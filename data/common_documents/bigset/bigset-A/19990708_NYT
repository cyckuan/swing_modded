<P>
   LONDON _ Ericsson AB, the Swedish telecommunications company
that is the world's third-largest mobile telephone producer, ousted
its chief executive Wednesday in a surprise move only 15 months
after his appointment, sending its stock spiraling down nearly 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is threatened by Nokia of Finland and
Motorola of the United States in the booming mobile telephone
market, said that Sven-Christer Nilsson, its chief executive and
president, had resigned to assist the ``increased pace in the
restructuring efforts to insure Ericsson's continued leading
position and profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson was replaced by his predecessor as chief executive, Lars
Ramqvist, the company's chairman. Kurt Hellstroem, the head of
Ericsson's Southeast Asia division, took over as president.
</P>
<P>
   Investors have grown concerned about Ericsson's direction under
Nilsson, who rattled them throughout his short tenure with repeated
profit warnings. Though Ramqvist's return to the job was seen as a
positive development, it was overshadowed by the surprise of
Nilsson's abrupt departure, and Ericsson's stock price tumbled on
fear that the move presaged another profit warning ahead of the
half-year results, which are due July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Ericsson, controlled by the Investor AB holding company, is
Sweden's biggest company by market capitalization. But its fortunes
have been uneven, with mobile phones sales down and costs rising.
In April, it warned that a combination of market uncertainty,
increased costs, lower profitability and restructuring expenses was
expected to push profits down this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nilsson took over as chief executive and president in March
1998, and announced restructuring plans in October that were
supposed to help prepare Ericsson to compete in a new generation of
wireless technology using high-speed Internet and data hookups. The
plan called for cutting 11,000 jobs _ a tenth of the work force _
at a cost of $352 million. A company statement Wednesday said that
the plan for a reduced work force remained intact, though less than
half of the job cuts had been accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   But, the statement added, ``The next phase of implementation of
this strategy and continued technological changes requires strong
and expeditious leadership.'' The company said the management
change was ``intended to improve profitability and long-term growth
in the company.''
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement, Ericsson's shares, which hit a high for
the year of 287.5 kronor, or $33.82, on Monday, plummeted 22.50
kronor, or 7.9 percent, to 262 kronor, leading a broad decline on
the Stockholm market. The company's American depository receipts
fared even worse, falling $3.1875, or 9.3 percent, to $30.4375 on
the NASDAQ market, where it was among the day's most heavily traded
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives said Nilsson had been held responsible for
failing to expedite the revamping. During Nilsson's tenure,
Ericsson watched as Nokia surged past Motorola to become the
world's biggest manufacturer of mobile phones.

WOMEN STILL PLAY CATCH-UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just when you thought the U.S. women's World Cup
team was winning fans and influencing chauvinists, a high-ranking
official of international soccer's governing body cleared his
throat _ the better to make room for his boot.
</P>
<P>
   At a media gathering in Century City on Wednesday, Keith Cooper,
the communications director of FIFA, introduced Marla Messing. She
is the president and CEO of the 1999 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But that isn't how Cooper described her. Instead, he glibly
referred to her as ``the little lady, Marla Messing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a gaffe on par with U.S. defender Brandi Chastain's own
goal against Germany in the quarterfinals. The only difference was
Chastain knew right away she had made an egregious mistake and
wasted little time atoning for it, beating the German goalkeeper
once to help the U.S. to a 3-2 win.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper gave not the slightest indication he had goofed. To her
credit, Messing neither blanched nor blinked before extolling the
efforts of the four remaining World Cup participants _ the U.S.,
China, Norway and Brazil _ in advancing the cause of gender equity
in sport and society.
</P>
<P>
   Her words, however heartfelt, floated over the crowd in the
hotel ballroom like a balloon leaking helium. Cooper, without
realizing it, had let a little air out of a crusade.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't matter now how riveting, how rousing, Saturday's
title match is between the U.S. and China. As Cooper's gaffe made
so clear, to write the story of the 1999 Women's World Cup as an
Emancipation Proclamation for female athletes is to write fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Women and men have been fighting a civil war on the sporting
turf since the passage in 1972 of Title IX. Logic dictates that
it's going to take more than three weeks of scintillating soccer to
tear down convention and build a new consensus.
</P>
<P>
   Logic, though, has gone the way of empty seats at U.S. matches.
To be sure, it's hard not to buy the hype if your feet aren't
firmly grounded in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Parlow came along six years after Title IX. The
21-year-old starting forward on the U.S. team is the beneficiary of
battles not her own.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't have to pay her own way to play soccer at the
University of North Carolina, like teammate Julie Foudy did at
Stanford in the late 1980s. She hasn't had to wash her U.S. uniform
in the sink after games like teammate Michelle Akers did when she
joined the national team in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The road was paved for Parlow, so she can be forgiven for not
anticipating any bumps or detours ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The commotion created by the U.S. team en route to the World Cup
final ``just shows there's an opportunity for women in sports,''
Parlow gushed. ``Little girls can see they don't have to grow up
being a secretary or a nurse. There is room to be a professional
athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what all the marketing and media mavens are saying, too.
</P>
<P>
   As much as she would like to believe it, Tiffeny Milbrett knows
better.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett is the offspring of a 50-something, soccer-playing mom
who was confined to recreational club competition by the mores of
her day.
</P>
<P>
   At 26, Milbrett's perspective is broad enough to see where U.S.
soccer's grand dame, Akers, and the young pup, Parlow, are coming
from.
</P>
<P>
   She knows the women's work is only beginning when the World Cup
ends. She was reminded anew of this on a commercial flight the U.S.
team took the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett was seated next to a passenger who glanced at all the
women wearing red, white and blue sweat jackets and asked, ``What
kind of high school basketball team is this?''
</P>
<P>
   At that instant, Milbrett felt as small as a salted peanut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're on top of the world,'' Milbrett said, ``but
then we . . . jump on a plane and it's easy to be brought down to
earth real fast. The reality is, we still have a long ways to go
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbrett and Parlow were late arriving to the press conference.
Traffic spared them Cooper's reminder of just how much ground they
have to make up. &QL;

THE KOCH VERSION: HOW HE'S DOING  
 TOP COP  
 ON CONDITION OF ANONYMITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHARLES STRUM with ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Have no fear,'' writes Ed Koch in the latest
monthly packet of press clippings he sends to friends and
associates. ``I'll be out of the hospital by Tuesday, probably back
in the office next week, and back at the gym in four weeks. I have
dodged another bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ebullient former mayor, 74, who suffered a heart attack
last week, was a tad optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Koch's note was dated last Friday, the day after he was
stricken. He remains in intensive care at New York Weill Cornell
Center of Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   George Arzt, his former press secretary, said Wednesday that
damage to Koch's heart was found to be less extensive than
initially thought. Last week, a blocked artery was reopened.
</P>
<P>
   But the flow of blood through two other arteries was found to be
reduced, by 70 percent in one. Arzt said doctors were considering
``opening that up,'' too. He said Koch could be home by Friday or
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Koch has made the most of his stay. He has told
friends that he had ``the best room possible'' for the fireworks
over the East River on Sunday night, and he delayed the monthly
packet to add press coverage of his illness. His column Friday in
The Daily News is all about the dodged bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol Selects Yank as Top Man
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Noble is soon to be an American in Lyons, France _ not
only the first American, but also the first non-European to go
there as secretary general of Interpol, the international police
agency.
</P>
<P>
   International he may become, but his is a very American success
story.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an Army sergeant, Noble, 42, grew up in a biracial,
bilingual household. His father, who is African-American, met his
mother, who is German, just after World War II. By the time the
elder Noble had retired and opened a small janitorial-supply
business, the family was living outside Fort Dix, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until I was 16, I just wanted to take over the business,''
Noble said.
</P>
<P>
   But his father had other ideas, which the son heeded: University
of New Hampshire, Stanford University Law School, the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   As a Treasury Department undersecretary, he was the author of a
scathing report on the bloody federal assault on the Branch
Davidian compound in Waco, Texas, in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Noble will succeed Raymond Kendall, a former Scotland Yard
official, in October 2000. The term is five years and is renewable.
</P>
<P>
   No-Name Museum
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If Pierce Brosnan ever wants to get into the
Metropolitan Museum of Art again, he may have to do more than pay
the standard donation.
</P>
<P>
   In a remake of ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' that opens next
month, Brosnan stars as a corporate raider who chases women,
dresses really well and steals art.
</P>
<P>
   But when production started, Brosnan, who is also the producer,
discovered that Philippe de Montebello, the Met's director, was
troubled that the film would show how to steal a painting and would
depict the Met's security staff as bumbling.
</P>
<P>
   So they agreed that in publicity materials the Met would become
``an unnamed, heavily guarded New York museum.'' No filming was
allowed. Interiors were shot on a sound stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to cooperate with filmmakers,'' said the Met's chief
spokesman, Harold Holzer, citing recent professional visits by Ben
Stiller and Woody Allen. ``But a movie that suggests that our
security is lax is not something we want to encourage. At least
this way, it's referred to as `an anonymous lookalike museum.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anonymous? On Tuesday, about 100 guests, including Andrew Stein,
the former City Council president, and Patricia Duff, a former Mrs.
Ronald Perelman, attended a screening whose hosts were Pamela Gross
and Jimmy Finkelstein, founders of LuxuryFinder.com. No one was
fooled.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Siegel, a guest and a film critic for ABC-TV, said: ``It's
like making a deal with the Vatican in which you can only refer to
it as `the unnamed headquarters of a major religion in Rome.'''

SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT CANDIDATE SNUBS BOARD AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Kansas City Board of Education is turning
its attention to Benjamin Demps Jr. as the next possible school
superintendent, having been rebuffed for a second time Wednesday by
Pascal Forgione Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Board members met privately Wednesday afternoon and voted 7-2 to
ask Forgione, a former U.S. education commissioner, to reconsider
his decision to withdraw as a candidate. Terry Riley and Lee Barnes
Jr. opposed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, board members and other community leaders
discussed sending a delegation of civic leaders, led by Kansas City
Mayor Kay Barnes, to Washington to persuade Forgione to change his
mind.
</P>
<P>
   But Forgione's attorney later told a district representative
that his client was no longer interested in Kansas City. Board Vice
President Patricia Kurtz said she had not been able to contact
Forgione.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he calls me back firsthand to tell me,'' Kurtz said.
``This thing is taking some unusual twists and turns, and I just
don't know where it will go.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple ordered a conference
for this morning, to be updated on the search. And Demps, a
longtime state and federal administrator, told district officials
Wednesday that he remained interested in the position.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring
Committee told school board members it still expected them to hire
a superintendent by midday Friday from a field of four candidates
originally submitted to the board.
</P>
<P>
   Three of them later withdrew from consideration. But one,
retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Jay T. Edwards, has since reconsidered
and says he is interested in the job.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite certain what will happen if the board fails to
reach agreement with Demps. Some board members have speculated that
if they are unable to come to terms with a superintendent, Whipple
might put the district in receivership, giving the court complete
control over district operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Receivership has been a potential end game or outcome ever
since I've been on the board and even before,'' Kurtz said.
``That's an option the court has. But from my perspective, given
all the constraints we have on us...the board is working hard and
trying to do the job. It's just tremendously difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz also said intense media scrutiny of the process was making
the selection even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a little bit like were under siege almost,'' she said.
``It's almost impeding the process. It makes our job that much more
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgione, a former U.S. education commissioner for statistics,
abruptly withdrew his candidacy Tuesday afternoon in the midst of
discussions on a three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview late Tuesday night, Forgione expressed anger at
the negotiating tactics employed by the district's legal counsel,
Blackwell Sanders Peper Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Forgione contended that board members initially agreed to
provide him salary and benefits similar to the $200,000 annual
package paid to former Superintendent Henry Williams. But Forgione
said that when a Blackwell Sanders lawyer faxed a contract offer
Tuesday, it included far less compensation. He said it was apparent
he and the board were starting their relationship too far apart and
with too little trust to ensure a successful partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a board can't give direction and be accountable for this
one decision, what does that say about the tougher struggles we
would have to face together down the road?'' Forgione said.
</P>
<P>
   School board members and the Desegregation Monitoring Committee
spent much of Wednesday trying to reconstruct what had gone wrong.
Many, including all three monitoring committee members, tried
unsuccessfully to reach Forgione by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, members said they thought Forgione had
mischaracterized events and simply got cold feet. Board members
said that they had authorized their attorney to offer up to
$164,500 in base salary, $33,800 in performance incentives, plus
benefits, but that Forgione withdrew before the parties even began
discussing salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting the Washington spin,'' board member Lance
Loewenstein said. ``The mature thing to do would have been to call
and say, `Is this a typo?' Not to quit. If he has such a monumental
ego that he can't make a phone call to make sure there isn't a
misunderstanding, then we don't want him.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgione could not be reached Wednesday. His Kansas City
attorney, Norris Greer, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Barnes said she had offered to get involved in the search
after a day of phone calls and conversations with school board
members and civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision regarding the selection of a superintendent
crosses all political, social and racial boundaries, and must be a
top priority for all Kansas Citians,'' Barnes said. ``I will do
whatever I can to assist in the selection of a qualified
superintendent.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, some board members say they expected Demps to encounter
the same kind of opposition as Edwards, who now works as general
administrator of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission. Many in the
minority community complained that Edwards had no background in
education and argued that the district needed someone with
experience as an urban school superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Demps, who lives in Oklahoma City, also has no experience in
public education. He could not be reached for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Demps also already has expressed concern about whether he would
be able to complete negotiations on a contract by the DMC-imposed
Friday deadline.
</P>
<P>
   He also faces a divided board. At Wednesday's meeting, the
board's vote to pursue Demps should Forgione decline the offer
passed 5-3, with one abstention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like now we're going to the last option _ door number
3,'' board member Connie Clark said of pursuing Demps. ``What's
that say about how confident we feel?''

 &HT;    Marlins left floundering by Maddux
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ reg Maddux is officially back in his element, complete
with frustrated hitters, ridiculous control and streaks like the
one he rode into Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He wound up losing his scoreless streak at 20 innings but not
much else, restoring some order to this series with a 7-3 win over
the NL East cellar-dwelling Marlins. The Braves are back on top in
the series 2-1 with one game to go, and with the Mets' loss to the
Expos their first-place East lead is back to four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good, I felt relaxed, really relaxed,'' said Maddux,
now 9-5. ``I don't know. Some nights you're just more relaxed than
others.''
</P>
<P>
   The same Marlins that slapped 15 hits on Tom Glavine Tuesday _
the most ever allowed by an Atlanta pitcher _ scratched out only
three on Maddux, including one Preston Wilson home run that broke
up his scoreless streak. Maddux got his third consecutive win and
fourth in the last five starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's in a zone, he's in a zone,'' Braves right fielder
Brian Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's ERA is down to 3.55, and he moved to 9-2 with a 2.01
ERA vs. Florida. He left the game after six innings having taken a
Bruce Aven grounder in the left foot, diagnosed as just a bruise.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux threw 72 pitches _ 55 of them strikes.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end of the control spectrum was Marlins 22-year-old
right-hander Ryan Dempster, who'd walked 15 batters in his previous
13 2/3 innings coming into the game. He added four in five innings
Wednesday night and gave up one of his seven charged runs on a wild
pitch. He didn't fare much better with his pitches over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones and Andruw Jones each launched home runs, Bret
Boone and Maddux each doubled and new All-Star Jordan got his 69th
RBI to start the scoring off on a single in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are getting in scoring position for me, Boonie,
Chipper,'' Jordan said. ``I hit my little 18-hopper between first
and second, drive in a run. I'll take that every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipper Jones led off the third by hitting a line-drive home run
to right, his fifth in six games and 19th of the year, to give the
Braves a 4-0 lead.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Nine-year-old Leon Smith was swinging on a Chicago
playground with his 8-year-old brother Jerry Sanders when a woman
called to them, ``Hey, you two, come over here.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his brother walked over to the woman, who demanded,
``Give me a hug.'' They obliged and then the woman asked, ``Do
y'all know who I am?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, you're our mother,'' Leon and Jerry responded. Then they
went back to the swings.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, Leon Smith, 18, is the newest Mavericks
project, a 6-foot-11 forward drafted from Chicago's Martin Luther
King High School by the San Antonio Spurs last week and traded to
Dallas. He is one of two high school players picked in the first
round of the 1999 draft, the reigning Illinois high school player
of the year who averaged 25.5 points, 14.5 rebounds and eight
blocked shots per game.
</P>
<P>
   He is also a survivor who yearns to reunite his family after
spending the past 14 years as a ward of Illinois, living in
state-run housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon is a successful story for kids who are taken from their
parents and go on to become wards of the state,'' said Ormon
O'Quinn, a former King assistant basketball coach who helped
retrieve Smith from despair. ``Here goes a story that needs to be
written, that needs to be seen, that needs to be heard by these
other kids that are wards of the state, because a lot of those kids
turn rebellious and get mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon could be making commercials telling kids, `Hey, stick in
there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He has stuck with it through a transient life that saw him live
in five group homes from ages 4 through 18, a life that came after
his parents' divorce that left Smith and his seven siblings
scattered throughout Chicago in group homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things just happened along the way,'' is the way Smith
explained his life. ``But I had to keep my nose clean.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith grew up around gangs and drugs on Chicago's south side. He
said his parents' breakup and his mother's personal problems led to
him and his siblings becoming wards of the state. He has no
relationship with his father, and he said he last talked to his
mother two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   O'Quinn said both Smith's parents tried to start a relationship
with Smith once his name became prominent on the Chicago basketball
scene. Smith can't remember the last time he saw his father, and
there was a period from ages 10 to 16 when he didn't see his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Smith said he declared for the NBA Draft for one
unselfish reason. He has one brother and six sisters scattered in
group homes in Illinois, and he figured he could use his NBA money
to buy a house and put everyone under one beautiful roof.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the NBA is a means to an end for Smith, a way to
finally give his siblings some much-needed love, peace and
happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to do everything the right way,'' said Smith, who is
wise beyond his years. ``I'm trying to put my family back
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was at his group home, Sullivan House, when he learned he
had been drafted by the Spurs with the final pick of the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did that because I knew everything would work itself out,
and I just wanted to let them know we're all in this together, and
if I made it, they were going to make it,'' Smith said. ``The
people at the Sullivan House will always be a big part of my life
because they helped make me become the person that I am today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in a regular (family) setting before. It was
hard at times living in the group homes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smith persevered, using basketball as an outlet. Whether he
starts his NBA career with the Mavericks this year or next, he will
get a three-year guaranteed contract worth approximately $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leon is a good kid who just wants to be loved,'' O'Quinn said.
``They need a ward of the state story so these kids know that they
can still make it, because a lot of these kids who become wards of
the state feel like they're failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I used to tell Leon all the time, `Hey, you've got a
lot going for yourself son. Don't blow it.' '' nn

SAMAKI WALKER DRAWING INTEREST, AGENT SAYS
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Still convinced his client won't get a favorable offer
from the Mavericks, agent Norm Nixon said forward Samaki Walker is
receiving interest from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two teams that have shown a lot of interest /Rare/S
Milwaukee and Vancouver,'' Nixon said. ``But right now they're only
talking about offering the $2 million exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm waiting on the Clippers, Utah and Minnesota, because those
teams have a lot of (salary) cap room.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker turned down a four-year, $20 million extension from the
Mavericks in February, but Mavericks coach/general manager Don
Nelson has told Walker he would match any deal as high as $2.5
million. If the Mavericks can't re-sign Gary Trent, Nelson might
have to up the ante.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Trent is the Mavericks' top priority, but the best they
can offer him is a two-year, $4.2 million deal or a one-year, $2
million deal. Trent and Walker are power forwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to go about my business one way or the other,''
Walker said. ``I want to go somewhere where I can help somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that's playing, they know my abilities. Anybody that
knows basketball knows that I can play this game.'' ALL'S FORGOTTEN
</P>
<P>
   Everything was back to normal a day after 18-year-old rookie
Leon Smith was booted out of the first day of minicamp by assistant
coach Donnie Nelson for failing to run wind sprints.
</P>
<P>
   Smith later apologized to Nelson and the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of the growing process,'' Donnie Nelson said.
``We're just going to continue to have conflicts like this and have
resolution, and over a period of time we're going to grow together
solid as a rock.'' ACE IN THE FOLD
</P>
<P>
   Forward Ace Custis is trying to win a spot with the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Custis was on injured reserved the entire 1997-98 season, and
was waived by the Mavericks in training camp last season. Custis
wound up playing for the Pennsylvania Valley Dogs of the United
States Basketball League.
</P>
<P>
   Former NBA player ``Darryl Dawkins was my coach, so that was
interesting,'' Custis said. ``He's a true character, but that was a
good experience. He used to tell stories about when they used to go
on the road and name his dunks.''
</P>
<P>
   Add Custis to the list of players impressed by rookie Leon
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a strong kid,'' Custis said. ``He's real aggressive, and
he's willing to go and block shots.'' nn

KANSAS CITY ART MUSEUM CHOSES ARCHITECT TO DESIGN ADDITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANTRELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art has picked
American architect Steven Holl, widely considered a rising star in
his profession, to design an $80 million addition to the original
1933 building.
</P>
<P>
   Holl's plan will place a series of new galleries underground on
the east side of the existing building, along Rockhill Road, in a
slender triangle widening from north to south. Seven above-ground
lanterns, clad in transparent and translucent glass, will draw
natural light during the day and glow from within at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, this stood out as something that was
magical,'' Nelson-Atkins director Marc Wilson said of the Holl
scheme. ``It was definitely not conventional.''
</P>
<P>
   The design includes a new entry lobby at the north end, to be
entered primarily from a new underground parking garage north of
the present building. Capping the garage will be a reflecting pool,
positioned off center to integrate new and old buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing down the new structure's procession will be a cafe,
spaces for special exhibitions, modern and contemporary art,
prints, drawings, African art, the Noguchi sculpture court, and an
educational facility and library. Given the slope of the land from
north to south, the procession will be broken up by stairs and
ramps.
</P>
<P>
   The new entry lobby also will connect to the lower level of the
existing museum building, just outside the Atkins Auditorium.
Visitors will take an expanded staircase into a new grand gallery,
reconfigured from space now used for special exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   The New York-based Holl, who will appear at a press conference
at the museum at 3:30 p.m. today, has attracted international
acclaim for his boldly chiseled contemporary art museum Kiasma in
Helsinki, Finland, which opened in 1998. Holl, 51, also is working
on a redesign and expansion of the Cranbrook Institute of Science
in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Holl, who was unavailable for comment Wednesday, is a native of
Bremerton, Wash. He was educated at the University of Washington
and at the Architectural Association in London, and he established
his architecture firm in 1976. He has been a tenured professor in
the Graduate School of Architecture and Planning of Columbia
University since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelson-Atkins project will expand the museum by more than 55
percent, from its present 234,000 square feet to 374,000 square
feet. Now in conceptual form, Holl's design should be completed by
February 2001. Construction is expected to begin in spring 2001 and
end in 2004. A local architect of record will be selected in fall
1999.
</P>
<P>
   The project is being funded from a $175 million capital
campaign; $95 million will go toward an endowment for programming,
education and outreach. So far, the museum has pledges of
approximately $135 million.
</P>
<P>
   Holl was one of six internationally prominent architects invited
to submit sketchbook proposals for the museum expansion. The
others:
</P>
<P>
   - Tadao Ando Architect &AMP; Associates, Osaka, Japan
</P>
<P>
   - Annette Gigon//Mike Guyer, Zurich, Switzerland
</P>
<P>
   - Carlos Jimenez Studio, Houston
</P>
<P>
   - Machado and Silvetti Associates Inc., Boston
</P>
<P>
   - Atelier Christian de Portzamparc, Paris
</P>
<P>
   Holl's was the only design that did not envision a large new
structure on the north side _ now the main entrance _ of the
existing neoclassical building.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals by Ando, Gigon//Guyer and Jimenez would have
completely obscured the 66-year-old building's north facade with
enormous boxes. Machado and Silvetti proposed a narrower structure
that would have left the colonnaded wings of the older building
exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Portzamparc's design called for a slender corridor extending
from the present entrance, with free-form galleries spreading out
from its sides.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, each of the architects gave in-person
presentations of their designs for the museum's architect selection
committee, led by senior trustee and Hallmark Cards chairman Donald
J. Hall. Before the presentation, committee members also visited
completed buildings by the architects in the United States and
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Holl's design was radically different from the other
five,'' said committee member Henry Bloch, a Nelson-Atkins trustee,
leader of the building committee and chairman of H&AMP;R Block Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all left the south terrace alone. But Steven Holl came
out with a completely different configuration on the east side,
where you could enjoy the sculpture court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't fight with this building. It would enhance it. And
the committee was unanimous in selecting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although construction will require temporary disruption of the
east edge of the Nelson property, the main south lawn will not be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson-Atkins director Wilson praised all the architects for
being ``very sensitive to the issues.'' He said the choice became
clear only at the end, after Holl made the last of the
presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The others were to a degree conventional,'' Wilson said,
``based on Western European architecture of the last 500 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee member Ada Louise Huxtable, architecture critic of The
Wall Street Journal, formerly of The New York Times, praised the
Portzamparc and Ando designs. But she said most of the designs
would have yielded ``a very big building'' north of the existing
structure.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, she called Holl's plan ``a miraculous response,
really, to the landscape, to the original building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be one of the best buildings anywhere.
It's going to be a pilgrimage point for people who are interested
in museums and architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   John C. Gaunt, dean of the School of Architecture and Urban
Design at the University of Kansas and another member of the
Nelson-Atkins selection committee, shared the enthusiasm for the
Holl plan. MORE

TINY CARS PROVIDE BIG EXCITEMENT AT RACE TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT CARROLL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANT HILL, Mo. _ It's a familiar scene. Lap one, turn one.
Six race cars funnel into the turn, every driver trying to be
first. Cars kiss briefly. One flips into the air as more cars smash
into one another. Some spin, others cartwheel down the track or
over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Such a sight would bring gasps of horror and a red flag at
Indianapolis or Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   But it's cause for whoops and chuckles among spectators at the
Real R.C. Raceway near Pleasant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   These vehicles are radio-controlled, one-eighth or one-tenth
full size, and their drivers are safely looking on.
</P>
<P>
   The racing cars look like frolicking puppies as they scamper
over the jumps, nibble at one another's heels and tumble into a
heap.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake: Although the cars are not real, the racing
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've raced full-scale cars, and I rode dirt bikes seriously,
and I get as much of an adrenaline rush (here) as I did from any of
that stuff,'' said Chris Kovachevich of Independence, a former
Sports Car Club of America driver.
</P>
<P>
   Crashes generally would finish full-size cars for the day, but
not the models. Most land on their wheels and sprint away. Course
marshals pick up those that are stuck and set them back on the
track to rejoin the chase.
</P>
<P>
   They might be way behind, but hey, those guys out front could
flip or spin out. It's anybody's race.
</P>
<P>
   It's a typical Friday night at Steve Hale's track just west of
Pleasant Hill.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 racers and their families and friends have come to the
dirt track. The track simulates an off-road course with left turns,
right turns, jumps and bumps packed into an area 90 feet by 120
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers mount an elevated stand from which they can see the
whole track. There are men and women; a gray-bearded veteran may be
standing next to a child too young to drive a real car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about this,'' said Tony Mineart of Raytown,
Mo., ``is kids can compete against their dads. It doesn't matter
what your age.''
</P>
<P>
   The cars are sophisticated enough to allow considerable tweaking
of suspensions, which are fully independent, with coil springs and
tiny oil-filled shock absorbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you can do on a real race car, you can do on
these,'' Mineart said.
</P>
<P>
   Their engines can rev to 35,000 rpm, Hale said. On a long enough
straightaway, they can hit 50 to 55 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Clutches are automatic, but the drivers can steer, brake and
throttle.
</P>
<P>
   The track started as a small dirt oval in Hale's back yard,
where he and 10 or 15 friends would run their cars. Over the years
it grew to its present size, with a concession stand, announcer's
booth, computer timing and scoring and a roofed area where crews
can work on their cars.
</P>
<P>
   Kovachevich has been racing the cars for years and writes about
it for magazines. He started when his son got a radio-controlled
car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bought him one and ran it up and down the driveway,'' he
said. ``That was fun, now what? My stepson said, `They've got a
whole racetrack on the other side of town.' I've never looked
back.''
</P>
<P>
   A car, spare parts and equipment for racing can cost $400 to
$1,000, racers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a cheap hobby,'' Kovachevich said, ``but money
doesn't necessarily mean winning. It's more driver skill than
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Racers compete in divisions according to skill, from novice to
expert.
</P>
<P>
   On a Friday night in June, Tracy Dinwiddie of Blue Springs, Mo.,
won the first heat, a race for novice drivers of electric cars. Her
car quit in its second race _ a dead battery _ but she came back in
the third and finished strong in the main event.
</P>
<P>
   She is in her first full year of racing, she said, having been
drawn into the sport by her husband, who also races.
</P>
<P>
   Racers mostly decide their own competitive level, Hale said. But
if someone has been running as a novice for a couple of years and
is winning everything, there might be a few gentle hints that it's
time to move up.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is Reggie Tongue, a safety for the
Kansas City Chiefs. He's been racing about 3 1/2 months but
competes as an expert and holds his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot of fun,'' Tongue said. ``It takes your mind off
things to come out and play with your toys for a couple of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a couple of hours, actually.
</P>
<P>
   Racing begins at 7 p.m. and consists of three qualifying heats
for each division, followed by mains. The races go off in quick
succession, but by the time everyone has had a chance to race _
electric or gas-powered cars, novice, sportsman or expert, trucks
and buggies _ it is often past midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Hale is on the public address system throughout the night
reminding everybody to come back next week. By then, he will have
rebuilt the track with a whole new layout to challenge the drivers.
</P>
<P>
   That's racin'.

JOAQUIN RODRIGO, 97, COMPOSER OF `CONCIERTO DE ARANJUEZ' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain)  (js) 
 By AL GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ Joaquin Rodrigo, a major figure in Spanish
classical music whose haunting masterpiece, ``Concierto de
Aranjuez,'' inspired dozens of interpretations worldwide, including
a jazz version by Miles Davis, died on Tuesday at his home in
Madrid. He was 97.
</P>
<P>
   Maestro Rodrigo, as the blind composer was frequently called,
wrote 26 works for the guitar and helped to move that instrument to
center stage in concert halls. The three-movement ``Concierto de
Aranjuez'' is his most widely performed guitar piece, and there are
some 50 recordings of it currently on the market, said Spain's
royalty collection society, the General Society of Authors and
Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's culture minister, Mariano Rajoy, called Rodrigo ``one of
the most relevant figures in Spanish music,'' the news agency EFE
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo was born in Sagunto in southeastern Spain on Nov. 22,
1901. His father was a large landowner and influential conservative
politician. When Joaquin was 3, diphtheria severely impaired his
eyesight, and he later went completely blind.
</P>
<P>
   He began studying piano and violin and by his early 20s was an
accomplished pianist and budding composer. His first orchestral
work, ``Juglares,'' had its premiere in 1924 in Valencia. He moved
to Paris in 1927, studied under Paul Dukas and met the well-known
Spanish composer Manuel de Falla, whom he befriended.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris Rodrigo also met the Turkish pianist Victoria Kamhi.
They married in 1933 and were inseparable companions and
collaborators until her death in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the Spanish Civil War, from 1936-39, Rodrigo
lived in Paris or Salzburg, and in 1939, at the suggestion of the
guitarist Regino Sainz de la Maza, he composed ``Concierto de
Aranjuez.'' Largely written in Paris, it had its premiere on Nov.
9, 1940, in Barcelona with the Barcelona Philharmonic Orchestra and
De la Maza as soloist.
</P>
<P>
   The piece became so popular that Rodrigo later complained that
it was like a great tree that cast a shadow on his other music.
Aranjuez is a town 30 miles southeast of Madrid whose main point of
interest is the 18th-century Bourbon royal summer palace and its
lush gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The concerto's second movement, an Adagio about 11 minutes long,
has the work's signature melody, which begins as a slow cadence
played by strings and woodwinds, later by guitar, and in a final
climax by the full orchestra. Miles Davis used the concerto as
inspiration for his 1959 album ``Sketches of Spain,'' and Chick
Corea did likewise on his jazz piece ``Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   A fellow composer, Xavier Montsalvatge, who attended the 1940
debut in Barcelona, wrote after Rodrigo's death that ``the work
even then made a great impression for the originality of being one
of the first concertos for guitar and orchestra, and for its great
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo took a teaching position in 1940 at Madrid's Royal
Higher Conservatory of Music. In the 1940s he also worked as a
music critic for various Madrid newspapers and was musical adviser
for Spain's National Radio.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958 Rodrigo's ``Fantasia Para un Gentilhombre'' (``Fantasy
for a Gentleman''), written for Andres Segovia, had its premiere in
San Francisco, with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and
Segovia as soloist.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo wrote more than 200 works in a variety of genres and
styles, for ballet, movies, light operas, and for voice, piano and
full orchestra. A Spanish poet, Gerardo Diego, said that Rodrigo
created acoustical landscapes, and critics said his style blended a
vital, lyrical happiness with strong touches of melancholy. In 1991
King Juan Carlos I granted Rodrigo the royal title of Marquis of
the Aranjuez Gardens. The concert hall in that city is named for
him.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a daughter, Cecilia.
</P>
<P>
   Rodrigo once said that his ``Concierto de Aranjuez'' was about
``looking for the roots, the most traditional and authentic Spanish
things.'' He added, ``I like to be an ambassador for Spain.''

   RIVERSIDE, Mo. _ In the hands of anyone other than a
professional, the highly volatile fireworks stolen from a Riverside
store are ``a coiled rattlesnake, and you're playing with it,'' a
federal official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Jimerson, supervisor of the bomb and arson unit of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said the investigation was
continuing into the theft of display fireworks from a Riverside
warehouse over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Area police and the Missouri fire marshal's office are helping
with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a large quantity of fireworks and launching tubes
were reported missing about 9:10 p.m. Saturday from Cousins
Fireworks Co.
</P>
<P>
   The stolen fireworks, if detonated, could do considerable damage
to an apartment building and might destroy smaller buildings,
Jimerson said.
</P>
<P>
   Police have recovered some of the stolen goods, but the
fireworks that are still missing could easily be set to detonate,
Jimerson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a high priority with us because these fireworks are so
dangerous, so volatile,'' he said. ``They will maim and kill if
they get in the wrong hands, and no one has any idea how little it
takes to set them off.''
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks, which police described as mortar shells used in
large aerial displays, require a federal license for use.
</P>
<P>
   Each contains photoflash powder, which is more sensitive to
accelerants than black or smokeless powder used in common fireworks
such as firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these stolen fireworks are in the hands of John Q. Public,
or anyone without pyrotechnics training, especially juveniles,
you're literally talking about playing with fire,'' Jimerson said.
``If they're in a confined space, you've basically got the power of
a small bomb. It takes one second and one mistake to cause an utter
tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks could be set off by a minimal amount of friction
or static electricity, Jimerson said. If one of the shells burst
and loose powder was touched by a spark, it probably would detonate
the entire stock, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks are more volatile in humid weather, Jimerson said.
Photoflash powder that gets wet and then dries out becomes more
sensitive to heat and friction, increasing the risk, he said.
</P>
<P>
   An ATF agent was killed several years ago when illegal fireworks
detonated while he was trying to destroy them, Jimerson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we're talking about professionals here, people who are
specially trained to handle these things,'' he said. ``But for
anyone, if you want to see the big stuff, see it professionally on
the Fourth of July. In any other hands, you've got a very good
possibility of disaster.''

`WARRIOR' AKERS PREPARES FOR FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You don't reach Barbie Doll status when you're more like GI
Jane, but that's how Michelle Akers wants it. Give the woman her
battle plans, not some cheesy commercial endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   She's all the blood and guts a coach could ask for, a player
often referred to as ``the warrior'' by her teammates. Akers, a
midfielder for the Women's World Cup finalist U.S. team, takes
shots in the back of the head, the nose _ and almost had her
shoulder dislocated by an enthusiastic fan during a victory lap
recently.
</P>
<P>
   That's Akers _ a 33-year-old seasoned starlet who has spent more
time with ice packs, leg wraps and bandages than has an ex-Marine.
Her body seemingly is airborne more than the coast-to-coast flights
of the Chinese team, the Americans' opponent in Saturday's World
Cup Final at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said I've got a magnet on my head,'' joked Akers at a
recent training session at Pomona-Pitzer College. ``I was talking
about it with my doc. I said, `Is there something I'm doing that's
attracting this kind of attention to my head?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's just my kind of go-for-it mentality. Sometimes
I stick my head in places it shouldn't be, but I'm not going to
change my style. That's who I am, that's how I play and that's part
of the package of Michelle Akers.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been Akers' style since her days at Central Florida
University, where she honed her skills playing against men. That
style worries U.S. coach Tony DiCicco, but all he can do is shake
his head and smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just takes physical risks on every ball,'' he said. ``It's
not an option for her to give up. And we've worked on her tactical
agility, where she can put herself into situations where she can't
get injured, but it doesn't work. She's not going to back off of
anything, even when a foot's coming and she's heading the ball,
she's going to head the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible warrior mentality when she's in the game.
It's led to a lot of injuries in her career but, for sure, it's an
inspiration to our entire team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been Akers' aura for as long as anyone can remember. She
practically started the U.S. women's national team program in 1985,
scoring the first goal in the history of U.S. women's soccer in the
team's second international game.
</P>
<P>
   Second only to Mia Hamm with 104 international goals, she's
nearing the end of her brilliant career. Once the best attacking
midfielder in the game, Akers has turned into a defensive, midfield
gem.
</P>
<P>
   Akers hounded Brazil's Sissi in the semifinals, leaving the
tournament's leading scorer puzzled. Now she'll have an even bigger
task, marking China's Sun Wen in Saturday's championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's going to play her best soccer of 1999 in this
final,'' DiCicco said. ``I can just see it in her eyes. She's still
one of the best headers in the world, one of the best distributors,
and she can service the ball with both feet. Over the last three
months, she improved her defense, which has paid huge dividends for
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers realizes she's still every bit as important to this team
as Hamm and the other standout U.S. players but, as the big redhead
notes, she's not sure how much longer she'll keep playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one more game and then we'll see,'' Akers said.
``Right now, I'm here, enjoying the moment. All my focus is on
China. After that, we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be more emotions running through her head than
anyone's. Her battle with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is
well-documented and her injury-plagued career has included long
stretches of rehab. Yet Akers seems as fit as the day she started.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an illusion,'' Akers joked. ``You get to this point in
your career and you remember the 5 a.m. workouts. Or the times I'm
in rehab all by myself or feeling sick and then getting up and
going to training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those quiet moments, all those prayers and agony to God, just
asking to give me enough energy to take another step or last
another five minutes. All those things have brought me to this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't care about anything but helping this team win,''
striker Tiffeny Milbrett said. ``A defensive midfielder is not a
glorious position. It's a guts position. It's a work-your-butt-off
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so proud of what Michelle means to this team. She's the
heart and soul. She's not getting the assists and goals like she
used to, but she's back there working and working. What an
inspiration to our entire team. She's not getting the so-called
publicity, and it doesn't matter to her at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all exciting, but for me to stay focused on what we
need to do as a team and what we need to do on the field, I can't
be distracted,'' Akers said. ``It's nice seeing the team on TV and
in the front page of papers, and it's easy to get distracted by all
that they say we've done, but we're not there yet. We have one more
game.''

FORMER POSTAL WORKER WINS RULING FROM FEDERAL BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT CAMPBELL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Sorting mail at the Kansas City Post Office
was a tolerable job for Robert F. Hernandez _ as long as he could
sit in a special orthopedic chair.
</P>
<P>
   The chair gave him support to avoid aggravating back injuries
from the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But postal supervisors four years ago took away his chair,
Hernandez said, forcing him to risk further injury or quit his job.
</P>
<P>
   He quit _ but Hernandez did not stop fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has won a ruling from the federal Merit Systems
Protection Board that says the Postal Service must reinstate him to
his job on Pershing Road and pay him lost wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long, hard haul,'' said Hernandez, 53. ``A friend
of mine told me the whole third floor of the post office where I
was working erupted with people cheering because this guy had
beaten them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City postal officials said they could not discuss the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The order of the Merit Systems Protection Board came after the
Postal Service had appealed an initial decision in Hernandez's
favor in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez plans to return to the Postal Service and then take
early retirement. He also has a civil discrimination suit pending
in federal court against the Postal Service and the American Postal
Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had neck, back, knee and shoulder problems stemming
from his service in Vietnam. Doctors' opinions indicated he needed
an orthopedic chair to perform his work.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service provided Hernandez with an orthopedic chair
in 1994 but removed it in July 1995, when his work status changed
and he was no longer under worker's compensation, according to the
Merit Board ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Postal supervisors instead substituted a ``leaning bar,'' a
metal device to lean against while he performed the manual sorting
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wiggles all night and you're fighting it with your back
muscles and rear muscles to stay level,'' Hernandez said. He
claimed the bar aggravated his injuries and caused him to miss work
until March 1996, when he resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The merit board found that a supervisor wanted either to
pressure Hernandez to return to an automated processing position
that required him to stand, or to force him to leave the Postal
Service altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The Postal Service argued that Hernandez quit voluntarily, but
regional Administrative Judge Victor Russell disagreed and in May
the merit board in Washington, D.C., backed his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just so great because people have tried to go after
them and win,'' said Hernandez. ``But...I had all my documentation,
and I had witnesses.''

THOR KAPPFJELL, 32, A DAREDEVIL WHO LEAPT TO FAME IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Norway)  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thor Axel Kappfjell, a parachutist who frustrated the police and
entertained the public with daredevil leaps from some of the
world's tallest buildings, including the World Trade Center, the
Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building in New York, was
killed on Tuesday after he miscalculated a stunt jump from a cliff
in Norway, The Associated Press reported. He was 32 and lived in
Drammen, Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Kappfjell was killed just after midnight when he jumped off the
3,300-foot high Kjeraag cliff over the waters of Lysefjord near
Stavanger, 300 miles west of Oslo, the agency said. He was the
third of a dozen jumpers planning to leap in thick fog.
</P>
<P>
   Kappfjell made headlines around the world for his daredevil
stunts. He jumped from more than 200 mountains, towers and landmark
buildings, including the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Norwegian prime
minister's office in Oslo and the 95-story Petronas Twin Towers in
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
   Kappfjell's daredeviltry in New York began on Oct. 25, 1998,
when he plunged from the 86th-floor observation deck of the Empire
State Building.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with an Oslo newspaper, Dagbladet, Kappfjell
called the jump from the Empire State Building ``my biggest dream
for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later he jumped from the 61st floor of the Chrysler
Building. In each case he vanished before the police could capture
him.
</P>
<P>
   Kappfjell intended to cap his adventure with a leap from the
World Trade Center but appeared to back down after Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani threatened him with arrest, calling his actions
``irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it gets a great deal of attention,'' the mayor said.
``It's really a stupid and jerky thing to do, and it's a very
dangerous thing to do, not only for him but for the people below.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 25, he returned to the World Trade Center, ducked
security and plunged 110 stories to the ground. ``It was
fantastic,'' he told The New York Post afterward. ``I have no words
to describe it.''
</P>
<P>
   That time he was arrested. He pleaded guilty to three counts of
reckless endangerment and was sentenced to seven days of community
service.
</P>
<P>
   The parachutist then sued the executives of the television show
``Extra,'' contending that they had him arrested rather than pay
for a videotape of his last New York jump.
</P>
<P>
   The State Supreme Court suit said that Kappfjell had previously
sold the show videotapes of his leaps from the Empire State
Building and the Chrysler Building for a total of $7,500.
</P>
<P>
   Kappfjell said he gave an executive of the program a videotape
of his jump from the World Trade Center. But instead of paying him,
the suit claimed, the executive alerted the police and sent a crew
to tape his arrest, ``in violation of common decency,'' then used
the videotape of Kappfjell's parachute jump without his consent.
</P>
<P>
   The program denied all the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Kappfjell earned his living as an offshore oil worker. He was
single and told The Associated Press that as a result he could
afford all the fines he had been assessed over the years.

ZIMMERMAN PITCHES LIKE AN ALL-STAR AS RANGERS DEFEAT ATHLETICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The boxscore from the Rangers' 7-4 victory
against the Oakland Athletics yesterday reveals the wealth of
talent at manager Johnny Oates' disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Rick Helling, the Rangers' 20-game winner from
1998, took the mound at Network Associates Coliseum. All-Star
closer John Wetteland recorded the game's final three outs.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' lineup included a two-time American League most
valuable player in right fielder Juan Gonzalez and All-Stars in
catcher Ivan Rodriguez and designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be argued,'' Oates said, ``that he's our most
valuable player through the first half of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Oates referred to none of the aforementioned players.
</P>
<P>
   The manager spoke of right-hander Jeff Zimmerman, the
26-year-old rookie phenomenon who learned of his All-Star selection
Wednesday morning and again pitched like one during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Lee Stevens delivered the game-winning runs with
his two-run, seventh-inning single, and Zimmerman pitched 2 1/3
scoreless innings for his eighth victory in as many decision this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff has been right there every time we've called upon him,''
left fielder Rusty Greer said after the Rangers snapped their
four-game losing streak. ``He's been about as good as you can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the bottom of the sixth inning with a 4-3
lead after a two-run double by center fielder Roberto Kelly, but
Oakland's Ben Grieve tied the score with his solo home run on a 3-2
fastball from Helling.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter John Jaha followed with a double before Oates
summoned dependable left-hander Mike Venafro from the bullpen.
Venafro retired first baseman Jason Giambi and right fielder Matt
Stairs, two left-handed hitters, without allowing Jaha to advance.
</P>
<P>
   That set the stage for the Zimmerman, who induced an
inning-ending ground ball from catcher Ramon Hernandez and
surrendered only a seventh-inning single to third baseman Eric
Chavez before completing his 16th consecutive scoreless appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing,'' Stevens said of Zimmerman. ``He's done
everything that's been asked of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens also came through in the clutch despite entering the
contest hitting .161 (5-for-31) in his previous nine games.
Stevens, who entered as a defensive replacement for Jon Shave in
the bottom of the sixth inning, fought off a first-pitch fastball
from right-hander Tim Worrell and dumped it into left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just tried to be aggressive early in the count,'' Stevens
said. ``I was looking for a fastball and fisted it into left field.
In all honesty, it was a good pitch. I think he put that pitch
where he wanted. All I know is that hit took the bad taste out of
my mouth for this series.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' two-out, bases-loaded single scored Gonzalez and third
baseman Todd Zeile and gave the Rangers a lead Zimmerman and
Wetteland would not relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland loaded the bases in the ninth inning by issuing three
walks, but the three-time All-Star induced a game-ending popup from
shortstop Miguel Tejada to record his major-league-best 26th save.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's nothing-out-of-the-ordinary performance improved his
earned-run average to 0.89 _ thanks to 192/3 consecutive scoreless
innings _ and made him the Rangers' first pitcher to accumulate
eight victories before his first loss of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Where would the Rangers be without Zimmerman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to try and explain it,'' Oates said. ``I'm just
going to enjoy it.'' nn

</P>
<P>
   ``We feel there's a definite possibility we've missed out on
some rain,'' Downing said. ``This thing is controversial enough, we
need a vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Rawlins County opted to hold an election. The mail ballots go
out soon with a question reading: ``Shall weather modification
(cloud seeding) be allowed in or over Rawlins County?'' The
election is purely advisory.
</P>
<P>
   Weather modification is under way in several places outside
Kansas, with Texas among the most active.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, the federal government helped study weather
modification in states ranging from North Dakota to Utah, said Joe
Golden, a senior meteorologist for the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Golden, who managed the project, said the potential for changing
the weather is very real. It's essential, he said, for cloud
seeding to take place in the right way in the right storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very promising possibilities.''

KANSANS DISAGREE OVER MERITS OF CLOUD SEEDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKIN, Kan. _ What a strange place to try to change the weather:
a yellow metal building not much bigger than a double garage, no
sign out front, accessible by gravel road at a little-used rural
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, when thunderstorms develop nearby, meteorologist Curtis
D. Smith operates radar, peers at computer screens and dispatches
airplanes that seed clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The goal: suppress hail and thereby safeguard valuable farm
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeding all the severe storms we can get our hands on,''
Smith said. ``We know we're having an effect on the clouds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hocus-pocus?
</P>
<P>
   Well, let's say there's a lack of general agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Kansas Weather Modification Program began in 1975,
an attempt to enhance rainfall and reduce hail. Gradually, hail
emerged as the main focus.
</P>
<P>
   By one calculation, hail damage to crops has fallen 27 percent
in some of the area covered by the program.
</P>
<P>
   Major studies in the past found no proof that cloud seeding
really spurs rain or diminishes hailstones.
</P>
<P>
   And doctoring the sky has so angered a group of farmers in
northwest Kansas that they demanded a public vote. An advisory
election on weather modification takes place this month in Rawlins
County.
</P>
<P>
   Every Kansan has a stake in the debate. The cloud seeders will
spend $840,000 of government money this year.
</P>
<P>
   The program started in the early 1970s. Ground Water Management
District No. 1 in Scott City wanted to remove a little of the risk
of farming.
</P>
<P>
   The High Plains region often sees a lack of rain, but also often
sees ruinous hailstorms. So the water district undertook cloud
seeding.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, seeding involves vaporizing a substance containing
silver iodide. The resulting ice nuclei enter clouds, providing
vast opportunities for hailstones to form. With so many nuclei
present, the thinking goes, hailstones don't grow large enough to
cause damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the economic benefits are tremendous,'' said Wallace
Robinson, owner of 4,200 acres near Modoc, Kan., and one of the
originators of the program.
</P>
<P>
   About two months ago, Robinson, who is 70, saw his wheat crop
damaged, but not destroyed, by hail.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gut feeling is that if we hadn't had weather modification,
we would have had a wipeout,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the program evolved. The counties originally
funding it were joined by others. State funding came later.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 59, the radar operator and meteorologist, arrived in 1985
and serves as manager. A Lakin resident, he said he has traveled
the world conducting weather modification.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more exciting than about anything else I can imagine in
meteorology, including storm chasing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the program runs from April 20 to Sept. 2. It covers
part or all of 22 western Kansas counties, including areas around
Dodge City, Garden City and Goodland.
</P>
<P>
   Checks after big storms, Smith said, have found that farmers in
areas covered by the program make fewer hail-insurance claims than
farmers in noncovered areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always said we can't stop it all,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots say they can take off within 15 minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   During operations, Smith will use both hands to operate the
radar, judging what part of which storm to seed. By radio, pilots
provide crucial information.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concentrate on that cell just north of Garden City,'' he told
one airplane during a recent storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're burning,'' a pilot told him, meaning the seeding
solution was being ignited and spread into a storm.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is obvious. Although cloud seeding frequently takes
place alongside thunderstorms, not in the midst of them, the
airplanes do encounter turbulence. And sometimes hailstones.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Brian Bergman, who flies a one-engine cloud-seeding Piper
Comanche stationed in Lakin, points to numerous dents on his
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't advise pilots to do this kind of flying,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The program typically sees about one airplane a year lose a
windshield to hail.
</P>
<P>
   But Bergman has returned to the program year after year. ``It's
very rewarding,'' he said. ``It feels good to help the local
farmer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Water Office, a state agency, considers the program
worthwhile enough to contribute $360,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Darrel Eklund, environmental scientist for the office, studied
long-term hail damage in various western Kansas counties.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in a recent issue of the Journal of Weather
Modification, Eklund estimated that hail damage to crops in six
counties covered by the weather-modification area decreased 27
percent. Estimated benefits were about $4 million a year, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Others aren't sure the airplanes prevent hail.
</P>
<P>
   An extensive study, financed mostly by the National Science
Foundation, seeded clouds in northeast Colorado in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   With the results inconclusive, the study ended ahead of schedule
because scientists discovered they couldn't show that seeding
suppressed hail.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Doswell, a research scientist for the National Severe
Storms Laboratory in Norman, Okla., said the weather-modification
industry hasn't proved itself effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have considerable concern about the wisdom of investing
taxpayer resources in this type of program,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, when the Kansas program suggested its cloud seeding
may have defused the beginnings of a tornado, Doswell responded
sharply: ``Nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Criticism of cloud seeding has broken out in northwest Kansas,
where areas joined the weather modification program in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can prove anything on either side of it,'' said Keith
Downing, who heads a group called Citizens for Natural Weather and
farms 3,000 acres northwest of Colby, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers allied with Downing contend that cloud seeding has
reduced rainfall, although they don't offer studies to substantiate
the claim. They demanded an election over the issue. MORE

MCDONALD'S HEADS TO COURT OVER A BURGER KING MEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (js) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's just the sort of thing parents frown on _ a food fight.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the latest twist in the never-ending Battle of the
Burgers, McDonald's is suing its archrival, Burger King, saying its
Big Kid's Meal food-and-toy combination is essentially a knock-off
product.
</P>
<P>
   In the suit, filed June 30 in federal court in Detroit,
McDonald's Corp. said that packaging and promotional material for
Burger King's meal, which the company introduced last month, was
too similar to a logo and product of the same name that McDonald's
introduced for a limited time in Detroit last year. The only
difference is one consumers may well overlook: Burger King uses an
apostrophe in ``Kid's''; McDonald's does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a school assignment, we think Burger King would
get an F for plagiarism,'' Charles Ebeling, a spokesman for
McDonald's, said.
</P>
<P>
   Burger King had two words for its biggest competitor: grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has a kid's meal program,'' said Richard Taylor, vice
president for marketing at Burger King, a unit of the London-based
Diageo PLC. ``You can bet we'll defend our right to use this name
vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Burger King promotion, youngsters can get a
combination of a regular-size meal and toy, currently tied to the
recently released movie ``Wild Wild West.'' The McDonald's meal,
which the company said represented an investment of more than
$500,000, came with a regular-size meal and a coupon booklet to be
used at an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's said that it had filed to register the Big Kids Meal
phrase and logo as a trademark and that the application was
pending. But Burger King contends that the phrase is generic.
</P>
<P>
   A burger-and-treat combination has become serious business.
Youngsters have been known to ditch the food and go straight for
the Teenie Beanie Babies in a Happy Meal or beg parents to pull in
to a Burger King for an action figure in a box. The Big Kid's Meal
is intended to lure somewhat older customers.
</P>
<P>
   The current battle is the latest in a war that will almost
certainly wage on. The companies have traded barbs over which chain
has the tastiest fries and the best cooking system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Burger King, which makes the Whopper, introduced the
Big King, calling it ``a bigger, better Big Mac.'' And last year
McDonald's revamped its kitchens with a new cooking system that it
says produces the freshest fast food available.

CHINA CLOSES GAP ON U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There used to be a time in this country when our men's Olympic
basketball team was invincible _ literally.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1980, no one could touch the United States in the sport,
save for that incredible display of highway robbery suffered
against the Soviet Union _ also known as the gold-medal game at the
1972 Summer Games in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   Things eventually changed and the rest of the world caught up,
forcing America to assemble a ``Dream Team'' to restore order and
regain supremacy in a sport it invented.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's soccer team had a similarly untouchable nature
for most of this decade since the inaugural Women's World Cup in
1991. But the gap it once held over the rest of the world has
closed considerably as sexual stereotypes have begun to slowly die
down and female soccer is receiving the support it needs in other
traditionally male-dominated societies.
</P>
<P>
   One team that has been with the U.S. nearly every step of the
way in this evolution has been China, and it is no coincidence the
two will face each other in the 1999 tournament final at the Rose
Bowl on Saturday. The rivalry has been one of the best, although
the Americans have come out on top in almost every major
competition when the teams have met.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese must be bitter toward us,'' said U.S. forward
Tiffeny Milbrett. ``Until this year, every major competition since
1995 has always gone our way. They must think, `God, we've got to
get this thorn out of our side.'''
</P>
<P>
   China lost the Olympic gold medal to the U.S. in 1996 and it
lost the Goodwill Games to the Americans last summer. But is the
tide finally turning for the Chinese? Recent results seem to point
in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   China has captured two of the past three meetings against the
U.S., including a victory in the Algarve Cup in Portugal in March,
its first major triumph. In April, the teams split friendlies
played in the U.S. as China snapped the Americans' home-soil
winning streak at 50 games with a 2-1 win at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got away from our game plan a bit and we were sending
everyone forward at the end,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said at the
time. ``We can learn a lot from this game to take with us into the
World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the U.S. took its coach's words to heart in making it
to this point, but the players remain cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just goes to show that anything can happen when two of
the best teams in the world play,'' said U.S. midfielder Kristine
Lilly. ``Great teams make great things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   In each of the three meetings this calendar year _ all 2-1
results, incidentally _ the U.S. has outshot China every time. In
contrast, China seems to have always made the most of its chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to lose any match, but this is a great tournament with
great teams,'' U.S. defender Carla Overbeck said at the time about
the Algarve Cup. ``We have to look at the big picture, and the most
important time to win is in June and July at the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The time has arrived.

KANSAS WORKS TO TRACK DOWN OWNERS OF UNCLAIMED MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN L. PETTERSON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ Kansas Treasurer Tim Shallenburger is having the
time of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He's giving away money, and he couldn't be happier about it,
unless, of course, he could give away even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great fun,'' said Shallenburger, a former speaker of the
Kansas House. He moved into the treasurer's office in January after
winning the post in last fall's election.
</P>
<P>
   The great giveaway is the bottom line of the state's
unclaimed-property law.
</P>
<P>
   Holders of unclaimed money, such as banks, utilities, insurance
companies and governments, are required to send it to the
treasurer's office once the accounts are determined to be dormant.
</P>
<P>
   The state is charged with holding it until the rightful owners
turn up. But rather than just wait, the treasurer has decided his
office should be working hard to find them.
</P>
<P>
   Right now Shallenburger has about $80 million that belongs to
about 375,000 people. Some are no longer living, and the search is
on for their heirs. Others are easy to find, and they are getting
their money back.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a Leawood man is on the verge of receiving a check
for more than $95,000. That is money he had no idea was his. It
came from his late father's estate but somehow never found its way
into the initial settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Shallenburger tracked the man down and phoned him with the good
news. An official presentation could come as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   On the treasurer's desk are lists of Kansans who are entitled to
money the state is holding. Shallenburger spends a little of each
day tracking down the missing people.
</P>
<P>
   ``As best I can determine, there's been a considerable effort in
the past to advertise that we had it, but no effort to try to find
who it belongs to,'' he said. ``No one wanted to spend the
resources to do more than say, `Here's what we've got.' ''
</P>
<P>
   People said they did not have time to spend on the search, the
treasurer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided we'd make time to do it,'' Shallenburger said.
</P>
<P>
   The money that is not returned is invested by the state, which
retains the interest it earns.
</P>
<P>
   The man who leads the program is former state Rep. Dennis Wilson
of Overland Park. He has been banging on a few doors in Mission
Hills and Overland Park in his efforts to return some sizable
amounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun stuff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month his division returned about $700,000. He said that
was about three times more than had ever been returned in a single
month.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson says the chances are between one in 10 and one in 20 that
you or people you know are entitled to a check from the treasurer.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the phone calls, the treasurer's office has other ways
of finding the money's owners.
</P>
<P>
   There's the Cash Caravan _ a motor home with computers linked to
the list of names of people entitled to money the state holds.
</P>
<P>
   The motor home is driven to county fairs, and people stop by to
see whether their names are on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Computer systems also are taken to the State Fair in Hutchinson.
Some large companies are audited to see whether they have money
that should be forwarded. A credit bureau has been used to track
down some Kansans.
</P>
<P>
   Shallenburger said he learned how to track people when he was a
repo man for a bank in Baxter Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty easy,'' he said. ``Everyone is out there
somewhere. Most people can be found with three phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the people Shallenburger calls can't believe the good
news. They have to be convinced.
</P>
<P>
   An Overland Park woman got a call telling her the state was
holding $77,600 from an old stock sale.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation went something like this, Shallenburger
recalled:
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her who I was, and the first thing she said was, `Are
you a Republican or a Democrat?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `I'm a Republican if it makes a difference.'
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `I don't give to Democrats. How much do you want?' I
said, `I don't want anything. We have some money for you.'
</P>
<P>
   ```Oh, yeah, sure you do.'''
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't believe it and asked for Shallenburger's phone
number. She called him back to double-check.
</P>
<P>
   ```I'll believe it when I see it,''' Shallenburger said she told
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sent the check out, I sent her a note and said, `You
can see it. Now believe it.'''

SAVE MONEY, DON'T MAKE HANFORD SAFE FOR HUMAN HABITATION, REPORT
URGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If anybody out there has been thinking about
someday building a nice waterfront home amid the sand, sagebrush
and nuclear waste at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, a top federal
official has some advice: Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy's inspector general is urging his
agency to drop plans to clean up the most scenic portion of Hanford
_ the stretch along the Columbia River _ to make it habitable for
human beings. People are never going to live there, the inspector
general says, and the Energy Department could save money by
acknowledging as much.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion issued in a report drew a fast and furious
reaction from Washington state and federal officials, as well as
environmentalists. The Energy Department late Wednesday seemed to
be backing away from a part of the report indicating that the
agency agreed with the inspector general's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is a key portion of the Hanford reservation, which is
560 square miles acquired by the federal government in 1943 and
used to produce plutonium for the world's first atomic weapons.
Plutonium production was phased out by 1987, and the highly
contaminated site is now home to the world's largest environmental
cleanup project, with radioactive and hazardous waste that the
Energy Department expects to spend 50 years and $100 billion
cleaning up.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas at Hanford are expected to be contaminated forever,
while others will be usable only for industrial parks. But cleanup
advocates have hoped that part of the stretch along the river, the
so-called 100 Area once used for agriculture, will be suitable
someday for farming or rural housing.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Inspector General Gregory Friedman says that is not
realistic. He said all projected uses for the area are
non-residential, such as recreation and wildlife preservation, and
that the Energy Department is wasting money trying to make the land
suitable for people to live on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continuing to support cleanup objectives that are inconsistent
with projected land uses unnecessarily increases restoration
costs,'' Friedman wrote. ``Changing the cleanup objective from
residential to industrial for just three waste sites within the 100
Area would reduce the cleanup cost from $85.5 million to $73.4
million, a 14.2 percent reduction. Other cost reductions are also
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, Friedman reported that the Department of Energy had
concurred with his recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   His report was not well-received.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to leave all the waste along the Columbia River,
cover it with soil, and leave it there for all time,'' said Doug
Sherwood, Hanford project manager for the Environmental Protection
Agency, who said the stretch of Hanford along the river should be
clean enough for rural residential use. ``Yes, you can save a lot
of money by not doing any cleanup, but does that really mean
cleanup? That's just not acceptable to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Pollett, executive director of the watchdog organization
Heart of America Northwest, also was incensed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one in a long line of highly political efforts by the
inspector general to assist the agenda of people who do not want
the area alongside the Columbia River to be cleaned up, as required
by state and federal cleanup laws,'' Pollett said. ``The Department
of Energy is trying to avoid its commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sheryl Hutchison, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Ecology, said she was ``flabbergasted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this report doesn't indicate a desire by the feds to
walk away from their cleanup obligation, because it's an atrocious
mess they have out there, and we're trying hard to get it back in
shape for human use and fish recovery,'' she said. ``There isn't
too high a cleanup standard to set when you're talking about the
Columbia River and the people of this state.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials said the inspector general
mischaracterized their reaction when he wrote that ``Richland
concurred with the recommendations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see our cleanup changing,'' said Linda Bauer,
assistant manager for environmental restoration at the Energy
Department. ``In the near-term, we're doing the right kind of
cleanup out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rich Holten, the director of remedial projects at the Energy
Department, agreed, saying: ``We are very proud of the cleanup
activities we've got going out there right now. This talks about
something that might happen in the future.''

KANSAS CITY SOUTHERN RAILWAY TO SPEND $100 MILLION ON NEW
LOCOMOTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kansas City Southern Railway has placed a
$100 million order for 50 new locomotives, the biggest one-time
purchase of locomotives in the railroad's history.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern said Wednesday that it would buy the
machines from GE Transportation Systems, a General Electric Co.
subsidiary. The locomotives are expected to be delivered in
November and December.
</P>
<P>
   GE Transportation also will build a maintenance facility next to
Kansas City Southern's rail yard in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern employees will do most of the maintenance
work there, but a few GE technicians also will occupy the facility,
said Kathy Simpson, a Kansas City Southern spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern said it was buying the equipment in
anticipation of growth from its rail network, which it calls the
NAFTA Railway. NAFTA is an acronym for the North American Free
Trade Agreement, which was implemented to eliminate trade barriers
among the United States, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Through acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances, Kansas City
Southern has created a rail line that runs from Canada to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Southern has 450 locomotives now. It last acquired
locomotives in 1991. The new ones are considered among the most
advanced produced by GE Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upgrading our locomotive fleet will help us provide North
American shippers with higher standards of service while achieving
substantial operational efficiencies,'' said Michael R. Haverty,
the railroad company's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   GE Transportation officials said the new machines had nearly
twice the hauling capacity of Kansas City Southern's older models.
In addition, the railroad will spend less on fuel consumption and
maintenance.

SPRINT'S DRESS CODE IS A SHOCK TO SOME EMPLOYEES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Memo to clothing stores around the new Sprint
office campus: Stock up on men's dress slacks. There will be
noontime runs on your inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Sprint dress code tempest, currently whirling in
the scattered offices of the Kansas City area's largest corporate
employer, may subside by the time thousands of workers move to the
new spread.
</P>
<P>
   The furor concerns a companywide ``Sprint Dress Policy'' memo.
For the most part, it clarifies a code already followed at the
current headquarters. But for thousands of Sprint employees in
buildings elsewhere, the policy was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   In many Sprint offices, Dockers rule. The dress is ``business
casual'' every day. Some offices even have jeans days on Fridays.
The newly disseminated policy seems to some employees to be out of
touch with current Sprint reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people view business casual dress as a job benefit,''
said one Sprint worker. ``I certainly believe that I am more
productive because it allows for a more relaxed work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Bureau of National Affairs, 79 percent of
employers surveyed say casual dress improves employee morale.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the worker said, why ``dress for success'' if you
have no aspirations about rising in management ranks and no
customer contact with outside business people?
</P>
<P>
   Some workers say they'll have to spend a lot of money to upgrade
their wardrobes _ and that's no job benefit. It's tantamount to a
pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   A Sprint spokeswoman says that the policy intends to create a
professional image for the new campus and that cotton slacks
``don't promote the type of corporate image Sprint strives for.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees say they hope the policy withers away before they
have to go shopping. Meanwhile, the policy says what attire is
inappropriate at Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   The no-nos: T-shirts, sweat shirts, jeans, cotton slacks, sweat
pants, leggings, shorts, miniskirts, sundresses, athletic shoes,
sandals, going without socks or hose, denim clothing, shirts with
letters or logos (except for occasionally sanctioned Sprint
promotions), and anything soiled or frayed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pretty reasonable list. You can make a strong case that,
according to contemporary standards, anyone wearing most of the
above items would look less professional than someone wearing a
business suit or hose and heels.
</P>
<P>
   The wicket gets sticky, though, when policies dictate things
that are unenforceable. For example, what is a sundress? Is it any
sleeveless dress? It it a thin-strapped dress? Is it a
thin-strapped, low-necklined dress?
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to do the measuring? Who's going to decide whether
she's wearing a banned miniskirt or a fashionably short suit skirt?
</P>
<P>
   Professional standards are great, and the only way they can work
is if they're precisely detailed. But I wonder about the
Dockers-type ban. Will there be label or pocket checks? There's an
exceedingly fine line between some dress slacks and some cotton
casual slacks. I'd suggest that Sprint honchos not worry about the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   I also would suggest that pressure-cooker jobs in
pressure-cooker industries need productive, satisfied workers. And
I'd let the Docker debacle fade real fast.

ZIMMERMAN A SURPRISE ALL-STAR
</HEADLINE>
 STARS-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Seattle manager Lou Piniella recently
described right-hander Jeff Zimmerman as ``the difference in the AL
West.''
</P>
<P>
   New York manager Joe Torre recognized Zimmerman's impact
Wednesday by selecting the Rangers middle reliever to the American
League roster for the 1999 All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, the organization's 26-year-old rookie and poster boy
for perseverance, will be accompanied by Rangers closer John
Wetteland and first baseman/designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro, whom
Torre also chose to represent the league in the annual classic
Tuesday at Fenway Park in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, Wetteland and Palmeiro will join catcher Ivan
Rodriguez, the Rangers' only starter after the league announced
results of fans' balloting Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comprehend it,'' Zimmerman said. ``I'm a middle
reliever. We're supposed to be the bottom feeders of the baseball
world, so this is ultimate pinnacle for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman's selection could be described as highly irregular.
The TCU product bucked the system to become only the fourth pitcher
with no starts and fewer than five saves to be selected an
All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``There haven't been a whole lot of guys do what he's done or
the way he's done it,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman pitched 2 1/3 scoreless innings for his eighth victory
in as many decisions as the Rangers defeated Oakland, 7-4,
Wednesday. Zimmerman has the best earned-run average (0.89) and
lowest opponents' batting average (.110) among major-league
relievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most exciting part for me is that he was able to make
history in a season he's defined as historical,'' Wetteland said.
``You couldn't ask for it to happen to a better guy, and you know
he's going to take it well. Nothing would go to that guy's head.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland will make his third All-Star Game appearance despite
undergoing arthroscopic surgery in October to remove a bone spur
and chip from his right elbow. Opponents' .243 batting average and
Wetteland's 4.04 ERA suggest that the right-hander might not be as
dominant as in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not really over that,'' Wetteland said of the elbow
injury. ``I still haven't pitched the way I'm capable of doing day
in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Wetteland converted his major-league-best 26th
save in 30 opportunities with a scoreless ninth inning Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro underwent arthroscopic surgery Feb. 10 and March 7 to
remove torn cartilage from his right knee, but the left-handed
power hitter responded favorably to earn his fourth All-Star
selection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought my knee would be a problem as far as my
offense,'' Palmeiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro will begin the series in San Diego this weekend hitting
.351 with 20 home runs and 73 runs batted in to join Cleveland
right fielder Manny Ramirez as the league's only players to rank
among the top 10 in all three triple crown categories. nn

DEALS WON'T COME EASILY FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The Dodgers reached the 81-game halfway point of the
season Tuesday and were 11 games under .500, their worst mark since
1979.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of balance in the lineup has become the focal point for
the National League's worst hitting team and has led to speculation
the Dodgers will unload one of their right-handed bats, most likely
Eric Karros, or possibly either pitchers Ismael Valdes or Darren
Dreifort, if a left-handed bat becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   There's even talk of teams looking for speed trying to acquire
second baseman and leadoff man Eric Young, who's third in the NL
with 32 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   The talk will be bantered around a lot with the July 31
nonwaiver trading deadline approaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I anticipate us doing something?'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said Wednesday. ``Probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   However, much will tell in how the Dodgers do during the next
three weeks, whether they play better baseball and try to climb
back into the wild-card race before the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends in three weeks where we're at and what we're trying
to do,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem is the contract situation this regime
inherited. The Dodgers are locked in long term for nearly every
player who would have significant value on the trade market. That
makes unloading players difficult.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to trying to bring in the big left-handed bat, the
Dodgers haven't been willing to part with their young players,
particularly catcher Angel Pena and third baseman Adrian Beltre.
They also don't have many top-flight prospects above Single-A level
to deal. Therefore, teams aren't interested in dealing impact
players to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, much like the flexibility Johnson lacks in making out his
lineup card, Malone has restrictions in trying to work a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as easy to make trades as it used to be,'' Malone
said. ``It's more involved. There's limited prospects out there,
financial implications with contracts. I work at it every day to
see what other clubs are doing and what options are there, and how
we can make ourselves better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Johnson's made no secret as to wanting a left-hander in
the middle of his lineup _ he's tried Devon White, Todd Hundley and
Todd Hollandsworth _ he said he won't use that as an excuse as to
why the team is playing dismally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what we can do . . . what's available,'' Johnson
said. ``(Karros) has probably been as productive as any other guy
on the club. Whether they're easy matchups or not, Eric's done a
good job. What I saw before is, I'd like it to be a little more
challenging for the opposition (with matchups).''
</P>
<P>
   Brown pushed up: Since staff ace Kevin Brown wasn't selected to
the All-Star Game, Johnson said his immediate plans call for Brown
to start against Anaheim in the series opener following the
All-Star break. That will keep him on four days rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would work better to (have Brown) get Arizona twice if he
throws the first day back,'' Johnson said, alluding to a pair of
series with the Diamondbacks in late July.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson also said the right-handed Valdes will probably work his
way into the No. 2 spot in the Dodgers' rotation after the All-Star
break and pitch next Friday against Anaheim while Chan Ho Park
drops to No. 3 and ends the series Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Trying anything: Johnson continues to fiddle with the lineup to
get the sickly offense going. A day after resting Karros, who
usually demolishes Coors Field pitching, he sat Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, who despises having days off, entered the series
hitting .302 with seven homers and 24 RBI at Coors Field. But he's
mired in a powerless slump in which he hasn't homered in 84
at-bats. He has one homer in his last 122 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, meanwhile, returned to the lineup after resting so
Johnson could get Hollandsworth's bat into the mix. Karros, who was
1 for 4 in the opener, is a lifetime .363 hitter at Coors Field.
He's hit 13 homers and driven in 34 runs here.
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Dodgers trainer Charlie Strasser said results of Tripp
Cromer's examination for an irregular heartbeat might not be
available until the weekend. Cromer returned to Los Angeles before
Tuesday's game with Colorado after being diagnosed with the
ailment. . . . Right-hander Antonio Osuna, who had elbow surgery in
May, threw 19 pitches in one perfect inning in a rehab stint for
Single-A San Bernardino against High Desert. It was Osuna's first
game action since the surgery. The Dodgers are hopeful he'll return
after the All-Star break. . . . Rockies right fielder Larry Walker
returned after missing one game with flu-like symptoms.

ENERGY SECRETARY AGREES TO IDEA OF AGENCY ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., N.M., Alaska, Texas, Tenn.)  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said Wednesday
that he would work with Congress to establish a more independent
nuclear weapons program as a remedy for security problems, but key
details of the proposed reorganization are still in dispute,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson altered his previous position and said he would
consider a semi-autonomous program within his department. ``I'm
ready to move on it,'' he said, adding that he would seek
bipartisan agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's change in position was first reported in Thursday's
editions of the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   But even Richardson's acceptance of the idea may not resolve the
issue. Some House Republicans have demanded creating a wholly
autonomous agency, or moving the nuclear weapons work to the
Pentagon in response to allegations that China obtained weapons
secrets from one of the Energy Department's laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   Three Republican senators, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Jon Kyl
of Arizona and Frank Murkowski of Alaska, have been pushing for
reorganization. But Richardson has resisted changes that would
remove the weapons program from his control.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial issue _ and one on which there is no agreement with
Congress _ is whether the department's counter-intelligence and
security chiefs would report to the head of the new weapons
program, as some Republicans would like, or to the energy
secretary, as Richardson wants. Richardson has maintained that
having those officials report to the head of the weapons programs
would create conflicts and would not benefit security.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of a semi-autonomous agency, its definition still
under negotiation, was proposed in a report issued in mid-June by
President Clinton's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, but
Richardson had been resisting. ``I hate the `agency' word,'' he
said at a Senate hearing on June 22.
</P>
<P>
   The plan now under discussion, which would create an Agency for
Nuclear Stewardship, would be headed by an undersecretary.
</P>
<P>
   It would include the three main weapons laboratories, Los
Alamos, Sandia and Lawrence Livermore; the weapons-assembly
operations at Pantex, in Amarillo, Texas, and at Oak Ridge, Tenn.;
the naval nuclear propulsion program, and various non-proliferation
and bomb-fuel storage programs. These last two barely existed when
the department was formed in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson would like the undersecretary to report to him. But
focusing the program under the control of one high-ranking official
would improve accountability, department officials believe.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has argued in the last few weeks that he has already
undertaken reforms to improve security, including naming a
``security czar,'' Eugene E. Habiger, a retired four-star Air Force
general.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Energy Department's establishment, it has had an
office of Defense Programs, which oversees weapons production, and
reports to an assistant secretary of energy.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has a surplus of bomb-grade uranium and
plutonium, which it is no longer producing. It is trying to safely
store the excess material until it can dispose of it, and help the
Russians do the same with theirs.

SMITH POISED TO RESHAPE NHRA'S LANDSCAPE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Minus the anticipated sizzle, we have reached the halfway point
of the NHRA Winston Drag Racing Series' 25th anniversary season.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a drag racing fan, but what is new and different about this
National Hot Rod Association season? The 4.60-second quarter-mile
pass has become mandatory just to be a player, and speeds in excess
of 320 mph also are routine. How many ways can we get excited about
the vagaries of the five-disc clutch, or a Top Fuel or Funny Car
engine that actually completes a pass with all eight cylinders
firing?
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the contrived format that will pit Top Fuel
dragsters against Funny Cars at the inaugural Winston No Bull
Showdown this weekend, the points races have fallen into too many
predictable patterns. The NHRA's lack of a fan-friendly live TV
package also has tested the resolve of even the most diehard
devotee.
</P>
<P>
   It is against this background that NHRA officials and
motorsports mogul Bruton Smith are preparing what is being billed
as a true all-star event at the reinvented Bristol (Tenn.) Dragway.
Beginning with qualifications tonight and concluding with Saturday
night's finals _ live on ESPN! _ 64 of drag racing's best will
compete at Smith's version of Thunder Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and his Speedway Motorsports Inc. are best-known for their
involvement in NASCAR's Winston Cup Series. Smith owns six tracks,
including Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, that currently play
host to nine Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith's Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., also is a
regular stop on the NHRA schedule. His revamping of Bristol Dragway
is the culmination of a $15 million project Smith and general
manager Jeff Byrd believe will convince NHRA officials to grant
them one _ two would be better _ national events for the facility.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30,000 seats are in place at Bristol for this
non-points event. Additionally, a new four-story tower featuring 21
luxury suites, a control room, conference room and awning-covered
observation deck will be available to approximately another 800
occupants. A $500,000 Musco lighting system, another Smith staple,
will allow the drag cars to run at night.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's expanding interest in NHRA drag racing hardly ends
there. On July 20, the NHRA's brass plans to assemble in Las Vegas
to announce that Smith's LVMS will be added to the national event
calendar in 2000. Engineer Devin Horihan, who designed the new
Bristol Dragway, will oversee a similar project at Las Vegas on a
site that currently is a quarter-mile gravel pit.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, industry sources say that Houston Raceway Park in
Baytown will lose its spring NHRA event to accommodate Smith's
newest state-of-the-sport facility in Vegas _ and all those SMI
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``NHRA is not Winston Cup. But nothing else is either,'' said
Chris Powell, executive vice president and general manager of Las
Vegas Motor Speedway. ``I think you'll find that Bruton's ability
to be a `visionary' is not restricted to stock cars. You'll learn
more about that in the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   We await the details. Because at halfway, the NHRA needs all the
sizzle Smith can serve up.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTLIGHT ON... STEWART MARKS `ARRIVAL' WITH SIGNATURE WHEELS
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Tony Stewart has arrived as a NASCAR Winston Cup driver,
and he didn't need to consult the top-10 points standings or hear
it from team owner Joe Gibbs.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR Nation _ the nomadic fans who follow the series from
racetrack to racetrack _ bestowed that honor upon Stewart at the
Daytona International Speedway last week. Like all those who either
work or ``reside'' in the sprawling infield at DIS during race
week, Stewart had to drive through the tunnel under Turn 4 while
preparing for the Pepsi 400.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came through the tunnel the other day and turned right to
come towards the garage area,'' Stewart said, ``and there was an
orange school bus with `Home Depot and 20, Tony Stewart and Joe
Gibbs Racing.' And I thought, `I've arrived.' When a school bus in
the infield is painted up in my colors, I'm a Winston Cup driver
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, teammate to native Texan Bobby Labonte, has been
sensational during the season's first half. After 17 races, Stewart
has booked four top-five and nine top-10 finishes and a single Did
Not Finish (DNF). In comparison, three-time and reigning Cup
champion Jeff Gordon has suffered through four DNFs _ results that
basically have doomed his chances of a repeat title.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-place Gordon is only 19 points ahead of Stewart as the
tour cranks up for the Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire
International Speedway this weekend. This will be the series' first
visit to Loudon, N.H., in 1999, although Stewart won on the flat
1.058-mile track en route to the Pep Boys Indy Racing League title
in 1997. And Stewart finished second in the NASCAR Busch Grand
National Series race at NHIS last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart and crew chief Greg Zipadelli are more excited about
returning to the tracks where they already have raced this season
in their Pontiac Grand Prix, and now have a baseline for setups.
</P>
<P>
   And what about his ``inevitable'' first Cup victory?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what is going to happen,'' said Stewart, 28. ``It
means more to me to finish in the top five three or four weeks in a
row than it does to win one week and finish 30th the next week and
crash the week after that. You guys \Rthe media\S are more antsy
about me winning a race than I am.''
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS CREW CHIEF FINED
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Scott Eggleston, who was paired with Sterling Marlin
at Sabco Racing on June 2, has been fined $50,000 for a rules
violation detected before the NASCAR Winston Cup Pepsi 400 at
Daytona International Speedway last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Eggleston, 37, also has been placed on probation until Oct. 20,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors found an illegal insert in the intake manifold of
Marlin's No. 40 Coors Light Chevrolet Monte Carlo. Modifications to
the intake manifold are particularly frowned upon at the 2.5-mile
DIS, one of the two tracks where the cars compete with carburetor
restrictor plates to reduce speeds in the name of safety. That's
why the fine is so severe.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Sullivan, NASCAR's manager of communications, said Marlin's
car raced with an approved manifold Saturday night. And Marlin
finished 12th. MARTIN HAS SURGERY
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup star Mark Martin underwent surgery Wednesday in New
Smyrna Beach, Fla., to repair a broken tibia plateau in his left
knee. Martin suffered the injury during an accident while
practicing Friday at the Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Martin plans to wear a leg brace that will allow him to drive
the No. 6 Valvoline Ford Taurus at New Hampshire International
Speedway this weekend. Martin, who also fractured his wrist in the
crash, plans to have NASCAR Busch Grand National regular Matt
Kenseth standing by as a relief driver. HILL SEEKS SPONSOR
</P>
<P>
   Texan Eddie Hill is 63, and searching for a new primary sponsor
for his NHRA Top Fuel team for 2000 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Pennzoil officials announced last week they would not renew the
one-year contract signed with Hill on Jan. 11. Pennzoil has
sponsored Hill for 11 consecutive years, including his
championship-winning season of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he and wife Ercie, whose shop is located in Wichita
Falls, are not considering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel on the brink of another breakthrough on the
racetrack,'' Hill said. ``Frankly, the concept of retirement
frightens me more than anything that could go wrong on the
racetrack.'' LAST LAPS
</P>
<P>
   _ Juan Montoya could tie Nigel Mansell's CART FedEx Series
rookie record of five victories in the Texaco/Havoline 200 at Road
America in Elkhart Lake, Wis., on Sunday. Mansell set the record in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   _ His start in Sunday's race will be the 264th of Al Unser Jr.'s
CART career, tying him with Bobby Rahal for first place on the
all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ford's NASCAR Winston Cup teams are scheduled to test at the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway Tuesday and Wednesday. GM teams are
booked for July 19-20 at IMS, in anticipation of the Brickyard 400
on Aug. 7. LAST WORDS
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I can become the poster boy for the AARP.''

<P>
   _ Eddie Hill, 63, on his decision to keep drag racing in 2000
and beyond.

MORE THAN HALF OF MINORITY JOURNALISTS EXPECT TO LEAVE NEWSROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ At a time newspaper editors are facing their
industry's failure to reach ambitious year 2000 minority hiring
goals, a new survey shows that more than half of the journalists of
color are planning to leave the profession.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists questioned in a Freedom Forum survey are not
planning their exits because they're dissatisfied with their
prospects in daily newspapering _ 77 percent rated their chances
for advancement as excellent or good.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, 41 percent said they plan to leave within five
years. A total of 55 percent said they plan to leave the newspaper
business altogether. And their top-ranked reason for moving on was
their ``interest in another field of work.'' Fiction writing,
teaching and business careers were named as the most enticing
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   But the 200 blacks, 152 Asians and 100 Hispanics questioned said
there are things that editors could do to get them to stay: better
hours, improved pay, and more opportunities for professional
development. (The surveys from 15 Native American participants were
not included because they were not considered statistically
meaningful.)
</P>
<P>
   Robert Giles, executive director of the Freedom Forum's Media
Studies Center in New York, said the survey would help crystallize
for editors around the country how crucial holding onto the
minorities already in their newsrooms is if they hope to reach
their diversity goals.
</P>
<P>
   Giles released the survey results at a news conference in
Seattle Wednesday as part of the UNITY '99 conference, a national
meeting of minority journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE) made
a controversial decision to adjust its goal of having the nation's
newsrooms reflect the ethnic diversity of the country by the year
2000 to 2025. The 2000 goal was set in 1978, when minorities
accounted for only 4 percent of the newsroom employees.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades the industry has taken huge strides in
increasing the diversity of its work force. But in recent years
some of those gains have been reversed even as the U.S. population
becomes increasingly diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, minorities make up about 28 percent of the
population. But according to an ASNE January census, the number of
minority newspaper journalists crept up only slightly in 1998,
increasing 1.5 percent so that people of color now make up 11.5
percent of newsroom employees.
</P>
<P>
   In radio and television newsrooms, minority journalists have
fared somewhat better. A survey by the Radio &AMP; Television News
Directors Association this year found that minorities make up 19
percent of newsroom staff and 11 percent of radio staff.
</P>
<P>
   While those numbers are lower than they were a year ago,
association President Barbara Cochran said the number of minorities
in management track positions has increased greatly in the past
three years. For instance, today 18 percent of all assistant news
directors are minorities, compared with 10 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, there are efforts under way to revitalize the drive
for bringing more people of color into journalism. ASNE and another
editors' association, the Associated Press Managing Editors
Association, are sponsoring a Time Out for Accuracy and Diversity
initiative. The effort's core premise is that newspapers are
incapable of accurately reflecting the diversity in their
communities if newsrooms don't.
</P>
<P>
   Since the initiative's inception, 2000 journalists in 200
newsrooms have participated in discussions about how to create a
staff that mirrors the variety in race, genders, sexual
orientation, age, class, and religious and political affiliations
in the community so their news coverage can be more balanced and
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   David Yarnold, executive editor of the San Jose Mercury News who
is leading the effort, said by reframing the issue, he is hoping
newspapers will re-examine their hiring for the sake of higher
quality journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just common sense'' that a diverse staff will ``make
coverage richer and deeper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giles said it's obvious newspapers need to do a more exhaustive
job of sparking minorities' interest in journalism early on through
internships, and then holding onto to them with mentoring programs.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the main complaints by journalists of color _
burnout, long hours and poor pay _ are shared by many in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But he guessed there are some challenges minority journalists
don't share with whites. For instance, 77 percent of the minorities
surveyed said they have to work harder than their white
counterparts to get ahead. Among black journalists, the sentiment
was especially high _ 90 percent either strongly agreed or somewhat
agreed they had to work harder, compared with 67 percent of Asians
and 66 percent of Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Giles suggested that black journalists' higher frustration
reflects the fact that African Americans began advocating 30 years
ago for better representation and may be more weary than other
groups.

SALES HOT AT MALLS IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY, MADE FAMOUS BY `VALLEY
GIRL'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FERNANDO VALLEY _ If you want proof that the San Fernando
Valley's economy is humming, look no farther than its malls.
</P>
<P>
   Cash registers at the Valley area's malls are as hot as the
weather, with sales increasing up to 10 percent during the first
five months of 1999 compared with the same period last year. That's
considerably higher than either the national or state averages and
a testimony to the strength of the local economy and its mall
culture, which was made famous _ some might say infamous _ by the
1980s ``Valley Girl'' pop fad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a retailer can't make money in this environment, they can't
make money, period,'' said Richard Giss, partner with the trade
retail services group at accounting firm Deloitte &AMP; Touche LLP in
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Malls across the region have seen healthy sales increases among
stores open at least a year. That measure _ known as store-to-store
in the retail industry _ is the one traditionally used by analysts
to gauge the health of the retail scene.
</P>
<P>
   Sales increased 6 percent at Fashion Square Sherman Oaks, 6.9
percent at the Valencia Town Center in Santa Clarita, 7.1 percent
at the Glendale Galleria, 8 percent at The Oaks mall in Thousand
Oaks and at the Northridge Fashion Center, and 10.5 percent at the
Panorama Mall in Panorama City.
</P>
<P>
   According to the New York City-based International Council of
Shopping Centers, malls across the nation saw an average 2.2
percent increase and in California a 5.1 percent jump through
April, the most recent figures available.
</P>
<P>
   Local mall representatives attribute their success to both the
strong economy and their individual efforts to lure more customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, retail is back on the rise,'' said Alison DiLeva,
Fashion Square's marketing director.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherman Oaks mall hopes to build its foot traffic by luring
shoppers who otherwise might go to places like the Century City
Shopping Center &AMP; Marketplace and the Beverly Center outside the
Valley as well as to the Glendale Galleria, the Westfield
Shoppingtown Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park and Westfield
Shoppingtown Promenade in Woodland Hills, and the Northridge
Fashion Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a customer that is fashion-conscious that we're
trying to reach here,'' DiLeva said. ``We're really trying to pull
more upscale tenants in, but we're also at an achievable price _
we're not trying to be Rodeo Drive.''
</P>
<P>
   In Thousand Oaks, some retailers at The Oaks have upgraded their
merchandise and looks, resulting in greater sales, said mall
general manager Becky Bresson.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of tenants have upgraded their merchandise, adding
new product to stay fresh and current,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors that have pushed the Panorama Mall past the 10
percent mark are the two-story Wal-Mart, which opened May 21, 1998,
in a space once occupied by The Broadway, and a strong marketing
program by La Curacao, a department store catering mainly to
Latinos, said Louise Marquez, the 66-store center's general
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Panorama Mall has benefited from The Plant, the
commercial/industrial center at the old General Motors site nearby,
where stores began opening in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think The Plant has added new traffic to the community at
large,'' Marquez said. ``It's typically what a big-box provider
will do. It's an enhancement to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Clarita, promotional efforts and the booming Santa
Clarita Valley's economy have pushed the Valencia Town Center to
its 6.9 percent gain, said general manager Charles Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, I think the shopping center as a whole is something that
the community has taken under their wing, and (they) have enjoyed
coming here,'' Sullivan said. ``We're just trying to make it
better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Glendale, new businesses are moving in and office vacancies
surrounding the Galleria are low, said Annette Bethers, senior
marketing director for the 260-store shopping center.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the mall gets healthy traffic from the lunch crowd,
contributing toward its 7.1 percent store-to-store increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``So things are looking good,'' Bethers said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local malls continue to attract new tenants, which in
turn are boosting traffic and sending overall mall sales _ that is,
sales that include outlets that opened after May 1998 _ to even
greater heights.
</P>
<P>
   At the Northridge Fashion Center, for example, overall sales
through May jumped 26 percent when figures are included from the
Claim Jumper restaurant, Old Navy clothing store, Borders Books,
Pacific Theaters' 10-screen multiplex and the Farmer's Market. All
are recent additions to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've added a lot of new, exciting tenants, (and) traffic is
increasing every month,'' said general manager Carol Jacobs.

OBSERVERS MAKE A BIG STINK ABOUT PLANT'S BLOOMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LISA STIFFLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The smell hits you from all the way down the hall, the
minute the greenhouse door is opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It smells like when the mouse got caught and died in my
drain,'' said Chris DeCrease, a University of Washington research
technician. ``And it looks like the `Little Shop of Horrors.'''
</P>
<P>
   A description like that can mean only one thing _ the reeking,
heating wonder from Sumatra, the Amorphophallus titanum, is finally
blooming at the UW greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The plant's center stalk, or spadix, has turned a
yellowish-purple and grown 8 inches in the past four days to a
height of more than 6 feet. Wednesday afternoon the upside-down
pleated skirt surrounding the base of the spadix began to open,
revealing a deep crimson color _ and the odor.
</P>
<P>
   The spadix emits pulses of heat that can be felt inches away;
with every pulse, a wave of stench fills the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wet manure,'' proclaimed Zoology graduate student Deniz
Erezyilmaz. ``It smells like a horse stable that hasn't been
cleaned, when buried manure is first exposed to air.''
</P>
<P>
   In the tropics of Sumatra, carrion beetles flock to the foul
odor and pollinate the plant. They climb into the plant, and if
carrying pollen from another A. titanum, they pollinate the
numerous small female flowers tucked into the bottom of the flute.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the smell begins, it starts to wane, and the female
flowers stop being receptive to pollination. The male flowers, also
nestled in the flute, then release their pollen and the insects
depart. Two or three days later the bloom rapidly dies.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday there were no beetles, but dozens of people and flies
crowded around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to see this flower my whole life,'' enthused
66-year-old Marjorie Lou Ericksen from Renton. She tried to see the
bloom on other occasions at conservatories around the world, but
always missed it because the bloom lasts only days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be more excited,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Ewing, manager of the UW greenhouse, is thrilled. Six years
ago he planted a seed the size of an olive pit that gave rise to
this bloom, which only two months ago was barely above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday marked only the 10th time this century an A. titanum
has bloomed in the United States, and the first time that it's ever
happened west of St. Louis or at an American university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been totally addicted to it,'' said Joanne Rosen, a
resident of the nearby Montlake neighborhood. Rosen has visited the
greenhouse with camera in hand and fluffy white poodle in tow for
eight days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sensuality of it makes it fun for photography,'' she said.
But ``I expected the smell to be worse.''

CROWDS STORM SOCCER PRACTICE TO SEE U.S. TEAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY C.J. FOGEL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT _ The U.S. women's soccer team practice was supposed
to be closed Wednesday, but they couldn't keep the girls away.
</P>
<P>
   They came wearing soccer jerseys, waving American flags and
carrying soccer balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're showing that we are soccer players,'' said 12-year-old
Randi Tillett, wearing the jersey that identified her as a member
of the Ontario Tidal Wave.
</P>
<P>
   Tillett was among the 150 or so soccer enthusiasts, many of them
soccer-playing girls, who found their heroines practicing on a
field near Pomona College.
</P>
<P>
   They wanted a closer look at the women who have kicked and
muscled their way to the top to face a powerful Chinese team in a
sellout game at the Rose Bowl on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And they wanted autographs, which players like Mia Hamm paused
to deliver after the workout _ even after a team official told the
crowd there would be none.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look up to her because I'm a forward, too, and I like her
moves,'' said Crystal Diaz, 12, who plays for the Ontario Tidal
Wave.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these fans had to convince their parents to make the
trip while others were brought by parents who see good role models
in the U.S. women's team. Janet Povero of Glendora said her
8-year-old daughter, Nicky, has shown real talent and can benefit
from seeing athletic young women play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great just to see them go all out and not hold back,''
said Povero, who combed the campus to find the well-hidden field.
``It's a pretty physical game. It's great to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Team USA is adding fuel to a surge of
participation in soccer, especially among girls, said Terry Davila,
coach of the men's team at California State University, Northridge,
and director of the girls program at Valley United Soccer Club. And
the demand for teams is only going to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't fully felt the effects of the World Cup yet,''
Davila said. ``But we will. Every girl knows who Mia Hamm is.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand already has outpaced the supply of fields and
facilities in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, said Stu Steinberg,
vice president of the girls program of Valley United. Two years
ago, the Coast Soccer League had 32 girls teams. Now it has 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in the Valley, we just can't keep up with the growth,''
he said. ``Some players have had to go up to Santa Clarita to play
or Camarillo or even Santa Barbara. We could put together teams,
but where would they practice?''
</P>
<P>
   Female soccer participation is at an all-time high nationally,
according to the Soccer Industry Council of America. Women now
account for 41 percent of soccer players and 45 percent of soccer
players who are under 17.
</P>
<P>
   Nickie Brandt of Claremont is a soccer mom in more ways than
one. She and her 9-year-old daughter, Megan, both play, the mom in
an over-30 league, ``even though I'm over 40.'' She said it's the
sheer physicality of the sport that is so attractive and recalled
one goal by U.S. midfielder Michelle Akers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen the muscles on her leg,'' she marveled.
``It was impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of young, strong and talented women makes a good
antidote to other female role models like actresses and fashion
models, she said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Hamm who most of the kids were on the lookout for
Wednesday. Before the players arrived, a team official told the
growing crowd that the women would not stop to sign autographs or
talk to the fans, who waited anyway and ultimately got what they
were after.
</P>
<P>
   When Team USA arrived by bus, the players stepped off, wearing
red jerseys and blue shorts. Focused but upbeat, they filed past
the kids without a word. The kids looked on in silence, watching
the players pass and then following them to the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian team, in the runner-up game Saturday against
Norway, had just finished practice, and four boys were comparing
the autographs they got the players to sign on their soccer balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got Sissi, Maycon and Priscila,'' said 11-year-old Daniel
Frazer of Claremont, showing the signatures from the Brazilian
team, with their numbers. Priscila had signed ``Kisses.''
</P>
<P>
   For the boys in the crowd, it didn't matter that the players
were women.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good, and at least it's soccer,'' said Francisco
Cienfuegos, 9, of Upland.
</P>
<P>
   But to the girls it mattered. As the team moved downfield, the
crowd surged forward, taking seats in a set of bleachers 30 feet
from the players bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you, Mia,'' one girl shouted.

CLINTON BRINGS `NEW MARKETS' MESSAGE TO SOUTH PHOENIX
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL 
 JANE LARSON AND JEFF BARKER 
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ During a sweltering five hour visit Wednesday,
President Clinton pitched a message of economic hope to a neglected
part of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on a Hispanic activist group, checked out a suc
cessful tortilla factory, engaged in a lively back-and-forth with
business leaders and sat out a rainstorm eating tamales and
chimichangas at a South Phoenix restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before 10 p.m., Clinton was wing ing his way toward Los
Angeles on the next leg of his trip, meant to showcase his efforts
to reduce poverty in America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was in town to spotlight his `New Markets'' program, a
first-of-its kind initiative aimed at channeling millions of
dollars into companies that set up shop in low- and middle-income
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Six major Valley banks have promised $5 million to share in the
Small Business Investment Com pany, to be named Magnet Capital,
which will issue loans to deserving businesses.
</P>
<P>
   `We need to create more jobs so people can afford the products
you produce here,'' Clinton said during a round-table discussion
between local business leaders and community activists following a
tour of the La Canasta Tortilla factory, 3101 W. Jackson St.
</P>
<P>
   One of the business owners noted that the President didn't
complain during the sweaty late afternoon stroll around the
factory, which is famous for its production of 840,000 tortillas a
day.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton joked that the tour caused him one problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got hungry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was finally able to deal with his hunger at about 7:30
p.m. when he paid a surprise visit to Poncho's Mexican Food, 7202
S. Central Ave., where he munched a fiesta chiquita platter,
according to manager Sylvia Madrigal. The plate, two mini-tacos,
two mini-chimi changas, two tamales, a side of beans and garnish.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a rainstorm, the restaurant near Central and Baseline
briefly lost power, but employees said they were otherwise had no
problem feeding the 35-member party, which included Jesse Jackson
and other dignitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at the roundtable dis cussion at La Canasta, Clinton
lauded the Safeway grocery chain, which opened a new store in South
Phoenix in March.
</P>
<P>
   `Everywhere in America there are good people who need investment
and jobs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his trip through South Phoenix pointed up the neces
sity of programs aimed at low-in come communities.
</P>
<P>
   `All you've got to do is drive around the streets here in South
Phoenix to see that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If the tortilla kitchen didn't make him sweat, there were plenty
of protesters along the President's trip who did their best to turn
up the heat.
</P>
<P>
   During his short stay, the Presi dent was met with boos from
protestors disgruntled over every thing from regulations on sports
utility vehicles to the U.S involve ment in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Several protestors also took jabs at Clinton's personal life,
accusing him of dodging the draft as a youth and engaging in serial
womanizing.
</P>
<P>
   One protestor's sign read, `1969 Draft Dodger, 1999 War Monger.`
Another read, `Today Kosovo, To morrow Our Planet.` Still another
read, ``What if the Chinese Had Intruded in the U.S. Civil War?''
</P>
<P>
   Others criticized Clinton for meeting only with businessmen and
dignitaries, rather than average resi dents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghettos this way,'' said Gilbert Garay, as Clinton's motorcade
left La Canasta.
</P>
<P>
   The President arrived at Sky Harbor International Airport at
4:11 p.m., on the north runway, forcing all other traffic to divert
to the south runway.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a gray suit, the President descended from Air Force
One to greet a long line of local dignitaries, including Secretary
of State Betsey Bayless, Attorney Gen eral Janet Napolitano and
Phoenix Mayor Skip Rimsza.
</P>
<P>
   Also on hand to shake the president's hand in the broiling heat,
which reached 107 degrees Wednes day, were Maricopa County Super
visor Mary Rose Wilcox, Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley and
Gila River Indian Comunity chair woman Mary Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Clinton on the trip were former Democratic Presi
dential contender Jesse Jackson, who was on board to help tout the
`New Markets'' program, and Gene Sperling, Clinton's domestic
policy advisor.
</P>
<P>
   At Sky Harbor, Clinton briefly mingled with the officials and
other well-wishers, including one who handed him a baseball cap and
a box of Girl Scout cookies.
</P>
<P>
   From the airport, Clinton traveled by limousine to the
headquarters of Chicanos Por La Causa, the His panic activist
group, at 1112 E. Buckeye Road. There he met with residents and
business leaders from the South Phoenix Enterprise Zone who have
benefited from the Clin ton administration's previous efforts at
spurring economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton moved by motor cade to La Canasta Mexican Foods,
where he was led on a 20-minute tour of the tortilla-making opera
tion, inspecting but not consuming any of the floury disks.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Clinton sat down with another group of business
leaders and community activists to discuss the merits of the `New
Markets'' program and others like it.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton huddled inside La Canasta, about 300 supporters lined
31st Avenue and crowded close to the front of the restaurant, some
carrying red white and blue bal loons.
</P>
<P>
   Others watched the presidential roundtable on television from
the comfort of their nearby homes. Sylvia Rodriguez, 62, who has
lived in the neighborhood near 31st street and Washington Avenue
since 1972, said she hoped the Clinton trip would post real
results.
</P>
<P>
   `I think it's nice to see him in this neighborhood,'' Rodriguez
said. `I think this neighborhood needs some improvement and maybe
if he sees it he'll realize that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may be the first president to tour a Phoenix tortilla
factory, but he's not the first White House resident to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1987, then-Vice President George Bush_on a fundraising
swing through Phoenix for his 1988 presidential bid_visited Ruben
Parra Sr.'s Estrella Tortilla Factory on South Central Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't bring an entourage, he just brought his grandson,''
Parra Sr. recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton became the first sitting United
States Presi dent to voisit an Indian Reservation since Franklin
Delano Roosevelt traveled through the Cherokee In dian Reservation
while on vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the Oglala Sioux Nation in Pine Ridge South Dakota,
Clin ton unveiled a partnership between the Department of Housing
and Urban Development, the Treasury Department, tribal governments
and mortgage companies to encourage homeownership by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The program would establish ``one-stop mortgage centers'' at
Pine Ridge and on the Navajo Reservation in Arizona, Clinton said.

PERCIVAL AN ALL-STAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Troy Percival was the sole Angel player named to the
American League All-Star team Wednesday, and that's the way it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   No other Angel put up numbers worthy of All-Star consideration,
with the possible exception of Mo Vaughn (.281, 16 homers, 53 RBIs
going into Wednesday's game). And while Percival is appreciative of
the selection -- the third of his career (he was an All-Star in
1996 and '98) -- he's going to feel a little lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real difference (from '96 and '98) is that I don't
get to share this with any of my teammates,'' said Percival, who
ranks third in the league with 22 saves. ``It's a little hollow
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun (in '98) watching (Darin) Erstad go for the first
time and it was a thrill (in '96) going with Chuck (Finley). This
time I'm on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the chance to hang out with the stars, the best
players in the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows I don't associate with position players from
other teams, Percival said. ``I'll talk to other relievers then fly
back home.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise to Percival that the Angels have only one
All-Star -- they're in last place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we're sitting in the standings says it all,'' he said.
``But we're only 7 1/2 games out. We're still in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three All-Star appearances and the Angels single-season club
record for saves (42 last year) don't mean much to Percival if the
team doesn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes 50 saves from me for us to win the division,
that's all I care about,'' he said. ``All the other stuff doesn't
matter. I saved 42 games last year, but all I think about are my
seven losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival was also quick to give credit to the Angels bullpen,
which has been at or near the top of the league in ERA all season.
Mark Petkovsek has been key setting up Percival, going 8-2 with a
1.69 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could have him go instead of me, I'd do it,'' Percival
said. ``I got a 4-month-old (son Cole) at home I'd like to spend
time with.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielders Tim Salmon (sprained left wrist) and Jim Edmonds
(surgery on right shoulder) continue to make progress in their
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon hit off a tee for the third day in a row Wednesday and if
all goes well, he might hit soft toss this weekend and live
pitching next week.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit off a tee Tuesday and also could begin hitting in
the batting cage soon. Still, there is no timetable for the return
of either.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins has decided pitcher Mike Fyhrie will start
Sunday's game in Colorado, the final game before the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Collins had been undecided, but after Fyhrie held the Mariners
to two runs and six hits in seven innings Tuesday, it was an easy
decision. Collins' other options were Jarrod Washburn and
Shigetoshi Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Greene's demotion to triple-A Edmonton might have been a
surprise to some, considering his 12 homers and 31 RBIs. But Greene
has been horrible with runners in scoring postion (.197), his
at-bats looking worse and worse as he continued to swing at pitches
out of the strikezone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get him out of that was to have him go play,''
Collins said. ``He needs at-bats. He needs to go find his stroke.
He knows what he needs to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Greene on the roster is Tim Unroe, who had hit in 10
consecutive games for triple-A Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   It's Unroe's third tour of duty with the Angels this season. He
made the team out of spring training, was sent down June 13, then
called up June 16 when Mike Colangelo was injured. He was sent down
again June 22 before being called up Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough being the 25th man,'' Unroe said. ``But it's better
than being the 26th man.''
</P>
<P>
   Unroe started Wednesday's game at DH.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are off today, then will begin a three-game series in
Denver against the Colorado Rockies on Friday. Pitching matchups
for the series: Friday (6:05) -- Chuck Finley (4-9, 5.52 ERA) vs.
Darryl Kile (5-6, 5.57); Saturday (5:05) -- Omar Olivares (7-6,
3.26) vs. Pedro Astacio (8-7, 5.30); Sunday (12:05) -- Mike Fyhrie
(0-0, 2.57) vs. Bobby Jones (4-7, 5.76).

AID FOR TERRORISTS CAME THROUGH 2 PERSIAN GULF NATIONS, U.S. SAYS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct spelling of Khaled Shaikh Muhammad to Khaled
Shaikh   `MOHAMMAD')   (nk) 
 By   JAMES RISEN with BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. officials say they believe that two suspected
terrorists wanted by the FBI have received help through two Persian
Gulf countries with close ties to Washington, complicating the
administration's counterterrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Clinton administration has made no public protests,
it quietly sent senior officials last week to one of the countries,
the United Arab Emirates, to lobby for a halt to a suspected
financial relationship between a government-controlled bank and
Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile charged in the bombings of
U.S. &UR;  &LR; embassies in Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
   A federal indictment charges that bin Laden's extensive
businesses have provided him a cover to acquire explosives and
weapons, and Washington has begun a worldwide effort to curb his
access to international financial systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Intelligence Agency has obtained evidence that bin
Laden has been allowed to funnel money through the Dubai Islamic
Bank in Dubai, which the United Arab Emirates government
effectively controls.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also confronting allegations by some
American officials that the foreign minister of Qatar told a
suspected lieutenant of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, a convicted terrorist,
that an FBI counterterrorism team was on its way to Qatar to arrest
him.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials said they did not believe that the
foreign minister was involved in the 1996 incident, but that the
United States believed that at least some Qatar officials had
warned the fugitive, Khaled Shaikh Mohammad. The United States
wanted him in connection with a plot to blow up 12 American
airliners over the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases highlight the difficulties of managing relations with
moderate Arab states long courted by Washington, showered with aid
and allowed to buy high-technology military weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The American generosity is meant to encourage the moderate
states to stand as a bulwark against radical Islam, with public
policies and with quiet support for American intelligence
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say some members of the elite even in moderate Arab
states apparently feel a need to hedge their bets against critics
of their pro-Western policies and to insure against becoming
targets of terrorist attacks themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations that the Dubai Islamic Bank is dealing with bin
Laden seem to underscore that this scion of one of Saudi Arabia's
wealthiest families retains some support among the elite of the
Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Although bin Laden was exiled and supposedly cut off by his
family, which controls construction companies in Saudi Arabia,
American officials believe wealthy Sunni Arabs in the Persian Gulf
quietly share his anti-Western fundamentalist beliefs, even though
they run counter to other moderate Arab interests.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence officials said they had evidence that bin
Laden had a relationship with the bank, which they believed had
been arranged with the approval of the officials who control the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The minister of state for finance and industry for the emirates,
Mohammed Khalfan bin Kharbash, was elected chairman of the bank in
February, after the government stepped in to prop it up in the wake
of severe financial losses last year that followed charges of
embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official who went to the Emirates last week said
that officials were ``responsive'' to American concerns about the
Dubai bank's involvement with bin Laden. But the official refused
to provide details about the meetings, which included Treasury
Department and National Security Council officials. The American
officials also declined to say how much money they believed that
bin Laden had funneled through the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan under the
protection of the Taliban. Estimates of his wealth vary widely.
Some analysts say they are convinced that he has just a few million
dollars left from his vast inheritance. The Central Intelligence
Agency estimates that he has up to $250 million, including assets
in legitimate businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A press adviser in the Emirates Embassy here, Edmund Ghareeb,
said he could not comment on the suspected bank dealings. The Qatar
ambassador to the United States, Saad Mohammed al-Kobasi, declined
to comment on the allegations against officials in his country.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has refrained from public comment on
either case, apparently fearing damage to relations with two
oil-rich Arab states that have generally supported American
policies in the region and that also help American military
operations in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For years, the main port of call for U.S. warships in the gulf
was in the Emirates. Last year, the country agreed to pay $8
billion for F-16 fighters, a major boost for Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   In Qatar, construction is under way on what United States
officials say will be the Pentagon's largest prepositioning supply
base outside the United States. When the $178 million complex is
completed in about a year, it will support up to 10,000 troops and
5,000 vehicles, aiding operations against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Gulf War, Qatar has also deepened its economic ties,
cutting deals with American oil companies like Occidental Petroleum
and Mobil. Breaking with its larger neighbor, Saudi Arabia, Qatar
also became the first gulf state to establish open trade relations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Its foreign minister, Sheik Hamed bin Jasim al Thani, plays a
significant role in the relationship with Washington. He has met
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright two times, in November and
February, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Qatar case centers on efforts to arrest Mohammad in
connection with Yousef's plot to destroy the airliners. Yousef was
convicted in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center in
Manhattan. In January 1996, the United States secretly indicted
Mohammad as an accomplice in the airliner plot.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charged that in late 1994 and early 1995,
Mohammad lived in Yousef's apartment in Manila, where they kept
explosive devices and chemicals. Federal prosecutors have also said
they believe Mohammad helped Yousef devise and finance the airliner
plot.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996, American authorities learned that Mohammad was
living in the capital of Qatar, Doha, and working at the Public
Works Ministry, said one official.
</P>
<P>
   The American ambassador to Qatar, Patrick N. Theros, a former
counterterrorism official in the State Department, met Qatar
officials and reported that he was optimistic that Qatar would be
willing to arrest Mohammad and turn him over to the United States,
officials recounted.
</P>
<P>
   There was a recent precedent such an action. About a year
earlier, the United States sent a plane to Pakistan after the
authorities there arrested Yousef and agreed to turn him over to
the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, however, found itself thwarted in its attempt to catch
Mohammad. Its agents, sent to Doha in early 1996, were told that
the suspect, who had been under surveillance, was now nowhere to be
found. A Qatar police search of a beachfront estate where the
officers had been told that Mohammad was staying, proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI spent about a week awaiting word of Mohammad's
whereabouts; they returned to the United States empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   American officials now say they believe that Mohammad was warned
by someone in the Qatar government and that he was staying at the
estate of Abdallah bin Khalid, a fundamentalist who has provided
support for other Islamic radicals. A former American intelligence
official said bin Laden also visited bin Khalid in Qatar twice in
the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Although American officials said they had no conclusive proof,
current and former officials said they believed that the foreign
minister was involved, directly or indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign minister declined to comment for this article.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also noted that the raid occurred at a time
of confusion in Qatar, which might have contributed to its failure.
In the summer of 1995, the ruler of Qatar was overthrown by his
son. In early 1996, about the time of the FBI action, the father
was staging an unsuccessful countercoup.
</P>
<P>
   Two years after the fruitless FBI action, Federal prosecutors in
Manhattan unsealed the indictment against Mohammad. A $5 million
reward for information leading to his arrest or conviction is being
offered.

IT'S EXTORTION, COMING TO A BALL FIELD NEAR YOU
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ I love The Ballpark in Arlington. I mean, I
``really'' love it. In a purely platonic way, of course. Nothing
kinky, you understand. This feeling is too pure, too sacred.
</P>
<P>
   I adore its colors, its smells, its sightlines, its sounds. With
the exception of a couple of minor items, I love everything about
it.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have moved in there permanently a long time ago, in fact, if
Tom Schieffer would have let me.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly roomy enough for a king-size bed, and the dogs
would love romping on groundskeeper Tom Burns' ``yard.''
</P>
<P>
   This is why a lot of folks, yours truly included, implored the
citizens of Arlington _ and I was one at the time _ back in the
early '90s to approve the sales tax increase, partner up with the
Texas Rangers and build this magnificent structure.
</P>
<P>
   There was some stiff, vocal resistance, you'll recall, but a
record turnout of voters approved the measure by a 2-to-1 margin.
Those of us who had fought long and hard were justifiably proud.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, somewhere, buried way back in my conscience where none of
us really like to wander around for fear we'll stumble over
something we don't want to think about, there was this tiny, little
guilty feeling. Claims of blackmail and extortion by Seattle media
and Mariners fans this week have reminded me that that uneasy
feeling is still very much there.
</P>
<P>
   So here's my warning to you: Don't think that just because
Arlington and Seattle are separated by thousands of miles and the
Continental Divide means what's happening there won't affect you
right here in Texas. It can and probably will.
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't been keeping up, Seattle's Safeco Field will
officially open for business a week from tonight, following the
All-Star break. It is a palace, the Taj Mahal of baseball. Then
again, for $517 million, there should be a few bells and whistles,
right?
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Seattle fans is that cost overruns on the new
stadium have exceeded $100 million and the Mariners' owners are, in
effect, holding star players Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez as
hostages in a high-pressure game of extortion. Their message is
simple: Pay up, or say goodbye to Griffey and/or Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   In a copyrighted story Sunday, ``The Seattle Times'' said that
Mariners owner John Ellis and others in the team's ownership
structure have subtly ``played the Griffey card'' almost from Day
One in its dealings with the King County Public Facilities
District, which oversees the construction project.
</P>
<P>
   The team's claim: If we're forced to pay these overruns, as we
agreed to do, then we may not be able to keep Griffey or Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, we have moved from the threat of
``build-or-we-will-leave'' to direct intimidation regarding a
team's superstars. You want to see Griffey play in a Mariners'
uniform, Seattle fans? Then you have to step back up to the plate
as a citizenry and bail us out one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey has lashed out at the team, saying he doesn't want to be
used as a pawn in the negotiations, and fans are in an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if the overruns are $1 or $100 million, the
Mariners said they would pay them and they should,'' Mariners fan
Larry Garvin said at Safeco Field's open house Tuesday. ``As
someone said, our response isn't just `no' to the Mariners, it's
`hell, no.'''
</P>
<P>
   We said ``yes'' to the Rangers back in '91, and while I
certainly don't regret it, now and then my conscience gives me a
tweak because, in a way, we too succumbed to subtle extortion.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' lever when they wanted Arlington to build The
Ballpark was the same one that most franchises use: ``We need a new
facility. You can build it and we'll agree to stay here, or we'll
go someplace that will.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever really came out and said it. They didn't have to.
They just made it clear that they were exploring all their options,
meeting with planning boards in other cities, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, they weren't going to Florida, or North Carolina, just to
Dallas, or Irving, or Lewisville. But they'd still be gone from
Arlington. As someone who lives west of the Trinity, I didn't want
to see that, and Arlington didn't either.
</P>
<P>
   Build this grand new facility for us, the Rangers vowed, and we
can be more competitive. We can afford to keep our star players and
pass some savings along to our fans.
</P>
<P>
   Everything they promised has come true except one. The Ballpark,
built for a mere $191 million, isn't Safeco Field with its
retractable roof, but it's superb. The bonds used to finance the
construction will be paid off even earlier than expected. And the
Rangers have been more competitive, and they kept Pudge Rodriguez
in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But there have been no savings for the fans. On the contrary,
since The Ballpark opened in 1994, ticket prices have soared at
least 50 percent in most areas and in some, Home Run Porch, for
instance, they've almost doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, very soon the Rangers must ante up again if they want to
keep two-time MVP Juan Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel the hard, cold steel of a symbolic gun barrel
prodding your rib cage in the very near future, you'll know soon
enough who gets to pay for that honor, too.

PALMEIRO EAGER TO RETURN TO FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ The Rangers' upcoming series with the Padres
at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium should produce a second tour of
duty at first base for Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't talked about it,'' Palmeiro said, ``but I'm sure
I'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who underwent arthroscopic surgery Feb. 10 and March 7
to remove torn cartilage from his right knee, made his 76th start
Wednesday as the Rangers' designated hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro made five consecutive starts at first base from June
5-9 during the Rangers' previous interleague swing through
Arizona's Bank One Ballpark and Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium.
Palmeiro hit .391 (9 for 23) with two home runs and nine runs
batted in during those five games, and went 1-for-4 during his only
other start at first base June 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm to the point now where I'm not going to be where I want to
be,'' Palmeiro said, ``but I feel I can do a pretty decent job.''
</P>
<P>
   Interleague games at National League ballparks prohibit the
designated hitter, so Palmeiro likely will replace Lee Stevens in
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think so,'' manager Johnny Oates said, ``but it all
depends on Raffy and how he feels.'' KELLY DAY-TO-DAY
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Roberto Kelly remains day-to-day after suffering
a strain to his left biceps muscle during his seventh-inning at-bat
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve outfielder Scarborough Green completed the at-bat for
Kelly, who departed in pain after overextending the arm while
swinging at a 1-1 pitch from right-hander Tim Worrell. Kelly first
experienced a twinge in the arm during his sixth-inning at-bat,
which resulted in a two-run double that gave the Rangers a 4-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The injury increases the probability of center fielder Ruben
Mateo (strain, left groin) being reinstated from his medical
rehabilitation assignment for this weekend's series with the
Padres, should the Rangers deem him healthy. STEVENS SITS, THEN
STARS
</P>
<P>
   Manager Johnny Oates inserted reserves Jon Shave and Luis Alicea
into Wednesday's lineup for the slumping Lee Stevens and second
baseman Mark McLemore with Oakland left-hander Kenny Rogers on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens went 5-for-31 (.161) in his previous nine games, and
McLemore has struggled this season with left-handers by hitting
.137 (7-for-51). Shave, who replaced Stevens at first base, also
needed the at-bats after making his most recent start June 19 in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens replaced Shave in the sixth inning and delivered the
game-winning hit with his two-run, seventh-inning single.
ZIMMERMAN'S ZEROS
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman, who Wednesday matched right-hander
Tim Crabtree's club record with his 16th consecutive scoreless
appearance, has pitched 192/3 innings without allowing a run. That
ranks second among Rangers relievers to the 232/3 scoreless innings
pitched by Jim Kern during the 1979 season: Pitcher Year Innings
Jim Kern 1979 232/3 Jeff Zimmerman 1999 192/3 Jim Kern 1979 182/3
Steve Foucalt 1974 172/3 Dave Tobik 1983 17 Briefly
</P>
<P>
   _ Third baseman Todd Zeile extended his hitting streak to 16
games with his run-scoring single in the fourth inning. The streak
matches the best of Zeile's career, and he is hitting .450
(27-for-60) during that span.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rafael Palmeiro and closer John Wetteland earned bonuses of
$50,000 with their selections to the All-Star Game as reserves.
Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman's contract did not include a bonus for
his selection. nn

PERCIVAL AN ALL-STAR
</HEADLINE>
 GREENE QUOTES-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Troy Percival was the sole Angel player named to the
American League All-Star team Wednesday, and that's the way it
should be.
</P>
<P>
   No other Angel put up numbers worthy of All-Star consideration,
with the possible exception of Mo Vaughn (.281, 16 homers, 53 RBIs
going into Wednesday's game). And while Percival is appreciative of
the selection -- the third of his career (he was an All-Star in
1996 and '98) -- he's going to feel a little lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real difference (from '96 and '98) is that I don't
get to share this with any of my teammates,'' said Percival, who
ranks third in the league with 22 saves. ``It's a little hollow
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun (in '98) watching (Darin) Erstad go for the first
time and it was a thrill (in '96) going with Chuck (Finley). This
time I'm on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   But what about the chance to hang out with the stars, the best
players in the game?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows I don't associate with position players from
other teams, Percival said. ``I'll talk to other relievers then fly
back home.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise to Percival that the Angels have only one
All-Star -- they're in last place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we're sitting in the standings says it all,'' he said.
``But we're only 7 1/2 games out. We're still in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Three All-Star appearances and the Angels single-season club
record for saves (42 last year) don't mean much to Percival if the
team doesn't win.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it takes 50 saves from me for us to win the division,
that's all I care about,'' he said. ``All the other stuff doesn't
matter. I saved 42 games last year, but all I think about are my
seven losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival was also quick to give credit to the Angels bullpen,
which has been at or near the top of the league in ERA all season.
Mark Petkovsek has been key setting up Percival, going 8-2 with a
1.69 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I could have him go instead of me, I'd do it,'' Percival
said. ``I got a 4-month-old (son Cole) at home I'd like to spend
time with.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielders Tim Salmon (sprained left wrist) and Jim Edmonds
(surgery on right shoulder) continue to make progress in their
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon hit off a tee for the third day in a row Wednesday and if
all goes well, he might hit soft toss this weekend and live
pitching next week.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds hit off a tee Tuesday and also could begin hitting in
the batting cage soon. Still, there is no timetable for the return
of either.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Terry Collins has decided pitcher Mike Fyhrie will start
Sunday's game in Colorado, the final game before the All-Star
break.
</P>
<P>
   Collins had been undecided, but after Fyhrie held the Mariners
to two runs and six hits in seven innings Tuesday, it was an easy
decision. Collins' other options were Jarrod Washburn and
Shigetoshi Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Greene's demotion to triple-A Edmonton might have been a
surprise to some, considering his 12 homers and 31 RBIs. But Greene
has been horrible with runners in scoring postion (.197), his
at-bats looking worse and worse as he continued to swing at pitches
out of the strikezone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to get him out of that was to have him go play,
Collins said. ``He needs at-bats. He needs to go find his stroke.
He knows what he needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, who will join Edmonton at Oklahoma City today, was asked
if he saw the demotion coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I didn't, he said from his Orange County home. ``You know
I don't make excuses. ... I'm not going to be there (Edmonton) very
long.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing Greene on the roster is Tim Unroe, who had hit in 10
consecutive games for triple-A Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   It's Unroe's third tour of duty with the Angels this season. He
made the team out of spring training, was sent down June 13, then
called up June 16 when Mike Colangelo was injured. He was sent down
again June 22 before being called up Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough being the 25th man,'' Unroe said. ``But it's better
than being the 26th man.''
</P>
<P>
   Unroe started Wednesday's game at DH.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are off today, then will begin a three-game series in
Denver against the Colorado Rockies on Friday. Pitching matchups
for the series: Friday (6:05) -- Chuck Finley (4-9, 5.52 ERA) vs.
Darryl Kile (5-6, 5.57); Saturday (5:05) -- Omar Olivares (7-6,
3.26) vs. Pedro Astacio (8-7, 5.30); Sunday (12:05) -- Mike Fyhrie
(0-0, 2.57) vs. Bobby Jones (4-7, 5.76).

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a blackout that lasted nearly 19 hours, power
was restored to most of northern Manhattan Wednesday, but angry
city officials nonetheless threatened legal action against Con
Edison, saying the utility had failed to build a power system able
to withstand intense heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the city of New York is entitled to a more secure flow
of electrical power than Con Edison is giving us,'' Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said Wednesday, contending that poor planning by the
company had created a life-threatening crisis for the city. ``You
can't have too many nights like the night we had last night and not
expect that you are going to kill people.''
</P>
<P>
   The blackout in the Washington Heights and Inwood neighborhoods
was the most spectacular result of a three-day heat wave that
officials blamed for at least eight deaths in the city. Most of the
victims were elderly _ the youngest was 53, the oldest 90 _ and all
succumbed after their body temperatures climbed to extremely
dangerous levels. None of the deaths were blamed directly on the
Manhattan blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The blackout occurred when Consolidated Edison workers were
preparing to turn two power cables that had failed in upper
Manhattan on Tuesday night back on when one of the cables failed
again, sparking a fire. Con Ed said that it quickly shut down all
power to the entire area north of 155th Street to prevent further
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond New York, officials said the heat caused seven deaths in
Pennsylvania, four in New Jersey, two in Massachusetts and two in
Washington. Scattered power failures continued to plague hundreds
of thousands of people across the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states
Wednesday, and hospitals continued to treat hundreds of people for
heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   New power failures flared in some parts of New York City,
including the Lower East Side, and also in downtown Newark, N.J.,
where blackouts knocked out power to the subway system,
Pennsylvania Station and thousands of homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Late Wednesday night, Con Ed officials said there were no
further power problems in the area, though some 3,000 customers
remained without electricity in northern Manhattan, as did 1,400
customers in Westchester County and hundreds more in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Northeast, temperatures dropped significantly,
providing a respite for utility companies and their powerless
customers.. In Central Park, Wednesday's high reached a breezy 92
degrees, well below the 101-degree temperatures recorded there on
Monday and Tuesday. In many New England cities, the highs barely
nudged into the low 80s, and the cooler weather is expected to last
through the week.
</P>
<P>
   Cheers and applause swept through the streets of northern
Manhattan when, at 5:05 p.m. ET, power was restored to 93 percent
of the affected customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights went on, and the air-conditioner went on, and
everyone started screaming,'' Kelvin Nunez, 24, said outside his
apartment building on 159th Street. ``Then we relaxed in front of
the air-conditioner. It felt great. Cold. Nice. I knew I was going
to sleep well.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the length of the blackout, police reported only a
handful of looting arrests. But shopkeepers in the area, which is
home to many Dominican immigrants and includes some of the city's
poorest and most crowded neighborhoods, were left to contend with
another problem _ substantial stocks of spoiled food. Demetrio
Tavariz, who owns a bodega on 187th Street, was typical. He said he
had lost $1,000 worth of meat and dairy products. ``I don't know if
my insurance will cover it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   City officials also worried about expenses associated with the
blackout. Though no final cost estimate was available, hundreds of
additional police officers were deployed throughout the blackout
area, which encompassed all of Manhattan north of 155th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he had directed city attorneys to research a
lawsuit against Con Ed. The suit would likely have three
objectives: to seek money damages for public costs, to force Con
Edison to come up with a plan to prevent more blackouts, and to
establish an independent monitor to assess the quality of the
company's power system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was not a natural disaster,'' the mayor said.
``Last night was a man-made disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   For guidance, the city's lawyers Wednesday were studying a
lawsuit the city filed against Con Edison after the 1977 blackout,
which left millions of residents without power for 25 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the Court of Appeals, New York state's highest
court, ruled that Con Edison's gross negligence led to the power
failure, but the court also held that the utility did not have to
pay New York City for additional police and fire protection caused
by the blackout. The city could, however, recover money for
property damage from the blackout or any resulting looting, the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the state Public Service Commission, which
regulates utility companies, said that in studies of power failure
rates, Con Edison had the best performance of the state's utility
companies. As is routine for power failures, the commission said it
will examine Con Edison's efforts this week in New York City and
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will review the utility's actions to ensure that they were
reasonable and that they complied with their operating
procedures,'' said Dave Flanagan, a spokesman for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   And as Giuliani spoke of lawsuits, his aides were acknowledging
that, despite years of complaining about blackouts, they remained
largely uninformed about the quality, design and load capacities of
the city's power grid.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said the city has enlisted consultants to study the
power system. ``The city will now get more involved in
understanding that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison officials declined to comment on the mayor's threat
of legal action, saying they were focusing instead on restoring
power to customers. But the mayor was not the only public official
consulting lawyers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   David Paterson, an influential Democratic state senator who
represents a portion of Washington Heights, said Wednesday that he
was considering organizing a class-action lawsuit against Con
Edison. He said many residents firmly believed that Con Edison cut
power to Washington Heights to spare the city's wealthier
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll never be able to convince anybody that it was a random
event,'' Paterson said, a remark echoed by other local officials.
``They think it was very deliberate and they think it was a chosen
way to handle the problem at our expense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception in that area,'' he added, ``is that the area
has regularly been denied service and opportunity, and this is just
in furtherance of that same concept.''
</P>
<P>
   A Con Edison spokesman, Joseph Petta, responded: ``If that is
the perception, it is a false perception. There is no reason why
one network would not be maintained as diligently as another area,
regardless of its location.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Michael Evans, president of Con Edison, insisted that the
power network serving Washington Heights and Inwood was designed to
the same engineering specifications and received the same level of
maintenance and equipment upgrades as the company's other networks.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Company officials continued to give sometimes conflicting
accounts of the events that led up to the power failure. On Tuesday
night, Petta said the network crashed on its own because it was
overloaded by demand. Early Wednesday, Petta said the company
itself cut the power to prevent the blackout from spreading across
Manhattan. Later Wednesday, Con Edison denied that concerns over a
broader blackout figured into their decision.
</P>
<P>
   As Evans toured Washington Heights Wednesday afternoon with City
Council Speaker Peter Vallone, the utility executive told reporters
that the company had no choice but to cut power when a small fire
started in a substation that supplied electricity to northern
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very concerned that by continuing to operate the
network, it would overload and damage the facility, and ultimately
make it more difficult to restore service to the citizens of this
area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But what remained undetermined Wednesday was why Washington
Heights' network began to fail in the first place, and why several
other networks across the city also came perilously close to
failing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really tell you why,'' Evans said, adding that company
experts would conduct a complete analysis of their equipment and
systems.
</P>
<P>
   City officials, however, were focused on Con Edison's web of
feeder lines, insulated high-power lines that run underneath the
city's major avenues. By Con Edison's count, 50 of the system's
1,175 feeder lines failed during the heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Wednesday, Con Ed scrambled to cope with an
unfolding public relations disaster. They issued apologies for the
power failure. They praised the residents of northern Manhattan.
They promised they were doing everything possible to restore power.
Evans, who earned $616,333 last year in salary and bonuses, even
sought to identify with those who suffered through a long, hot
night. He said his own house had been without power on Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife tells me it was very uncomfortable,'' he said, noting
that he never made it home to see for himself because he was
managing the company's response.

OFFERMAN SURPRISE ALL-STAR 
</HEADLINE>
 RESERVES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ While the honor of being named an
All-Star now belongs to pitcher Pedro Martinez and second baseman
Jose Offerman as well as shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, surely the
triumph of the moment belongs to Red Sox general manager Dan
Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Duquette predicted last year when the Red Sox unveiled
their All-Star logo on the left-field wall at Fenway Park,
Garciaparra and Martinez will be in the starting lineup for the
American League team that takes the field at Fenway next Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   That prediction was interpreted as a snub by Mo Vaughn, whom
Duquette neglected to mention. But while the former Sox star stays
home, passed over when the AL reserves were announced Wednesday,
Offerman was a surprise addition.
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping score, Duquette drafted Garciaparra, traded
for Martinez, and signed Offerman last winter as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nomar's a great shortstop, but there are other great
shortstops in the league,'' Duquette said. ``Our fans deserve a lot
of credit for voting for Nomar, especially after it was brought to
their attention that he was behind (Derek) Jeter and (Omar)
Vizquel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro Martinez is just unbelievable, and Offerman had a great
start, a good season last year, and is a real solid pro. He's
struggling a little bit with the bat, but he'll come around.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman, who has been in a dreadful slump that has dropped his
average from .346 May 19 to the .283 he's now hitting, said he
already had been making plans to spend the three-day break with his
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised,'' Offerman said upon learning of his selection
when he arrived at Tropicana Field Wednesday afternoon. ``And I'm
more than happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised because this game is `what have you done for me
lately,' and I know I haven't been doing that well lately,'' he
said. ``But I have to be pleased for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Offerman was an All-Star reserve for the National League in
1995, when he was chosen from the Los Angeles Dodgers. He played
shortstop in the ninth inning but did not bat. In his last 43
games, he is batting .225 (39 for 173), and just 7 of his 32
extra-base hits have come since that date. He had a bunt single
Wednesday night, but is just 2 for his last 26.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who already has been unofficially anointed the AL's
starting pitcher by Yankees manager Joe Torre, manager of the AL
squad, is an All-Star for the fourth time. When Cleveland manager
Mike Hargrove chose David Wells to start ahead of Martinez last
year, Martinez attended the game but asked not to pitch, choosing
to frolic in the AL dugout instead.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be the case this time. ``To me this is nothing new,''
he said of his selection after Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night's 3-2 loss. ``I
knew where I was going to be. To me, it's a great compliment. I'm
going to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Sox players all have been All-Stars before (this
will be Garciaparra's second appearance), this will be a novel
experience for 23 players who will be making their All-Star debut.
There will be seven newcomers on the AL side, 16 on the NL squad.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newcomers on the AL team are Orioles outfielder B.J.
Surhoff, making his Star debut in his 14th season, and Rangers
reliever Jeff Zimmerman, who two years ago was playing in the
independent Northern League and faxing his resume to all 30
big-league clubs. Zimmerman, the Rangers' setup man, is 8-0 with an
0.89 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``His numbers are so great that it's really hard to ignore what
he's done,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the National League's 11 pitchers will be making their
first All-Star appearance: St. Louis's Kent Bottenfield,
Philadelphia's Paul Byrd, Atlanta's Kevin Millwood, and Houston's
Jose Lima, Mike Hampton, and Billy Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Missing will be such familiar faces as Vaughn, Roger Clemens,
Barry Bonds, Alex Rodriguez, Kevin Brown, Albert Belle, and the
Atlanta pitching troika of Greg Maddux, John Smoltz, and Tom
Glavine.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the gifted Seattle shortstop who was elected a
starter the previous two seasons, has more home runs (17) than
either Garciaparra or the Yankees' Jeter (14 apiece) despite
missing 32 games with a knee injury. Yet, he was left off the AL
squad, which was selected by Torre with input from the league
office, while Jeter and Vizquel of the Indians were chosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, you're going to have one or two deserving guys
out, and that's unfortunate,'' said Rodriguez. ``I'm going to take
those three days and rest my knee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who lead the majors in wins, led both leagues with
six All-Stars. Vizquel and righthander Charles Nagy joined four
starters: first baseman Jim Thome, second baseman Roberto Alomar,
and outfielders Kenny Lofton and Manny Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   Nagy replaced Yankees closer Mariano Rivera, who reportedly
begged out because of personal business at home in Panama.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' Tony Gwynn was elected to the NL team but will miss
the game with a calf injury. Giants closer Robb Nen was selected
but will sit out with a callous on his right thumb.

MARTINEZ A FALLEN STAR 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-DEVIL RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ He gave a 14-karat performance in his
final tuneup for his All-Star start next Tuesday in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   But while Pedro Martinez's 14 strikeouts Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night were
the most anyone has seen here in the 1 1/2 seasons since they
opened the doors to baseball in Tropicana Field, Martinez won't be
riding a winning wave back home for his 'Star turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Tampa Bay Devil Rays came from behind to edge Martinez and
the Red Sox, 3-2, as a pitcher who didn't have a big-league win in
almost four years beat the man with more wins than anyone in the
majors. This, on a night Martinez said he felt like he had no-hit
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt in command all night,'' said Martinez, who fell short
in his attempt to become the first pitcher to have 16 wins at the
break since Randy Jones of the Padres in 1976. ``I felt I was
really strong. I took a peek at the radar gun in the eighth inning,
and I was still throwing 94, 95 miles an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Dan Duquette didn't have to see this loss, the
Red Sox' second straight to the Devil Rays and fourth in five
meetings over the span of a week, to opine that it was
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be able to win these games,'' said Duquette, who
listened to the game on the radio back home in Boston but already
is attuned to what he has to do in the 23 days leading to the July
31 trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   With the baseball world convening in Boston this weekend,
Duquette will be accelerating his efforts to find help for a team
that was missing All-Star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra for the fifth
straight game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make the playoffs,'' Duquette said. ``We want to
win the division. Generally, when you want to do that, you trade
younger players for established major league players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking around now, and we should have a much better
idea soon what players are potentially available.''
</P>
<P>
   Topping Duquette's wish list is a hitter. ``I'm still hopeful
that (Tom) Gordon and Ramon Martinez will come back,'' he said.
``If they pitch at a high level, then we'll look to bolster our
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they can't come back, then we may also need to look for
some type of pitching. But generally, there are professional
hitters available.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a Jim Leyritz, Duquette was asked.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, who dumped the King last summer at Leyritz's request,
chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players of that type are probably available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who had won his last four starts and hadn't lost in
almost a month (June 9 at Montreal), gave up more than two earned
runs for the first time in five starts and came away a loser
because of it. He was beaten by Dave Eiland, a righthander of
modest ability and immodest record (6-20 lifetime) who last won in
the big leagues on July 21, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game, don't ever underestimate anybody,'' said Eiland,
a 33-year-old journeyman who played college ball at Florida with
Mike Stanley and whose 15 minutes of fame is yet to come, as he was
Kevin Costner's body double in the soon-to-be-released baseball
movie, ``For the Love of the Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first win in a long time and it feels good to beat a
guy like that, and it was worth the wait.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox took a 2-1 lead in the sixth on singles by Darren Lewis,
Jose Offerman (a bunt that died on the first-base line), and Brian
Daubach. That lead could easily have expanded, but Offerman was
thrown out on a close play at third trying to advance on Daubach's
single, and Troy O'Leary's double took an ill-timed hop over the
fence, which kept Daubach, who could have scored easily, at third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was yelling at that fence to grow, but it didn't,'' manager
Jimy Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The next batter, Lou Merloni, lined out to end the inning, and
the Red Sox went hitless in the last three innings against
relievers Norm Charlton and Roberto Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who struck out six of seven batters in one stretch and
finished by striking out the side in the eighth, whiffed at least
one batter in every inning.
</P>
<P>
   But Tampa Bay took a 1-0 lead in the second when Fred McGriff
skidded an opposite-field double into the left-field corner and
scored when former Sox benchwarmer John Flaherty singled past a
diving Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty started the winning rally in the sixth with a one-out
single to center, Wade Boggs singled through the left side, and
Paul Sorrento bounced a grounder through the right side to tie the
score, Flaherty just beating Trot Nixon's throw home.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Ledesma then chopped a ball toward short that third
baseman Wilton Veras, whose first big-league home run had tied the
score at 1 in the fifth, fielded and flipped to second for a force
as Boggs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez has allowed three straight hits in an inning only five
times this season. The Devil Rays have done it three times, twice
Wednesday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   He threw 133 pitches, 90 for strikes, but despite the heavy
workload, Williams said he never entertained a thought of taking
him out, unless the Sox had tied the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You leave the game to the man,'' Williams said. ``You respect
him for who he is and what he has done for the team, let him
compete.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the standpoint of giving us one last shot in the ninth, I
thought he deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Merloni led off the ninth against Hernandez, the Devil Rays'
closer, with a liner to the wall. Jason Varitek drew a walk, but
Reggie Jefferson, pinch hitting for Veras, looked at a third
strike, and Damon Buford tapped into a game-ending force.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no luck in this game,'' Martinez said. ``You create
your own luck . . . They just played better, they did the little
things. No excuses, nothing to look for. Just let it go. There'll
be some other days.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has now lost to the White Sox (4-0), Expos (13-1),
and Devil Rays, will go into the break with a 15-3 record and 2.10
ERA, both major-league bests, and 184 strikeouts, second only to
Arizona's Randy Johnson (200).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pitched 18 games and kept us in the game 18 times,''
Williams said. ``That statement says it all. It tells you how good
he is.''

GRANT TRADE ONLY GETS SONICS BACK WHERE THEY STARTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The best part about the Sonics' trade for Horace Grant
last week is that the club unloaded personnel mistakes whose
contract value approximated the GNPs of all the European
principalities.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part is, that deal gets them merely back to even.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when a pro team churns the roster without
direction (see Mariners bullpen).
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Sonics president Wally Walker sees it another way,
contending the Sonics are neither directionless nor back to even.
</P>
<P>
   As far as having direction, Walker has a difficult case to make,
because the entire NBA in 1999 was directionless. The
thrown-together teams, compressed schedule and reckless disregard
for the quality of the game removed the last veil obscuring the
ruthless shamelessness in the NBA's Microsoft-like pursuit of a
buck.
</P>
<P>
   As rewarding as it was to see the stalwarts among the San
Antonio Spurs win the championship, that title will forever pack an
Oliver Miller-sized asterisk:
</P>
<P>
   ( season had no business being played).
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were among the sporting disaster's primary victims,
having to absorb the empty trade of Jim McIlvaine while indulging
two of the most ghastly examples of the NBA's unprofessionalism,
Anything But Thin Baker and Belly Owens.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in Olden Polynice's title as the worst single-season free
throw shooter in NBA history, and the Sonics at least should have
invested in a free agent cat to scrape litter over the mess.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the contention can be made that the Sonics, by
trading Don MacLean and Owens (and to a far lesser extent, Dale
Ellis), and dumping Polynice and other veterans, have removed the
worst mistakes of the Walker regime and returned the club nearly to
the pre-McIlvaine days.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, of course, sees progress where others see carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``All GMs have skeletons in their closet,'' he said Wednesday,
managing a small smile at the Sonics gym while watching
summer-league preparations. ``It's part of the business. I don't
look at what we did as trying to fix mistakes as much as making
moves to get better right away.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft-day deal with Orlando that brought Grant, a 6-10
forward on the downhill of a productive career, instantly made the
Sonics a better rebounding and defensive team, although Grant often
will be overmatched when he's forced out of position at center (how
often has that been said about a Sonics post man?).
</P>
<P>
   Another virtue is that Grant buys another year of development
time for Jelani McCoy and Vladimir Stepania, two frontliners of
whom large improvement is expected after a summer league full of
teaching. Both were bit players last season in a season nearly
devoid of practice time.
</P>
<P>
   The final asset was the departures of MacLean, Owens and Ellis.
It ridded the Sonics of three multi-year contracts that would have
been cripplers in improving a roster that tumbled out of the
Western Conference elite so abruptly that some feared a mass
kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Their departures _ all three may be waived by Orlando, although
their salaries will count against the Magic's cap _ along with
Grant's arrival, created a net $1 million reduction in the Sonics
payroll counted against the salary cap, meaning that the Sonics
potentially have more cash in the free agent derby than all but
Toronto, Chicago and the L.A. Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   The virtues made the trade a smart one, the only losses being
the 39-year-old Ellis and a draft choice _ Orlando had Seattle
choose Corey Maggette _ that would have added a guaranteed
four-year contract for a player unlikely to get time the next two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The caution is that the organization might be as wrong on Grant
as it was with Owens, whom the Sonics claimed to have thoroughly
researched and declared a good fit. This was despite the fact that
he was among the few NBA players in history to have his scoring and
rebounding averages decline six consecutive seasons. Now, it's
seven straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought Billy would be a good fit,'' Walker said. ``We got
him for below the average NBA salary and he had a skills set that
helped us with rebounding and ballhandling.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair to Billy, I don't know if he had a fair chance to
show his skills'' because of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair to the fans, Owens should have retired after showing
up looking like Mr. Sta-Puf. His lack of conditioning, along with
same for Baker, violated a minimum requirement for pro athletes and
killed the season.
</P>
<P>
   But their jock crimes cannot be charged against Sonics
management, which was forbidden to even talk to players during the
lockout, much less work them into shape.
</P>
<P>
   One more win would have pushed the Sonics into the eighth seed
in the playoffs, a place from which in the Eastern Conference the
New York Knicks did some damage, even without Patrick Ewing. That's
a fine example of how random was this NBA season.
</P>
<P>
   The seasonal conclusion is that Walker, and coach Paul Westphal,
as well as just about every other NBA president, GM and coach,
rates a get-out-of-jail card this summer for lack of evidence that
intentional basketball badness was committed.
</P>
<P>
   The Grant trade helped clear out Walker's ghost closet. The free
agent signing period that begins Aug. 1 will be the moment for
Walker to do something more than getting to even.

CLINTON ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION FOCUSES ON OPPORTUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JANE LARSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Saying huge opportunities remain in America's vibrant
economy, President Clinton on Wednesday championed his
administration's plans to make it easier for entrepreneurs to start
or expand businesses, no matter how poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``American business needs to know there are good opportunities
right now in inner cities and rural America,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about charity. This is about how to make money by
helping people who are willing to work for themselves get a chance
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   An audience of about 200 listened to Clinton's discussion with
entrepreneurs, business leaders and government officials, held
inside the high-ceiling factory of La Canasta Mexican Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Guests included bankers and business leaders, small-business
owners and three rows of La Canasta employees clad in new white
T-shirts and baseball caps.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his New Markets initiative will make it easier for
entrepreneurs to get the money they need to build and expand.
</P>
<P>
   The president praised Phoenix-based Magnet Capital, a new Small
Business Investment Company that will focus on lower-income areas,
and he reminded the crowd that high-tech names like Intel Corp. and
America Online got their start with U.S. Small Business
Administration-backed financing.
</P>
<P>
   He also pushed a proposal before Congress that will give tax
breaks to investors who finance such ventures in the United States,
``the same as we give to developing countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The round table was more a series of short speeches than a
give-and-take discussion of small business issues. The panel
included only two Phoenix entrepreneurs, though both are success
stories in the Valley's Hispanic business community: Josie Ippolito
of La Canasta and John Corella of the Corella Cos.
</P>
<P>
   Corella, who grew his electrical contracting company with the
help of set-aside programs aimed at minority-owned businesses,
urged Clinton not to let the programs come under attack in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Such programs took his company to a level it could not have
reached on its own, and it is now close to closing a deal that
would make it the first Hispanic-owned telephone company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also told Clinton that the New Market plans will take
commitment from the heads of Fortune 500 companies, because ``they
can open doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The new SBIC will be an extension of the Arizona MultiBank's
work with low- and moderate-income census tracts, said Andrew
Gordon, president of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Univision's Myrna Sonora said her television company is building
its new station in south Phoenix not just because the community it
represents is there, but because it will have ready access to a
labor pool. She urged Clinton to focus on training and education
programs ``so the people who live around us get to work around
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also brought along national executives from the Safeway
grocery chain and Enron, a Houston energy company.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway's Steve Burd said the company built a new store at 16th
Street and Southern Avenue in Phoenix because ``there is plenty of
business to be had'' in the neighborhood. The chain has found in
other cities that customers feel safe if the stores include a
police substation, which will be added to the Phoenix store within
months, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Enron has started a investment company that has $50 million
earmarked to provide equity capital to new businesses, Gene
Humphrey said.
</P>
<P>
   SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez drew applause when she told
Clinton that the Hispanic community has a saying, ````Si, se
peude,'''' or ``Yes, we can.'' She said her agency is working on
the programs that will bring venture capital to small businesses
that will become future success stories.
</P>
<P>
   Bob McGee of Southwest Business Financing Corp., which, along
with M&AMP;I Thunderbird Bank and SBA guarantees, financed La Canasta's
new factory, said there is a great need for venture-type funding
here.
</P>
<P>
   The main difficulty could come if entrepreneurs have to give up
too much control of their companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the crowd that all one had to do was drive around
south Phoenix to see that not every American has been blessed by
the recent economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what we're doing is going around the country to say, `We
can do better,' that, morally, now that we're doing so well, we
have an obligation to give every American who's willing to work for
it a chance to walk across that bridge into the 21st century with
us when we go forward together, leaving no one behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And not only that, it's good economics.'' &QL;

CHINA HAS ALL THE TOOLS TO UPEND AMERICANS IN WORLD CUP FINAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was quite intentional that the coach and star
players of China's Women's World Cup team did not make it to a very
formal news conference Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Wen, the 26-year-old striker whose seven goals make her the
World Cup's leading scorer (along with Brazil's Sissi), was back at
camp. So was acrobatic goalkeeper Goa Hong, who has allowed just
two goals in five matches.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, coach Ma Yuanan already had made it clear that his
speedy and highly technical team understood what it faces Saturday,
when China plays the U.S. in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Ma told reporters earlier this week that China accepts ``the
responsibility to move the game to a higher level against the
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday, instead of taking time away from training, the
Chinese sent another team official to Century Park Hotel to make
nice with the world press _ a gathering that has grown rapidly and
monstrously, infatuated with this incredible, expanding women's
sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an honor to be in the final of the World Cup,'' Yan
Zhongjian said through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   No translator was needed, however, to interpret his confident
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are well prepared for the final. That is also why the head
coach is absent,'' Yan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese feel they have yet to win anything so far, which
makes them supremely hungry for this World Cup finale.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, well, you have to wonder just a bit.
</P>
<P>
   They have already won something extremely important, which is
why coach Tony DiCicco said Wednesday they are relaxed and happy,
less tense and no longer suffering anything resembling performance
anxiety _ things that may have been issues during their tough
quarterfinal match against Germany and again against Brazil in the
nerve-wracking semis.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. and its coaching staff already have pulled off one of
the great sales coups in the history of sports. They have sold a
nation on a women's event that has racked up viewership the likes
of which pro hockey would die for.
</P>
<P>
   We already know that 2.9 million watched on TV as the U.S. beat
Brazil in the semifinals in Palo Alto, Calif., on the Fourth of
July. We already know that 79,123 were at Stanford Stadium and that
a sellout of close to 90,000 is guaranteed at the Rose Bowl
Saturday for the 1:50 p.m. kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   But what we're less sure about is the ability of the U.S. to
tackle this next and last obstacle, China, to say nothing of the
heavy expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the best two teams in this World Cup have
made it to the championship round. However, there may be a twist.
</P>
<P>
   Out from under the massive red, white and blue brush strokes of
this tournament, many World Cup observers have begun to realize
that the Chinese are not only one of the best two teams left
standing, they are quite possibly the favorite to win.
</P>
<P>
   That is why this steamroller of a sporting event called the
Women's World Cup ought to come with a warning label, especially
for those who think the U.S. booters are a shoo-in to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   May we suggest ``Buyer beware.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the hype and all the determination to reclaim the World
Cup crown _ the U.S. women won the inaugural tournament in 1991 but
lost in the semis of the last Cup, in 1995 _ this could be a lot
more difficult than called for in the All-America Hollywood script.
</P>
<P>
   After being trampled 5-0 by China in the semifinals, Norway
coach Jarl Torske was hard-pressed to hide his appreciation for the
Chinese attack. He said Wednesday the U.S. will be severely tested,
especially defensively, where it is weakest.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the (U.S. women) keep on like they have been so far, they
will definitely run into serious problem in the back line, and they
would probably get goals against them. So they have to be tighter,
and they can't give the Chinese so much space,'' Torske said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe the U.S. takes too many risks, too many chances.
They underestimate maybe their opponents sometimes, instead of
kicking the ball wide. They don't seem concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because the U.S. women have been offensively superior
for the first decade of elite international soccer competition,
defense has been a secondary consideration. There has always been
Michelle Akers or Mia Hamm or Kristine Lilly or Tiffeny Milbrett to
counterattack with fury.
</P>
<P>
   But now, at the moment for which this wildly likable and highly
skilled U.S. team has worked years, on the largest stage ever for
women's sports, the American players face an opponent that is truly
their competitive equal.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk about it being a showcase game, I guess it
encompasses everything. But I'm a coach, so I'm just talking about
what you're going to see on the field,'' DiCicco said Wednesday,
still promoting the event as much as championing his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see two teams that are fit, that are ready,
that are going to go out to win this game, they're not going to
hold anything back, and they're going to play attractive soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be attractive soccer, but it will also be for blood.
That's why this World Cup finale should come with a buyer-beware
warning.
</P>
<P>
   At the very pinnacle of this history-making, rolling-stone
sporting spectacle, a serious game could break out.

SOUNDS OF SILENCE FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER -- The Dodgers' clubhouse is empty and quiet after games.
Not many players around, not much to say.
</P>
<P>
   This is what it's like when a team with such lofty aspirations
and expectations crashes and burns. There are loads of questions
and no answers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers lost again. This is nothing new. They've been losing
for the better part of a month. The way it's been, it's not a
matter of winning or losing, but how the loss will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, it came via a three-run opposite field homer from
Vinny Castilla to break a tie in the seventh inning and lift the
Rockies to a 7-5 win at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game the Dodgers led 4-1, but the usually reliable
bullpen faltered when Jamie Arnold (2-2) got beat with his third
best pitch _ a hangin' slider.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make better pitches than that,'' said Arnold, who
allowed four runs in two innings. ``The team is struggling right
now, and I'm hangin' sliders. We had an opportunity to win, and I
let them down.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't so much the homer as the pitch that became the homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just inexperienced, and he got beat with his third-best
pitch,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``It was a hangin'
slider, and that's what got me. It's probably the third time he's
done it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of a turnaround before every game from the
Dodgers. Then they do just enough to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen's been fantastic most of the season, going 4-3 with
a 2.57 ERA in the last 37 games. But it was the pen that couldn't
protect Carlos Perez's 4-3 lead after five innings. You kind of get
the idea if Perez left trailing by a run, the bullpen would have
been superb but the offense would have lacked the one huge hit.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a way to lose, the Dodgers have it covered. They are
35-47. They say the season isn't over. Everyone else says it is.
The Dodgers are a Chan Ho Park blow-up away from getting swept by
the Rockies. That aside, the Dodgers have lost three straight, nine
of 10, and 24 of 33. Oh, heck, they've lost 47 of 82 and are last
in the National League with a .259 batting average.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not playing like a championship club, obviously, but I
still keep thinking we'll be a good offensive club,'' Johnson said.
``We keep misfiring.''
</P>
<P>
   The hitters are pressing, gripping the bats so hard they
seemingly turn to ash. The pressure to perform has been there since
opening day, which Johnson said should have helped instead of
hindered.
</P>
<P>
   ``That should be more of a stimulant,'' Johnson said. ``People
think you're good, get in there and have a quality at-bat. That's
what we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most damning statistic is this: The Dodgers haven't
won more than two games in a row for more than two months. What
reason is there to believe they're capable of putting together a
bigger streak?
</P>
<P>
   ``The table is set for a dramatic comeback,'' said Trenidad
Hubbard, who started in right field and had two hits and threw a
runner out at home. ``Rehearsal is over. It's time for the big
show. If Tony Gwynn is 0 for 4 in a game and comes up for a fifth
at-bat, he's not dwelling on the other four.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers built a lead with their battery. Rookie Angel Pena's
three-run homer, the first of his career, gave them a 3-1 lead in
the fourth. Perez followed with his fourth career homer, marking
the second time the Dodgers have hit back-to-back homers. (The
other came April 7, when Raul Mondesi and Todd Hundley did it.)
</P>
<P>
   The cushion lasted two outs. Kurt Abbott hit a two-run homer to
right-center to pull the Rockies with 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold gave up the tying run in the sixth on a double-play
ground out. The Dodgers had runners on first and second in the
seventh, but Eric Karros grounded into an inning-ending double
play. A few minutes later, Castilla hit Arnold's first pitch over
the fence in right-center for a 7-4 lead.

   LOS ANGELES -- The U.S. National team tried its best to have a
closed training session at Pomona-Pitzer College, Wednesday, but
nothing stopped the camera crews, media and several fans from
stopping by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was it closed?'' said a surprised Cindy Parlow. ``I don't
think so, there were a lot of people there.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of having a closed session was so the U.S. could
prepare tactically for China, their opponent in Saturday's Women's
World Cup final at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly in the two games we lost to China (in the past year)
they had two breakaways for the two winning goals,'' said U.S.
coach Tony DiCicco. ``We had to work on how to to eliminate the
space in front of our defense, but also protect the space behind
the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a good job of that in the World Cup so far. We've
cut down on clear breakaways that the Chinese used to expose us
since the 1996 Olympics. We also worked on our traps. If you are
going to trap the Chinese you have to be very organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm struggling? That was a question posed to DiCicco
because Hamm failed to score in both the quarterfinal and semifinal
victories. She has scored two goals in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won both games with her not scoring and that's a good
thing,'' said DiCicco. ``We all know that when she doesn't score
there's usually one not far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``But having said that, we don't define Mia as just a goal
scorer. With some players you do. Some just sit up there and don't
do a lot of work. Giorgio Chinaglia (former New York Cosmos
standout) comes to mind. He was very talented but he just sat up
there. If he scored he did his job. If he didn't he didn't do his
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Mia has so many more dimensions to her game. She got us
the penalty kick (against Brazil) the other day. And defensively
she does a lot too, helping everyone else out.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'll tell you, she's excited about this game and she wants
to make a statement in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have asked DiCicco what the popularity of the women's
national team says to naysayers who didn't feel they could pull off
this huge event.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure there are people dismayed by the success of this
event,'' he said. ``Now they've got to compete with girls playing
sports. No matter how we look at it, we're still in the attitude
changing business. We're more advanced here in the United States
but all over the world we're in the attitude changing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some people that are not happy about what's
transpired here the last few weeks, but they won't be able to come
out and publicly announce that. They will just wait for their turn
to squash soccer or put down women's athletic's at some point in
the future. But what's happened is in motion. Of course it will
slow down, but it's not going to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with many of the U.S. National team's families in town,
captain Carla Overbeck asked if the team would have dinner
together. In another example of the team's closeness, the vote was
unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been having three meals a day in hotels so we all wanted
to get together and go out and have a dinner together,'' said
Parlow. ``We wanted to be away from everyone. Away from the press
and people to have a dinner for ourselves and have a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what's special about this team and why people are
getting behind us. We just love going out together, taking pictures
and having a good time.''

GRIFFEY M'S ONLY ALL-STAR; RODRIGUEZ SEEKS MOTIVATION IN SNUB 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Only one Mariner was honored Wednesday, and it
wasn't with an All-Star selection.
</P>
<P>
   Like the rest of his teammates, left-hander Jamie Moyer was
bypassed for a spot on the American League All-Star team when
reserves were announced Wednesday. For Moyer, that meant he will
start for the Mariners when they open Safeco Field on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   For shortstop Alex Rodriguez, it meant that for the first time
in his four full seasons, he will not take part in the midsummer
classic, to be held next Tuesday at Fenway Park in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' Rodriguez said. ``But maybe it will give
me motivation to prove to guys like Joe Torre that I can play.''
</P>
<P>
   As manager of the World Series champion New York Yankees, Torre
selected the All-Star reserves, with input from AL president Gene
Budig. Two shortstops, the Yankees' Derek Jeter and the Cleveland
Indians' Omar Vizquel, were chosen to back up starter Nomar
Garciaparra of the Boston Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said Wednesday that he considered Rodriguez, adding that
Rodriguez's numbers were impressive even though he missed 32 games
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's disappointment was understandable. When reserves
were named, he was batting .322 with 17 homers, 47 runs batted in,
59 runs scored and a .400 on-base percentage. With five errors, he
had a better fielding percentage than the Gold Glove-winning
Vizquel, .980 to .975, and all of the offensive numbers are better
except batting average (Vizquel was hitting .333).
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing to point out is that he has comparable
numbers (to other All-Stars) and he did miss six weeks,'' said
catcher Dan Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who has no errors and was batting .286 before Wednesday
night's game, was another Mariner whose numbers matched up well
with a player picked instead. Detroit's Brad Ausmus, the AL reserve
catcher, has a lower batting average (.274) and two errors, though
he does have 12 more RBIs than Wilson. Ausmus is the Tigers' lone
representative. Every team must be represented on the 28-man
roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be 35-40 spots,'' said starting outfielder Ken
Griffey Jr., who is the only Mariner going to Boston. ``It's an
All-Star Game. It's not about making it fair, because it's not.
Guys deserve to go, and they should expand the roster. It's one
day. Who cares if you take 40 guys? ... It would give a chance for
guys that deserve to go, to go.''
</P>
<P>
   With 28 spots and 14 teams, picking the roster is not an easy
job. When Mariners manager Lou Piniella piloted the National League
team as the Cincinnati Reds manager in 1991, he asked league
president Bill White pick the roster. White did, leaving just one
spot for Piniella, who gave it to his right fielder, Paul O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Piniella was disappointed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping we'd have two or three,'' Piniella said. ``I
thought that Jamie certainly warranted (a spot), (Freddy) Garcia is
a rookie and he's won nine ballgames, Dan Wilson _ outside of
(Ivan) Rodriguez, no other catcher is having an outstanding season.
Alex was hurt six weeks, and he's hitting over .300 with 17 home
runs and 50 RBIs or so. That's nothing to snub at.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time since 1991 that only one Mariner will go
to the All-Star Game. In 1996 and '97, the M's sent five; this
time, there are more ex-Mariners (Mike Hampton, Randy Johnson and
Vizquel) than current Mariners on the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer was surprised Garcia was passed over, though Garcia's ERA
(5.04) is almost a run higher than the highest on the AL staff.
Griffey was also surprised _ and feeling a little lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always fun to have your teammates to go with you,'' he
said. ``It's not too much fun to make flights by yourself. Now I've
got to hang out with Cleveland _ they've got their whole team
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Sr. will be on hand, at least, and Griffey joked
that he'd like to bring along an injured teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bring Jay so he can throw me BP,'' Griffey said. ``I'll
have my own BP thrower for the home run contest that I'm still
waiting to be asked to.''
</P>
<P>
   ROTATION SET: The decision to start Moyer at the Safeco opener
was easy, Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had been in the All-Star Game, it would have been
necessary to change the rotation,'' Piniella said. ``But right now,
Jamie is certainly very deserving of that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be exciting whether I start or not,'' Moyer
said. ``I'll just try to approach it like another day, not get
caught up in anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Jeff Fassero will follow Moyer and start Friday,
followed by lefty John Halama and right-handers Freddy Garcia and
Gil Meche. Piniella grouped the three lefties together because the
San Diego Padres have struggled against left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   By starting Sunday, Garcia could end up facing the pitcher whose
trade brought him to Seattle, the Arizona Diamondbacks' Randy
Johnson. Johnson likely will pitch Sunday if he works in the
All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   TRADE TALK: It's not just the small-market teams that may be
looking to move quality starting pitching before the July 31
trading deadline. Reports from New York indicate the Yankees could
try to trade left-hander Andy Pettitte, and he could interest the
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is trying to upgrade its pitching for the stretch run.
Woody Woodward, M's vice president for baseball operations, has not
been given permission to raise his club's payroll, but has
indicated that if he feels strongly about a player, he can take the
case to management. Pettitte is making $5.95 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   He stands to make up as much as $2 million more next season in
arbitration, even though he has struggled. The former 21-game
winner is 9-14 with a 5.56 ERA since last July 14. The Yankees, who
have a wealth of starting pitching talent, would like to improve in
left field and in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners did make one trade Wednesday, sending shortstop
Domingo Cedeno to the Philadelphia Phillies for Class AAA infielder
Jose Flores.

TURF WAR FOR USC, NFL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Whether Eli Broad or Michael Ovitz eventually
brings professional football back to Los Angeles, one undeniable
winner would seem to be USC.
</P>
<P>
   Without spending a dime, the Trojans will enjoy playing in a
completely renovated, state-of-the-art Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my judgment, it would be appropriate to rebuild the
Coliseum,'' USC president Steven Sample said. ``We'd be very
supportive.''
</P>
<P>
   But beneath the official statements of support for bringing an
NFL team to Los Angeles, there are reservations that what's good
for the Coliseum isn't necessarily good for USC.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans might inherit a sparkling facility, but at what
cost?
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial side is a grave concern for us,'' said a USC
official who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
   Already, internal estimates speculate USC could lose between
$3-4 million a year if the NFL returns to the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   That's a significant amount of money _ enough to sway whether
USC's athletic department has a profitable year or loses money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd probably just as soon not see the NFL move here,'' said
another USC administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Talk like that might make a football fan seethe, but it's simple
economics that foster such opinions. Whoever owns the NFL franchise
will undoubtedly lock up all parking, concession and corporate
suite revenues, along with advertising and signage rights.
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly what Disney did when the Mighty Ducks moved into
the Pond in Anaheim, making it nearly impossible for the arena to
lure an NBA franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Those aren't the only probable lost sources of income. There is
also an expected decrease in ticket revenue if the new Coliseum is
unable to expand to 92,000 for the UCLA and Notre Dame games.
</P>
<P>
   That's enough to dampen the university's enthusiasm for the
flashy drawings and models that Ovitz and Broad have unveiled to
the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these potential obstacles, Sample is steadfast that USC
will not lose money if the Coliseum undergoes a massive renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would want a better agreement,'' he said. ``I think it's
probable and absolutely necessary. It has to be (a superior) deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be better for USC financially than the program could
have expected without rebuilding the Coliseum.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are strong words, but even Sample can't guarantee that USC
will indeed secure a better deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's legitimate to be concerned about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to prevent a financial disaster, a four-member
committee of the university's board of trustees, led by John Argue,
has begun working on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Argue, who helped bring the 1984 Olympics to Los Angeles, said
he has met or talked to Broad, Ovitz and Edward Roski, who is one
of Broad's partners and the man many credit for getting the
Coliseum this far into the NFL's selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Ed Roski and Eli Broad have told me in writing the
situation would be better for USC in a new Coliseum,'' Argue said.
``That's pretty strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general concept is they'll see to it one way or another
that 'SC will come out ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Argue said it is too early to place a dollar figure on the
amount of money USC would need to offset potential losses.
</P>
<P>
   But according to sources, the NFL, or the new franchise's
owners, would need to compensate USC as much as $4 million per
year.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is the NFL has distanced itself from Roski and
relied more on Broad and Ovitz, meaning USC might have to start
over, since the majority of discussions have been with Roski.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a fear,'' USC athletic director Mike Garrett said.
``We're always trying to talk to the relative powers to make them
aware of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But USC might also have some bargaining leverage with whomever
owns the new NFL team. A revamped Coliseum almost certainly will
not work unless the university opens its parking facilities on game
days.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL's plan involves tearing down the Sports Arena and
building 25,000 parking spaces in Exposition Park, an idea that is
considered financially impossible.
</P>
<P>
   There's already been some backing away from that idea, as
Broad's plan envisions relying on USC to ease the parking crunch.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible ally in USC's eyes is the Coliseum Commission.
Sample and Garrett believe USC's loyalty to the Coliseum and Sports
Arena will be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bargaining power is that we've been here for a long
time,'' Garrett said. ``NFL clubs have left and we've stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   That opinion is backed up by Pat Lynch, general manager of the
Coliseum and Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the Coliseum Commission's original agreement with
Roski ensured USC would be dealt with ``fairly and properly.'' That
agreement is no longer in place, but Lynch said he doesn't foresee
USC losing money in a new Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have USC's interests first and foremost in our minds,''
Lynch said. ``We would make sure in our agreement USC would have a
proper seat at the table. Until someone cuts a deal, we don't know
if the concerns are real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe those concerns materialize or maybe they don't. 'SC has
certain revenue they need to generate.''
</P>
<P>
   The skeptics _ including those within USC _ are taking a
wait-and-see attitude before proclaiming that USC's predicament
will be properly addressed.
</P>
<P>
   They worry that since USC has no other legitimate alternatives
for a football venue, the NFL might ignore the school's concerns.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL scenario collapses, even Sample will be content to
see things remain as they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a college football stadium, the Coliseum is in good
shape,'' Sample said. ``From USC's perspective, it works fine for
us.''

USC ARENA HAS SUPPORT, NOT FUNDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the announcement came in February that USC's board of
trustees had decided to support the idea to raise funds for an
on-campus arena, the reaction was overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Boosters, alumni and basketball fans seemed to think USC was
finally going to build an on-campus arena.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't quite that simple. Yes, the trustees agreed to let
the athletic department begin raising funds for the arena, but that
was hardly an indication that ground would ever be broken for a new
facility.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, USC president Steven Sample was taken aback by
the perception an arena was about to be constructed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people had the idea the trustees had a big pot of
money and they would just write a check,'' Sample said. ``It
doesn't work that way.''
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly did the board of trustees' decision provide?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we have this endorsement,'' Sample said. ``Remember, when
you get the endorsement, you then have to raise the money.''
</P>
<P>
   That means raising anywhere from $50 million-$75 million for a
12,000-seat arena that would house the men's and women's basketball
and men's and women's volleyball teams.
</P>
<P>
   Time may be the critical factor for USC.
</P>
<P>
   If the NFL awards an expansion franchise to Los Angeles, the
Sports Arena could be torn down to provide extra parking for the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   That could leave USC without a basketball facility, although it
would probably end up moving to the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever come to the point where we'll have to
go to the Forum,'' athletic director Mike Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case, the issue is already being evaluated by USC and
Sports Arena management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably will be torn down,'' said Pat Lynch, general
manager of the Sports Arena and Coliseum. ``We need more parking.
And the Sports Arena loses money. But a lot of people on the
Coliseum Commission are sympathetic to USC's needs, even at the
expense of parking.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said it would be a minimum of two years before the Sports
Arena was demolished, and it would probably be delayed if USC was
constructing its own arena and needed a place to play its home
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sports Arena will not come down until 'SC has alternative
arrangements,'' said John Argue, a member of the university's board
of trustees, who is negotiating with the NFL on USC's concerns over
possible changes to Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   Already, a member of the board of trustees has been wooed for a
$25 million donation that would include naming rights to the arena.
Overall, more than $12 million has already been secured for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a long way to go before anyone watches USC play in a
new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Whether USC is capable of raising the massive amounts needed is
a legitimate concern. The largest single donation ever given to the
athletic department is just $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   USC is several million away from funding a proposed $4.7 million
track stadium that was announced last year, and is already well
over its original budget projections. Similar problems could be
massive on a project the size of an arena.
</P>
<P>
   Progress on the arena could come slowly. In August, the
trustees' business affairs committee is expected to select a site
for the arena. After that, the finance committee must recommend
that funds be available for design renderings and pre-construction
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this project is very real,'' said Dennis Dougherty,
USC's senior vice president of administration. ``It's going forward
with a lot of enthusiasm from our trustees.''
</P>
<P>
   But some skeptics believe the university's bureaucracy could
weigh it down. According to sources, there is already discussion of
adding a university conference center to the facility.
</P>
<P>
   And Sample carefully chooses to call it a ``campus events
center'' instead of ``arena,'' so it's not tied to athletics.
</P>
<P>
   That scares some critics within the university, who argue that
Sample needs to be more enthusiastic toward raising funds for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   They wonder if he has the same zeal to secure donations for an
arena as he had for the $100 million gift he got from biomedical
entrepreneur Alfred Mann, or the $35 million he received from
businessman Gordon Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never really participated in any other athletic department
project,'' said an official who asked not be identified. ``History
tells us it is unlikely he would be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Sample said his dedication toward the arena project is
unquestionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I been actively engaged? The answer is yes,'' Sample
said. ``Will I be actively engaged in the next couple of years? The
answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sample believes the point man on raising funds is Garrett,
who confidently says he will spend the next 18 months raising money
for the arena, and construction will be completed by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to get after it and get it done. If I'm wrong, I'm
wrong,'' Garrett said. ``I'll just keep getting after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Other administrators say the arena will probably require three
years of fund-raising, with a more likely opening in 2004 or 2005.

TROJANS TO JOIN BRUINS?

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _With Los Angeles likely to receive an NFL team and
Coliseum renovations expected to last at least two years, USC has
begun preliminary discussions with the Rose Bowl about playing
there in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are interested in having USC play in the Rose Bowl,'' said
Darryl Dunn, general manager of the Rose Bowl. ``I would hope it is
in the next 30 days that we begin discussions. We're anxious to
begin discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the very near future, we expect the process to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   If USC moved to the Rose Bowl, it would present a minor
scheduling problem. At least three games would conflict with UCLA's
home schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Trojans athletic director Mike Garrett said it's almost certain
USC will play some Thursday night games to prevent a scheduling
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential hurdle is the Arroyo Seco ordinance, which
limits the Rose Bowl to 15 major events per year, including UCLA
football, Galaxy soccer games and the New Year's Day bowl game.
Dunn said he did not anticipate a problem revising the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a good fit. It would generate a lot of revenue for
the city,'' Dunn said. ``There are an awful lot of USC alumni in
Pasadena.'' &QL;

COMIC STRIP'S FANS COME OUT IN DROVES AFTER CREATOR CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A funny thing happened to Aaron McGruder on his way to
being fried in the forum.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of continuing to scorch him with insults, the public has
begun showering him with praise for creating ``The Boondocks,'' a
brash, controversial, black-oriented comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clever and multilayered,'' weighs in one Seattle newspaper
reader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaks the truth,'' praises another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thought-provoking ... makes me laugh,'' exhorts a fan.
</P>
<P>
   Plus _ his groupies point out _ McGruder is darn tootin' cute.
</P>
<P>
   So what's not to like?
</P>
<P>
   Well, plenty _ or so you would have thought from early reaction
to the strip.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, after the Seattle Post-Intelligencer and dozens of
other newspapers across the country started carrying McGruder's
provocative comic, it appeared he might have sketched himself into
a very tight corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boondocks'' brings a spicy cast of characters to the
nation's vanilla funny pages by presenting the lives of four
urbanly hip kids who speak the language of hip-hop and live in a
Wonder Bread suburb.
</P>
<P>
   There's Huey Freeman, the black nationalist with a heart of
gold; Riley, Huey's younger brother, who projects a gangsta air;
their buddy Caesar, who totes a microphone; and Jazmine, a biracial
neighbor confused about her racial identity.
</P>
<P>
   They inhabit a strip that hits hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent installment, Huey, named for former Black Panther
Huey P. Newton, makes random stops of white motorists as part of
``Operation Klanwatch.'' In another strip, Riley knocks down a
white girl with a toy lightsaber and huffs: ``See?! You're still
alive! This thing is worthless!''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the ``Boon-lash'' to register with a
vocal minority of Seattle readers. Thirty-one of 33 readers who
blitzed this paper's reader representative phone line blasted the
strip for being ``racist,'' ``indulgent'' and ``not very funny.''
And many of those readers especially hated the lightsaber strip,
which they said encouraged violence among young people.
</P>
<P>
   After the Post-Intelligencer published some of those concerns in
a lengthy story about McGruder on June 28, supporters of the strip
emerged in droves.
</P>
<P>
   More than 130 people contacted the Post-Intelligencer, using
phone calls, e-mail and snail-mail letters. A majority of them _
roughly 80 percent _ wanted to keep the ``The Boondocks'' around,
citing its timely social commentary, panache and
Japanese-influenced art style.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a breath of fresh perspective and relevant commentary on
race relations in America today,'' writes Dennis MacCoumber of
Seattle, who adds, ``McGruder gives us old dudes who have no
contact with young blacks some hint of what another culture may be
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacy Vennema of Bellingham writes: ``Boondocks is, in my
opinion, equal-opportunity satire, exposing attitudes and
assumptions of both white and black characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Barnes says: ``McGruder strikes a nerve because he is
putting racial satire in a comic setting where most (people) expect
non-confrontational humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of confrontation, Sally Wolff of Coupeville saw no
racial animosity in the lightsaber strip.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it the way the cartoonist intended _ a boy who was
disappointed that his lightsaber didn't work like the ones in the
`Phantom Menace' movie,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some black readers said critics of the strip may be
unaccustomed to or uncomfortable with artistic depictions of young,
intelligent blacks who call it like they see it. Many callers said
McGruder deftly skewers those liberals who believe the race
question is passe.
</P>
<P>
   His support crosses party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the liberals don't have a sense of humor. What else is
new,'' huffs Dave Cavanaugh in an e-mail message. ``Just for the
record, I'm a 46-year-old white, Goldwater conservative, and I
think `Boondocks' is one of the better strips around.''
</P>
<P>
   For several readers the bottom line was this: Keep ``The
Boondocks'' or lose a subscriber. (Post-Intelligencer managing
editor Ken Bunting said he is ``watching carefully'' as the strip's
story line develops.)
</P>
<P>
   Seattle resident Meri Tahset, who had been getting the strip
e-mailed to her by friends, said she would subscribe to the paper
just for ``The Boondocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Tahset, who is black and grew up in Detroit, said McGruder's
insights humorously speak to challenges she faces living in a
predominantly white city. Racial intolerance, she says, boils below
the surface in Seattle, a liberal pocket in a state that recently
passed an anti-affirmative action initiative. ```The Boondocks' has
me feeling like I can last here,'' she says, adding ``I just hope
Aaron doesn't get watered down.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, McGruder has received praise and criticism
in cities where his strip runs, including Atlanta, Chicago and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   More than 180 newspapers carry his strip, a remarkable
accomplishment for a man who just turned 25 and lives at home with
his mother and father in suburban Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   To date, three newspapers have dropped the strip and moved out
of ``The Boondocks'': The Greenville News and The Aiken Standard,
both in South Carolina, and The Independent in Massillon, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hunter, publisher of The Aiken Standard, which has a daily
circulation of 14,000, said ``The Boondocks'' was ``not working''
in his community 50 miles southwest of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't funny,'' said Hunter, who had ordered up
advance editions of the strip, only to discover that his funny bone
was untickled. ``Maybe it would go over well in much larger
cities.''
</P>
<P>
   In Southern California, where ``The Boondocks'' appears in the
Los Angeles Times, that paper reported nearly 100 complaints
shortly after the strip's debut.
</P>
<P>
   But after the paper published a feature story on McGruder, his
fans started popping up. To date, the paper has received more than
500 responses, split roughly down the middle between his supporters
and detractors, said Narda Zacchino, the paper's associate editor
and reader representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most significant contribution by (McGruder) is that people
are talking about race issues as a result of his strip,'' said
Zacchino.
</P>
<P>
   Kathie Kerr, spokeswoman for Universal Press Syndicate, which
distributes ``The Boondocks,'' says: ``The increased awareness can
only help newspapers increase the number of people who pick up the
papers.''
</P>
<P>
   McGruder is keeping his cool amid all the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he was featured in Time and Newsweek. Earlier this
week, he was on a C-Span program, where he had phones ringing off
the hook as a result of his latest strip tease that posed the
question of what is offensive.
</P>
<P>
   In the July 4 strip, McGruder took a joking poke at critics who
call his strip racist. He wrote that ``The Boondocks'' was being
replaced by a new strip that readers might find ``more suitable for
the comic pages.''
</P>
<P>
   The mock replacement featured Jar Jar Binks, the alien from
director George Lucas' summer hit ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace.'' Lucas' character, which looks like a Rastafarian
version of Joe Camel and speaks with a vaguely Caribbean syntax,
has drawn fire in the media for acting and sounding like a Stepin
Fetchit black caricature.
</P>
<P>
   McGruder left nothing to chance, giving Jar Jar the full
Buckwheat treatment: ``Jar Jar sho' nuff likes to shuffle! Ya see,
chilluns, Jar Jar besa good alien. Hesa no want no trouble. ...
O-TAY!''
</P>
<P>
   Says McGruder, with a chuckle: ``Jar Jar fans are upset? Well,
too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   He does not apologize for stepping on toes to foster intelligent
social and political satire with black themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do a black strip,'' he recently explained. ``I think white
people who want to buy into black culture would rather buy into
something that's authentic rather than something that is watered
down for their sake.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking this week from his hotel room in Seattle, where he is
attending the UNITY '99 conference for minority journalists, he
said he has much on his plate.
</P>
<P>
   After his picture appeared in national magazines, he was
approached by a ``major'' network to act in an upcoming TV pilot.
(He's weighing the offer.) He already has an animated version of
``The Boondocks'' in the works with movie director Reginald Hudlin.
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's glad to be in Seattle, away from heat _ including
the weather kind. ``He called me as soon as he arrived out there in
Seattle,'' McGruder's mother said from the family home in Maryland,
where there has been a heat wave. ``He said, `Mom, it's so
beautiful out here. It's not so hot.'''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
JOSE Lima watches from the top step of the dugout and begs for
rallies with his cap sitting on his head like some sort of
upside-down rudder.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he walks around the cage at batting practice wearing
his glove as a cap, looking something like a Dominican Darth Vader.
Sometimes, he screams into his glove. We'll worry if the glove ever
starts talking back.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, he points his finger at the batter's box and shoots a
couple of imaginary rounds at his latest strikeout victim. He
slide-steps off the mound and jiggles from head to toe. He dances
all by himself in the clubhouse, even when there's no music
playing.
</P>
<P>
   He stands out. And, sure, it takes some getting used to.
</P>
<P>
   When Lima first had a measure of success for the Astros a couple
of years ago, one Astros veteran tried to put Lima in his place by
asking if a gag banner emblazoned with Lima's number could be
raised to the rafters next to Nolan Ryan's.
</P>
<P>
   The request was denied, but eventually the Astros all began
realizing what the rest of the league knows now: Sometimes the
biggest deals are the smallest ones.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Lima is on his way to Chowder Town, surely poised to turn
it all into his own luscious bowl of spicy menudo. And the big deal
about it all is that it started with no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   When Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker pulled the trigger
on the first major trade of his tenure here in 1996, all he really
wanted was Brad Ausmus. He also got Daryle Ward, C.J. Nitkowski,
Trever Miller and Lima from Detroit in exchange for Doug Brocail,
Brian Hunter, Todd Jones and Orlando Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that with the other three major acquisitions Hunsicker
has made for the Astros. He got Moises Alou, which certainly was a
good trade. He traded for Randy Johnson, which didn't work out as
hoped. And he signed Ken Caminiti to a free-agent contract, making
everyone bustle about, but no one more than Astros trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Then think about the trade that nearly was _ the one for Roger
Clemens last spring, which might have cost the club Lima or Mike
Hampton, who also was named to the National League All-Star team
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   None of those big names will wear an Astros uniform in the
All-Star Game, while Lima will waltz _ OK, maybe merengue _ into
Boston as one of the hottest pitchers in the league and with a
better record than either Johnson or Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Lima and Hampton _ who was acquired in 1993, before
Hunsicker's arrival _ are the perfect pictures of why winning
baseball is such an imperfect proposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about a trade, on the one hand there's
pressure from the public, from the media and from your own players
to do something big to make something happen,'' Hunsicker said.
``But as a GM you know one trade is not always going to get you
where you want to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's risky to bank on a trade. Most players just aren't
predictable. Fine, there are some that year in and year out you can
bank on. But what about Kevin Brown?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the Dodgers' $100 million man, will watch Tuesday's
All-Star Game like so many others, while Lima dances for the
cameras and Hampton gives the nation the business end of his stare.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker can laugh about it all now, joking Wednesday, ``I knew
all along Jose Lima would be an All-Star,'' because he knows what
never has been more clear than right now.
</P>
<P>
   If it is the little things that build championship runs, then it
is the Lilliputians on this Astros team who are keeping it in the
hunt going into the break despite all the injuries and setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, after winning 102 games and obtaining Johnson,
Hunsicker remembers thinking, ``We have it all.''
</P>
<P>
   But even with Johnson, there was another first-round playoff
exit. Most significant, Johnson's presence on the team was what
prevented Lima from getting a chance to start even one playoff game
against the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Now, without Johnson, without Clemens, with Caminiti and Alou
hurt and Derek Bell struggling, where would the Astros be without
the little deals that brought Lima and all those who followed?
</P>
<P>
   Where would they be without the 1997 trade that brought Carl
Everett from the Mets? Where would they be without Tim Bogar, who
was claimed off waivers in 1997? Where would they be without Bill
Spiers, who seemed like a ho-hum free-agent signee the year before?
</P>
<P>
   ``To win in any given year, there has to be some unexpected
surprises for you,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lima is not alone as a surprise. It has been a mighty
struggle all season for this hobbling team, and surely the Astros'
stars eventually will have to live up to their billing.
</P>
<P>
   But the big deal so far has been the little deals. And no one
has stood out more than Lima, in more ways than one.

SOME CHARMED WHILE OTHERS PROTEST CLINTON VISIT

<P>
   President Clinton swept into Phoenix on Wednesday, stirring up
reactions that were good, bad and ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Some people smiled with pride and were wowed by his style.
Others trashed him and his motorcade. A few entrepreneurs took the
opportu nity to hawk T-shirts and food specials.
</P>
<P>
   On a hot, dusty afternoon, hun dreds of people from around the
Valley _ all ages, all races _ turned out, energized by the appear
ance of the chief executive. They were charmed with straight talk,
thrilled with impromptu hand-shak ing, disappointed at being
ignored, disenchanted by his record in office.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Vasquez, 44, was simply touched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's warm-hearted,'' she said. ``You can tell by his
handshake. He was very warming, very apprecia tive of all of us, no
matter what race or color.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles away, Lynn Zapert held up a sign in silent protest: ``Mr.
Clinton you disgrace my America.''
</P>
<P>
   The day began as early as 10 a.m., when 11-year-old Grant Laten,
of Fountain Hills, showed up at Sky Harbor International Airport
wearing a black T-shirt with an American flag and baseball. He
found the perfect viewing spot on the top level of the Terminal 2
parking garage. Carrying a police scanner and camera, the boy
didn't want to miss out on anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love airplanes, and I just thought it would be kind of a
nice once-in-a-lifetime experience,'' Laten said.
</P>
<P>
   So did Chris Gabrielson, 39, of Phoenix. With his 2-year-old son
Junior in tow, he showed up about 3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times in your life do you get to see a president
close up?'' he said. ``It's like seeing a movie star, almost.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrying an American flag, he lamented the reason for the presi
dential visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's on a poverty tour. It doesn't make us look too good,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Air Force One touched down, about a hundred people
were pressed up against a yellow security tape, craning their necks
for a view of Clinton. Some waved, but the group was mostly
subdued.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Chicanos Por La Causa, at 11th Street and Buckeye, an
enthusiastic crowd greeted the presi dential motorcade with cheers,
ap plause and honking horns. The neighborhood, meanwhile, took on a
carnival-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Budding entrepreneur Becca Lay ton, sold $10 T-shirts reading,
``Welcome President Clinton.'' Lynn Adams, manager of Pete's Fish
and Chips across the street, offered a ``Secret Service Special'' _
a three-piece fish-and-chips dinner with a drink and, of course, a
secret sauce, all for $4.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a secret sauce we've been selling for 52 years,'' Adams
said.
</P>
<P>
   But that wasn't enough to bring in the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   Army 2nd Lt. Chris Gonzales, 20, said Clinton's visit was
important to the Hispanic community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that he showed up here means something,'' he
said. ``Just showing up says a lot more than if he just talks about
Hispanics on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personal life aside, I think he's done a good job. The
econo my's booming.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's more that needs to be done, said Angel Sanchez, 37,
who lives in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope he can clean up the act around here,'' she said.
``There are lots of drugs, lots of prostitutes. Every day something
bad's happen ing in the neighborhood. It's getting worse. It's not
getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Chicanos por la Causa, Clinton wowed business leaders and
others with his straight talk and charisma.
</P>
<P>
   ``He supports the equity capital ization fund for small business
and zeroed right in on the importance of education,'' said Sandra
Espinoza, who with her husband, Perry Monge, owns Perry Monge Salon
in the Mercado.
</P>
<P>
   Monge added, ``It was fantastic. He walked around and met folks,
learned what the CPLC has done for the community. You look at him
and you can't believe he's real. He's very charismatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Garcia, president and chief executive officer of the
organiza tion, said Clinton was ``very per sonable. He listens, and
he has a good grasp of what we're doing here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important now is that we follow through with the state
congressional delegation, the mayor, the banks about what can occur
in this community,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   After the brief visit, Clinton thrilled onlookers as he got out
of his car and waded into the crowd of 100 to 150 people. Over
screams and cheers, Clinton smiled, shook hands and then was
whisked away to his second stop.
</P>
<P>
   At La Canasta, the crowd built to several hundred, and the mood
shifted dramatically _ from upbeat and enthusiastic to impatient
and, at times, hostile.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters carried signs with mes sages criticizing Clinton for
his foreign policy decisions and Monica Lewinsky indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   One threw trash at the presiden tial motorcade. Another held a
sign reading, ``1969 draft dodger. 1999 warmonger.''
</P>
<P>
   Zapert, 52, who accused Clinton of disgracing the country, said,
``I should be home in Peoria, but I'm out here protesting for the
first time ever because of his dishonesty, his insincerity and his
lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame that people are being taken in by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Kellybrew, 32, a mother of five, also took a few shots
at the president. She questioned why Clin ton focused on Hispanics
instead of Blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``How about Black business owners?'' she said. ``We've got
plenty of small Black business that need to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support him because I love him. He's doing a good job, but
there's some issues he needs to attend to.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Torres, 26 and uninsured, made a desperate personal plea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President, I need a kidney transplant. Please help me''
read her placard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just hoping the president will see the sign,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the La Canasta factory, a crowd of about 200
businesspeople fanned themselves and chatted as they awaited
Clinton's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Mariachis kept the crowd enter tained as Port-a-Coolers loudly
tried to pump cool air into the high-ceil inged space, blocked off
from the factory by pallets stacked with sacks of tortillas and
yellow corn.
</P>
<P>
   Many had dressed expecting to swelter. Golf shirts and
sleeveless dresses were more prominent than the die-hards'
white-shirt-and-tie look.
</P>
<P>
   Workers, meanwhile, busied themselves making tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Clinton swept through, squeezing hands, and then
settled in for a quick speech and roundtable discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The motorcade left under a dark blue sky, just before a dust
storm hit.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz Morales, 17, a Carl Hayden High School student, peered
through binoculars out the window of his first-story apartment
hoping for a glimpse of Clinton and his entou rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' he said. ``It's rare that the president
comes here, and maybe he wants to help.'' &QL;

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ONE young superstar fires first, winning golf tournaments
machine-gun style. The other phenom zings back a barrage of his
own, victories mounting up virtually every week.
<TEXT>
<P>
   An old war horse proves the heart of a champion beats beneath
that hokey costume he wears.
</P>
<P>
   A local grinder sheds his label as Mr. Second Place by winning a
$1 million payday.
</P>
<P>
   And a lefty proves it is all right to put golf on the back
burner sometimes.
</P>
<P>
   As these highlights suggest, it already has been a spectacular
year on the PGA Tour. Great stories have unfolded, and grand golf
has been played. Just look at the two marquee players who have
hogged the spotlight the way most people expected them to.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval started the year dominating the way nobody has in
recent years. Now, it is Tiger Woods' turn, threatening to win
every time he has played since mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ``What any player strives to do is be in contention, to always
have a chance,'' Woods says. ``And that's where I've got my game
now. I have a chance almost every week. And I'm very proud of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has been a fabulous year. I look at my stats, and
I'm right up there. I'm very pleased. Extremely pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``My last few events, starting at the (Byron) Nelson, I've gone
seven, one, one, three and one. That's not too bad.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been good enough to push Woods back to the No. 1 world
ranking that he surrendered to Duval at The Players Championship in
late March.
</P>
<P>
   If Duval owned the first three months of the PGA Tour season,
Woods has made the past three his personal domain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you one thing that's more important (than being No.
1), and that's winning,'' he says. ``Being No. 1 in the world and
not winning, like I was doing in all of '98, that's not that great.
I don't like going home and knowing that somebody beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval knows the feeling. He knew it well during January,
February and March, when he won four times in his first eight
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a good year for me,'' he says. ``And there's a lot
of time left to accomplish a great deal more.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval posted golf's most hallowed number _ 59 for 18 holes _ at
the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic, one of his four victories. Woods has
responded with a torrid streak in which he has finished seventh or
better five consecutive weeks with three victories. Their rivalry
is growing, even if we haven't seen them in a head-to-head battle
on Sunday yet.
</P>
<P>
   But there were other riveting moments in the first half of the
PGA Tour season.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart, the knickered one, won his third major when he
needed only three putts on the last three holes at Pinehurst No. 2
for a U.S. Open victory. But as much as Stewart's brilliance was
applauded, it was Phil Mickelson who stole his share of hearts when
he said being at his wife's side for the birth of their first child
would outweigh any situation he could be in during the U.S. Open
week.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson said time and again that he would leave the tournament
regardless of his standing if his wife paged him with news that her
labor had begun.
</P>
<P>
   The golf gods smiled on Mickelson in a different way. They
didn't permit him to win the Open, but they did allow it to end in
regulation. Had Stewart missed his 15-foot putt on the 72nd hole, a
Monday playoff round would have been played. Amy Mickelson went
into labor at the same time her husband and Stewart would have teed
off Monday, and the baby was born just a few hours later. Mickelson
had something far more precious than a U.S. Open trophy in his
arms.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maggert, meanwhile, was rewarded handsomely when he finally
broke through for his first victory in six years. He chipped in a
shot on the 38th hole to win the World Match Play Championship over
Andrew Magee. It wasn't the glamour matchup for which ABC had been
hoping. But it was good golf.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert's sand wedge, by the way, has since been plated with
gold and sent to the World Golf Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it has been a good year for golf. And there's so much more
that remains unanswered.
</P>
<P>
   Will the U.S. be able to win back the Ryder Cup that has been in
European hands for the past five years?
</P>
<P>
   Who will be the 30 players at Champions Golf Club for the Tour
Championship in October? Will it be Duval or Woods taking home
player-of-the-year honors?
</P>
<P>
   Will either win a major this year?
</P>
<P>
   Have we seen the last of Fred Couples and Greg Norman in the
winner's circle?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are questions. And answers will be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   There are 48 official-money events on the PGA Tour this season.
A little more than half of them have been played, and traditionally
the British Open signifies the beginning of the second half of the
tour season. Many of the players already have hauled themselves
over the pond to begin preparations for next week's tournament at
Carnoustie, Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mysteries that will unfold:
</P>
<P>
   Who will make the Ryder moves?
</P>
<P>
   There are six weeks left before the Ryder Cup teams are
finalized. There are a lot of players still looking to earn spots
on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of fellows that are trying very hard,'' U.S.
captain Ben Crenshaw says. ``The last few weeks, it's getting a
little more on their minds. All of the fellows you see from eight,
nine and on down still have to perform the rest of this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the players closing in on a spot on the team is Hal
Sutton. He is sixth on the points list, and one more top-10 finish
probably would clinch a spot for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the points I have are a cinch yet,'' Sutton
says. ``So I need to keep accumulating points to the best of my
ability because I really very much would like to be on the Ryder
Cup team. So every week when I show up, I think about that. And I'd
certainly like to accumulate enough as quickly as possible, so that
I don't have to sweat it out to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum is Duval. He is No. 1 on the
points list, and Crenshaw already has told Duval to get ready
because he is going to be playing every match.
</P>
<P>
   But Duval's mentality isn't necessarily focused on the Ryder
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as the end-all, be-all thing in golf that a lot
of other people seem to view it,'' Duval says. ``I'm not going to
be playing halfway, not trying. I will be ready to go, don't get me
wrong. But I'm not going to be bedridden for a month if we get
beat. It's not going to destroy me or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every intention of giving it my best. So please don't
take what I say the wrong way. I just have heard some European
players remark that it's the biggest event in golf to them. I just
don't see it that way. If I had to choose between a U.S. Open and a
Ryder Cup, I mean, there's not much of a choice for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Two majors down. Two to go.
</P>
<P>
   And neither of the first two was won by Duval or Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I don't win a major, I don't win a major,'' Woods says. ``I
know I've had a very successful year so far. I've won four times.
I'm very pleased with the way I've been playing. To win major
championships, you not only have to put yourself in a good
position, but you have to get lucky. The point is, you've got to
give yourself a chance in each and every major on the back nine on
Sunday with a chance to win. You never know what will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Who will be in Houston in late October for the Tour
Championship?
</P>
<P>
   At the current rate, it appears it will take between $1.2
million and $1.4 million to make the top 30 in money this season,
which qualifies a player for the tournament at Champions Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot of big-name players who would be missing if the
tournament started now.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there are nearly four months of golf left between
now and then. And the way this season is going, it will be four
memorable months.

IF ALL ELSE FAILS, STICK WITH OLSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All he wants is another chance. Another opportunity to make
things right.
</P>
<P>
   But as he sits inside his cubicle at Bank One Ballpark, Gregg
Olson knows last call may have come and gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they're going to do,'' Olson said. ``But I
think I've been pushed. And the next time I get the ball, I'm going
out there with nothing on my mind but destroying as many of the
opposition as I can destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   As crazy and contradictory as the notion sounds, a bit of advice
for the teetering Diamondbacks: If attempts to acquire a legitimate
closer fall by the wayside, wipe the slate clean. Let Olson clear
his mind over the All-Star break. And when the second half begins,
give him what he covets.
</P>
<P>
   One more chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt I can go out and do what I did last year,''
Olson said.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, ignore all the bouquets on the periphery. Forget
the four All-Stars and the cover story in ``USA Today.'' The
Diamondbacks have lost their mojo, and if you're looking for omens,
it rained inside BOB on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Like the bullpen, the roof sprang a serious leak. And just like
the roof, the bullpen can be fixed with one phone call, a fact not
lost on Jerry Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of the NBA draft, Colangelo sat on the side of the
makeshift podium. As he watched his baseball team lose another game
on television, you could almost see the steam coming from his ears.
The anger would dissipate, but the patience has finally expired.
</P>
<P>
   By his directive, the pursuit of a closer has now intensified.
The phone is ringing, and no one's demanding Travis Lee any longer.
The mind-set is focused on making a deal. Now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go back to the NBA Finals in 1976,'' Colangelo said. ``I'm
standing in the Boston Garden. Red Auerbach is being interviewed on
one end of the court and I'm being interviewed on the other end. I
remember thinking that it was only the start, that I'd be at a lot
of these things. Well, it took 17 years to get back. So the moral
of the story is, when you have a chance to win, you go for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo confirmed that the Diamondbacks have targeted
Montreal's Ugueth Urbina and Florida's Matt Mantei, and the
bartering has begun. Urbina is a big-time fireman who would make an
instant impact. Mantei is a grade below, but clearly better than
anyone currently warming up in the D-Backs' bullpen. Either one is
more than welcome in this space.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, the Marlins are uncertain whether to peddle Mantei,
and the Expos are content to take their time, dangle Urbina in the
wind, wait for the best offer. As much as Colangelo wants it to
happen, there is no guarantee anything will get done.
</P>
<P>
   No one comes close
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to closers, the demand far outweighs the supply.
And no matter how bad things may seem, it makes no sense to trade
away the farm without acquiring a proven pitcher, a reliever with a
track record of posting the 27th out.
</P>
<P>
   It's also painfully obvious that the in-house parade of
successors have failed in trying to win the closer's role.
</P>
<P>
   Olson comes off the disabled list today, and says he's
completely healthy. He claims to have found a new trick in the
bullpen, a way to be more effective against right-handed hitters.
And he insists his confidence is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm ever going to lose the mentality,'' Olson
said. ``I don't think I'll ever be afraid to go out there in
pressure situations. So it becomes a matter of stuff, and my stuff
is better than it has been in a number of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have to earn everyone's trust back. But June, July,
August and September is my time of the year. And I'm really looking
forward to getting the ball again.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the best option, but neither is pushing the panic
button. And in a worst-case scenario, they should reinstate Olson.
Even if it's the most unpopular move since Coolergate. &QL;

D-BACKS' BASH  
 5 HOMERS WALLOP ASTROS

<P>
   The Diamondbacks put their home-run shoes back on Wednesday
night and jogged around the bases five times to equal a club record
in a 13-7 victory over the Houston Astros at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona raised its record to 46-39 and climbed to within two
games of San Francisco in the National League West Division after
the Giants lost at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which fell to 47-36, got home runs from ``Killer B's''
Craig Biggio (solo shot in the first inning) and Jeff Bagwell
(three-run blast in the third) off left-hander Brian Anderson to
take a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona then took control with six runs in the third, hitting
three home runs off right-hander Wade Miller, who was making his
major-league debut.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Matt Williams hit a two-run shot, catcher Damian
Miller a three-run blast and shortstop Andy Fox a solo homer to
make the score 7-4.
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Steve Finley capped the team's scoring with a
two-run homer in the sixth and another two-run smash in the
seventh. The homers gave Arizona the league lead with 116.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell, named the starter at second base for the National
League team team in next week's All-Star game in Boston's Fenway
Park, had four hits, including a club-record three doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson struggled for the most part and was followed to the
mound by right-hander Bobby Chouinard, left-hander Greg Swindell
and right-hander Vladimir Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   Chouinard, recalled from Triple-A Tucson for the third time this
season on Saturday, got credit for his second victory.
</P>
<P>
   He also was the winning pitcher in Arizona's 7-6, 16-inning
victory over Los Angeles on April 13. &QL;

JOHNSON CONFIDENT WINS TO COME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strikeouts are a bonus. But give Diamondbacks pitcher Randy
Johnson wins. That's what drives the left-hander.
</P>
<P>
   He knows they'll come again, even if it means topping what he's
done in his last three starts.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out 43, gave up a total of 16 hits and four runs, and
lost all three complete-game efforts with a total of three hits and
zero runs for support.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Wednesday he is not frustrated by his efforts and
isn't critical of an offense that lately has disappeared when he
takes the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be fine,'' said Johnson, who, despite the three
recent tough-luck losses, was chosen by Manager Bruce Bochy of the
San Diego Padres as one of the National League pitchers for
Tuesday's All-Star Game in Boston. ``The offense carried us and now
the pitching needs to step up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it means pitching better than what I have been, then pitch
better than what you have. It's as simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was short with the media after his last start, a 1-0
loss to St. Louis on Monday. He walked away after fielding four
questions.
</P>
<P>
   But he said, after throwing more than 130 pitches in the searing
St. Louis afternoon heat and humidity, his legs were cramping and
he was feeling more fatigued than frustrated by the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to give my time, win or lose,'' Johnson said. ``The
reason I didn't give enough of my time was because I was beat, I
was tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``To sit there for a half an hour and go right to the training
room after that and lay down . . . The reason I'm saying that is
because some reporters didn't understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 35, said he understands how baseball goes in cycles and
he can't let a defeat consume him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1990, I lost eight straight games,'' he said. ``I was
frustrated then as a young player. I'm a veteran player now. I'm a
mature player. That's part of baseball. I've won close games and
I've lost them. There's nothing to be ashamed of.''
</P>
<P>
   The efforts Johnson gives impresses third baseman Matt Williams.
That competitiveness, that want and will to win, is what the
Diamondbacks admire about Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize every time he goes out there on the mound, we can
be part of something very special,'' Williams said. ``He's a
no-hitter waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston Astros closer Billy Wagner found out with Johnson on
Wednesday, while playing golf together, that they were chosen for
the All-Star Game. This is Wagner's first. Wagner got to know
Johnson last season when Johnson was traded from the Seattle
Mariners to the Astros. Both throw serious heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good person to learn from, for me especially,'' said
Wagner, who has 21 saves. ``He's always been supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was down there and gave up five runs (in a game last season)
and he hollers at me and says, `Hey, it's going to be all right.'
That's nice to have that support.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's next start is Saturday against the Oakland Athletics
at Bank One Ballpark and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be frustrated if I wasn't pitching well,'' he said. ``How
can you be frustrated as a ballplayer when someone is doing their
job better to beat you?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he was prepared not to make the All-Star Game,
which will be his sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wins and losses are really what seems to catch people's eyes,
and rightfully so,'' he said. ``That's your job, to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Strikeouts are nice, he says, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Strikeouts didn't win any of my last ballgames. I didn't
strike out the guy that got the base hit and the RBI.'' &QL;

ANGELS WIN; NO ALL-STAR TRIP FOR VAUGHN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Mo Vaughn wouldn't be wrong if he wanted to stir it
up a little, but he won't do that.
</P>
<P>
   For only the second time in the past five seasons, Vaughn will
not be going to the All-Star game. The Angels' only All-Star
representative is closer Troy Percival.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his numbers compare favorably to some players that
will be going to Boston's Fenway Park next week for the game,
Vaughn didn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointed? Nah,'' Vaughn said before Wednesday night's
game, a 10-3 win over the Seattle Mariners before 23,623 at Edison
Field. ``If I were out there healthy the first part of the season,
I could made a case. But I started playing first base what, two
weeks ago? Had I been in my element ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make any excuses, but that's the way it goes.
I'll look at it as a chance to take a load off -- it's going to be
a circus there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who sprained his ankle on opening night and missed 14
games, went 3-for-4 with a walk Wednesday, including his 17th homer
of the season in the first inning to give the Angels a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After back-to-back homers by Alex Rodriguez and Butch Huskey in
the top of the second inning made it 2-1, Mariners, the Angels
scored three times in the second to regain the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners cut the lead to 4-3 in the fourth inning, but the
Angels responded with a six-run fifth inning to take a 10-3 lead.
They had nine hits in the inning alone, including two by Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the end of a 15-game stretch against A.L. West
opponents for the Angels, during which they went 9-6. They've won
four of their last five series, the only series loss in that time
coming when they were swept by the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughn, an All-Star appearance would have been a chance to
make a triumphant return to Boston, where he played eight seasons.
Instead, the Angels are in last place and the Red Sox are in 13
games over .500 and in the playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Jose Offerman. Many scoffed when the Red Sox
``replaced Vaughn by signing Offerman to a free-agent contract.
Offerman (.283, 3 homers, 35 RBIs) was named to the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's numbers (.288, 17 homers, 55 RBIs) are better than
Offerman's, but Offerman is a second baseman. Cleveland's Jim
Thome, though, is a first baseman like Vaughn, but his numbers fall
short -- .276, 13 homers, 46 RBIs). Thome was elected a starter by
the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been selected, I'd be happy,'' Vaughn said. ``But I
know I didn't play like I know I can play. I don't want anything
given to me. The most important thing is you want to make the game
because you've been making the game. I'll try again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks (4-5) allowed 12 hits, but only
three runs in eight innings to get the victory. Mariners starter
Jamie Moyer (8-5) got the loss.

NEW STAR, VETERAN STAR: GONZALEZ, JOHNSON ADDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Luis Gonzalez has never put himself above anybody. He is
grateful just to be able to put on a major league uniform and go to
work.
</P>
<P>
   But, on Tuesday, the Diamondbacks left fielder will be living a
dream, standing among the best in baseball as he's introduced as an
All-Star at Boston's Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's goal is to try to get to the World Series, but to
be recognized as one of the elite players to get to an All-Star
Game definitely means a lot to myself,'' Gonzalez said Wednesday
after being selected by Manager Bruce Bochy of the San Diego Padres
as one of the National League All-Star reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, making his first All-Star appearance, will join a
veteran of this gala, left-hander Randy Johnson, who was picked
Wednesday by Bochy as one of the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Johnson will be on the National League
side. Five times, he was an American League All-Star for the
Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson expressed surprise that he was chosen, despite having
200 strikeouts and a 3.03 earned-run average. In his past three
starts, he struck out 43 but lost all of them with a total of three
hits for offensive support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked, first of all, that I made it,'' Johnson said.
``My record is 9-6.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, scheduled to pitch Saturday against the Oakland
Athletics, will find out Monday whether he'll be the NL starter.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is honored just to be chosen for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``To start, that would be a great honor,'' Johnson said. ``But
you have pitchers in the National League who have more wins, and I
think they're probably more deserving.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Buck Showalter felt both players were deserving, along
with third baseman Matt Williams and second baseman Jay Bell, who
were voted in as starters by the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Four Diamondbacks in the All-Star Game shows how far the
franchise has come in only its second season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, center fielder Devon White, now with the Los Angeles
Dodgers, was the lone Diamondback representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very proud moment for all of us, especially for the
four guys selected,'' Showalter said. ``My tip of the hat to Bruce
Bochy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's a tough decision, being there (managing the AL
All-Stars in '95) and knowing everything involved. I think he made
a real good choice with Luis. I'm very proud of what Randy has
accomplished and the things he's done for us. He's certainly very
worthy of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine an All-Star Game without him there.''
</P>
<P>
   With two days' rest, it is uncertain how much Johnson will pitch
in the game. But Showalter is certain, whatever it is, Johnson will
give it his best.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody thinks Randy is going to warm up and pitch against
the best players in baseball in front of the world and not give his
best effort doesn't know Randy very well,'' Showalter said. ``It's
not like he's going to go out there and throw batting practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has been living a sort of fairy tale since he was
traded by the Detroit Tigers to the Diamondbacks last winter. No
disrespect to the Tigers, but he said he could have walked to his
home in Sugar Land, Texas, after receiving the news a few days
after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   He's been ``riding the wave,'' he said, since then, and isn't
ready to get off any time soon, putting up career numbers. He led
the league in hits with 112 entering Wednesday's game and was third
in the league in hitting at .359.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Diamondbacks didn't put Gonzalez on the All-Star
ballot, a write-in campaign, spearheaded by local sports radio host
Brad Cesmat, was successful. The final votes have yet to be
released, but the number could be around a half million, Cesmat
said he was told. That would put him among the top 10 for his
position in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless, if it was 100,000 or 1, I greatly appreciated what
Brad did at the station, generating some excitement, and people
taking time out to do it,'' Gonzalez said. ``Little kids to adults
to older people, everybody was rallying around me and that means a
lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez could probably walk to Boston after Sunday afternoon's
game, but he'll take a plane with Bell, Williams and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little kid every day I go to the ballpark,'' Gonzalez
said. ``I get to do this every day. Millions of people want to do
this. Now, I get to do something that not many players get to
do.'' &QL;

MERCURY MAY HAVE CURE FOR AILING OFFENSE IN LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was no win for the gimper Wednesday night, but the Mercury
might have stumbled upon a cure for its lame offense.
</P>
<P>
   With forward Clarissa Davis-Wrightsil ruled out of the second
half due to a foot injury, Phoenix went with a three-guard lineup
that infused speed and life into a team shooting even worse (25.9
percent) than in its record low shooting and scoring Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet 51.6 percent from the field in the second half was not
enough to overcome 48 percent from the free throw line overall as
the Mercury (3-8) lost, 67-61, to the Los Angeles Sparks (9-4)
before an encouraging 11,363 at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Playing without Coach Cheryl Miller, at home recovering from
surgery to repair a ruptured Achilles tendon suffered at the start
of practice Tuesday, Phoenix continued its free fall from the 1998
near penthouse to the Western Conference cellar.
</P>
<P>
   Now 7.5 games behind Houston, the Mercury is 4.5 games out of
playoff position a little more than a third into the 32-game
season. And coming to town Friday are the two-time champion Comets
(11-1), nearly upset by Phoenix in the 1998 WNBA Finals that seem a
lifetime ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so emotional at this stage,'' Phoenix point guard Michele
Timms said. ``We're 3-8 and every game we come back in here and
players are all in tears. It's a different experience for us this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying our guts out. If you didn't see that tonight, I
don't know what you were watching. We never gave in, and we're
trying so hard to get it right, but we just haven't got it right
just yet. It feels like it's coming, but we can't afford to wait
any longer. We're all so desperate out there, but we just can't
seem to come up with a W.''
</P>
<P>
   The entire tone of the game changed with guards Edna Campbell
and Bridget Pettis on the floor together to start the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix scored the first two buckets on a 13-footer by Campbell
and Pettis on break layup, off a full-court pass from Campbell, to
erase most of a 28-22 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury led for the first time since 3-0 off a series in
which 5-foot-5 Kristi Harrower came up with two offensive rebounds,
allowing a third chance that Marlies Askamp converted from eight
feet for 45-44. A Pettis 3-pointer, the one of 13 that Phoenix hit,
made it 50-48 with 8:25 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Pettis said she has suggested the three-guard lineup to Miller,
whose NBA All-Star brother Reggie flew to town to offer support and
was at the game, but seemingly since Campbell was drafted, the
coaches have tried to decide between the two while starting
Davis-Wrightsil.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought playing with Edna was a great combination on the
floor, and was finally got to do it,'' Pettis said. ``We really ran
the floor, and that's something the old Mercury used to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and Pettis combined for 17 points. Most significantly,
the Mercury outscored a team in the paint, 30-26, for the first
time all season and had an 11-6 advantage in fast-break points. At
halftime, LA led 18-8 in points in the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun playing with Bridget,'' Campbell said. ``But I'm not
the coach, I don't make the decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   LA scored seven straight points, five by Mwadi Mabika, to go up
55-50, and the Mercury could pull no closer than one in the final
6:25.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Gillom, who had a game-high 17 points, fouled out with
1:40 left to take away Phoenix's best weapon with LA leading 61-58.
Lisa Leslie converted both free throws off that foul then Campbell
missed a jumper, and the Sparks' franchise-record sixth consecutive
win was assured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not have put ourselves in the position to have to
work so hard to win,'' LA Coach Orlando Woolridge said. ``We
allowed their fans in the game and they came at us, but we found a
way to get the win. It was very physical.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolridge was hit with a technical for objecting to a foul, and
Timms got a T for defending Gillom after a flagrant foul by DeLisha
Milton. Then Timms was hit with a flagrant foul vs. Leslie with
4:35 remaining. &QL;

COYOTES ROUND OUT STAFF  
 BOWNESS, FLEMMING TO ASSIST FRANCIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Coyotes' newest brain trust is finally complete with the
addition Wednesday of veteran NHL head Coach Rick Bowness and Wayne
Flemming to fill first-year head Coach Bob Francis' coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the guys I wanted off the bat,'' Francis said. ``I
talked to up-and-coming guys and to some even more experienced.
These guys are quality people who are knowledgeable and who _ I
feel is very important _ know to communicate in a manner that
players respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick has been head coach of three teams and all three worked
very hard and were always well prepared. Wayne has coached overseas
and is extremely knowledgeable of the technical aspects of the
game. I feel very privileged to have them on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes General Manager Bobby Smith had said he hoped to
surround Francis with someone who has NHL head coaching experience.
It was accomplished with Bowness, who actually has coached four NHL
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Bowness, 41, returns to the franchise where he served 28 games
as the interim head coach in the 1988-89 season, replacing Dan
Maloney after two seasons and 52 games when the team was located in
Winnipeg. He ended his NHL playing days with the Jets, and had been
with the Atlanta Flames, Detroit and St. Louis in an eight-year
career.
</P>
<P>
   Bowness was head coach at Boston in 1991-92, leading the Bruins
to a 36-32-12 record and to the Eastern Conference finals before
losing to Pittsburgh, the eventual Stanley Cup champion. He was
head coach of expansion Ottawa in 1992 and led it through the
growing pains, serving 3{ seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Bowness, who spent last season as a consultant for the expansion
Nashville Predators, likes his new setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of meetings with Bob and we share a lot of
common ideas. A coaching staff works closely together and I
wouldn't put myself in a position where it didn't. The head coach
makes the final decisions, but you have to support each other, give
input to reach decisions. I think we will do well together.''
</P>
<P>
   One major job the new staff has is putting teeth in a power play
that was the NHL's second worst last season.
</P>
<P>
   Flemming coached the Islanders' power play and it's considered
his forte. It's a role that Francis also flourished in with Boston
last season, and Bowness, as a head coach, has had to oversee all
aspects so all are knowledgeable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strong point of Wayne's but I don't believe in making
it one guy's responsibility,'' Francis said. ``If the power play
goes bad, I'll take the blame. If it goes good, we'll share credit.
Ultimately, it's my responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought three heads are better than one. We will
all chip in our ideas and Wayne will oversee their execution.''
</P>
<P>
   Flemming, 51, was head coach at the University of Manitoba for
eight years, where he still holds school records for wins and games
coached.
</P>
<P>
   He also served as Bowness' assistant in 1997-98 with the
Islanders, after serving as assistant coach/general manager of the
Canadian National Team, which he helped guide to a silver medal in
the 1992 Winter Olympics at Albertville, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne is an excellent hockey man,'' Bowness said. ``He's a
loyal, hard-working guy. He was a big help to me with the Islanders
and he's a guy you would want on any staff. He coached our power
play and had it among the top four or five in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   While Francis is approaching his first NHL season as head coach,
he has years of minor league and NHL experience as an assistant and
likes the bench knowledge the trio represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bench management is very important,'' Francis said. ``Rick has
been through it all and can slap me in the head if I get too
excited. Wayne is very a calm person, a technical coach who can
talk one-on-one as the play is occuring, and I believe in
on-the-job teaching. Some coaches like to wear a headset and be
linked with somebody in the press box giving suggestions, but I
believe in correcting something when it happens as opposed to
waiting to do it later on. We've all been in the hole before and
can do it.'' &QL;

GENTLEMAN PREFERS BLOND  
 BLEACHED-LOOK CALIFORNIA STAR ENTERS NEW LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
 JUNIOR WORLD-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only 55-point scorer on the USA Basketball Men's Junior
World Championship Team has a logical explanation for his new,
bleached-blond locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the only player from California,'' 6-foot-6 swingman Casey
Jacobsen said. ``The rest of the guys just think it's the Cali
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, the career Southern California high school scoring
leader trying out for the U.S. team this week in Tempe, doesn't
have to explain himself to his parents.
</P>
<P>
   They not only approve of his hairstyle, they encourage it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom likes the look,'' said Jacobsen, who will be a freshman at
Stanford. ``She wants me to do it, and it's the fourth time I've
done it. She does it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen, a native of Glendora, Calif., did little during his
high school career that didn't make his family proud.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 3,284 points, the second most in California history.
His senior year was an off year. He averaged ``only'' 31 points per
game, down from the 32 he averaged the previous season.
</P>
<P>
   He also was selected a John Wooden scholar in honor of the
legendary UCLA basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   On great nights, Jacobsen scored in the 50s. On off nights, he
was held under 30. Not once did he score in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't set out my high school career trying to break that
record,'' Jacobsen said of the California state scoring mark. ``In
fact, I had a few awful nights. Twelve points was my low.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a kid, I struggled with my shooting. I wasn't strong
enough. I was very skinny. It took me a while to learn to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things I learned is that you will have streaks.
Sometimes, you'll go 0 for 10. Sometimes, you'll got 10 for 10. My
goal is to go 10 for 10. That's why I have to shoot a million J's
(jump shots).''
</P>
<P>
   He learned to shoot playing against his older brothers, Adam and
Brock, on the family's backyard court.
</P>
<P>
   Their dad, Von, who played at San Diego State, is a carpenter
and built the court, one Jacobsen calls ``the nicest backyard court
I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned by osmosis from watching my brothers shoot,''
Jacobsen said. ``I watched them have good shooting games and bad. I
experienced it living with two perimeter shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're around something so long, you just start to pick
up on things you might not even think about. Even being in a car
with them after their games, I'd hear them discuss what happened
and what they thought they could improve on. I remembered almost
everything, and maybe that's how I got my style of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the top scorer in California last year, Jacobsen
had to prove he belonged on the same court as many of the nation's
best high school players.
</P>
<P>
   He showed that in the 1999 McDonald's All-America Game, when he
scored 22 points in 24 minutes for the West team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had something to prove,'' said Jacobsen, who
picked Stanford over Utah and Duke. ``No one (nationally) had seen
me. I didn't go to the Nike camp. I was not as high-profile as many
of the high school players. It wasn't pressure I was under in the
all-star games. I was just excited to show people what I could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody had any doubts I could play at the next level, I
wanted to show people and put that aside.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State Coach Rob Evans, the head coach of the USA Junior
World team, doesn't have any doubts that Jacobsen will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will be a great player in the Pac-10,'' Evans said.
``Not only is he a great shooter, he's a very tough competitor. You
can't wear him out. He goes hard every single play.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you let up on him, he might hit for five or six baskets in
a row.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobsen thinks the physical style of the USA team's practices
will get him ready for the Pac-10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what college (basketball) is going to be
like, but I can't imagine it being more difficult than this,''
Jacobsen said. ``This is like a college experience because many of
the players here are bigger and stronger than me. People say the
biggest transition from high school to college is to learn to play
a physical game. So I won't be in awe when I realize how big and
strong (college) people will be.''

   HERBERT-COLUMN (New York) _ On the evening of May 18, 1982, a
woman who was visiting a nature preserve with her husband in
Buffalo, N.Y., was attacked and raped. Vincent Jenkins, a
43-year-old black man who would never qualify for a good
citizenship award, was convicted and sentenced to 20 years to life
in prison. But sophisticated DNA testing that has only recently
become available has now unequivocally ruled out Jenkins as the
source for any of the DNA found on the victim. But they also ruled
out the victim's husband. This has thrown prosecutors into a
theoretical tailspin. All sorts of wild hypotheses are emerging as
they search for any scenario that can be used to keep Jenkins in
prison. Commentary by Bob Herbert.

ROBINSON REITERATES PREFERENCE TO RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Manager Bryan Colangelo, between a trip to scout a
summer pro league in Los Angeles and a family trip to Disneyland,
has begun discussions with a number of agents representing NBA free
agents.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have two salary cap exceptions to use on free agents _
for $1 million and $2 million. But Colangelo said the most
important negotiations are with the club's own top free agent,
forward Clifford Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had conversations with a number of agents, but I can't
elaborate on any of those,'' Colangelo said. ``And as well, we've
taken the opportunity to speak to representatives for our own free
agents, particularly Clifford. Our main priority is to take care of
Clifford.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams were free to begin negotiating with free agents on July 1.
But no deals can be made until Aug. 1. Robinson, reached at his
Portland, Ore., home, said he has been contacted by several NBA
teams, but his preference is to remain in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's interest out there,'' said Robinson, 32. ``But at this
point, it's still kind of early in the process. The main people I'm
interested in talking to are the Suns.''
</P>
<P>
   The collective bargain rules allow Robinson, as a so-called
``early Bird free agent,'' to receive 175 percent of his salary of
last season, which was about $3.5 million, or the league average,
whichever is greater.
</P>
<P>
   For Robinson, who made more than the league average last season,
the 175 percent raise means he can sign a pact that begins at about
$6.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a bad position to be in,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The point of contention will be the length of the contract. By
rule, the Suns could offer a maximum of seven years with annual
increases of about $730,000 _ or a total of $58.6 million for a
seven-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   But there also is an ``over-36'' age rule, which places cap
restrictions on long-term deals once a player passes age 36, which
complicates Robinson's deal. As a result, the Suns are not likely
to offer a contract of more than four years, which would pay about
$29 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to get as many years as I can, of course,'' Robinson
said. ``I'm dealing with a credible organization, so I don't doubt
they'll do whatever they can for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had two good years for them. I'm fitting in very well,
and Jason (Kidd) and I played well together last season.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season, Robinson said if a team with a better chance
to win a championship made a comparable offer, he would have to
consider it. But he said that isn't likely to happen because of
salary cap restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think the Suns are probably in the best position to
take care of me even close to what I would like,'' he said. &QL;  &QL; 
In training &QL;  &QL; 
Kidd, a guard, and forward Tom Gugliotta reported for the start of
USA Basketball's pre-Olympic training camp Tuesday in Orlando. They
are part of the 12-man USA men's Select Team that will compete July
14-25 in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The Americans are heavily favored
to win one of the two berths from the Americas to the 2000 Olympics
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team will wrap up its training camp Saturday with an
exhibition game against Team Canada, featuring former Suns guard
Steve Nash. &QL;  &QL; 
Summer plans &QL;  &QL; 
The Suns will hold a rookie/free agent camp beginning July 23, then
will have a team at the Rocky Mountain Revue summer league in Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The summer Suns will play five games in Utah. In addition to the
club's newcomers, young players such as Pat Garrity, Gerald Brown
and Randy Livingston get an opportunity to work on their games
within the club's system.
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft pick Shawn Marion also may participate in the
LA summer pro league.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd tournament &QL;  &QL; 
Kidd will play host to his first Jason Kidd Celebrity Golf
Tournament on Sept. 24 at Estrella Mountain Ranch Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament offers golfers an opportunity to tee it up with
sports celebrities, and proceeds will benefit the Jason Kidd
Foundation, which provides funding for children's medical research
and charitable organizations supporting the needs of children. As
an example, Kidd and his wife, Joumana, recently launched Kidd
Shots, a free immunization program for local youth. For tournament
information, call (602) 607-1633. &QL;  &QL;

YOUNG LATIN IMPORT DEFENSIVE STANDOUT IN OUTFIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the name:  &UR; Luis Terrero.
</P>
<P>
   He's 18, 6 feet 2, 190 pounds and a defensive gem in center
field who appears to have the power, speed, arm and glove to be a
future star in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks hope so anyway. So far, they've been impressed
with what they've seen in Missoula, Mont., where Terrero has helped
their advanced Rookie team to 17 victories in its first 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   In 17 games, Terrero, a converted shortstop from the Dominican
Republic, was hitting .308 and led the Pioneer League with six home
runs. He also had 21 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   With a logjam at short, Terrero, signed last year by Latin
American scouting coordinator  &UR; Junior Noboa, was moved to center
field, where he's adjusted amazingly well, said  &UR; Tommy Jones, the
Diamondbacks' director of minor league operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really opened up a lot of eyes,'' Jones said. ``He has
major league defensive abilities, and he's showing progress with
the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrero has drawn comparisons to New York Yankees outfielder
 &UR; Bernie
 &UR; Williams, but, Jones said, the comparisons are unfair at this
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a Bernie Williams-type body,'' Jones said. ``That's
where I'd end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a chance to be a five-tool category guy.'' &QL; 
Myers hurt &QL;
</P>
<P>
   First-round draft pick  &UR; Corey Myers, playing shortstop at
Missoula, has been out of action for a week after fouling a pitch
off his left shin, which caused an infection. Myers, who graduated
in May from Desert Vista High, is expected back in the lineup
Friday, when the Osprey begin a home stand.
</P>
<P>
   Myers was hitting .290 with three homers and nine RBIs in 69 at
bats.
</P>
<P>
   He's made 11 errors in 16 games, ``but he's had some tough
chances early,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making all the routine plays now,'' Jones said. ``He's
the first to admit that the game is played at a much faster pace.
Everything is quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's making the adjustment very well.'' &QL; 
Lefty luck &QL; 
Left-hander  &UR; Nick Bierbrodt didn't throw a pitch in his short stay
as a Diamondback, but the 21-year-old can wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they want me to do, I'll do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Diamondbacks' first-ever draft pick is starting for
Triple-A Tucson, where, in his first two outings, he gave up one
earned run and struck out eight in 10 innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been real lucky,'' Bierbrodt said.
</P>
<P>
   Bierbrodt pitched at Double-A El Paso, before the Diamondbacks
called him up to the big club June 24. He was sent to Tucson four
days later.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Triple-A batters are more selective than those he
faced in El Paso, but, he said, he's gotten away with strikes up in
the zone in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both games I pitched, I would have gotten hammered in
Double-A,'' Bierbrodt said. ``My mechanics haven't been real good.
It comes and goes.'' &QL; 
Short hops &QL; 
Right-hander  &UR; Erik Sabel has been a pleasant surprise as a starter
in Tucson. He has won four games without a defeat and has a 2.77
ERA. He has struck out 26 in 48 innings.

ROOF CAN'T KEEP FANS DRY DURING STORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The swimming pool wasn't the only area at Bank One Ballpark
where people got wet on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   A group of fans sitting in areas underneath the the large
affixed truss that holds up the retractable roof on the ballpark's
south side got a surprise shower early in the game as the result of
rain being blown inside from a small area where the roof overhangs
the truss.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks team President Rich Dozer said that there is a one-
to two-foot gap where large wheels move the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew that there would be a possibility for water and wind
coming in on the north and south sides if the conditions were just
right. If it were from the east or west, this wouldn't have
happened. This is something that is rarely going to happen,'' Dozer
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wind would have to be coming straight in from either of
those directions, and apparently, it was tonight. I went outside
and the street poles were really bending back and forth. We had a
bad storm last night (Tuesday night), too, but it wasn't anything
like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no hole in the roof itself. The water was essentially
sucked up and into the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously don't want the fans to have discomfort, but it
looked to me like most were being good-natured about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One fan in the upper deck came prepared, opening his
red-and-white umbrella for a brief period.
</P>
<P>
   Quipped managing general partner Jerry Colangelo, who was dry in
his front-row perch next to the Arizona dugout: ``We're going to
tell them to keep their ticket stubs in case we have a
rain-out.'' &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closer to a closer? &QL;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks inched closer to landing a closer on Wednesday,
talking to the Montreal Expos about right-hander Ugueth Urbina and
the Florida Marlins about right-hander Matt Mantei.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the people we are concentrating on, yes, but there
are others who we are considering,'' said General Manager Joe
Garagiola Jr., confirming published reports. ``It's so hard to tell
how these things are going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   As to which players the Diamondbacks might be offering, the
focus seems to be on one of two top pitching prospects, either
left-hander Nick Bierbrodt or right-hander John Patterson, perhaps
another minor league position prospect and maybe even a player from
the current 25-man roster. One name that was floating about before
Wednesday night's game was that of outfielder David Dellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Garagiola said that while the club is reluctant to part with top
prospects, ``it's always the case that you have to do what you
might not like in order to get a very good player.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said, ``These teams haven't put their signs out. You
have to approach them sometimes. You have to try to keep a balance
in what you're willing to do.''

A MORE DRIVEN MAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Under the circumstances, John Jacobs probably couldn't have
picked a better site for playing a U.S. Senior Open than Des Moines
Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, coming off two solid finishes in the past two Senior PGA
Tour events, is among the pros who'll tee off today on the
6,904-yard course in West Des Moines, Iowa, which is hosting its
first major event.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs leads the senior tour in driving distance with an average
of 286.6 yards, and finds himself on a course that is forgiving of
errant shots as Open courses go.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my game,'' the Scottsdale golfer said by phone after
his practice round Wednesday. ``If I drive the ball well, I play
well. If I don't, I'm down the road. This course is more generous
than most of the Open courses I've played on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it caters to a longer hitter. If I can just explain to
my ball what I want it to do, I'll be in good shape. My ball might
not know I'm leading in driving distance or what direction I want
it to go.''
</P>
<P>
   This year started with the ball doing exactly what Jacobs wanted
as he won the season-opening MasterCard Championship, formerly
known as the Senior Tournament of Champions, in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant a lot because all of the top players are there and
it lets you know you can compete on their level,'' Jacobs said. ``I
always knew I could drink on their level, but wasn't sure if I
could play on their level.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, 54, always has been known as a free spirit, who lived
life to the fullest in his younger years but didn't take advantage
of his talents as a golfer.
</P>
<P>
   His resume includes giving lessons to Vietnamese Premier Nguyen
Cao Ky, but not much in the way of PGA Tour prowess, as he earned
just $119,790 from 1968 through '80. He later played Asian and
European tours and led the Asian money list in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played with him quite a few times on the Western States
Tour, and we were pretty competitive with each other,'' Papago Golf
Course pro Joe Huber said. ``But he's improved his game, and that's
what happens when you get on a tour and start competing on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We both went to qualifying school (in 1986), and he made it
and I didn't. The last couple times I've seen him, he's really been
swinging the clubs well. In his younger years, he was free-spirited
and wasn't really committed to his golf game. He's gotten more
serious about it and it shows.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs' breakthrough came in '96, when he tied for second at
Q-school and won $510,263, finishing 23rd on the money list. He
moved up to 12th the next year, was 15th last year, and this year
ranks eighth with earnings of $713,947. In 19 events, he has eight
top-10 finishes and 11 in the top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs admits he lost focus for a while after his Jan. 24
victory in Hawaii, and it showed with a string of disappointing
finishes until he took third two weeks ago in the Ford Senior
Players Championship in Dearborn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   He followed that last week with a tie for sixth in the State
Farm Senior Classic. Jacobs also played well in the PGA Seniors
Championship in April, tying for eighth.
</P>
<P>
   In his three Senior Opens thus far, Jacobs' best finish has been
a tie for 17th in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am playing pretty well and I feel good about my game right
now,'' Jacobs said. ``But when you get over 50, you just take it
week to week. You don't get that same adrenaline rush you did when
you were younger. Sometimes you wake up with a bad this and a bad
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This does look like a course I can play well on, though.''
</P>
<P>
   The Open will be the biggest golf event staged in Iowa and
already has been a stunning success at the gate. The tournament was
sold out in advance for the first time in Senior Open history, and
the practice rounds drew crowds of 25,000 Monday, 27,000 Tuesday
and 29,000 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hale Irwin and tour rookies Allen Doyle and Bruce Fleisher, with
three victories each this year, are the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who won the Ford Seniors, ranks third on the money list
and is trying to become the third to win back-to-back titles in the
Senior Open. Doyle, whose victories include the PGA Seniors
Championship, tops the list and Fleisher is second.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this course, I think it's pretty wide open this week,''
Jacobs said. ``Now that I say that, Hale will probably win by 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``As big as his house is, he better win a few of these things.
Have you seen it? I drove by it the other day and it's the biggest
. . . thing I've ever seen. I don't know how anybody can afford
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin won last year after opening with a 77, the highest
one-round score for a winner in the history of the senior tour. &QL;

MONARCHS SLIGHTED  IN VOTING 
</HEADLINE>
 ALL-STAR-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American Basketball League and Sacramento Monarchs were the
biggest losers in WNBA All-Star voting.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 10 starters selected by fans for next week's game is
out of the ABL, with the highest vote-getter out of that defunct
league being Orlano's Taj McWilliams, who has better numbers than
starter Kym Hampton of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The real crime, though, is that Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith,
another former ABL player with Most Valuable Player-type
statistics, is not starting ahead of Houston's Tina Thompson as a
West forward. Thompson remains an important cog for the Houston
Comets, but Griffith has elevated the Monarchs from last place to a
contender.
</P>
<P>
   And Sacramento second-year point guard Ticha Penicheiro, who
leads the league in assists and is seventh in steals, deserves to
start ahead of the Mercury's Michele Timms. In assist-turnover
ratio, Penicheiro is at 1.71 compared with 1.58 for Timms, third in
league assists through Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the 34-year-old Timms is having a bad season. But
Penicheiro and Griffith deserve to be rewarded for Sacramento's 8-4
start and probably will be among the West reserves named today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my all-around game, I'm playing much better this year
than the last two years,'' Timms said. ``I feel really confident
and really good, especially defensively. I feel much quicker
defensively, and none of the point guards has scored on me this
season. In fact because the (shooting guards) and (small forwards)
from the other teams have been scoring, they've been having me on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition starting point guards, including Penicheiro twice,
are averaging 7.0 points vs. Phoenix. &QL;

ANGELS POUND MOYER, HANDING M'S LEFTY HIS FIRST LOSS SINCE MAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ When the first words in manager Lou Piniella's
postgame news conference are a calling to God, it's easy to tell
how the night went for the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, the Anaheim Angels used a six-run
inning to sink Seattle. This time, the final was 10-3, and the loss
dropped the M's five games behind the division-leading Texas
Rangers, who won Wednesday in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played like a tired team tonight,'' Piniella said. ``I
think we can use the day off today.''
</P>
<P>
   Starter Jamie Moyer lasted 42/3 innings, his shortest outing of
the season, and lost for the first time in 13 starts. Moyer (8-5),
who had won his last seven decisions, allowed eight runs for the
first time since his last loss, to Toronto on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, meanwhile, came into the game with the fewest runs
scored in the American League and a patchwork lineup beyond the
four veterans at the top of the order. But they broke out against
Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're good hitters,'' Moyer said. ``They probably haven't
been swinging the bats the way they'd like over the last week or
couple of weeks. Tonight they swung the bats well. They were very
aggressive and didn't back down. I probably didn't make adjustments
when I needed to.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, who lost eight pounds in the Texas heat in a no-decision
last Friday, said he wasn't tired or drained Wednesday night. But
there's little doubt he can use the eight days of rest before his
next start, in the opening game at Safeco Field on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's given us an awful lot of innings,'' pitching coach Stan
Williams said. ``So the break might be coming at just the right
time for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moyer allowed seven earned runs on 10 hits, by seven different
Angels. Mo Vaughn had the first, a towering homer that struck the
right-field foul pole and gave the Angels a 1-0 first-inning lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners went ahead in the second off knuckleballer Steve
Sparks. Alex Rodriguez, passed over for the American League
All-Star team earlier in the day, hit his sixth homer in five days
(No. 18 on the year). One batter later, designated hitter Butch
Huskey, starting in place of Edgar Martinez, who missed another
game with a tight left hamstring, followed with a homer of his own.
</P>
<P>
   But Anaheim quickly reclaimed the lead in its half of the
inning. Moyer hit Angels' DH Tim Unroe to lead off the second, and
singles by Reggie Williams, Gary DiSarcina and Darin Erstad gave
the Angels a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer worked a scoreless third and fourth, but could not escape
the fifth. Vaughn singled, Anderson reached on an infield hit, Troy
Glaus added a run-scoring double and Unroe an RBI single. When
Williams brought in two with a double over Ken Griffey Jr.'s head
in center field, Moyer was replaced by Ken Cloude.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude himself could not survive the inning. Three singles and a
Vaughn double drove Cloude from the game, and by the time Damaso
Marte retired Anderson on a comebacker, the Angels had built a
seven-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude allowed more than one run for the seventh time in 10
outings since moving to the bullpen in early June. He seemed to be
making progress in sideline drills with Williams in which he worked
on driving the ball to the outside corner. But the results haven't
showed in games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he threw well the last time (in Texas), even though
he gave up a few key runs,'' Williams said. ``Today, everything was
flat, and he never got an out. It didn't look like he was throwing
it very well tonight. It's a tough role to be in, long relief, but
you have to keep yourself pitching to the best of your ability.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Moyer has done in the first half, though he missed
out on an All-Star bid Piniella felt he deserved. With his own
first half over, Moyer was hopeful about the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a fun second half,'' he said. ``I think this
division is wide open. It's up for grabs. Texas is in the lead, and
there are three clubs chasing it. Anaheim has talent, Oakland has
talent and we have talent _ and the Rangers have talent as well
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to come down to who wants it bad enough, because in
the first half, nobody's played that well, I don't think, in our
division. Nobody's taken it by the horns and run with it. The three
teams that are chasing are very fortunate.''

</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks rip rookie starter &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHOENIX _ First it rained inside Bank One Ballpark, the result of a
leak in the retractable roof. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, the rain was accompanied by thunder and
lightning, the result of a leak in the two pitching staffs on
display. A bomb shelter might not have provided the Astros enough
protection from the storm that was the Arizona Diamondbacks'
offense Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros allowed a season-high five home runs, including three
in the decisive sixth inning of a 13-7 loss that prevented them
from reclaiming first place in the National League Central
Division. The Astros remained percentage points behind Cincinnati,
which lost to St. Louis on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks broke the game open with six runs in the third
inning and held on to the lead behind the solid relief pitching of
Bobby Chouinard, Greg Swindell and Vladimir Nunez. Meanwhile, the
Astros' bullpen allowed six runs in relief of rookie Wade Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a horse, I'd shoot myself,'' lefthander Trever
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   There were plenty of heroes at the plate, led by All-Star second
baseman Jay Bell, who reached base in each of his five plate
appearances and had three doubles. Former Astro Steve Finley hit a
pair of two-run homers, while Matt Willliams and Damian Miller had
three RBIs apiece.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' Craig Biggio, who also reached in all five plate
appearances, tied a career high with four hits and came within a
triple of hitting for the cycle. But the Biggio-led Astros were
unable to score with the frequency of the Diamondbacks, who won for
only the fifth time in 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Miller's major-league debut was hardly memorable. In fact,
it happened so quickly, there's a good chance the rookie won't
remember many of the gory details a couple of days from now. The
Diamondbacks shell-shocked the 22-year-old righthander, punishing
him for seven runs on eight hits in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous at first, but I calmed down after that,'' Wade
Miller said. ``I just didn't hit spots like I normally do. If you
make bad pitches at this level, they're probably going to hit them
for home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-inning stint matched the shortest outing by an Astros
starter this season. Shane Reynolds also was knocked out after
three innings May 8 against the Expos. The Astros plan to keep
Miller on the roster for the remainder of the week, although he
isn't expected to pitch in relief.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, he will return to Class AAA New Orleans after
the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wade had velocity, and he made some good pitches, but he also
left a lot of pitches over the plate,'' interim manager Matt
Galante said. ``He started getting his pitches up, and he couldn't
get back down. You never know what you're going to get with
rookies, but this was a good experience for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential of Miller, pressed into duty because of Mike
Hampton's wrist injury, was evident during the brief outing, but
his lack of experience showed through.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Diamondbacks starter Brian Anderson has been around
for parts of the past five seasons, including an appearance in the
1997 World Series with the Cleveland Indians, and he didn't fare
much better.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros pillaged Anderson for six runs on nine hits in 3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time this season and the 20th time in his career,
Biggio homered to start the Astros' first inning, sending a 1-2
pitch from Anderson into the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks tied the score in the bottom of the inning when
Bell doubled and scored on Luis Gonzalez's looping single up the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Bagwell's 27th homer, a three-run shot to left, gave the
Astros a 4-1 lead in the third inning, but once again the
Diamondbacks erased the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams, Damian Miller and Andy Fox combined for 1,138
feet worth of homers _ and six runs _ off the Astros rookie in the
bottom of the third. Wade Miller allowed only eight home runs in
101 innings while with New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Wade lost his focus and his concentration after
Williams' home run,'' Galante said.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros knocked Anderson out of the game with two runs in the
fourth, but the Diamondbacks then won the battle of the bullpens.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' franchise record for homers allowed in a game is
six, established at Wrigley Field on June 3, 1987.

ANGELS WIN; NO ALL-STAR TRIP FOR VAUGHN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Mo Vaughn wouldn't be wrong if he wanted to stir it up
a little, but he won't do that.
</P>
<P>
   For only the second time in the past five seasons, Vaughn will
not be going to the All-Star Game. The Angels' only All-Star
representative is closer Troy Percival.
</P>
<P>
   Even though his numbers compare favorably to some players who
will be going to Boston's Fenway Park next week for the game,
Vaughn didn't complain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disappointed? Nah,'' Vaughn said before Wednesday night's
game, a 10-3 win over the Seattle Mariners before 23,623 at Edison
Field. ``If I were out there healthy the first part of the season,
I could make a case. But I started playing first base what, two
weeks ago? Had I been in my element...
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to make any excuses, but that's the way it goes.
I'll look at it as a chance to take a load off _ it's going to be a
circus there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who sprained his ankle on opening night and missed 14
games, went 3 for 4 with a walk Wednesday, including his 17th homer
of the season in the first inning to give the Angels a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After back-to-back homers by Alex Rodriguez and Butch Huskey in
the top of the second inning made it 2-1, Mariners, the Angels
scored three times in the second to regain the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners cut the lead to 4-3 in the fourth inning, but the
Angels responded with a six-run fifth inning to take a 10-3 lead.
They had nine hits in the inning alone, including two by Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The game marked the end of a 15-game stretch against AL West
opponents for the Angels, during which they went 9-6. They've won
four of their last five series, the only series loss in that time
coming when they were swept by the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came into that stretch knowing we had to play well,''
manager Terry Collins said. ``Obviously we didn't play well against
Texas, but against the other teams we did. We're happy about it.
Now we take a day off and get ready for the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   For Vaughn, an All-Star appearance would have been a chance to
make a triumphant return to Boston, where he played eight seasons.
Instead, the Angels are in last place and the Red Sox are 12 games
over .500 and in the playoff hunt.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Jose Offerman. Many scoffed when the Red Sox
``replaced'' Vaughn by signing Offerman to a free-agent contract.
Offerman (.283, 3 homers, 35 RBI) was named to the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn's numbers (.288, 17 homers, 55 RBI) are better than
Offerman's, but Offerman is a second baseman. Cleveland's Jim
Thome, though, is a first baseman like Vaughn, but his numbers fall
short _ .276, 13 homers, 46 RBI). Thome was elected a starter by
the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd been selected, I'd be happy,'' Vaughn said. ``But I
know I didn't play like I know I can play. I don't want anything
given to me. The most important thing is you want to make the game
because you've been making the game. I'll try again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks (4-5) allowed 12 hits but only three
runs in eight innings to get the victory. Mariners starter Jamie
Moyer (8-5) got the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you score that many runs, it allows you to mix up your
pitches and be more aggressive,'' Sparks said. ``It also slows down
their running game and makes them play station to station, so I was
fortunate in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy to give them (bullpen) a rest. They needed it and
I haven't stayed out there very long lately.''

   All-Stars
</P>
<P>
   Lima, Wagner, &QL; 
Hampton join &QL; 
Bagwell on NL team &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHOENIX _ Jeff Bagwell is the front man of the Astros' All-Star
contingent _ the veteran who has been there and done that. It's a
good thing, too, because the other Astros All-Stars might need a
little guidance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hampton, Jose Lima and Billy Wagner were selected to the
National League All-Star team for the first time Wednesday by
Padres manager Bruce Bochy and league president Len Coleman, who
also named Bagwell among NL reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Craig Biggio was not named to the team; Jeff Kent
of the San Francisco Giants will be the backup to Arizona's Jay
Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Making the game even more special than usual for Bagwell is the
fact it will be played at Boston's Fenway Park. Bagwell was born in
Boston and grew up a Red Sox fan. His hometown team drafted him in
1989 but traded him to the Astros for Larry Andersen in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game will mark the first time Bagwell has stepped
onto the field at Fenway Park as a major-leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's going to be special for me,'' said Bagwell, who played
in a college all-star game at Fenway. ``It's going to be great to
sit in that dugout for the first time. It's going to be fun but not
emotional. When they traded me, the emotion went out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was business; I understand why they did it. They were
trying to build their team up for a shot at the postseason, and if
I were in that situation, I would have been saying, `Trade that
Bagwell kid.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably be the only one in Boston defending the trade.
I'm just excited to have an opportunity to go back and to share
this with three of my teammates who have never gone before.''
</P>
<P>
   The four representatives are the most the Astros have had since
Bagwell, Biggio, Ken Caminiti, Doug Drabek and John Hudek made the
team in 1994. This is only the second time in franchise history
three Houston pitchers have been selected to the team. Joaquin
Andujar, Joe Niekro and Joe Sambito made it in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner and his wife, Sarah, had planned a fishing trip for the
three-day All-Star break, but they were glad to change their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many good pitchers around that it's hard to
expect to make it,'' said Wagner, who is tied for the NL lead with
21 saves. ``It's special to make the team in only my third year in
the big leagues, and it's special for it to take place in Boston,
which is where I saw my first big-league game.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he thought American League hitters would react to
seeing such a blazing fastball coming from a small package, Wagner
said: ``Those guys know who I am. They've seen good fastballs
before. Ask (Mariners shortstop) Alex Rodriguez. He hit a ball
against me in the minor leagues that's still going.''
</P>
<P>
   Hampton, Lima and Wagner joined 13 other NL players as
first-time All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a very excitable guy,'' Hampton said. ``But I'm pretty
excited about this. Going to the All-Star Game is like a
once-in-a-lifetime experience. To be in the company of such great
players will be an honor. Hopefully, there'll be more to come. But
this is something I'll cherish for the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The only intrigue remaining is whether Bochy will put an Astro
in the starting lineup. Bagwell would seem to be a candidate to
start at designated hitter, and Lima's numbers are good enough to
warrant consideration for the starting assignment, but that's not
going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Lima is scheduled to start for the Astros on Sunday, which
likely would limit him to an inning of work in Tuesday's All-Star
Game. Batting orders and starting pitchers will be announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lima will not start the All-Star Game,'' Astros general
manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``I promise you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lima is happy to be there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great privilege,'' Lima said. ``You get to see the
best players in the world, and now I'm one of them. I want to
start, but I don't make that decision. That would be an honor, but
my team comes first. I'm just going to go down there and enjoy
myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be careful; I'm coming for you, Boston. It's Lima Time!''

 MCCAIN SUPPORTS BAN ON INTERNET TAX  &HT;     By ROBERT B. GUNNISON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STANFORD, Calif. _ GOP presidential hopeful John McCain told an
audience at the Hoover Institution Wednesday that he backs a
permanent ban on taxes on Internet sales, although he later said
that the ban needs more study.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a three-day California campaign swing, the Arizona
senator also blasted federal campaign finance laws as the obstacle
to fundamental political change in everything from education and
taxes to defense spending and Y2K lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all corrupted. I know that is a harsh judgment, but it
is a fair one,'' he told his luncheon audience of about 100 people
on the Stanford University campus. ``Anyone who believes America is
greater than the sum of its special interests should stand with
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Special interest money, he said, ``is an elaborate
influence-peddling scheme'' that contributes to the public's
mistrust and cynicism about politics.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted that in the past, he had been tempted to vote in
ways that would benefit campaign contributors. But he said, ``I do
not disparage the integrity of my colleagues.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, McCain and Sen. Russell Feingold, D-Wis., have
introduced a bill aimed at curtailing the influence of money on
politicians holding federal office. The measure has been vehemently
opposed by members of McCain's own party.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure passed the House of Representatives last year,
and he and Feingold are struggling to bring the bill to a vote in
the Senate this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first reform and a vital gateway to other reforms,''
McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill would ban unlimited, unregulated
donations to political parties, the so-called soft money that led
to campaign-financing abuses in the 1996 elections. The bill also
would tightly regulate advertisements by independent groups that
attack or tout various candidates during the final two months of an
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   For his own campaign, McCain has raised $6 million, more than
all other GOP presidential candidates except Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, whose staggering $36 million set a record.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's tirade against the evils of special interest money
dominated most of his speech. But he also touched on issues of
local interest for Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have advocated a permanent ban on Internet taxes,'' McCain
said. ``The ban must be permanent because you can be sure the
special interests yearn to tap the cash cow to finance their
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain later said he favors a permanent ban ``with this
caveat'' _ he wants to wait for the findings of a federal
commission looking into the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Congress last year enacted a three-year ban on taxes on Internet
sales, but also created the Advisory Commission on Electronic
Commerce to recommend future tax policy.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-member commission met for the first time last month, and
a majority of the commissioners said Internet taxes are inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the Texas governor
is still considering whether commerce on the Internet should be
taxed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also criticized efforts of trial lawyers and others who
opposed his Y2K legislation, which passed last week.
</P>
<P>
   His bill would give companies 90 days to fix Y2K computer
problems before lawsuits could be filed, and it encourages
mediation in a further attempt to limit litigation.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents said it would take away rights of consumers and
small businesses. The White House originally threatened a veto, but
relented under pressure from Silicon Valley lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he was acting ``in the public interest'' and
brusquely dismissed a reporter's suggestion that his opponents
might view their cause the same way. ``I know what is in the public
interest,'' he said.

 ALZHEIMER'S VACCINE SHOWS PROMISE IN MICE  &HT;     By CARL T. HALL 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An experimental vaccine against Alzheimer's disease has achieved
startling success _ in mice _ and could be ready for early trials
in humans within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting Wednesday in the journal Nature, Bay Area researchers
sponsored by drugmaker Elan Pharmaceuticals outlined a potential
strategy to prevent the buildup of brain-damaging plaques, one of
the biological hallmarks of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary tests suggest that it may someday be possible to
take a series of injections in middle age _ perhaps at the first
hint of symptoms, perhaps sooner in those with a family history or
other risk factors _ to preserve mental function in later life.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, the tests also hint that the vaccine may have a
therapeutic effect _ capable perhaps of reversing symptoms in those
already suffering memory loss and other signs of Alzheimer's
dementia.
</P>
<P>
   Medical experts warned that many questions have to be answered
before a therapeutic Alzheimer's vaccine can be considered a
serious possibility. Still, doctors said the results reported
Wednesday mark a new turn in the battle against one of the most
feared afflictions of an aging population.
</P>
<P>
   The disease, capable of producing a profound degeneration of
memory and mental function, afflicts about 4 million Americans,
including 1 in 10 of those over the age of 65 and nearly half of
those over the age of 85. There is no cure, and current treatment
options, aimed at replenishing neurotransmitters depleted as the
disease progresses, generally achieve little beyond a slight delay
in symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Miller, an Alzheimer's specialist at the University of
California at San Francisco, said the new study ``brings up a whole
exciting area none of us in the field has even thought about
before, and that's immunization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The field is moving from trying to replace the chemicals
destroyed in the process of brain degeneration to new strategies
looking at primary prevention,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Elan researchers injected an experimental protein drug
called AN-1792 into a mutant strain of mice with human gene forms
designed to produce biological symptoms of Alzheimer's disease as
the animals age.
</P>
<P>
   Treatments triggered an immune response in the animals that
seemed to clear away the telltale brain plaques, while preventing
new plaque from being deposited.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were astounded,'' said Dale Schenk, Elan Pharmaceuticals
vice president for neurobiology and lead researcher on the new
study.
</P>
<P>
   The company, formed through the recent takeover of San
Francisco-based Athena Neurosciences, plans to petition the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration later this year for permission to
begin launch  &LR; the first safety tests in people.
</P>
<P>
   If those succeed, the company could then begin larger clinical
trials to determine whether AN-1792 is truly effective. Even if all
goes well, it could take several years before any therapy or
vaccine is in widespread use.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial appearing in the same issue of
Nature as the Elan study, Alzheimer's specialists from the
University of Toronto noted the long-standing controversy as to
exactly what causes Alzheimer's dementia and outlined key questions
that have yet to be answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to be a little cautious,'' said Dr. David Westaway,
one of the commentary's co-authors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first questions the Elan team has to answer is
whether an appropriate immune response can be induced in humans as
was seen in the laboratory mice.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to trigger release of a specific type of antibody _
the body's guided missiles against disease-causing organisms _ that
can attack a particular form of protein known as amyloid-beta
peptide.
</P>
<P>
   The peptide, consisting of a string of 40 or 42 amino acids, is
the main ingredient in the drug that Elan injected into the mice.
The idea is to show the immune system how to recognize as an enemy
what would otherwise appear to be a benign substance in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies of potential cancer vaccines suggest this may
not be so easy to do. Results in so-called ``mouse models'' of
complicated human diseases have not proved very reliable, partly
because the human immune system often balks at attacking the body's
own proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the researchers had to induce relatively high levels of
antibody in the mice in order to achieve the desired results. It
may be hard to get such a robust result in humans while at the same
avoiding side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming those questions can be answered, the next key stumbling
block will be proving that amyloid plaque build-up is what lies
behind the behavioral and neurological impairments of Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the question was posed by the Toronto specialists, ``does
immunization with (amyloid-beta peptide) simply clear a
neuropathological by-product or can it cure the disease?''
</P>
<P>
   During an interview, Westaway said the new study should go a
long way toward clearing up the fundamental question of whether
amyloid plaque is the central problem or just one element in a more
insidious process that has yet to be fully explained.
</P>
<P>
   Recent studies suggest the death of brain cells and loss of
memory in Alzheimer's is rooted in a cascade of events in which at
least some of the damage is done inside brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the case, then preventing plaques from being
deposited all around the brain may not be enough to prevent or
reverse all the symptoms. It might take several years of
large-scale study to know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   The study authors said there are grounds to be optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we see what we're seeing now in human testing, we're going
to have a profound effect on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease,
there's no question about that,'' Schenk said.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the field cautioned family members and caregivers
against expecting too much, too soon. But they, too, said the
prospects are not so far-fetched that those now in their 40s and
50s can get more effective treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that you could immunize people against something
like Alzheimer's disease is pretty exciting stuff,'' said Bill
Fisher, Bay Area executive director for the Alzheimer's
Association, a support group with branches nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that other options are also in the testing stage and
could be available sooner, although most would have only modest
impact on the disease. Vitamin E, estrogen and nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs, for example, are being investigated as
possible protective agents against cognitive decline.

 HOW TO KEEP E-MAIL PRIVATE  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: I do a lot of e-mail correspondence that involves sensitive
corporate information. Is there any way to code my mail so that
only the person I'm sending it to can read it?
<P>
   A: What you need is PGP, a free encryption program that you can
download at www.pgpi.com. PGP stands for Pretty Good Privacy. It
was created in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman, who went on to found a
company, PGP Inc., that was acquired by Network Associates in 1997.
PGP is pretty strong stuff (so strong that the U.S. government
investigated Zimmerman for three years on the premise that PGP
violated U.S. export restrictions for cryptographic software).
</P>
<P>
   PGP uses what's called public key system. Each user has two
software keys _ a public key that can be shared with anyone, and a
private key that only the user knows. Someone sends you a message
using your public key to encrypt it. Once encrypted, the message
looks like random gibberish. When you receive the message, you can
decrypt it using your private key.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, PGP isn't just for e-mail. You can use it to
scramble any file that you don't want other people to know about.
Just use your public key to encrypt it, and your private key to
decrypt it.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORD ON LINUX
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've been reading a lot about Linux, and I was under the
impression that there would soon be versions of it that would be
easy to install and use on my PC. Is that true, and which versions
are the best?
</P>
<P>
   A: Linux has come a long way in the couple of years since it
burst into the spotlight. But truth to tell, it still is a long way
from being an adequate alternative to Windows or the Macintosh
operating system. The reason is that very little good software has
been written for Linux. For instance, the only mainstream word
processor that's been adapted to Linux is WordPerfect. Microsoft is
having no part of the upstart system, and we may never see Linux
versions of Word, Excel and Powerpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Linux itself is getting a lot easier to use, thanks to companies
that are packaging it with graphical, Windows-like desktop
interfaces and easy installation routines. Two good versions that
come to mind are Red Hat 6.0 ($79.95 list price) and Linux from
Macmillan Software ($49.95 for the Deluxe version, $29.95 for the
Complete version, although how it can be complete if there's a more
extensive version is beyond me). These products let you surf the
Web, exchange e-mail, create simple documents and manage your
files.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about Linux is that it works on older PCs, so if
you have a 386 or 486 system gathering dust in the basement, Linux
could give it new life.
</P>
<P>
   THE MOST POWERFUL
</P>
<P>
   Q: How powerful is the world's top supercomputer? I'm 13 and
would like to know.
</P>
<P>
   A: Over the past few years, Intel, IBM, SGI, Hitachi and NEC all
at one time or another have laid claim to having the world's most
powerful supercomputer. In every case, it's a computer that uses
hundreds or even thousands of conventional processors like Pentiums
to form a cyberbrain in which each processor does a small part of a
big job. The result is what's called massively parallel processing.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the top computer in the world, according to a list
published by the University of Mannheim, is the Intel ASCI Red,
which is installed at the Sandia National Laboratory in
Albuquerque, N.M. It uses 9,742 Pentiums and can perform 2.1
trillion operations per second. Second place belongs to SGI's ASCI
Blue Mountain at Los Alamos National Laboratory in Los Alamos, N.M.
IBM is planning a version of its RS/6000 SP supercomputer _ to be
installed at the Lawrence Livermore Lab next year _ that will be
capable of 10 trillion calculations per second. That means it will
be able to do in one second what it would take you 10 million years
to do with a hand calculator.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frustrating things about notebook computers is
that sometimes the cursor can be hard to see on the screen. This is
particularly true when the lighting situation is bad, such as when
you're outdoors. To make the cursor easier to locate, do the
following: Click the Windows Start button, point to settings and
choose Control Panel. Double-click the Mouse icon and click the
Motion tab. Then check the box labeled ``Show pointer trails'' and
click Apply. This will give the cursor a fleeting comet tail when
you move it.

 IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH _ WEB SITES OFFER HELPFUL DATA  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Dr. Ed Penhoet, dean of the University of
California at Berkeley's School of Public Health and vice chairman
of Chiron Corp., likes to conduct a little market research whenever
he speaks at public gatherings.
<P>
   ``How many people here have used the Internet to look for health
information?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the audience, he says the question always elicits
a sea of hands _ anecdotal evidence to support what the experts
say: The Internet is fast becoming the place where people turn to
find out about staying healthly or coping with disease.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Staff, chief economist with Zona Research in Redwood City,
Calif., offers several reasons for the Internet's growing
popularity as a medium for health advice:
</P>
<P>
   -- The abundance of Web sites offering easy access to
information that used to be found only in medical libraries.
</P>
<P>
   -- The ability to make queries anytime and in almost complete
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   -- The existence of online discussion groups where people from
all over the world can share their experiences with
sometimes-obscure diseases.
</P>
<P>
   But like everything else in cyberspace, the real challenge &LR;   &LR; in
searching for health information is not finding something _ it's
finding exactly what you want to know, and from a reliable source.
</P>
<P>
   No single Web site lists and ranks every online offering. But to
help jump start a health search, here are some suggestions for
sites of proven usefulness, reliability and ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic reasons to begin a health search: Either you
or someone you know is sick and you want to learn everything you
can about the illness, or you're in good health and you're looking
for information or products to help stay that way.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with illness as a motivation and then move to the
wellness search. Addresses for all Web sites mentioned are listed
in an accompanying chart.
</P>
<P>
   As a biotech reporter, I constantly encounter new ailments. My
first stop on many stories is Citeline.com, a San Francisco service
that lets people search for information about virtually any
disease. It provides definitions, articles about the latest
treatments and other facts to get you up to speed in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Citeline.com sells an advanced version of its database to drug
and biotech firms, so the information is high caliber. But the
basic service is, and will remain, free, said marketing director
John Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Doctors
</P>
<P>
   Once you've found out a bit about your disease, you might want
to look for a physician who specializes in its treatment. The
American Medical Association maintains a nationwide directory of
physicians that you can search by specialty and state.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, your choice of physician is probably limited by your
health plan. But it may be useful to know where you can turn for a
second opinion. The AMA page has another great advantage. It
reveals where a doctor went to school, did a residency and earned
credentials _ tools that can help you learn more about any
physician you encounter.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare ailment that isn't treated by some form of
medication. PharmInfoNet is a great place to learn about
prescription drugs, their side effects and possible interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the site. Click on drug info. Type in the name of your
medication. PharmInfo will pull up a list of articles that mention
the drug. No telling what you'll find, but you will learn what has
been written about the drugs you take.
</P>
<P>
   To test the system, I typed in Neoral, one brand name for a drug
that transplant patients take on a daily basis. Up popped an
article about how grapefruit juice interacts with a number of
medications to dramatically increase their effect on the body _
surely a good thing to know!
</P>
<P>
   Support From Others
</P>
<P>
   One way people cope with disease is by joining support groups.
People who've been there and done that are often the best sources
of solace and information. Your physician may steer you to a local
support group. People who suffer from common ailments, like
diabetes or heart disease, can easily find support groups through
the American Diabetes Association or the American Heart
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But it's harder for those with rare or genetic diseases to find
people with similar experiences. Fortunately, the University of
Kansas Medical Center posts an A-to-Z support group directory for
everything from Acoustic Neuroma (a loss of hearing) to Xeroderma
Pigmentosum (extreme sensitivity to sunlight).
</P>
<P>
   When other sources of information fail, try HealthFinder.
Maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services, this Web
site provides a simple way to find the health information that
pours out of government agencies like the National Institutes of
Health or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The nicest thing about HealthFinder is its simplicity. At the
top of the screen is a question box. Type in your query and the Web
site looks for an answer.
</P>
<P>
   I went looking for a central list of clinical trials. These are
experiments, carried on by medical researchers, to gauge the safety
and effectiveness of new drugs or surgical treatments. A person
with a serious ailment who has learned that conventional treatments
won't work might be willing to take part in such an experiment.
</P>
<P>
   HealthFinder pointed me to a series of Web pages that listed
various clinical trials being sponsored or supervised by several
federal agencies, although the list did not seem to include all
clinical trials. Still, enrolling in a trial, provided an
appropriate one is available, could sometimes be a patient's last,
best shot.
</P>
<P>
   Staying Healthy
</P>
<P>
   If you start from the other point, trying to maintain your
current health, there is an even larger universe of sites from
which to choose. Many of these sites also contain useful
information about diseases, but their focus is on how to stay
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of my list would be the Web sites maintained or
sponsored by research centers. The Mayo Clinic and Johns Hopkins
University, two noted medical research centers, both sponsor
excellent pages aimed at laypeople.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you'll be able to find information about diseases and
drugs on either page, but the emphasis is on ways to avoid disease
through diet and exercise.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, clicking on ``nutrition'' on the Mayo Clinic site
leads ultimately to a heart-healthy menu plan emphasizing fish over
meat. Headlines on the Johns Hopkins page talk about how to relieve
the stress of caring for an elderly parent. These pages approach
health in a holistic way, encompassing everything from attitude to
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   A plethora of commercial Web sites have sprung up that dispense
health information while trying to sell you products or services to
maintain your health.
</P>
<P>
   Sorting the reputable sites from the snake oil vendors is
difficult. But the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. government
agency that polices the truthfulness of advertising claims,
recently posted a list of recommended Web sites for health
information.
</P>
<P>
   Koop's Coup
</P>
<P>
   Among the commercial Web sites that won FTC kudos is Drkoop.com,
the new health site launched by former U.S. Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop, who is chairman of the company. The site recently
went public on Wall Street, and America Online this week designated
Drkoop.com as its main health information center, giving the site
huge visibility.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to Drkoop.com shows a mixture of the useful and
commercial. In addition to providing access to medical
encyclopedias, disease directories, and basic nutrition and health
information, the site gives you a chance to buy cancer insurance or
join a weight-loss plan that promises to help you lose 10 pounds in
30 days.
</P>
<P>
   If your interests run toward alternative medicine,
HealthGate.com is another commercial Web site that won FTC
accolades. A quick visit to the site shows a blend of up-to-date
information about cutting-edge biomedical technology, blended in
with New Age techniques like aromatherapy (the name explains it
all) and reflexology (physical techniques, like rubbing the soles
of your feet to help with headaches).
</P>
<P>
   Other Web pages, like OnHealth.com and Caresoft.com, follow the
same approach as Drkoop and HealthGate: They provide health
information as a lure to attract consumers to click on their banner
ads or buy their drugs, vitamins or health products.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these sites are quite reputable. The best way to avoid
those that aren't is to follow the FTC's advice: If a health claim
sounds too good to be true, it probably is.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the FTC did such a good job of listing dependable Web
sites for health information that our best recommendation is to
visit its list.

 SALON.COM TO SELL TICKETS TO PERFORMANCES  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Nothing like the whiff of e-commerce to pump up an
Internet stock.
<P>
   Salon.com's stock shot up nearly 17 percent Wednesday, jumping
$1.81 to close at $12.75, after the San Francisco online magazine
announced a deal to sell tickets to cultural events on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   That's after Salon's critics had been panning the company for
its lack of e-commerce offerings. Such sniping was a big factor in
Salon's initial public offering failing to soar last month. While
other dot-coms typically ascend on takeoff, Salon.com opened June
22 at $10.50, closed its first day at $10 and hovered in the single
digits all last week.
</P>
<P>
   Few investors saw the merits of a Web site with provocative
literary journalism, yet without the market-making potential of a
Priceline.com. For e-commerce, all Salon offered was a link from
its book reviews to Barnesandnoble.com.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Salon does offer the kind of educated, well-heeled and
Internet-savvy audience that an e-commerce company craves _
particularly a company like New York's CultureFinder.com, which
sells tickets to more than 350,000 theater, ballet, opera and
symphony performances in 1,300 cities on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tied right into the kind of readership we have,'' said
Andrew Ross, vice president of business and strategic development
at Salon.com.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Salon covers the arts but rarely reviews arts
events. The new deal means Salon is likely to beef up its reviews
later this year. ``We should do more and we will do more,'' Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. Salon and
privately held CultureFinder will develop a ``co-branded'' site at
www.culturefinder.salon.com, which should be online by August 1. In
addition, Salon's sales force will sell ads on the CultureFinder
site. The two companies also plan to link the ticket sales into
discussion groups about arts and entertainment, such as Salon's
TableTalk and the Well communities.
</P>
<P>
   Salon says this is only the beginning. The firm plans to plunge
into more e-commerce deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a growing part of our business,'' Ross said.
``The trick is to do it right and choose the right partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross couldn't say whether the stock market uptick validated the
deal. He just chuckled and said, ``The day traders are having fun
at last.''
</P>
<P>
   SECOND THOUGHTS: It turns out Cnet didn't really want the
Presidio anyway. Or Cnet CEO Halsey Minor has talked himself out of
the plum, since the Presidio Trust chose to give the former
Letterman Hospital property to Lucasfilm Ltd. instead of to the
Shorenstein group that included Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those buyer's remorse things,'' Minor said in a
phone interview. ``I literally think it may end up being the kind
of deal where it takes you two extra years to move in. Already,
environmental groups are looking to sue. Our company can't look at
a move-in date two years out. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The other bad part about being there _ don't get me wrong, it
would have been wonderful _ but there's no other place to expand.
We would have had to put people across town.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing to Lucas has some benefits, too. ``Now, everybody's
coming out of the woodwork wanting to try to help us. People know
we're looking,'' Minor said. ``Our preference would be to stay in
the city, but we're not ruling out leaving. We have to look at all
options.''
</P>
<P>
   TECHIES ON THE TUBE: Several of the Internet's marquee media
firms, including Cnet, have made various television announcements
in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Net may be a new medium, but its stars know that television
still has staying power. TV not only makes money _ something hard
to come by on the Web _ but it also promotes the online product.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, a weekly show on investing called
``TheStreet.com'' will debut on the Fox News Channel. It will be
co-produced by the online financial news site and feature former
CNBC anchor Brenda Buttner.
</P>
<P>
   Cnet, which already produces television programs for cable
syndication, will be archiving six months' worth of shows at a time
on its Web site. The shows aren't Webcast, but they'll go on the
site close to airtime and stay up for six months. Cnet will use the
shows' closed-caption text to enable people to search, so they can
go right to the segment of the show that's relevant to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the Web is all about,'' said Cnet CEO Minor.
``It's not about trying to stream this stuff and watch it for half
an hour. People are not there to be entertained. They're there to
learn something.''
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the company's strategy to gear up as more people
get high-speed connections to the Net _ connections that will
enable them to see video easily.
</P>
<P>
   Minor said Cnet will see how the experiment goes, tweaking it if
necessary, before it tries to make any money out of it. ``The Web
works best when you get the user experience to work right first,

<P>
   SPLITTING THE GATE: As the owners of Chronicle Publishing Co.
investigate the sale of some or all of their assets _ including
this newspaper and KRON television station _ the company Web site,
SF Gate, is in the strangest position of all.
</P>
<P>
   SF Gate employees are happily ensconced in their cavernous new
office in the KRON building on Van Ness Avenue. They moved from
their ground-floor digs in the same building into the former
third-floor studio two months ago and hung inflatable toys,
including a giant horseshoe, from the tall ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   A staff of 40 produces original content, and also puts content
from The Chronicle, Examiner, KRON and cable station BayTV onto the
site at sfgate.com.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to federal rules adopted after Chronicle owners bought
KRON, no one can own a television station and newspaper in the same
city _ making it likely that The Chronicle could be sold to one
company and KRON to another.
</P>
<P>
   In that scenario, it's unclear which entity would end up with SF
Gate _ or if it could go to yet another company entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible,'' SF Gate General Manager John Coate
said. ``Until some bids come in, there isn't a way to know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's somewhat reminiscent of last year's deal in which Conde
Nast bought Wired magazine but didn't acquire its Web site. The
site still has an arrangement to post the magazine's archival
content, and they share the brand name.
</P>
<P>
   SF Gate might have to move if it's cleaved from KRON, but the
loss of content wouldn't be a killer. ``Television is very
polished, very produced and does not play well on the Web,'' Coate
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, SF Gate is ``being positioned to go with the
newspaper,'' Coate said. ``Nothing would affect our traffic
overnight like a loss of Chronicle content. That would be a
supermarket without much food on the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   CLOSING WINDOWS: Let us mourn the passing of a fine publication,
Windows magazine, which this week takes leave of its glossy,
tactile realm and will hereafter reside strictly in cyberspace, at
www.winmag.com. Windows was published by CMP Media, which last year
shut down the print operation of venerable Byte magazine in favor
of online-only publishing.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the news, CMP, which is now a division of San
Francisco's Miller Freeman, said ad pages for magazines covering
the desktop computer market had declined 23 percent in the first
five months of this year.
</P>

 CONSUMERS PAYING HIGHER CHARGES FOR LONG-DISTANCE  &HT;     By DEBORAH SOLOMON 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- You can reach out and touch someone, but the costs
are going up.
<P>
   A study conducted by a San Francisco consumer group found that
some customers are paying higher monthly charges to long-distance
carriers than they were a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   While long-distance rates have come down in price, more phone
companies are requiring that customers pay either a monthly fee or
a minimum amount each month, according to a survey by Consumer
Action of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 21 phone company calling plans now charge a
fee compared with 11 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And none of the big three long-distance carriers _ AT&AMP;T, MCI
WorldCom or Sprint _ offers a calling plan without a monthly fee or
minimum spending requirement. That leaves consumers with fewer ways
to avoid hefty bills.
</P>
<P>
   The study, released Wednesday, also found that monthly charges
are on the rise, with the maximum fee imposed on customers soaring
to $25 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the highest monthly fee charged by a long-distance
carrier was $4.95.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not say how much the average customer pays per
month in fees.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, Sprint and MCI WorldCom generally charge between $3 and $5
in monthly fees and minimums. Some companies, like Qwest, charge
$14.95 per month but offer rates of 5 cents per minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies, in the absence of being able to make money on
rates, are stepping in there with fees and minimums,'' said Linda
Sherry, the survey's lead researcher. ``And these fees are hurting
the people who don't make a lot of calls and who can least afford
high bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The group identified just five smaller carriers with low
per-minute rates that don't charge monthly fees.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly minimums are imposed on customers who don't sign up for
a calling plan or those who choose a ``basic rate'' plan. The
minimum requires that a customer pay a set amount each month,
regardless of how many calls they make. For example, if a company
sets a $5 monthly minimum but a customer makes only $2 in calls per
month, the company will charge the customer an extra $3.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly fees are imposed on customers who sign up for calling
plans with low per-minute rates. In exchange for getting 10 cents
per minute, for example, a customer usually will have to pay about
$5 per month. Customers who qualify as low-income are exempt from
most minimums and fees.
</P>
<P>
   The long-distance companies defend the charges as a way to
recoup costs.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1996 Telecommunications Act was passed, the
long-distance carriers have been required to pay fees to fund
federally mandated programs. Most companies have passed along those
fees, which pay for services like wiring classrooms and libraries
to the Internet, to consumers. The government does not require that
the fees be passed on, but most companies have done so to recover
their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Other fees are access charges that long-distance carriers must
pay local phone companies. Those also are passed along to
consumers, who generally pay between $1 and $2 per month in fees.
</P>
<P>
   But to impose those fees, long-distance companies now have to
generate monthly bills for all customers, regardless of whether
they made any calls that month. That costs money, which the
companies need to recoup, said Brad Burns, an MCI spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to generate bills now that we didn't have to generate
before, and we have to field calls from customers that before, we
didn't have to field,'' Burns said. ``We have shareholders to live
up to, so we most definitely have to recover these costs. We're not
a not-for-profit company.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer advocates said the long-distance carriers have
found a convenient way to siphon additional money from customers
while technically not increasing rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have consumers over a barrel. Rates may not be going up,
but these charges certainly are,'' said Regina Costa, a
telecommunications analyst with The Utility Reform Network, a
consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials say the increased fees and minimums don't add up
to much on a customer's monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about cents here in most cases,'' said Andy
Boisseau, an AT&AMP;T spokesman. He defended the increases, saying his
company's costs have been rising.

 GYMBOREE PLANS BIG MAKEOVER  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Gymboree, the troubled Burlingame, Calif.,
children's wear retailer, announced a wholesale makeover Wednesday
of its outdated stores, fashions and even its logo.
<P>
   It also said its loss for the second quarter will reach 55 to 60
cents _ up from a previous estimate of a 2-cent loss.
</P>
<P>
   Amid declining sales, the company will close 12 poorly
performing stores out of its total of 589. The makeovers and store
closures will cost the company $13.5 million (35 cents per share).
It also expects a per-share loss from operations of 20 to 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Melanie Cox, Gymboree's president, was recruited from trendy
teen retailer Urban Outfitters earlier this year to bring Gymboree
up to date.
</P>
<P>
   Cox plans to revamp the children's line to pay more attention to
trends rather than adhering to Gymboree's signature bright colors.
The company is also jettisoning its traditional coordinated
ensembles in favor of separates.
</P>
<P>
   Stores' selling floors will be opened up to eliminate the
alcoves where matching ensembles are now displayed. Clothing for 4-
to 7-year-olds will be moved to the front of the store and
separated distinctly from the baby and toddler area, since older
children dislike shopping in a ``baby'' store, said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   Storefronts, fixtures, signs, labels and the Gymboree logo will
also be modernized.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's turnaround announcement had a similar ring to
changes announced in years past. Gymboree has been trying to get
its act together since late 1995, when inventory problems and
fashion mistakes contributed to a dismal holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially what they're saying here is that it's going to be
a bigger project than they expected,'' said Jeanne Kraus, an
analyst with First Security Van Kaspar in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Cox agreed. ``The difference here is that rather than
manipulating an outdated brand, we have ... determined that the
entire brand needed to be updated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask a customer what they think of Gymboree today and
five years ago and five years before that, how much has the picture
really changed?'' Cox asked. The answer: not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think next year at this time when you think about Gymboree
you will think very differently about it,'' said Cox.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, the planned changes were influenced by
Gymboree's new Zutopia chain, which targets children ages 7 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Zutopia, with 10 stores, carries more fashionable clothing than
Gymboree and fun merchandise like space alien dolls, inflatable
chairs and Pop Rocks candy. Stores feature a disco ball and
Nintendo games to play.
</P>
<P>
   Positive consumer response to Zutopia helped convince Gymboree's
decision-makers that kids _ and their parents _ prefer trendier
merchandise than the traditional Gymboree offerings, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine more Zutopias will be opened by the end of the year. Cox
declined to say how many are planned for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, store renovations and new styles of apparel will be
seen at Gymboree beginning this fall. Early next year, customers
will begin to see new storefronts and signage.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are expected to yield improved financial results
next year, said Gary White, Gymboree's chief executive and
chairman, in a press release.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the turnaround strategy announced Wednesday,
Gymboree said sales for the five-week period ending July 3 declined
20 percent to $40.9 million from $51 million in the same period
last year. Sales at stores open at least a year plummeted 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed much of the problem on unpopular boys'
fashions, which retail analysts have said are too brightly colored.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: In your hatred, hate yourself
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benjamin Smith, in his suicide, was his own last hate-crime
victim.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry for the pop psychology, but it is hard to imagine that
Smith could have come to the vicious and obsessive racism that sent
him on his killing spree if the hate had not found in him a ready
emptiness to fill. Where goodness is gone, venom finds an
indifferent void.
</P>
<P>
   A man who can discover his own worth only by declaring the
worthlessness of others _ who has no more to say for himself than
to cite the markers of his race or color or the accident of some
ethnicity _ is desperately incomplete and fatally sad.
</P>
<P>
   In that, of course, however singular his acts, Smith was not
alone. Indeed, the World Church of the Creator _ and here's another
outfit degrading the word ``church'' into an obscenity _ claims 42
chapters for its parodic liturgies of racism and anti-Semitism.
</P>
<P>
   For its other hates as well: It counsels banning immigration and
homosexuality, too, while it's at it. And its web site offers a
children's page, with a simple crossword puzzle and an online
coloring book that tutor hate to the very young.
</P>
<P>
   The church's is only one of some 250 hate-mongering sites on the
Internet. Hate is one of the web's most vigorous growth industries,
and not surprisingly if you think about it. Out in cyberspace, the
vile can find and reinforce each other, free from the usual social
restraints that come of disapproving neighbors and disgusted
co-workers. There, sick personalities can fester and flourish, the
evil blooms of self-fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's church denies, of course, any link between its mad
preachings and Smith's assaults and murders. But its constant
battle cry is RAHOWA, mock-arcana for the racial holy war it hopes
for. It will connect you to the Anti-KOF Webring (Kosher Order of
Faggots). Its Ohio site will lead you to ``Skinheads of the Racial
Holy War.'' It sells books like ``On the Brink of a Bloody Racial
War.''
</P>
<P>
   If it were so that all this did not overflow into real-world
violence, like a backed-up sewer, the absurdities could be laughed
off as a kind of running sick joke. The church ballyhoos a house
band called the SS Bootboys and its leader styles himself the
pontifex maximus. These people are fools, clowns who don't even
know they are running around with floppy feet and big red noses.
</P>
<P>
   But there IS a connection to the violence. Words have outcomes.
``Creators,'' as they aggrandize themselves, have been linked to
other murders, to assaults, to bombings and other vandalism in
Florida, California and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   From a presidential aspirant (Pat Buchanan) bugling his troops
to religious and cultural war, to religious fundamentalists
anathematizing homosexuals, to the spite merchants of rant radio
and to the politics of character assassination, we are perfecting
the rhetoric of mutual estrangement and dehumanization. We husband
our differences to the neglect of our community.
</P>
<P>
   We are playing chicken with ourselves. It is a lug's game.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Tobacco jury finding may be addictive
 &HT;    (For release July 11, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Five men and a woman, after listening to witnesses and
viewing documents for a full year, have torched the tobacco
industry in a class-action suit held in a Miami-Dade courtroom. It
was an overwhelmingly significant jury verdict and opens the door
to similar suits in the 49 other states, and possibly other class
actions claiming illness or death of one kind or another from other
products.
</P>
<P>
   With damages not yet set by the jury, we are anticipating a
finding for billions of dollars. There remains a long road to the
ruination of Big Tobacco, however. Appeals and, eventually, the
Supreme Court likely will prolong this one for years.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not Big Tobacco ultimately coughs up the money, the
Miami decision nevertheless was a huge blow. The jury said, in one
count, that nicotine is addictive, that some of the tobacco
companies colluded to misrepresent information relating to the
health aspects of smoking cigarettes and that smoking cigarettes is
responsible for a wide assortment of diseases including aortic
aneurism, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, kidney cancer, lung
cancer, coronary heart disease ...
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the United States, or maybe the entire world, there
are people today saying, ``See, I told you so!'' In truth, the
decision was not so revealing about the facts regarding tobacco;
the Surgeon General's Office has been telling us about that for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   What Big Tobacco was arguing in its defense was that people,
already informed by the Surgeon General's Office, continued to use
cigarettes and therefore should not be compensated for their own
stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   That's a point well made but apparently not enough to hurdle the
larger question, particularly that about conspiring to misinform
the public.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Big Tobacco, if there can be any good news out
of this, is that the jury held that asthmatic bronchitis,
infertility and bronchioalveolar cancer are not caused by smoking.
</P>
<P>
   As a smoker who quit in 1983 _ and thus almost an anti-smoking
missionary _ I do have an expectation that similar suits will pop
up in the other states, a continuing stream of litigation _ almost
as addictive as the cigarettes themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So, what of the future? First, of course, is the determination
of damages. With 500,000 Floridians signed onto this suit, the
assignment of damages will be humongous. When a jury can award a
woman millions of dollars for accidentally spilling boiling hot
coffee in her lap at McDonald's, what can we expect of the Miami
decision?
</P>
<P>
   While some hold that this decision will lead to the death of the
tobacco industry, don't hold your breath. Big Tobacco probably
could raise the price of a pack by 50 cents and still find enough
willing smokers to get back their money in a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   With the finding of the addictiveness of nicotine, however, does
there not arise a possibility that either the federal government or
state governments will tinker with legislation that would treat
nicotine as a drug? I know of few doctors who would write a
prescription for Camels or Kools.
</P>
<P>
   This case really didn't tell us anything most of us already
knew. What it did was set a precedent for forcing Big Tobacco to
clean up its act and, eventually, will set a punishment price tag
for the lies and deceits it already has broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Big Tobacco cannot escape the now chiseled image of an industry
covertly colluding to keep information from the public, or to sway
them into doing something that is not in the best interest of their
health.
</P>
<P>
   No overturning of a lower-court decision, or reduction of
punitive damages, ever can alter the findings of those six jurors _
one a smoker _ who sat diligently for an entire year, going through
more information than most of us tread through in a lifetime.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: GOING FOR THE SOFT KILL
 &HT;    For release Sunday, July 11
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When colorful fireworks rose into night sky on July
4, Bill Clinton and his guests watched from the Truman balcony.
It's but one of many presidential perks.
</P>
<P>
   While the U.S. Treasury underwrites the Clintons' comforts, the
taxpayers' largess doesn't extend to their bank account. Actually,
the First Family is ``under water,'' as Wall Street bean counters
would put it. The $1.6 million that Clinton stands to earn in eight
rent-free years at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue won't cover his huge
scandal-fed legal bills, despite generous help from wealthy donors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's nemesis, President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia,
portrays the same scene in reverse. In the course of a 78-day air
offensive, NATO bombs smashed the Serbian leader's home. Meantime,
the CIA has traced his considerable liquid holdings to accounts in
Switzerland, Hong Kong, Russia, Cyprus and the Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Washington, the NATO partners have mounted a quiet effort
to seize, or at least freeze, as many of these hidden assets as
possible, on the reasonable grounds that they reflect the
ill-gotten gains of an indicted war criminal.
</P>
<P>
   Should that goal fail, Clinton is building another kind of
bridge to the 21st century. Under a secret presidential directive
signed in May, the president ordered the CIA to wage cyberwar
against Milosevic, using the spy agency's hackers to tap into the
foreign banks and, if possible, drain his estate.
</P>
<P>
   One need not shed tears for the Butcher of Kosovo to question
the wisdom of employing what CIA Director George Tenet describes as
``dual-use'' technology to deliver a digital blow. The reciprocal
use, which Tenet fears, would be an attack by the nation's
adversaries on mission-critical U.S. computer systems, employing
technology that he observes ``can be quite inexpensive and easily
concealable.''
</P>
<P>
   Poison gas, a major battlefield weapon in World War I, was
shelved in World War II. Those decisions were not driven by humane
concerns: 10 times as many people died in the later conflict as in
the earlier one, including a larger share of innocent civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Gas wasn't deployed because it's hard to protect fighting troops
from a
</P>
<P>
   retaliatory attack. For similar reasons, perhaps the time has
come to declare a moratorium on cyber-warfare.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, U.S. officials privately scoff at the notion of
yielding the opportunity of landing a ``soft kill'' on Milosevic's
fortune, after 11 weeks of hard warfare failed to unseat him from
power.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they note, he started it. They cite a little-known bid
by the Serbians in December 1990 to shatter neighboring Croatia's
information systems as the two former Yugoslav republics pulled
apart. Ironically, the Serbian scheme to overload Croatia's
relatively primitive phone and data networks was routed through the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In war, unlike in football, an offensive force can unexpectedly
and quickly be thrown on the defensive. Infowar advocates should
bear that in mind, even as they argue that computer sabotage is a
more compassionate way to do battle than launching fireworks of the
lethal variety.

 &HT;    Why Silicon Valley? Follow the money
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Question: Why do George W. Bush and Al Gore go
to Silicon Valley?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: The same reason Willie Sutton gave for robbing banks _
because that's where the money is.
</P>
<P>
   So the Texas guv has racked up a cool $36-plus million in his
first few weeks of fund raising for a presidential run. Big bucks
to you and me, yes.
</P>
<P>
   But to Bill Gates, whose net worth now hovers around $90
billion, that's chump change _ way less than the interest Gates
earned on his money just during the three days W. was in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, just as W.'s troops are crowing that they may pass up
the federal matching funds system so they can go toe to toe with
Steve Forbes' personal deep pockets, the cluck-cluck of criticism
begins.
</P>
<P>
   It's led by Bush rival U.S. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) who
co-sponsored a failed effort in Congress to limit runaway ``soft
money'' contributions to political parties by corporations, labor
and others. McCain did not mention Bush and wasn't talking about
circumventing the individual campaign-spending limits.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain picked the same day Bush chanted his new fund-raising
figures to call for politicians to wean themselves from ``special
interest'' government. Speaking in New Hampshire, McCain issued a
``patriotic challenge'' to Americans, ``declaring war on the
cynicism that threatens our public institutions, our culture and,
ultimately, our private happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed public officeholders _ yup, he is one _ ``for the
sickness in American public life today. It is we who have
squandered the public trust. We who have, time and again, placed
our personal and partisan interests before the national interest,
earning the public's contempt for our poll-driven policies, our
phony posturing, the lies we call spin and the damage control we
substitute for progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we are the defenders of a campaign-finance system that is
nothing less than an elaborate influence-peddling scheme in which
both parties conspire to stay in office by selling the country to
the highest bidder.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong words. Doesn't sound like someone angling to be W.'s vice
presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   (However, George Bush the Elder still got the VP nod from Ronald
Reagan _ just weeks after tagging Reagan's claim he'd balance the
budget, even while cutting taxes and increasing defense spending,
as ``Voodoo Economics.'')
</P>
<P>
   But even without singling Bush out, McCain's campaign spending
criticism hit the Texas governor.
</P>
<P>
   Already a Wall Street Journal story said Bush was undermining
the last vestige of the post-Watergate efforts to limit spending.
Headline: ``Flush Bush Undercuts Federal Funding of Campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times editorialized that Bush's bypassing the
spending limits ``is a serious mistake for a candidate who promises
to practice a new and better brand of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, if you're accusing someone of trying to buy the
election with special-interest cash, you've got to figure out a way
to get that message out.
</P>
<P>
   The story in The Wall Street Journal, and the criticism by The
New York Times, will be read by some people and spread a little
further by some of the TV networks.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't keep coming up over and over again _ unless McCain
or someone else can come up with the money to put it on TV, over
and over. Not likely Forbes will do it, since he'll also be
circumventing the matching funds approach as he seeks to buy the
nomination with his personal wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush, if his re-election campaign in Texas is a
guide, will use that money for saturation TV exposure in Iowa and
New Hampshire, and other early primary battlegrounds. There'll be a
bunch of good-guy ads about a Bush who cares about education,
people, good government, personal responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain and the others who do accept matching funds will have
a lid on how much they can spend in the primaries, and in each
state _ even if they could raise it. Bush, who already enjoys
saturation name identification because of Dad, presumably will
bypass those limits.
</P>
<P>
   Money may not necessarily buy happiness, but it can buy an awful
lot of TV. That's what drives American politics _ and Bush knows
it.

 &HT;    Listen up, nerds: You've been insulted with the wrong word all
these years
 &HT;    By Gregory Kallenberg
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Who would have ever thought the Fonz could be
wrong? That the man who gave us the universal sign for ``I'm OK,
you're OK'' _ a thumbs up and an ``Ayyyyyyyy!'' _ could err in his
word usage? And that his errant usage would have such an impact?
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Fonzarelli's lexical mistake would usually take place in
Arnold's over a spilled shake or a ``bonehead'' move by Potsie or
Ralph Malph. After such an incident, the leather-jacketed one would
shake his head (as only he could) and then, with arms akimbo, utter
the word that quickly took the world by storm: ``Nerd!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nerd'' soon became the rote insult used against the bookish
and technologically advanced. When computers first came out, their
users were labeled nerds. When the Internet connected us, anyone
online was called a nerd. Bill Gates was crowned by Newsweek as
``King of the Nerds'' and The New York Times' J.C. Herz recently
declared, ``It's now cool to be a nerd.'' Wired magazine has more
than 17,000 ``nerd'' references in their database, Excite.com shows
more than 21,000 sites with the word ``nerd'' somewhere in them _
and how could we forget those delightful ``Nerds'' candies? And to
think, of all people, Fonzie was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the mistake wasn't in the reprimanding of his two
acquaintances: Potsie and Ralph were bungling characters who
deserved constant verbal spankings. The question is whether these
two were ``nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, Dr. Seuss published ``If I Ran the Zoo.'' In it was a
picture of a perturbed, furry Chester A. Arthurlike character that
Seuss labeled as a ``nerd.'' There was a short mention (''I'll sail
to Ka-Troo and Bring Back an It-Kutch a Preep and a Proo a Nerkle a
Nerd and a Seersucker, too!'') and no further explanation.
According to the Oxford English Dictionary and Terry O'Connor,
renowned etymologist and author of ``Word for Word,'' the next time
the word appears is in a 1957 Scottish Daily Mail article, ``ABC
for SQUARES,'' in which ``nerd'' is defined by a catty Scot writer
as ``a square, any explanation needed?''
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Fonz would note my defeat by laughing that
Fonzie laugh and telling me to ``Sit on it!''
</P>
<P>
   Hold on, Mr. Fonzarelli. The next time the word appears is in
1970, in the book ``Current Slang.'' The book defines ``nurd''
(sic) as ``an uninteresting person, a `dud.' '' According to the
book, nerd is supposedly derived from the practice of calling
someone who didn't drink a ``knurd,'' which is ``drunk'' spelled
backward. Our friends in Arnold's weren't necessarily
uninteresting, and who knows whether they boozed it up or not?
</P>
<P>
   Though not a hot point in the etymological world, experts have
argued about the origin of the word ``nerd.'' Most agree Dr. Seuss
is the true originator of the term but define it as a ``comically
unpleasant creature.'' Etymologists guess ``nerd'' was picked up by
5- and 6-year-olds in 1950 and passed on to their teen-aged
siblings, where the definition became ``a square.'' While
buffoonery and boneheadedness are indeed reprehensible, Ralph and
Potsie are beyond being called ``nerds.''
</P>
<P>
   Better hold that ``Sit on it,'' Fonz; the law of lexicon rules
against you. Maybe on the reunion show, when your friends start
spilling shakes, you can find a better noun than ``nerd.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you insist on using your sugar-coated expletive, at least
make sure that the script calls for a Ralph Malph and Potsie that
more closely resemble the term's true meaning, the meaning that Dr.
Seuss intended. In other words, make sure they're played by a
couple of perturbed, furry Chester A. Arthurlike characters.

 &HT;    Talk about feminine mystique; how about this one?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The 11-year-old in our house came in from the
darkened driveway distraught. A favorite shirt he'd acquired had
been stripped of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Ruined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not true, I said. Buttons can be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   He was not soothed. He grabbed a flashlight and went on a button
hunt in the front yard. He emerged sweaty and defeated. His grim
report to his mother: Button lost. Shirt ruined. World ended. (I
think bedtime was calling.)
</P>
<P>
   He slumped toward his room in utter dejection. Knowing it wasn't
the end of the world, his mother regardless heaved a sigh, got up
and headed out the door with the flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't 30 seconds later that she returned. Maybe it was 15
seconds. The button was in her hand. Her smile was straight from
Michelangelo's brush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Uterus thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I can't tell you how many times I've heard those words, and
marveled at the meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The uterus is all-knowing. Nothing is lost if the uterus is
around.
</P>
<P>
   I did not assign the credit as so stated. It came from my wife.
She thinks it's a biological, female thing. She can find any lost
item. Or her uterus can.
</P>
<P>
   As the sole female in a house of males, she lays it on heavy and
often about her know-it-all plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   This truly must be one of those biological-survival,
nest-instinct things. She doesn't have a photographic mind. She
admits her long-term memory is faulty. In fact, she needs picture
books to recall the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But she can find anything she looks for around our house, or her
uterus can. Am I to assume that all mothers have this spooky
quality?
</P>
<P>
   I imagine this mysterious power as akin to that of the divining
rod, the stick that tells the surveyor where the underground water
is. Maybe it's like the capillary action that draws a pooch to a
fireplug. If it's something of value to our family, it calls out to
Mom's innards like a beacon from the deep.
</P>
<P>
   Call it biological. Call it psychic. It never fails. And my wife
always lets us know about it _ those of us who are
bio-psycho-kinetically challenged, that is, those of us who are
males.
</P>
<P>
   I'm so sold on this power that I expect it to come into play on
the campaign trail once women decide they can exploit their power.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton says of candidate Rudolph
Giuliani, ``He says he thinks he can find a solution to the
long-term solvency of Social Security. I have a uterus. I have no
question I can find it.''
</P>
<P>
   (This of course begs the question about those Whitewater-related
billing papers Hillary couldn't find until they suddenly
materialized. The uterus can find anything the bearer wants to
find.)
</P>
<P>
   I've often advocated the need for a woman president, and for a
host of reasons, in part because females are less likely to look at
people as interchangeable parts (each having had a mama.)
</P>
<P>
   Now I think of the feminine mystique in leadership not just in
abstract but in utilitarian terms. Put a uterus in charge of our
country to answer some nagging mysteries:
</P>
<P>
   Where is Jimmy Hoffa?
</P>
<P>
   What about that ozone hole?
</P>
<P>
   What became of most of Rush Limbaugh?
</P>
<P>
   We don't know where the networks found Jerry Springer, but can
you find someplace where we could deposit him and no one could find
him again? Try where Hoffa is.
</P>
<P>
   What about finding the missing link between animal and man?
(That which predates Limbaugh.)
</P>
<P>
   A woman running the country would explore recesses not probed by
mankind in the search for answers to all that ails us.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that America has lost its soul. A uterus can find it.

 &HT;    Buffett show aims to capture the spirit of Atlanta fans
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Parrotheads, it's time to claim your 15
minutes of fame.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it's probably only six or seven. But when a crew from
NBC's ``Today'' show hits town this week to document the antics of
these exuberant music fans _ whipped into a quasi-tropical frenzy
by the annual concert appearances of their hero, pop singer,
entrepreneur and mystery novelist Jimmy Buffett _ it will be a sign
that the Parrotheads have come of age.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially true of the Atlanta Parrothead Club, which has
the distinction of being the oldest such outfit in the country.
Founded in 1989 after Buffett enthusiast Scott Nickerson placed a
two-line classified ad in the free weekly newspaper Creative
Loafing, the group spawned a nationwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were using Jimmy as a medium,'' says Nickerson, 38, who
quit his corporate day job five years ago to follow his bliss,
singing and playing percussion in a Buffett tribute band called
A1A. ``It was just a really off-the-cuff idea. Then my phone
started ringing off the hook.''
</P>
<P>
   There are Parrotheads _ loosely anyone who shows up at a Buffett
concert _ and then there are Parrotheads, officially someone who
frequents Parrothead Club functions, which include anything from
weekly happy hours to picking up trash on Peachtree Street.
</P>
<P>
   Coinage of the name is usually attributed to former Eagles
member Timothy B. Schmitt, who, while on tour with Buffett in the
1980s, supposedly likened the singer's fans to ``Deadheads with
Hawaiian shirts _ Parrotheads,'' says Nickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, unlike the Grateful Dead fans known as Deadheads or their
late '90s successors, Phishheads _ young fans of the improvising
rock band Phish _ Parrotheads neither bathe in patchouli nor twitch
and twirl as if at a Summer of Love ``be-in.'' They've got too many
frequent flier miles to be part of the counterculture. And though
they might take a few days off to catch some Buffett concerts,
they've usually got to be at work in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Such distinctions are important to the faithful Parrothead, for
whom, says Nickerson, fellowship and community service are as
important as the wacky garb. It's something that impressed the
``Today'' staff when Buffett made a recent appearance on the show,
cheered on by a gazillion sign-waving Parrotheads.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to show the world that Parrotheads are not a bunch
of drunken beach bums,'' says Roland Woerner, a ``Today'' producer
who will spend this morning filming local Parrotheads at work and
Saturday night amid the riot of plastic shark fins, blender drinks
and Carmen Miranda headgear at Lakewood Amphitheatre in Atlanta,
where Buffett concludes a two-day stand. The segment is scheduled
to air July 28. Says Woerner, ``They have real jobs and real
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, on nights like a recent Friday. Sporting the
de rigueur Hawaiian shirts, brandishing Cuban cigars and sweaty
bottles of Miller Lite and Heineken, a trio of manly Parrotheads is
holding court on the patio of Hemingway's, a Key West-themed bar on
the square in Marietta. Inside, A1A (the title of an early Buffett
album and, of course, the name of a coastal highway in Florida) is
tuning up to play several hours worth of Buffett cover tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, no one would think to nominate the Parrotheads as an
oppressed minority group, but they insist it's true. These people
are misunderstood. They need to clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think we Parrotheads worship Jimmy Buffett,''
says Wade Jenstead, 28, an Atlanta-based sales manager who is one
of about 160 members of Atlanta's Parrothead Club. He contends
that's an overstatement. ``We just all enjoy his music. All of us
got to be really good friends because we have the same lifestyle.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffett is simply a role model, not the incarnation of the
divine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does what we want to do,'' says Joel Oates, 39, of
Norcross, who runs the customer support department of a medical
supply company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have some diehard guys,'' Jenstead continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffett is God!'' Oates interjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the extreme. We love all kinds of music. We're
going to see Poison tonight,'' Jenstead says in a way that lets you
know he won't be within 10 miles of that pop metal band's concert.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Myers, the 35-year-old leader of the Atlanta Parrotheads,
summarizes the group's raison d'etre: ``Tell corporate society to
get bent. Work three months of the year and spend the rest of the
time in the Caribbean.''
</P>
<P>
   Since this won't happen soon, gatherings such as this one
re-create a ``Margaritaville'' of the mind. A1A _ Nickerson and
singer-guitarist Jeff Pike _ mugs its way through a batch of
pun-laden tunes by Buffett and his harmonica player, Greg
``Fingers'' Taylor. Mildly risque by ``South Park'' standards, they
celebrate a distinctly relaxed '70s attitude toward the use of
alcoholic libations and carnal knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Frivolous as it seems, however, Buffett's music has inspired
proceedings at Parrothead weddings and Parrothead funerals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had really planned a traditional wedding,'' says Felicia
Myers, a 30-year-old computer programmer who met husband Wayne on
the job five years ago, when she mentioned reading Buffett's latest
novel. ``It's just the stuff that everybody brought in. I looked
around and wondered, `Where did all the coconuts come from?''' As
tuxedos were shed to reveal Hawaiian shirts, and blenders
materialized as if from thin air, the new couple was toasted in
true Parrothead style.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the Myerses are still celebrating. As A1A rollicks
through ``Fins,'' Buffett's saga of shark-infested waters, they're
in the middle of a narrow dance floor with about 20 other
Parrotheads, shaking their hips and making snapping shark-jaw
motions with their forearms and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Myers flashes a cigar-stoked smile. ``Stick around,'' he
says. ``It gets a whole lot worse.''

 &HT;    Exotic birds' beauty balances responsibility of care
 &HT;    By Katherine Ullmer
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ In the back room you can hear them meowing,
whistling like madcap sailors and making raucous noises.
</P>
<P>
   Walk in the front door of the Sugarcreek Bird Farm Inc. in
Bellbrook, and a cheery ``Hel-lo'' will greet you.
</P>
<P>
   Store owners Paula and Pete DiSalvo will likely stop whatever
they're doing to see who Katie, their resident parrot, a green
yellow-naped Amazon, is greeting.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's a false alarm. Katie is just looking for
attention, a few pats on the head and snuggles from Pete, or a word
or two from Paula, food or a toy to play with. At other times, she
decides to entertain, calling ``Whoa ... whoa,'' while swaying on
her perch as if on a roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard for a bird not to be jealous when surrounded by
150-plus other exotic birds of beautiful plumage _ big, deep-blue
hyacinth macaws with yellow eye rings, rose-breasted cockatoos,
African greys _ with multiple verbal skills, including meowing like
cats and whistling like sailors.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-July the Bird Farm, which specializes in exotic birds and
other bird-related items, like seed mixes, nuts and veggies, cages,
toys, harnesses, bath sprays, DNA sex testing, and boarding and
grooming, will be moving to a real farm about 2 1/2 blocks away.
The DiSalvos live on a 10-acre farm in Bellbrook, where they're in
the midst of renovating an outbuilding into a store.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a larger space, which we needed,'' said Pete DiSalvo.
</P>
<P>
   The DiSalvos, who also own the International Pro Bike Shop next
door to their bird shop, breed and raise most of their birds, so
they've limited store hours to have time to take care of their
breeding stock. Caring for the babies (there are about 60) means
feedings every two hours.
</P>
<P>
   A ban was placed on importing exotic birds in 1992, Pete DiSalvo
said, ``so everything now is domestically raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Turn left when you enter the store and you'll find the breeding
area with birds in all stages of growth. On a recent day, several
dozen small eggs were waiting to hatch in an incubator. In a coffee
cup in the corner of the incubator, a 3-day-old Quaker parakeet
raised his featherless head in ``feed-me'' fashion. Nearby, fluffy
brown baby pheasants the size of chicks, destined for the DiSalvo's
farm, scurried around in a small pen. Black baby Eclectus parrots
ran around in another pen, while African greys, Lories, and Amazons
rested in cages. Sleepy-eyed blue and red greenwing macaws about 7
or 8 weeks old and already bigger than the Amazons, were taking a
siesta.
</P>
<P>
   Some people like to raise their own pet birds, DiSalvo said, so
they buy them at a young age. ``We show people how to hand-raise
them and how to mix the formula and to feed them,'' he said. ``We
give them instructions on how to do it. We don't just hand them
over to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The DiSalvos breed 25 types of pet birds, from $25 American
parakeets to blue-throated macaws costing $1,600 and the rare,
deep-blue, 40-inch hyacinth macaw, the Rolls Royce of birds and a
macadamia nut lover, which costis $8,000 to $10,000. For several
breeds on the endangered species list, like the bright yellow
Golden Conure, the DiSalvos have a special government permit to own
and breed them.
</P>
<P>
   Raising the birds from egg to adulthood allows them to be
handled, touched and get used to humans, Pete DiSalvo said.
Imported birds that grew up in the wild often didn't make very good
pets, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shop is constantly busy. If they're not taking phone calls,
the DiSalvos are helping customers pick out seed or toys for their
birds, trimming wings, or grinding down nails and beaks.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, Sue Humphrey, 50, of Bellbrook, stopped in to
buy a special seed mix for her yellow-naped Amazon, an anniversary
present she and her husband, Steve, gave one another. Her husband
named him Nacho, she said, so he'd learn to say, ``I'm Nacho
parrot.'' They've had him 2 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just keeps us laughing,'' she said. ``He clowns, talks,
answers the phone and sings 'Nacho, Nacho Parrot.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ben Saettel, 12, and his brother Nick, 16, of Centerville, came
in to buy some feed and have their birds' wings clipped and their
nails done. Ben said his English parakeet, Buddy, is the Michael
Jordan of the bird kingdom. Buddy says ``I scored'' whenever he
dunks his ball in the water dish.
</P>
<P>
   Nick chose a larger (about 11 inches) Quaker parakeet, whom he
named Bob, because he wanted a bigger bird that would talk better
and be more personable. ``He mimics about anything you do,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Only the male of the parakeet and cockatiel species talk, while
both male and female macaws and Amazons talk, Paula DiSalvo
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Deb Moore, 43, and her daughter Lisa, 16, of Bellbrook, picked
up Bailey, their gray and white cockatiel, who had been boarded at
the shop while they were on vacation. They said they stop in about
once a month. The birds in the back room seemed to know them, as
they started whistling, saying hello and squawking as the two moved
about.
</P>
<P>
   Though the DiSalvos have had their store just four years,
they've been working with birds for more than 30 years. Pete
DiSalvo said his love of birds started as a child. He had a pet
crow the family rescued and also a cockatiel. When he and his wife
married 30 years ago, a friend gave them a cockatiel as a wedding
present. Then they got an African grey and an Amazon. What started
as an avocation grew into a vocation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides running their bike shop and bird business, the DiSalvos
sponsor the Dayton Bird Expo, a bird fair and auction featuring 40
to 50 exhibitors, held three times a year in the coliseum at the
Montgomery County Fairgrounds. The next expo will be Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   While most people think exotic birds are beautiful, they should
give careful thought to becoming a bird owner, DiSalvo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bird is a real big commitment,'' he said. ``They can be
loud. They can be messy. They like to chew on things. They require
a lot of time (to exercise) and a lot of patience. But they're like
a dog or cat in terms of companionship,'' he said, ``and in
addition to that they can talk. They're very affectionate.''
</P>
<P>
   They're also aware of one's presence or absence, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As customers left the store, Katie called out, ``Bye-bye.''
</P>
<P>
   The gang in the back room meowed, whistled and squawked.

   LOOK WHO'S TALKING
</P>
<P>
   If you are buying a bird for its talking ability, it's good to
remember that although all parrots can mimic to some extent, not
all talk with the same ability or extent of vocabulary. Among the
parakeets and cockatiels, only the males talk.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pete DiSalvo of Sugarcreek Bird Farm Inc.:
</P>
<P>
   _ The best talkers: Amazons and African greys. They are capable
of saying 100 to 200 words and imitating all kinds of sounds. The
Amazons are extroverts who like to scream and yell, hang upside
down and entertain, while the African Greys are quieter, laid-back
birds that don't always talk on command or in front of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fairly good small bird talkers: Indian ringnecks (small
parrots with long tails) and Quaker parakeets (larger than American
and English parakeets) can have a 20-30 word vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limited talkers: Cockatoos (lovers who like to cuddle); macaws
(big gaudy birds who can learn about a dozen words); Meyers and
Senegal parrots (small African birds that are fairly shy and not
good talkers); cockatiels (males learn up to a dozen words but
whistle a fair amount of tunes); parakeets (males can learn 20 to
30 words but usually are hard to understand because they whisper);
Patagonian conure (four or five words) and Pionus (Maximillan) _
not a very good talker; black-head caique and white-belly caique
(not good talkers but playful, comical birds); Blue Streak and
Rainbow lories (about five words, but playful and comical antics).

earlier ages, of weight and body image. Eating disorder specialists
say we're now into the second generation of dieters, and that
parents are unwittingly passing on their hyperawareness of food and
weight to their kids at early ages. Kids notice that the fridge is
full of fat-free or light condiments; they overhear their moms
complain that they're ``too fat.'' We talk to nutritionists and

Fitzpatrick created this 20-acre hilltop Eden. Or the pre-Civil War
era of their tiny cottage, surrounded by flowers and trees. Or even
the distant days of their impressive collection of ancient Greek
sculptures. For beneath all of that, quite literally, is the
footprint of a cataclysmic event that occurred some 80 million
years ago. Toward the end of the age of the dinosaurs, the county
seat of Wetumpka was hit by a meteorite that left a crater four

summer while a soft breeze fans your face _ all in the tranquil

partly nostalgia, partly decorative and mostly, just plain
relaxing. (Dayton Daily News). 25. HEAT-COMFORT _ A couple weeks

   BUFFETT-PARROTHEADS _ The Parrothead phenomenon. Unlike the

They've got too many frequent flier miles to be part of the
counterculture. And though they might take a few days off to catch
some Jimmy Buffett concerts, they've usually got to be at work in
the morning. Such distinctions are important to the faithful
Parrothead, for whom fellowship and community service are as
important as the wacky garb. It's something that impressed the
``Today'' staff when Buffett made a recent appearance on the show,
cheered on by a gazillion sign-waving Parrotheads. (Dollar, Atlanta

   EXOTIC-BIRDS _ In the back room you can hear them meowing,

``Hel-lo'' will greet you. Store owners Paula and Pete DiSalvo will
likely stop whatever they're doing to see who Katie, their resident
parrot, a green yellow-naped Amazon, is greeting. It's hard for a
bird not to be jealous when surrounded by 150-plus other exotic
birds of beautiful plumage _ big, deep-blue hyacinth macaws with
yellow eye rings, rose-breasted cockatoos, African greys _ with
multiple verbal skills, including meowing like cats and whistling

   EATING-DISORDERS _ Janet Seay's 9-year-old daughter already
reads nutritional labels when deciding what to eat. Little Caitlin
doesn't have an eating disorder, but more and more preteens are
turning up with them _ because kids are increasingly aware, at
earlier ages, of weight and body image. Eating disorder specialists
say we're now into the second generation of dieters, and that
parents are unwittingly passing on their hyperawareness of food and
weight to their kids at early ages. Kids notice that the fridge is
full of fat-free or light condiments; they overhear their moms
complain that they're ``too fat.'' We talk to nutritionists and
psychologists about adolescent eating disorders as well as to
``healthy'' families about how they eat and how they view
themselves. (Kim, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 50 WITH

until you've done it yourself. After the memory of all the hassles
subsides, a certain elation sets in from enduring it all. Johanna
has flown 19 times now, and I look at loading up all her
necessities like the provisioning of a small miltia. Keeping this
29-pound dervish entertained for an amount of time in close

Jasmine Hill Gardens, sometimes referred to as ``Alabamas Little
Corner of Greece,'' it's easy to lose yourself in the past. Not
just the near past of the 1920s, which is when Benjamin and Mary
Fitzpatrick created this 20-acre hilltop Eden. Or the pre-Civil War
era of their tiny cottage, surrounded by flowers and trees. Or even
the distant days of their impressive collection of ancient Greek
sculptures. For beneath all of that, quite literally, is the
footprint of a cataclysmic event that occurred some 80 million
years ago. Toward the end of the age of the dinosaurs, the county
seat of Wetumpka was hit by a meteorite that left a crater four

LORNA LUFT AND A TALE OF TWO JUDIES

entertainment column) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of singer Lorna
Luft and of her as a baby with her mother, Judy Garland. 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The role of Judy Garland may seem impossible to cast, but Lorna
Luft _ daughter of the legendary singer and author of the book on
which an upcoming television film will be based _ thinks she's
found the right woman for the role.
 &HT;    ``She is my dream to play my mother _ she has such
vulnerability,'' Luft says. ``She was my first choice, the absolute
top of my wish list.''
 &HT;    The object of her delight is the Oscar-nominated Australian
actress Judy Davis, who has been signed to play Garland in a
three-hour-long ABC adaptation of Luft's best-selling book ``Me and
My Shadows'' (Pocket Books, 1998), about the enormously talented
but tragic singer, who died too young at 47 in l969.
 &HT;    Garland may be gone, but she seems very much present in a bare
rehearsal room in Hollywood. On a huge television screen, Garland
is singing one of her hit ballads, ``I Can't Give You Anything But
Love,'' while just a few steps away, Luft is singing with her as a
duet.
 &HT;    She's rehearsing her new one-woman show, ``Songs My Mother
Taught Me,'' first launched in May in Atlantic City and due to play
other North American venues into 2000. And, yes, some of those
songs _ including Garland's signature tune, ``Over the Rainbow'' _
are sung, through the wonders of modern technology, as duets with
Garland herself.
 &HT;    Suddenly the picture on the giant screen changes. It's footage
from one of Garland's 1960s television shows.
 &HT;    ``I have a daughter who's pretty angry because nobody has ever
written a song about her _ until now,'' she says.
 &HT;    Then the camera pulls back to show the mother facing the
dewy-eyed 6-year-old, and Garland sings ``Lorna'' to her little
girl. When the song ends, mother and daughter embrace.
 &HT;    In l999, the scene still brings tears to the eyes of the
46-year-old Luft, who has stopped to watch.
 &HT;    A bit later, more collected, Luft sits in a shady corner outside
the rehearsal room to talk about her two favorite Judies.
 &HT;    ``Judy Davis is an extraordinary actress, and she has all the
tools to play my mother,'' she says. ``Look at her wide-ranging
work, going all the way back to `Passage to India' (1984) _ she can
do anything. When I heard she was interested in doing a musical, I
told my producer, `Boy, do we have a story for her.'''
 &HT;    The cast of characters includes Luft, her brother Joey and their
father, producer Sid Luft, as well as their half-sister Liza
Minnelli, daughter of director Vincente Minnelli. But everyone else
seems dwarfed by their mother, whose talent was matched only by her
propensity for self-destruction.
 &HT;    ``I didn't want to glorify or to vilify my family,'' Luft says.
``I want to tell a truer and much more interesting story about a
group of people who grew up in the public eye and got through it
the best they could.
 &HT;    ``Sure, we were a dysfunctional family _ but what family
isn't?''
 &HT;    By the time her 30-year-old mother gave birth to her, Luft says,
Garland had been hooked on prescription drugs for almost half her
life. The three children grew up having to look after their
constantly ailing mother.
 &HT;    Garland's personal problems ran in the family: Luft chronicles
her mother's drug escapades and her sister's drug problems, but is
equally candid about her own cocaine and alcohol habits, as well as
her troubled romantic history, including affairs with Barry Manilow
and Burt Reynolds.
 &HT;    Today, Luft admits, she has no relationship with Minnelli. The
two daughters of Judy Garland haven't spoken in years, and Luft
doesn't know if Minnelli is even aware of her one-woman tribute to
their mother.
 &HT;    ``I wish Liza the best,'' Luft says sadly, ``but we are not
close. We once were. But I have chosen to live my life without her
for now.''
 &HT;    As for Garland, many of her problems were traceable to drugs,
Luft believes.
 &HT;    ``When she was a teenager and doing `Wizard of Oz' (l939), they
fed her benzedrine to help her lose weight and cope with the
exhausting film schedule,'' she says. ``Doctors were ignorant about
treatments for addictions. Sure, they had A.A. in those days, but
women didn't go. And movie stars _ are you crazy?
 &HT;    ``Today it's so different,'' she adds. ``There's the Betty Ford
Center and clinics like Hazelden to help. But in those days a star
going into rehab could have kissed her career goodbye.''
 &HT;    Luft was a troubled teen-ager when Garland entered the final
stages of her long decline, and made frantic, ultimately futile
efforts to save her mother.
 &HT;    ``It led to my own breakdown from severe emotional and physical
exhaustion,'' she says. ``One by one my mother had worn us all
down.''
 &HT;    Today the singer proclaims herself better than perhaps she's
ever been. Since 1996 she's been married to Englishman Colin
Freeman, a musical arranger who leads the orchestra for her
one-woman show.
 &HT;    She has two children _ 15-year-old Jesse and 9-year-old Vanessa
_ from an earlier marriage, and says that the book, the television
movie and the one-woman show are all part of her effort to help
them understand the grandmother they never knew.
 &HT;    ``I want to tell them who their grandmother was,'' she says.
``After all, `The Wizard of Oz' is part of their legacy.''
 &HT;    Luft admits to being nervous about the show.
 &HT;    ``You have to make friends with the legend first,'' she says.
``It took me a long time to do that _ I fought who I was related to
for a long time. I remember, early in my career when I was trying
to break into the record business, an executive called and said,
`Why don't you do a disco version of ``Over the Rainbow?''' I got
out of that place fast!
 &HT;    ``When your parent is a public idol, you never really have a
chance to lay that parent to rest,'' she muses. ``I am reminded
daily of my mother's life and her death. Every day I miss her and I
miss the relationship she would have had with my kids.''
 &HT;    In some way, she says, she sees her show as an embodiment of
that relationship.
 &HT;    ``It took me a long time to pluck up the courage to do it,'' she
says. ``But writing the book helped me come to terms with my mother
and her legend. Then I heard Nancy Sinatra say that we have a
responsibility to keep our parents' legends alive in the proper
light. I agree. It's vitally important that people don't forget
what they left us.
 &HT;    ``Frank (Sinatra) was my godfather,'' she adds, ``and for a long
time there were just the two great artists, Frank and my mom. They
are no longer here, but we mustn't let people forget.''

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Although not widely used today, the split door,
which is more commonly known as a Dutch door, has been around since
the early 1600s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of the split door is found throughout much of rural
Europe,'' said Roderick Blackburn, architectural historian, author
and antiques dealer in Columbia County, N.Y. ``It was originally a
convenient way to keep kids in and pigs and other animals out. It
created a social distance by allowing you to communicate with the
public, without having them in your home.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to privacy, the split door provided ventilation and
natural light.
</P>
<P>
   Blackburn also noted that dense populations made the split door
popular in rural towns and cities to keep vermin, neighbors and
vendors at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Split doors aren't used on houses very much today,'' Blackburn
said. ``They are basically a quaint survival of years past. I've
seen them in Greece, Norway and Spain.''
</P>
<P>
   Dutch doors also can be found on barns and stables, where the
top half can be opened for ventilation, while keeping animals in,
or locked together for use as a standard door.
</P>
<P>
   Dutch doors may be custom ordered to add a bit of country charm
to your home, barn or garage.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the material, size, finish and whether or not glass
inserts will be used, split doors cost $500 and up.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ On a day that is uniquely ours, a day in which
we are supposed to reflect upon the greatness of this 223-year-old
nation, another disaffected, disturbed, hate-filled white male went
on a violent rampage.
</P>
<P>
   Covering two states in the heart of the country, he used two
illegally purchased handguns to kill an African-American in Skokie,
Ill., and a Korean doctoral student in Bloomington, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting from behind the wheel of the best-selling American car
(a Ford Taurus), the man wounded nine other members of racial or
ethnic minorities and missed hitting several others.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as so many disaffected, disturbed and hate-filled white
males have done, Benjamin Nathaniel Smith absented himself from the
bloody mess he'd made by sending a bullet through his own chest.
</P>
<P>
   With the remnants of our own holiday weekend still around us _
the spent coals in the Weber bellies, the empty beer bottles in the
trash, the sunburned noses peeling and Old Glory in need of furling
_ how many of us felt shamed by what Smith did on the Fourth of
July?
</P>
<P>
   How many of us white Americans _ people who Smith believed are
inherently better and more deserving than any other group of
Americans _ felt ashamed that he was one of us?
</P>
<P>
   The more likely response was to distance ourselves from Smith as
fast as we could. Yes, he was a child of privilege. Yes, he and his
parents were well educated. Yes, he grew up in an affluent,
predominantly white surburb.
</P>
<P>
   But he was a crazy man. Screwed up. Busted for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Vociferous white supremacist. Woman batterer. Fanatic.
</P>
<P>
   Abberational.
</P>
<P>
   What if Smith had been black or Jewish? Of Asian, Latino or Arab
descent? What if he had turned his .22-caliber pistol and Bryco
.380 semiautomatic only on innocent bystanders who looked Anglo?
</P>
<P>
   Would we white Americans be so quick to distance the gunman from
his group? How many of us would have felt anger and a need for
vengeance arise? What racial slurs would have sprung to many minds
or lips?
</P>
<P>
   How many law-abiding blacks, Jews, Asian-Americans,
Latino-Americans or Arab-Americans would have been condemned by
sweeping generalizations about ``those people''?
</P>
<P>
   What retaliatory violence _ or mass suspension of civil rights _
might have been considered justified if the targets of hatred had
been white?
</P>
<P>
   Something gave Smith the idea that it was his duty as a white
man to turn talk about driving racial and religious minorities from
the country into reality. Something convinced him that it was a
patriotic, supremely American gesture to stalk black, Asian and
Jewish citizens on the Fourth of July and shoot them down like
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Shrinks and 12-steppers tell us that, in the individual, shame
is a toxin that must be expelled for our recovery to mental and
emotional health. Religious leaders and ethicists tell us that we
have so purged ourselves of individual shame, there isn't enough
left to inspire collective shame; its absence is a poisonous
deficiency in any healthy society.
</P>
<P>
   Smith felt shame _ that his first name sounded too Jewish, so he
began to call himself ``August.'' Across his chest, he wore a
tattoo: ``Sabbath Breaker.''
</P>
<P>
   In the yearbook of his upscale high school, he chose as his
favorite a Latin quotation: ``Sic semper tyrannis'' _ ``Thus ever
to the tyrants.'' That is the same phrase John Wilkes Booth uttered
after he assassinated President Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Nathaniel ``August'' Smith. Disaffected, disturbed,
hate-filled murderer. Proud to call himself a white man, proud to
think of himself as one of us.

GOOD `PIE': COMEDY MIXES EQUAL PARTS TEEN SEXUAL ANGST WITH GROSS
HUMOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ELVIS MITCHELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The new comedy ``American Pie'' doesn't seem new. It shrewdly
rekindles the spirit of the 1982 raunch-comedy, ``Porky's,'' where
every member of the cast was obsessed with sex. But _ surprise _
``Pie'' manages to be both smart and calculating. In the end, the
movie is about romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pie'' is another of those high-school movies where the
protagonists make a pact, placing it squarely in the new-school
tradition of ``She's All That'' and ``10 Things I Hate About You.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, four friends, all seniors, resolve to lose their
virginity. The most determined, and the most hapless, is Jim (Jason
Biggs). It's Jim who makes the moves on the apple pie (which has a
hilariously spelled note on it). It's Jim who blows his cool when
he gets a chance to be alone with another kind of deep-dish, the
willowy foreign exchange student Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). And
it's Jim whose father (played by a wonderfully deadpan Eugene Levy)
tries to walk him through the minefield of adolescent sex.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) and his longtime girlfriend (Tara
Reid) are trapped in the classic teen movie dilemma _ wondering
when they should go all the way. ``Pie'' is made of ``classic''
gambits: Oz (Texas Christian University student Chris Klein, who
made his laid-back debut in ``Election'') is a jock who discards
the in-your-face approach to chasing women for the sensitive route
to get Heather (Mena Suvari, a doe-eyed wonder); Finch (Eddie Kaye
Thomas) is the odd man out, an obsessive-compulsive bohemian with a
dry, arch delivery who carries a thermos of mochaccino wherever he
goes.
</P>
<P>
   These guys all seem like such confident smoothies _ with the
exception of Jim, whose heart rises up into his cartoonishly bright
eyes whenever he gets near a girl _ that we know it's only a matter
of time before they get what they want. To its credit, ``Pie''
doesn't say that the quest makes them better people. It sees the
joke in their shallow obsession, and the fact that humiliation is
never more than a heartbeat away for any of them.
</P>
<P>
   The women here aren't degraded or treated as meat. For the most
part, they're creatures whom the foursome just can't understand.
The wisest is Jessica, played by Natasha Lyonne with a mature rasp
and a levelheaded grasp of the games being played out. At 17, she's
already a veteran of the relationship wars, and she knows when to
keep her distance. Alyson Hannigan, as a chattering band-geek who
goes after Jim, knows exactly who she is, too. That's what all the
young women have in common: They know what they want. They have the
real power. It's the guys who can only concentrate on sexual
conquest, just like real life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pie'' is set in the moneyed suburban paradise that John Hughes
brought to the screen for teen movies, without the
``in-every-dream-a-heartache'' angst that gave a little Tang to his
white-bread settings. (Here, that setting is emphasized when we see
Oz and his girl in a choir doing lite-FM versions of R&AMP;B classics.)
Instead, the brand of bad taste that ``National Lampoon's Animal
House'' helped to institutionalize is prevalent (for example,
there's a super-laxative joke).
</P>
<P>
   But the bad taste is so energetic and good-natured that it
almost doesn't matter if it masks cynicism; the script is as
determined to score as the fellas. The straightforward direction by
Paul Weitz spreads on such CoolWhip optimism that's it hard to be
offended by the material.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``American Pie'' doesn't traffic in the Ivy League
ruthlessness of Hughes or ``Animal House,'' pictures whose
go-for-the-gusto crudeness clearly inspired it. Instead, it's got a
heart, and enough of a brain to not pass judgment on its
characters.

ADULT ENTERTAINMENT STARRING THE FIRST COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton managed to arrange his
national poverty tour so he can be at the Rose Bowl Saturday to
watch the American women's soccer team play the Chinese women in
the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, there are poor people in shorts. Soccer is underfunded.
Once again, the president is multitasking.
</P>
<P>
   The dirty-old-man-in-chief just wants to watch young women run
and sweat, you say. His wife is doing that in 100-degree weather in
New York, and he's in comfy La-La Land to watch women dribble and
head the ball and kick the bejabbers out of each other.
</P>
<P>
   You could say our president just like sports, but it gets worse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to be at the Bonaventure Hotel in Los
Angeles on Thursday, the same day the Adult Entertainment Expo sets
up shop in the same hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has promised not to bother us, and we promised not to
bother him,'' said a woman I talked to who works for the adult
video expo.
</P>
<P>
   And no, Clinton's famous X-rated, Kenneth Starr-directed video,
``Bubba Redefines Sex,'' is not up for an award.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything in politics. The same week Clinton is in
Los Angeles for the adult video convention and women's soccer
match, his wife launched a historic run for the Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   None of this can be a coincidence. Very little happens in the
Clintons' life by coincidence. They can't even take a vacation
without strategic planning, polling and focus groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' life is one of eternal triangulation.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts believe that Hillary Rodham Clinton's
popularity stems from voters' sympathy for her because of her
husband's affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   What better strategy could there be than for Hillary Clinton to
start campaigning while the president is sharing a hotel with the
leading figures of the adult entertainment industry?
</P>
<P>
   It reminds voters of last year's nonstop White House porno loop,
and thus the Hillary Clinton sympathy vote grows. Then voters turn
on the TV Saturday, and there's the president again, appreciating
women and the sporting life.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, no matter who wins the soccer finals, the first lady
should be breaking out of her statistical tie in the polls with New
York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani may have a clean Times Square on his side, but Hillary
Clinton has a dirty husband.
</P>
<P>
   And no, a statistical tie was not the kind of tie Lewinsky gave
the president.
</P>
<P>
   When Hillary Clinton was campaigning in Republican-dominated
upstate New York on Wednesday, she dodged a question about whether
she was the beneficiary of a sympathy vote.
</P>
<P>
   All she said was, ``I look forward to meeting with New Yorkers.
I think they will have a lot to tell me.''
</P>
<P>
   What? She thinks New Yorkers will have a lot to tell her? Has
she ever taken a cab or watched a Martin Scorsese movie? Are you
talking to me? Her comment isn't really naive. It's completely
cynical. It's part of a typical Clintonian strategy. Hillary
Clinton's campaign trip upstate was billed as a ``listening
stour.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I hear your pain.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady has moved to address the carpetbagger issue,
saying that while listening and learning from New Yorkers she hopes
``to demonstrate that what I am for is maybe as important, if not
more important, than where I am from.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I feel your doubt.
</P>
<P>
   When a reporter asked Hillary Clinton if she felt it took a lot
of ``chutzpah'' to run for office in New York, she said, ``I'm told
that characteristic is not all bad in certain parts of New York. I
may need a little of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pass the mayonnaise. Pass the white bread. Pass the vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton plans to keep listening in New York all summer.
She is always billed as ``strong on the issues,'' but when asked
what they were she said, ``All I can say is that I care deeply
about the issues that are important in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   She's going to have to do a lot of listening, and fast, the way
New Yorkers talk.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady would only say that as senator she would
emphasize education, health care and ``New York getting its fair
share from Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   This whole thing is completely calculated. Hillary Clinton, like
her husband, has learned never to be too specific, and to find tiny
issues to cultivate like bonsai plants.
</P>
<P>
   No, the Clintons aren't breaking up. They're as unified as mush.
</P>
<P>
   How does that joke go? If Hillary starts dropping in the polls,
all Bill has to do is start dropping his pants.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, though, the folks at the Adult Entertainment Expo
really, really don't want him to.

GROSS-OUT TEEN COMEDY FOLLOWS IN `MARY'S' FOOTSTEPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARLA MATZER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ A lot has happened since Warren Zide and Craig
Perry got the green light from Universal Pictures to make
``American Pie.'' The movie, a good-natured but often raunchy teen
comedy that follows four Midwestern high school seniors who
desperately want to lose their virginity by prom night, opens
today.
</P>
<P>
   First, a movie called ``There's Something About Mary'' came out
while ``Pie'' was in pre-production. That movie's success showed
there was a broad audience for comedies that mix romance and
gross-out humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The studio was a lot more open to our movie when they saw how
well (`Mary') did,'' said Perry, who formed Zide/Perry Films with
Zide two years ago. The two partners are very young _ in their
early 30s _ as is virtually everyone associated with the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Added Zide, ``It definitely allowed us to do things we wanted to
do, which the studio wasn't so sure about at first.'' These things,
which can't be described in detail in a family paper, include a
lewd act with the baked dessert of the title and a sexual reference
to a musical instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as Universal cranked up to market ``Pie,'' theater owners,
under pressure from politicians and parents, vowed to clamp down on
selling tickets to minors for R-rated movies. The filmmakers
remained adamant that ``Pie'' must be R-rated to be funny and true
to its subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, there's nothing we can do about (theater owners
checking IDs); we just have to roll with it,'' sighed Zide, who's
quickly made a successful career out of managing and producing the
work of young writers. ``But,'' he added, ``I don't think this is
the kind of movie that they wanted to stop kids from seeing.
There's no violence in it.''
</P>
<P>
   No violence, but plenty of sexual content and gross-out humor,
which can be just as offensive to some. The pendulum of what's
acceptable in teen-oriented films swings back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit ironic that ``American Pie'' is being touted as the
most raucous coming-of-age tale since ``Porky's'' and ``Fast Times
at Ridgemont High,'' since both those movies were released in the
1980s _ not generally considered to have been an adventurous time
for film. ``American Pie'' follows in their R-rated footsteps, but
comes at a different time in the political/social climate.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Weitz, one of the film's producers and the younger brother
of director Paul Weitz, contends that the movie is actually less
cynical than many of the teen flicks that have recently flooded
theaters. ``This film isn't that spiritually distant from the world
of Andy Hardy,'' said the 29-year-old Weitz. ``The kids are kind of
innocent and naive in their own way.''
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Fast Times,'' ``Pie'' may end up spawning several stars
among its ensemble of little-knowns. Perhaps the best-known young
cast member is Alyson Hannigan, who plays Willow on the WB
Network's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Natasha Lyonne, Mena Suvari and Chris Klein have received notice
for their recent roles in such films as ``Slums of Beverly Hills,''
``The Rage: Carrie 2'' and ``Election.'' Jason Biggs, who has the
movie's largest part, is known to soap viewers from his role on
``As the World Turns.''
</P>
<P>
   But these faces are all fresh, allowing them to portray awkward
adolescents believably. ``A lot of these kids are from the
heartland,'' said Perry of the cast. ``They're not Hollywood teens;
many of them are religious.'' In fact, some of the youths may have
been more cautious than their parents about taking these roles:
Klein was recently quoted as saying that when he expressed concern
that the script might be ``too gross,'' his mother replied, ``Don't
be retarded.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who bears a passing resemblance to Keanu Reeves, seems to
be one cast member who's marked for stardom. He's already filming
his next movie, ``Here on Earth,'' co-starring Leelee Sobieski of
the recent television miniseries ``Joan of Arc'' and ``A Soldier's
Daughter Never Cries.'' To some of the more worldly cast members,
the clean-cut Klein _ who grew up in the Midwest and has attended
Texas Christian University as his work schedule has allowed _ seems
almost hilariously perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's all-American boy ... I'm in shock,'' said Hannigan,
patting Klein on the shoulder. ``I didn't know that people like
Chris existed. I thought it was just something you saw on `The
Brady Bunch.'''
</P>
<P>
   One cast member whose appeal is definitely un-Brady Bunch is
Shannon Elizabeth, who bares nearly all in the film in her role as
a sexy foreign exchange student. As the movie opens, Elizabeth is
capitalizing on it by appearing in a 10-page layout in Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really goes along with my character,'' said Elizabeth,
``and it just seemed like a fun thing to do. (Posing for the
magazine) has always intrigued me, and it seemed like this might be
a good time to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the movie's young stars all say they were impressed with
the script, they also seem genuinely surprised that the movie now
has so much positive ``buzz'' surrounding it. ``
</P>
<P>
   ``It never entered my mind that we'd be here, talking to the
press (about this movie),'' admitted Eddie Kaye Thomas. Baby-faced
Thomas, at 18, is the youngest cast member, but also one of the
most experienced: He attended Manhattan's Professional Children's
School while appearing on Broadway and in movies, beginning at age
12.
</P>
<P>
   Casting young no-names allowed the filmmakers to keep the cost
of the movie down to a reported $11 million, a fraction of what
many star-driven movies cost. This virtually assures Universal will
make money on the film, regardless of whether some box-office
admissions are lost to enforcement of the
no-kids-under-17-without-an-adult rule.
</P>
<P>
   The cast members, like the filmmakers, are trying to be
philosophical about the possible loss of audience. Most think kids
will find a way to get into the film, whether by sneaking in or by
getting parents or older siblings to buy tickets for them. Hannigan
has a particularly creative suggestion for teen-age would-be movie
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say, take the homeless,'' said Hannigan, eliciting a roar of
laughter from her fellow castmates. ``I think they should put that
on the poster.'' &UR;  &QL;

FOR CHILDREN OF FLOWER CHILDREN, IT'S WOODSTOCK AT 30 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE FRICANO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Control is the word for Woodstock 99 organizers
hoping to avoid the surreptitious influx of drugs and alcohol and
to regulate the chaos of crowd-surfing, moshing throngs.
</P>
<P>
   The 30th anniversary of the historic gathering of ``peace, love
and understanding'' is expected to lure 250,000 to 300,000 former
hippies and children of flower children to the decommissioned
Griffis Air Force base.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have devised detailed plans for a mass of humanity
that may transform Rome, a city of about 45,000 people northwest of
Utica, into the New York's third-largest city from June 23-25.
</P>
<P>
   There will be at least 1,250 on-site, unarmed security guards _
the ``Peace Patrol'' _ buttressed by 500 off-site state police
troopers. A strict list of do's and dont's has been compiled. There
will be between 12,000 and 15,000 staff members. And entering the
concert will be akin to boarding a plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not to create an obsessive atmosphere,'' said Ilene
Marder, regional press director for Woodstock 99, ``but control is
the word. We want everyone to enjoy this.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone with a $150 ticket, that is.
</P>
<P>
   Those without tickets made short work of the chain-link fence at
the 25th anniversary mudfest in Saugerties. The ``Peace Wall''
surrounding the Griffis Business and Technology Park will be
12-feet high, and made of steel-reinforced plywood. The world's
longest continuous mural will cover the ``Peace Wall'' to showcase
artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Woodstock has a history of people not having to pay,'' said
Ken Donohue, director of security. ``That's not going to happen
this time.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue said that space is available for up to 200 arrests, and
that judges and assistant district attorneys will be on hand to
expedite justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't break the rules. We don't want to get into the law
enforcement mode of security,'' he said. ``We'd like to help
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the nearly 50 bands, including the Dave Matthews
Band, Metallica, Willie Nelson and the Tragically Hip, festival
goers will be inundated with a cornucopia of food, an X-games-like
action lounge, an after hours rave and more than 200 vendors. And
in case the cash runs low, an on-site ATM will be available for the
vast array of aural, visual and physical enticements.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ticket includes access to so much _ 2,500 portajohns
and shower facilities included _ Marder is urging everyone to go
minimalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have something that would be embarrassing for us to
find, leave it in your car,'' Marder said. As concertgoers pass
through the 200 turnstiles, they will be subjected to metal
detection wands and their belongings will be searched for drugs,
alcohol, weapons and other contraband, Marder said.

   ``One thing that makes a crowd unhappy is if a band walks off
the stage,'' Marder said. ``There's very little that will cause
that, but a bottle flying at them will.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers suggest rain slickers. And everyone should bring a
tent, sleeping bag and pillows and blankets, since sleeping in a
car is also a no-no. There will also be about 2,000 medical staff
and 10 medical stations.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Saugerties concert, beer will be available to the
21-and over set. Those looking to imbibe will be restricted to
three beer gardens spread throughout the village.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bring a driver's license,'' Marder said. Not only will
everyone be carded, there will be a two-drink maximum per trip
inside the tent, and consumption will be confined to the gardens.
</P>
<P>
   With up to 80,000 automobiles expected, parking and traffic have
been a concern for organizers, community leaders and law
enforcement agencies. The two-mile runway along the north end of
the site can accommodate up to 60,000 cars, Marder said. Parking
facilities and access to the 250-acre, semi-wooded campground will
be available beginning at noon July 22. The festival gates open at
noon the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Off-site parking will be available with a free shuttle providing
transportation to the gates.

THIS `ROAD' TAKES SOME FRIGHTENING TURNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The '90s are on view in ``Arlington Road'' _
all-the-houses-look-alike subdivisions, the Internet, tragedies in
Waco and Oklahoma City (with St. Louis acting as a fictional
stand-in for the latter) _ but so are the '70s. Specifically, the
'70s of paranoid thrillers such as ``The Parallax View'' and ``The
Conversation,'' movies that took venerable Hitchockian themes and
gave them a post-Watergate cynical spin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Road,'' directed by Mark Pellington, feels a little like a
pastiche of the genre's movies: a little methodical Alan J. Pakula
paranoia here, a little manic Brian de Palma paranoia there, with
the Hitchockian undercurrent still in place, all wrapped up in
Pellington's music-video background. The surprising thing, given
all these ingredients, is how well ``Arlington Road'' manages to
cohere.
</P>
<P>
   Pellington has the advantage of a great cast. The teaming of
Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins alone will be enough to get some
people into the theater, much like the pairing of Samuel L. Jackson
and Kevin Spacey drew audiences to last summer's mediocre ``The
Negotiator.'' In Hope Davis and Joan Cusack, who play the actors'
significant others, Pellington has two of the most reliable
actresses working today. (Cusack is especially good here, in the
movie's most deceptively subtle performance.) But it's really
Bridges' show, at least when Pellington isn't letting his
hyperactive style get in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Bridges, who wears a look of haunted dishevelment better than
any other actor, plays Michael Faraday, a college professor who's
been troubled ever since his FBI-agent wife was killed in a
standoff with a right-wing group. Ostensibly a government
professor, Faraday obsesses over terrorism to the point where
everybody begins thinking that he's a little nuts, especially when
he starts casting suspicion on his new neighbor Oliver Lang
(Robbins), a nice-guy engineer with a supportive, cheerful wife and
three kids (the characters are brought together through an opening
sequence so eerily striking, you might think you're still watching
trailers for another movie).
</P>
<P>
   Because of ``Road's'' bumpy history _ it's finally hitting
screens after two earlier release dates were postponed _ its
trailer has been around seemingly forever. And it's a lousy
trailer, one that has Internet movie geeks up in arms because it
reveals too much of the film.
</P>
<P>
   They have a point, but then ``Road'' also reveals a little too
much of itself _ Robbins gives an ominous twist to every one of his
lines, and the Lang children appear to have been adopted from
``Village of the Damned.'' The audience never thinks Bridges is
crazy but might start wondering about the sanity of the other
characters.
</P>
<P>
   This is another Hitchcock trick _ letting the audience in on
secrets that the people in the movie don't know _ but Pellington,
in his second feature, doesn't quite pull off the ambiguity needed
to make this work as well as it should.
</P>
<P>
   But Pellington seems virtually alone among music-video grads in
that he wants to make movies, not glorified videos, using the
quick-edit techniques to heighten suspense rather than show off.
And ``Road'' is a step up from the mundanity of his first feature,
the 1997 coming-of-age story ``Going All the Way.''
</P>
<P>
   Pellington doesn't seem quite ready to make ``his'' movies,
though, borrowing heavily from other directors _ an odd habit for
someone who directed the video for Pearl Jam's ``Jeremy,'' one of
the most stunning clips of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy'' addressed high-school violence nearly a decade before
the Columbine High School shootings, which occurred shortly before
``Road's'' second scheduled release date and allegedly had
something to do with its postponement. Studio representatives say
that this isn't the case, but even if it were, ``Road'' still comes
at a time when mass violence is in the news, trailing reports of
race-based slayings in Illinois and Indiana by less than a week.
</P>
<P>
   This makes ``Road's'' themes _ of how life can change in an
instant, and how little we know about the people around us _
fortuitously timely. It also makes the movie, despite its
sharpness, less scary than real life.

TIME REPEATS ITSELF IN `YESTERDAY'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a lot to be said for being first, especially when it
comes to movies forming their own coincidental subgenres. ``The
Matrix'' looks like the best of this year's virtual-reality movies
because it initiated a wave of similarly themed films. Likewise,
last year's ``Sliding Doors'' may have been the best in the latest
series of films about romantic fate, simply because it started that
series.
</P>
<P>
   One of those films was called ``Deja Vu,'' and that's exactly
the feeling you're likely to get from ``Twice Upon a Yesterday,''
at least if you've seen any of the other films in this minigenre.
In ``Twice,'' a boozing slacker actor named Victor (Douglas
Henshall) gets a second chance after screwing up with his
girlfriend. This happens not because of the generosity of her
heart, but because he meets a couple of quixotic characters who
allow him to turn back time and _ well, if he had to do it all over
again, he'd do it differently, right? Isn't that always the way?
</P>
<P>
   It must be the way with a certain brand of filmmaker, the kind
who's so interested in playing with time that you begin to think
that he or she has been spending too many hours in editing rooms
rearranging reality. Maria Ripoll, the Spanish director who made
``Yesterday'' with a mostly British cast, at least has some
interesting visual ideas to go along with all the existential
questing. If you're the most incurable of romantics, it might be
worth seeking out. But even then, you might think that a more
accurate title would be ``Been There, Done That.''

HOW TO GET MORE CALCIUM IN YOUR DIET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It's been all over the news recently: Americans
aren't getting enough calcium. As a result, the body leaches the
mineral from your bones, weakening them and leaving them brittle, a
condition called osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of calcium also may contribute to high blood pressure and
increasing calcium may cut the risk of colon cancer and the
symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   But increasing calcium intake may be difficult and confusing.
Here's help:
</P>
<P>
   Q. How much calcium do I need?
</P>
<P>
   A. That depends. The National Institutes of Health recommends
the following amounts per day: 800 to 1,200 milligrams for children
ages 1 to 10; 1,200-1,500 milligrams for people 11-24 years old and
pregnant and nursing women; 1,000 milligrams for premenopausal
women, postmenopausal women using estrogen and men ages 25-65;
1,500 milligrams for postmenopausal women not using estrogen and
all people older than 65.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What foods are the best sources of calcium?
</P>
<P>
   A. With 300 milligrams of calcium in an 8-ounce glass, milk
contains a lot of calcium. Tofu set with calcium, yogurt, canned
ricotta cheese, navy beans, turnips, broccoli and calcium-fortified
foods such as orange juice, bread and cereal are also good sources.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Wait a minute. I'd have to drink three and a third glasses of
milk to get the calcium I need. That adds 495 calories and 27 grams
of fat every day if I drink whole milk. What do I do if I'm trying
to lose weight?
</P>
<P>
   A. Skim milk contains as much calcium as whole milk without the
fat and calories. Three and a third glasses of skim milk a day
would give you the calcium and only 284 calories and 1.32 grams of
fat.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm lactose intolerant and don't drink milk at all. How can I
get enough calcium?
</P>
<P>
   A. Lactose-free products such as Lactaid usually contain as much
calcium as milk. In addition, there are calcium-fortified
lactose-free products that contain even more calcium.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I eat a vegan diet (no meat or dairy products) for
humanitarian reasons. Can I get enough calcium without compromising
my ethics?
</P>
<P>
   A. Sure. Milk-like products made from soy are frequently
calcium-fortified too. Or, drink calcium-fortified orange juice and
eat food high in calcium such as navy beans, broccoli and collards.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does calcium-fortified orange juice taste different from
regular orange juice?
</P>
<P>
   A. In an informal but blind tasting, five out of 10 tasters
couldn't tell a difference between Minute Maid Premium Original Low
Pulp orange juice and Minute Maid Original Low Pulp Orange Juice
With Calcium. Another four tasters said the difference was
insignificant. The only person who detected a change in flavor
happened to be hanging around when the juices were being poured and
new of the difference in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Q. The National Institutes of Health recommends calcium intake
in milligrams but nutrition labels list calcium amounts in
percentages. How do I calculate how much calcium I've consumed?
</P>
<P>
   A. Add up the percent of daily value of calcium in each food
you've eaten. When you've reached 100 percent, you've gotten enough
calcium for the day, if you need 1,000 milligrams.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm confused. You say I need 1,000-1,500 milligrams of
calcium a day and my husband needs 1,000. According to the
nutrition label on the carton of yogurt I bought, it contains 30
percent of the daily value of calcium. Who's daily value are they
referring to, his or mine?
</P>
<P>
   A. Generally, his. The percentage of daily value of calcium
indicated on the label is based on the amount of a nutrient
required for most adults (1,000 milligrams). If you have higher
calcium needs, you'll have to eat more of a food to get the same
percentage of your daily value.

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of actor Thomas
Jane confronting an immense shark in a scene from ``Deep Blue
Sea.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Think ``Jaws,'' only more of them. And bigger. With more teeth.
Lots more teeth.
 &HT;    Think genetically manipulated sharks, with new brainpower, new
cunning, new imagination ... and the same old appetite.
 &HT;    No wonder they're calling it ``Jurassic Shark.''
 &HT;    Actually, the studio's name for director Renny Harlin's new
sci-fi thriller is ``Deep Blue Sea.'' Opening July 30, it's about a
group of scientists who, seeking a cure for Alzheimer's disease,
genetically enhance a laboratory group of sharks _ and,
predictably, learn not long thereafter that it's not such a good
idea to mess with Mother Nature.
 &HT;    ``Technically, I guess you'd have to call the movie sci-fi,''
Harlin says over a drink at the swank Mercer Kitchen in Manhattan.
``It's not sci-fi in the sense that `Star Wars' and `Star Trek' are
sci-fi. They're set in space, in a different time, on other worlds,
and they have aliens. `Deep Blue Sea' is set here and now, with
real people.
 &HT;    ``It could almost happen,'' the director adds. ``We're
practically there, with all the gene therapy and cloning that's
going on now. The film is more science fact than sci-fi, more like
`Jurassic Park' in that sense.''
 &HT;    Unlike Steven Spielberg's crew on that 1993 classic, though,
Harlin and company didn't rely on computer-generated critters. They
filmed real sharks and created a variety of mechanical sharks for
closeups and sequences in which the sharks interact with cast
members. Only a few shots added CG sharks to the mix.
 &HT;    ``If the sharks are not convincing, the movie is not
convincing,'' Harlin says. ``I would not have done the movie if we
couldn't see that our sharks would work. They're ferocious
creatures, very realistic.
 &HT;    ``On more than one occasion they scared the s--t out of the
actors,'' he adds. ``That only made the performances more real.''
 &HT;    Delivering those performances are Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane,
L.L. Cool J, Deborah Kara Unger, Stellan Skaarsgard and Michael
Rapaport as the crew aboard the floating science facility, and
Samuel L. Jackson as the businessman funding their project.
 &HT;    Jackson is the film's biggest name, but he's still a notch down
from the true A-list of stars _ which, Harlin says, is no accident.
 &HT;    ``The movie needed to come in at a price,'' he says, ``and I
wanted the money on the screen.
 &HT;    ``Also, if you have too many names in a movie like this, you get
into issues of who dies and when,'' he adds. ``Certain stars won't
do a movie if they die. Other stars will only die if they go out
heroically in the last scene.
 &HT;    ``I needed actors who could be part of an ensemble,'' the
director concludes. ``I wanted the audience to care about everybody
and believe in these people, even if you don't always like them or
what they do. Too big a presence in this movie would have rocked
the boat.''
 &HT;    The early buzz on ``Deep Blue Sea'' is encouraging, tagging it
as a solid sci-fi/actioner with a good shot at swallowing up a
chunk of the summer box-office take.
 &HT;    If so, it couldn't come at a better time for the Finnish-born
director. It's been a long time since the late 1980s and early
1990s, when ``A Nightmare on Elm Street IV,'' ``Cliffhanger'' and
``Die Hard 2'' marked him as an action-adventure master. After his
past two films, the disastrous pirate epic ``Cutthroat Island'' and
the under-performing thriller ``The Long Kiss Goodnight'' _ both
starring his then-wife, Geena Davis _ Harlin could use a hit.
 &HT;    ```Cutthroat Island' got out of hand,'' Harlin admits. ``We had
actor problems, boat problems and weather problems, and as soon as
the problems started, we were called a `problem' film.
 &HT;    ``Then, after we finally got it finished, nobody put any money
into promoting the film,'' he says. ``We never had a chance. It's
not a horrible film, and I'm not embarrassed by it.
 &HT;    ```Long Kiss' was a different story. It was not a big hit, but
it had a very good opening weekend and it's well-regarded in the
industry,'' he says. ``People who saw the film liked it, and it did
very well on video.''
 &HT;    Still, Harlin acknowledges that he has a lot riding on ``Deep
Blue Sea.''
 &HT;    ``If it's not successful, the studios may think twice about
using me again ... until I make something else that's successful,''
he says.
 &HT;    ``I've actually already won part of the battle,'' he adds.
``After `Die Hard 2' and `Cliffhanger,' I didn't think I could do
anything wrong. What happened with `Cutthroat Island' and `Long
Kiss Goodnight' made me less arrogant.
 &HT;    ``Also, `Deep Blue Sea' came in on time and on budget, and I
needed to show that I could do that. I think the film came out
well, and now hopefully the reviews and the box office will back
that up.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Only two sports events in Massachusetts history are
likely to have more impact on the economy: the 100th running of
Boston Marathon in 1996 and the Ryder Cup upcoming in September at
The Country Club in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's All-Star Game opens with the John
Hancock FanFest at the Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center
Friday. Companies are striving to promote the game and the events
surrounding it, hoping to polish their images by association.
Tourism officials see a promotional bonanza with an impact long
after the last baseball fan leaves. And observers say the huge
event will help the Red Sox demonstrate why they need a new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks sports don't have a financial impact on a
city ought to try to get a hotel or restaurant reservation in
Boston this weekend. It's going to be impossible,'' said Soosie
Lazenby, president of the Massachusetts Sports Partnership, which
is organizing 2,000 volunteers to staff the event, including
college athletes and Little League players. ``Events like this are
good for cities. They show that we can undertake the tremendous
collaborative effort that is required and that we're capable of
pulling it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball estimates that the game, and five days of
events leading up to it, will generate $62 million in the local
economy. The Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau is more
conservative, pegging its estimate at $50 million to $54 million.
The 100th Boston Marathon generated $173 million, and the Ryder Cup
is expected to generate $150 million, according to Patrick B.
Moscaritolo, president and chief executive of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts caution that such estimates are inflated, in part
because the disposable income likely would have been spent on
something else in the local economy if the event had not occurred.
But Moscaritolo says he has been conservative in estimating the
revenues, and others say that in the summer tourism season a lot of
that $50 million to $60 million would not have been spent in the
Boston area at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest dividend is going to come two, three, four, five
years from now, when people remember the images they see of Boston
on television or their visit here for the game, and they decide to
visit again, or for the first time,'' Moscaritolo said. ``About 205
countries around the globe get the television feed from the
All-Star Game and it's broadcast in 12 languages. No convention or
visitors bureau has a marketing budget to pay for that kind of
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game is such a prime attraction for Major League
Baseball that, even in cities with much larger stadiums than Fenway
Park, officials seek to maximize the opportunity for fans to
participate by hosting the FanFest, a Home Run Derby, and eight
other events on the days leading up to the game. And with only
about 34,000 seats for the game, fewer people will attend it than
any All-Star Games since the last one at Fenway Park in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau estimates 100,000 visitors will
come to Boston for the All-Star Game and related events, and that
some 80,000 will attend FanFest.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are among the companies leveraging their association
with the game and five days of related events. Originally, this
year's game was to have been played in Milwaukee. But it became
clear in 1997 that the Brewers' new stadium would not be ready, and
the Red Sox, the city, and the convention bureau were persuaded by
Major League Baseball to switch their approach from campaigning for
the 2001 game to the 1999 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually these games are awarded to teams with new stadiums so
they can show them off,'' said a businessman who works extensively
with sports franchises and leagues. ``This time, it is coming to a
team that says it needs a new stadium. And it's prime marketing for
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole event will demonstrate all of the magic and the big
impact that baseball has, at the same time that it provides a great
example of why Fenway Park is obsolete,'' he said. For their part,
the Red Sox were not saying much about the proposed new ballpark
when they talk publicly about the All-Star Game. But they intend to
release their financial plan for the proposed stadium soon after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox are just happy to be contributing in our role as a
player in the local community,'' said Richard L. Bresciani, vice
president of public affairs for the Sox. ``This is the kind of
impact a ball club has on a city, and it's part of our financial
commitment to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Other firms are leveraging the game as part of their marketing
plans. The official sponsors of the game include Stop &AMP; Shop,
Century 21, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., Fleet Financial
Group, Gulf Oil, PepsiCo Inc., Anheuser-Busch, and The Boston
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think as a leading company in the community a good way to
show our leadership is to tie in with premier events that come to
town,'' said Terry Vanderwater, vice president of public affairs
for Stop &AMP; Shop, which has 196 stores in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York. ``It's going to be a long
time before the All-Star Game is back on the East Coast, so we
thought this was a prime opportunity. We think it will sell more
products and drive customer loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers say Hancock is spending $800,000 to $1 million to help
finance the John Hancock FanFest, which will cost Major League
Baseball in excess of $3 million to produce. Hancock will open
FanFest unofficially Thursday night, with employees invited to
visit the interactive exhibits and partake of the full immersion in
baseball that the event is intended to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hancock has been great, and this is a very important part of
All-Star week,'' said Reg Bronskill, the executive producer of
FanFest. ``It is a way for Major League Baseball and its partners
to expand the All-Star experience to many, many people who could
not buy or afford tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game annually provides Major League Baseball with
one of its largest sales of licensed products at a single event.
Pro Player, in Hudson, N.H., has been selling shirts, jackets and
other products bearing the official All-Star logo for a year.
Shirts with large images of the Red Sox All-Stars Pedro Martinez
and Nomar Garciaparra will debut on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Pro Player, the sports licensing division of Fruit
of the Loom, say sales have totaled about $2 million to date,
including $750,000 to $1 million in sales in June alone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reebok International Ltd., of Stoughton, Mass., is
providing players who are signed with the company and who will play
in the game with a commemorative shoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, we give our players who are selected to play in
the game a special shoe,'' said Dave Fogelson, director of public
relations for Reebok. ``This year, it is a lighter, leather-colored
shoe, sort of brown or tan, with the All-Star logo on the tongue
and heel of the shoe.''

ROSE BOWL CROWD HELD DOWN BY POOR SEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Though the World Cup organizers say they could
sell all 92,000 Rose Bowl seats for Saturday's US-China final, odds
are they won't because the final few thousand have obstructed
views. ``We would love to make history with a big 9 in front of the
attendance figure, but I just don't know if it's feasible,''
committee president Marla Messing said Wednesday. ``We are trying
to open up every viable seat. Even though people will buy anything
we put on sale, some of them are just not very good seats.''
</P>
<P>
   After announcing a sellout of more than 85,000 Monday,
organizers put another 3,500 tickets on sale and may offer a few
hundred more. ``I think if we had 120,000 seats we could sell them
all,'' said Messing. ``But I think we'll end up somewhere between
88,000 and 90,000.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl record for soccer is 101,799 for the 1984 Olympic
men's final between France and Brazil but the stadium has since
been downsized several times. Nearly 94,000 watched the US men
defeat Colombia there in the 1994 Cup. Even if Saturday's figure
ends up at 88,000, it will be the largest number ever for a women's
sporting event. The record is 78,972 for the Cup opener between the
US and Denmark at Giants Stadium. Attendance for the six US matches
will surpass 410,000 _ nearly quadruple the mark for the entire
1995 Cup in Sweden.

   The US-Brazil semifinal on July 4, which was played when most
American families were firing up the backyard grill, still set an
ESPN record for soccer. The match was seen in 2.9 million homes (a
3.8 rating), topping the 2.7 million for the 1994 US-Colombia men's
match. The rating nearly doubled the 2.19 for the US-Germany
women's quarterfinal last Thursday night . . . Mia Hamm and Julie
Foudy, who know their way around a loft wedge, will play in the
pro-am before next week's LPGA event in New Rochelle, N.Y. Hamm,
who took up golf when she was a senior at the University of North
Carolina, says she's a 12-handicap. ``It was a real good way for me
to let out frustration and develop my psychological dimension,''
she says. ``Anyone who has ever played golf understands that if you
can't get over a bad shot, you're finished for the entire round.
Golf has taught me a lot of patience.'' Hamm did manage to get in
nine holes with pro-wannabe Michael Jordan when they were filming
their Nike commercial. ``I was so nervous,'' Hamm admits. ``I
didn't play well at all.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Worlds apart
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the US men's team (last in last year's World Cup) suffering
mightily by comparison to his squad, women's coach Tony DiCicco
says a bit of perspective is needed. ``The men get a beating, but
it's not easy where they entered the world game, generations and
generations behind,'' he says. ``They've been very supportive of
us, sending us e-mails and faxes. We're trying to grow soccer
together in this country.'' . . . So what does the Chinese team
think of the Land of 1,000 Cuisines? Not much, judging from its
menu sample during the World Cup. ``The food is too simple, the
variety too limited,'' says coach Ma Yuanan. So the team has
resorted to ordering, yes, Chinese takeout. Though the local
Chinese community has offered to provide some homestyle
ingredients, that's a delicate issue for the team. ``If you meet
Chinese people, it takes two hours just to chat,'' muses Ma. ``It
is a cultural thing. They are very warm-hearted people here, but we
just need the food.'' . . . There'll be no reason to break out the
video camera if the US reclaims the World Cup Saturday. US keeper
Briana Scurry, who dashed naked down a Georgia street with the
Olympic gold medal around her neck in 1996, says she'll celebrate
more subtly this time. ``Plain Jane,'' she insists. ``That's my
name in this World Cup.''

CELTICS' WALKER HUNG OUT TO DRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Parcells taught us all about cuisine logic, how you have to
buy your own groceries and cook your own food. He didn't mention
anything about cleaning up. Well, guess whose turn it is to wash
the dirty dishes? Rick Pitino's.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Pitino is surprised to hear this. Maybe he is not the
source of an inaccurate story that appeared in the Boston Herald
last week. It doesn't matter. Pitino is the president. He's the
coach. He's the one with his face on the media guide. He's the one
with the longest contract in the organization. He is not only The
Man, he is also The Man Players See When They Think of The Celtics.
This is very important.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the rubber gloves, Rick.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, Antoine Walker recently fired his
personal trainer, blew off a session with the team's strength
coach, and, to conclude his streak of rebellion, picked up some
extra pounds. Words such as ``exasperated'' were used to describe
the feelings of some in the organization toward the 22-year-old
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, Walker has not fired his physical therapist nor his
personal trainer. As for Celtics strength coach Shaun Brown, he and
Walker have worked out together at least twice since the end of the
season, the last session coming two days before the draft. Pitino
worked out Walker himself the day before the draft. The ``missed''
session was actually a schedule mismatch between Brown and Walker.
Brown got one day with Walker in Chicago; he wanted two. And the
extra weight?
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him in Las Vegas two weeks ago,'' Mike Higgins said
Wednesday. ``He looked fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins is Walker's agent. He is unhappy. Unhappy with the
newspaper? No. That's not how it works. He has a problem with the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very petty on their part,'' Higgins said. ``This
is high school stuff. You know where stuff like this comes from; it
comes from the organization. It's so petty. Antoine doesn't live in
Boston, but he has been out there three or four times. I think he
has done a good job with his workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand what the fuss is about. I deal with about
60 players, and I can count on one hand how many of them are
working out now. Some organizations try to keep things within when
a player is doing something wrong. Here, Antoine didn't do anything
wrong _ he `misses' a workout and they don't like it _ and stuff is
coming out. This is small, high school stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino did not return a phone call Wednesday. But at this point,
he shouldn't worry about that. He needs to call the agent. And not
for the reason that some might think. He doesn't need to call to
soothe the feelings of Walker. He needs to call because of his own
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA is a gossipy land, a land where players incessantly talk
and compare notes. You heard Higgins, right? He represents 60
players. They don't simply sit around and talk about contracts and
endorsements all day. They're like the rest of us in that they talk
about births, family reunions, office politics, and maddening
bosses.
</P>
<P>
   These players have already spoken about the day in April when
Pitino left Kenny Anderson home from a road trip in a disciplinary
move. They have already talked about the way Pitino operates on the
sidelines, barking out the most basic instructions the entire
night. The most recent draft ended just over a week ago, but there
is already a rumor floating among the players that Pitino promised
Wayne Turner he would draft him with the 55th pick . . . then
selected Kris Clack of Texas. And now this.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'll be the first one to raise my hand and tell you what I
don't like about Walker. He should be at least a 75 percent free
throw shooter. He should get no more than seven technical fouls in
a season. He should never, ever refer to another official as
``Ref'' (I still think eight-week Celtic Chris Mills had the best
idea of any NBA player, learning each official's name during one
offseason). He should never have fewer than three offensive
rebounds in a game. He is a terrific passer _ I once saw him throw
a behind-the-back bounce pass from midcourt for an assist _ so he
should always have three or four assists next to his name.
</P>
<P>
   But if I were him, I'd be disgusted with the Celtics right now.
Two days before the June 30 draft, he came to Boston to participate
in a ``Heroes Among Us'' ceremony at the State House (Pitino was
not there). The next day, he worked out with the coach. He later
confirmed that, yes, he would play in the team's summer league,
something rarely seen of a fourth-year player with a $71 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   So, what does he get for all that? An organization-generated
false story and whispers that the team would like to do a
sign-and-trade with free agent Vin Baker. If the Celtics do want
Baker over Walker, I hope they have done their homework. Current
NBA rules state that although Walker will make $9 million next
season, the most the Celtics can take back in a trade for him is
$5.275 million. If Baker is re-signed by the Sonics, his contract
would be similar to Walker's. In other words, they cannot be traded
for each other unless another team gets involved.
</P>
<P>
   But Pitino shouldn't be worried about Baker or anyone else not
currently on Merrimac Street. When he meets with Ron Mercer he
should figure out a way to sign him. After that, he should call
Higgins and make things right.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the suds and warm water, Rick.

RELIEF AGENCIES SEE KOSOVO AID CAUSING SHORTFALL ELSEWHERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angola's civil war has displaced 1.6 million
people, who face widescale starvation. The United Nations says it
has only one or two weeks' worth of food in the besieged central
highlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Eritrea-Ethiopia border war, the bloodiest armed conflict in
the world, has just expanded into war-wracked Somalia, where
another 1 million people are at risk of famine due to drought.
</P>
<P>
   For a hungry 1 million people in the shattered central Asian
nation of Tajikistan, money has dried up. The United Nations has
asked for $28 million to feed them, but so far has received less
than $1 million, or 4 percent of what it needs.
</P>
<P>
   And now, the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo stands to make
things worse.
</P>
<P>
   With the disaster in the Yugoslav province acting like a magnet
for relief agencies, UN and American officials fear that many
desperately needy places around the world soon will face deadly
shortfalls of food, water and aid.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of major calamities, from Hurricane Mitch in
Central America to the Colombian earthquake and now Kosovo, relief
agencies say it has become increasingly difficult to find money for
even the largest emergencies. Hundreds of millions of dollars may
be going to the Balkans now, for instance, but the UN has raised
just 35 percent of its goal this year for the region.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest concern is that nations will shift money away
from Africa and Asia and into Kosovo, and that private charities
will fold other operations to focus there.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agency officials say it is too early to prove
statistically that Kosovo will siphon funds from other locales, but
small indicators are starting to point in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   A US Senate bill would cut tens of millions of dollars in
Africa-related programs, including $50 million for the Peace Corps,
from the Clinton administration's fiscal 2000 budget request. At
the same time, the bill would add $142 million for reconstruction
in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Denmark has reduced its non-Kosovo foreign assistance
by 26 percent because of the Kosovo crisis. And a Los Angeles-based
charity, International Medical Corps, recently announced it will
suspend its nine-year Angola program due to lack of funding.
</P>
<P>
   As the charity hunts for $1.5 million to pay for the Angola
program, it has raised $5 million in recent months to help those in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggle with funding for Africa,'' said Nancy Aossey,
president of International Medical Corps, which has programs in
five other African countries. ``A lot of it is donor fatigue. Some
areas have had a civil war that has been going for 20 years. And a
lot of it is anytime there is a huge crisis of this magnitude, it
becomes The Story, at the expense of other stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, UN Under-Secretary-General Sergio Vieria de Mello
told the Security Council that of the 23 million people in need
throughout the world, only 3 million live in the former Yugoslavia
and its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   De Mello outlined a tour of the neediest spots on Earth,
spotlighting UN shortfalls everywhere. In Sudan, where 2.3 million
people rely on food aid to survive, the World Food Program has a
shortfall of 40,000 tons, leading to expected shortages later this
summer. Donor assistance to Burundi has been at about 5 percent,
delaying health, education and water purification programs.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from his Angola coordinator, DeMello said, ``sound like
a SOS to the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in an telephone interview late Wednesday from Angola,
Francesco Strippoli, the UN coordinator, thanked donors for past
assistance but also made an urgent appeal:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to compare misery. I think the Kosovar people are
suffering, they need assistance. Unfortunately, we have these other
tragedies unfolding around the world, and what I can say about
Angola is that we are asking for life-saving support.''
</P>
<P>
   He described how the war in Angola forced people to flee rural
areas for cities, how cities are being bombed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have one Sarajevo. We have many Sarajevos,''
Strippoli said.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Chipman, a top official at the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs based in Geneva, said the
message to donor countries has been not to forget ``Angola and
Afghanistan and other crises around the world. We're saying, `Hold
everything, folks. Yes, Kosovo is important, but don't let other
emergencies suffer.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the UN itself is giving mixed messages about the importance
of Kosovo versus the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   A UN official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
funds for Kosovo are now racing through various UN agencies,
``compared to when we get funds for Angola, Sierra Leone, Somalia,
Sudan, when everyone has to cross-check things and it takes
forever.'' The UN also is putting many of its top relief workers in
Kosovo, including de Mello himself, now the temporary overall UN
humanitarian coordinator there.
</P>
<P>
   But most importantly, the UN has given priority to Kosovo. Fully
one-half of the UN's $2.2 billion worldwide appeal this year is
designated for the former Yugoslavia and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   And of that $1.1 billion, UN agencies have requested $740
million _ one-third of its annual appeal _ for the nearly 2 million
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. They represent just 8 percent of the
people around the world designated as needy.
</P>
<P>
   What is behind the outpouring for the Kosovars?
</P>
<P>
   Relief officials say more money is necessary for the Kosovo
humanitarian disaster than comparable African crises because of
different needs and expecations, pointing out that items such as
satellite phones have been necessary for the ethnic Albanians to
locate relatives. And they say NATO's political decision to go to
war against Serbian troops, and the media's intense spotlight on
the Connecticut-sized province, started a stampede toward Kosovo
that relief agencies naturally followed.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the entire Kosovo effort, from the perspective of
military, political and humanitarian involvement, has the issue of
race at its root. A death in Kosovo, many point out, draws more
attention than a death in, say, Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Salih Booker, director of Africa Studies at the Council on
Foreign Relations in Washington, noted that the January massacre of
about 45 ethnic Albanians in the town of Racak led to a UN Security
Council meeting. At the same time, rebels invaded Freetown, the
capital of Sierra Leone, and killed 3,000 to 4,000 people. That
drew no calls for Security Council action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The imagery of human crises seen in Africa is viewed as
normal, while the same images coming out of Europe are not normal
and not acceptable,'' Booker said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, the departing administrator for the Agency for
International Development, said policymakers need to rethink how
they respond to different crises around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has something to do with the politics of international
affairs,'' he said last week. ``It is seemingly too easy to ignore
the problems of Africa because there is an expectation that Africa
will be associated with problems. There is a higher acceptance of a
level of violence in Africa than there is elsewhere. This world is
too small to allow that to happen to one region.''

WHAT'S A FEW MILLISECONDS BETWEEN FRIENDS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last April I wrote a column about Bell Atlantic's new high-speed
DSL (Digital Subscriber Loop) service. In that column, I criticized
the speed of the connection from Bell Atlantic's ISP
(www.bellatlantic.net) to the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Using my cable modem in Cambridge, I wrote, I routinely
see round-trip times between Media One and MIT of 2 to 4
milliseconds. But using Bell Atlantic's DSL service, I was seeing
times of 100 to 200 milliseconds.
</P>
<P>
   The day the article was published, a reader sent me a terse
e-mail from his WebTV account. ``Found it astonishing that you
found differences in thousands of seconds not only worth
mentioning, but actually significant! Gosh! How many actual human
users will (care) if one connection takes a smaller fraction of a
second to access the Web? Please!''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the difference between the two connections _
roughly 1/10 of a second _ can be quite noticeable. That's because
delays on the Internet frequently cascade. A few thousandths of a
second here and a few thousandths of a second there can often add
up to delays of a dozen seconds or more. The reason for this
seemingly nonsensical addition has to do with the fact that
information is sent over the Internet in little packets of data,
and that sometimes these packets get lost.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to visualize a packet on the Internet, think of a
postcard moving through the US Postal Service. Each packet has the
address of the person (or computer) that sent it, its destination,
and a little bit of data. Typically packets have between 100 and
500 characters. It might take 100 or more packets to send even a
small photograph across the Internet. I tried downloading the
entire boston.com home page Sunday night; that took 255 packets.
</P>
<P>
   Because packets sometimes get lost, the data sent in each packet
has to be acknowledged after it is received. The time between when
a packet is sent and the acknowledgement is received is the
round-trip time, or latency, that I wrote about in my April column.
And naturally, if a packet is lost, it needs to be sent again.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, designers of the Internet protocol came up with
some clever tricks so each packet doesn't have to be acknowledged
before the next one is sent. Nevertheless, the round-trip time and
the packet loss between your computer and a Web server is usually a
good indication of just how snappy theserver will feel when you are
browsing its pages. When delays are less than 50 milliseconds and
packet loss is less than 2 percent, Web pages seem to come up in an
instant. Delays of more than 500 milliseconds or packet losses of
more than 10 percent generally make you feel like you are surfing
through molasses.
</P>
<P>
   You can measure the latency and packet loss of your own Internet
connections using a program called ``ping,'' which is built into
Windows 95. Just open an MS-DOS Prompt window and type ``ping''
followed by the name of another computer on the Internet, such as
``ping web.mit.edu.'' If you use a Macintosh, two programs that you
can use are Finger and MacPing. Be aware that some Web servers,
including boston.com, block ``ping'' packets.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, programs like ``ping'' only let you look at one
path over the Internet at a time. To get an overall feeling for the
system as a whole you might want to look at one of the growing
number of Internet Weather Reports. These services look at Internet
traffic the way a helicopter might report on the Central Artery.
The University of California at Los Angeles runs a particularly
informative Internet weather service at
http://www.noc.ucla.edu/networking/weather.html. For a nationwide
overview, check out the MIDS weather report at
http://www.internetweather.com/. There is also the Internet Traffic
Report, at http://www.internettraffic.com/, run by Andover.NET in
Acton.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that all of these traffic and weather services are
really looking at the popular Internet ``backbone'' connections in
a given metropolitan area _ they don't necessarily look at the
particular Internet links that your packets will be traveling.
Boston might be having a bad Internet traffic day, for example, but
if your ISP has private links to New York, Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C., or San Jose, you might never see a blip.
</P>
<P>
   So that's why in April I was concerned about the differences of

   Last week, when I wrote about Connected Online Backup
(http://www.connected.com/), I should have mentioned that Connected
is just one of several on-line backup systems. If you are
considering an on-line backup system, you should also look at
(at)Backup ($99/year for 100MB of storage, http://www.backup.com);
Atrieva ($14.99/month for 1,000MB of storage,
http://www.i-filezone.com/); and Safeguard Interactive ($9.95 month
for unlimited storage; http://www.sgii.com). Each company offers
slightly different services and pricing models, so if you are
seriously shopping, it pays to look around.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a few weeks ago I wrote about Power Quest's new Lost and
Found data-recovery tool. I said that one of its advantages was
that you could purchase it after your computer suffered a hard disk
crash, since Lost and Found runs off floppy disks. Programs such as
Norton Utilities, I wrote, need to be purchased and installed
before you need them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not entirely true,'' says Sherri Walkenhorst, from
Norton's public relations firm. ``Norton Utilities 4.0 has an
emergency floppy disk and bootable CD feature that allows users to
run some of the utilities `after the fact' _ i.e., you can go down
to the store and buy a copy of NU after you've accidentally deleted
a file and still be able to recover it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although I still prefer Lost and Found for serious data recovery
tasks, Walkenhorst is right and I stand corrected.

HEAVEN COMES IN SLICES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heaven on Earth is a tomato sandwich. As long as the tomatoes
are locally grown, that is.
</P>
<P>
   I got a little trip to the Promised Land the other day when I
bought several home-grown tomatoes and have since devoured them
sliced thinly and placed with mayonnaise, salt and pepper between
two slices of plain white bread. This is one case where commercial,
presliced bread is a better ingredient than those crusty gourmet
loaves. There's something exquisite about the contrast of the soft,
bland bread and the acidic tanginess of a fully ripe tomato.
</P>
<P>
   The key to fully appreciating a tomato sandwich, though, is to
eat it as soon as it's assembled. I remember my mother trying to
pack tomato sandwiches in my lunch box and arriving at the
cafeteria table with a bunch of plastic wrap full of soggy pink
bread and tomato seeds. Yuck.
</P>
<P>
   I still have tomato sandwiches for lunch, but instead of putting
them together at home and expecting them to stay fresh, I simply
make the sandwich without the tomato. Then, I take a tomato to the
office, slice it and place it between two pieces of bread slathered
with real mayonnaise (not low-fat, not salad dressing) and
sprinkled with generous amounts of salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise on your palate.

Q AND A: PLAY DATES, WEANING, SEXUAL MISBEHAVIOR

questions. Please send yours to Barbara F. Meltz, The Boston Globe,
Box 2378, Boston, MA 02107-2378; fax 617-929-2813 or email

</P>

   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I was raised in Asia. Children there usually just play with
neighboring kids and relatives' kids . . . (and) almost never go to
other people's houses alone to play with kids from school. Now I am
a mother of two boys, 6 and 4. They get invitations for play dates
all the time. I am very happy they are making friends in school,
but I am very reluctant to send them to other people's houses. I
don't really know the other parents and they only invite the kids,
so I feel awkward to tag along. I worry about child abuse,
firearms, swimming pools, etc. . . . If I don't allow my children
to go, I am concerned that will affect their social life. I also
invite other kids and their parents to our house. What advice do
you have, and at what age is it appropriate for kids to have play
dates without their parents around?
</P>
<P>
   A. As you wisely recognize, this is more than a matter of what's
developmentally appropriate. But let's take that first:
</P>
<P>
   The typical child will let you know when he's ready to go
without you, either by telling you point-blank _ ``I'm not a baby
anymore, Mom. I don't need you to come'' _ or by his behavior,
perhaps showing that he doesn't need you by ignoring you at the
friend's or by being angry or testy with you before or after the
visit. (That's because he can't identify and/or verbalize his wish
for independence.)
</P>
<P>
   There is no magic age when this will happen, says Eleanora
Villegas-Reimers, an associate professor of early childhood
education at Wheelock College. For some children, it can be as
young as 3, for others not until 5 or 6, and the independent
behavior may be rife with inconsistencies. For instance, he may
feel competent and grown-up enough to go alone one day but not the
next; he may feel comfortable without you in one playmate's home
but not in another's. These are typically normal blips.
</P>
<P>
   Your comfort level may be more complicated, says
Villegas-Reimers, who specializes in multicultural education and
moral development. On the one hand, she says, there are cultural
values that are intrinsic to your identity that you shouldn't feel
you have to give up. At the same time, it's important to
distinguish between fears that are valid and fears that develop
from what you see on the TV news.
</P>
<P>
   When you don't know the family issuing the invitation, she urges
you to continue to invite yourself along (``My son would love to
come, and I would too, if that's OK; we can get to know each other
and I can help out with the kids'') or to invite them to your
house. Most importantly, she says, ``Don't be shy about sharing the
cultural differences that make you anxious. You don't have to hide
your concerns or be embarrassed by them. Most people will be
pleased to learn about your culture and to share information and
offer support.'' If they aren't, follow your instinct: Perhaps
these are not homes where you are comfortable having your child
play.
</P>
<P>
   If your son wants to go alone and you don't know the family,
tell him, ``In our family, we like it best if a parent goes with
you the first time. It's more friendly that way, and we get to know
the other parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The more open you are with the other parents, the more you'll
get to know them, and the more information you have, the better
able you'll be to decide if you have a valid reason for not wanting
to leave your child there. By the way, finding out if you have
shared values is what gives any parent a critical comfort level.
It's something all of us should do more of, even when we share a
cultural background and especially as our children get older.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Q. I read your article on weaning from breast-feeding (April 22)
with great interest. My 13-month-old daughter is currently
``weaning herself.'' I wonder if you have encountered anything
about bottle feeding during your research. Is it difficult to wean
a child from the bottle (either formula or breast milk)? One of the
mothers at my daughter's day care wants the parents to have a
concerted effort to wean them off their bottles together.
</P>
<P>
   A. Whether it's difficult to wean from the bottle depends on how
emotionally attached a baby is to it, says Gale Pryor, co-author of
the classic ``Nursing Your Baby'' (third edition, Simon &AMP; Schuster)
and author of ``Nursing Mother, Working Mother: The Essential Guide
for Breastfeeding and Staying Close to Your Baby after You Return
to Work,'' (Harvard Common Press). It's more likely a baby is
attached to the bottle if:
</P>
<P>
   --He has only been bottle-fed and you have made it an intimate
and loving experience;
</P>
<P>
   --She uses the bottle as a source of comfort, for instance at
times of stress;
</P>
<P>
   --He takes the bottle into the crib as he falls asleep.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases, Pryor says, ``You need to wean as gently as you
would from the breast,'' preferably by reading your child's cues
that she's ready to move on. If a child depends on the bottle for
comfort, Pryor recommends substituting something else when the need
arises: a soft stuffed animal or a cuddly blanket. For some
children, sucking is what comforts them, and this can be a time
when they turn to their thumb if they haven't already.
</P>
<P>
   While bottle weaning can be emotionally difficult, there is at
least one way in which it tends to be easier than weaning from the
breast. ``Mom isn't going to have the same ambivalence,'' says
Pryor. ``This is not a two-way weaning.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of trying to wean some or all of the children in a
day-care class at the same time is not only unrealistic but also
not in each child's interest. ``Weaning is individualized, whether
it's from breast or bottle,'' says Pryor. ``It's not something you
can legislate. It's not a group effort.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I described the behavior of a friend of my son's to a
therapist friend (the 6-year-old was mooning his parents, my
husband, and myself over the loft balcony of their vacation condo
and not stopping when his somewhat embarrassed mother asked him to;
very violent behavior of this boy toward his pushy and teasing
older brother; plus other sexualized behavior that I've seen over
the past few years), I expected to be chastised for my prudishness.
Instead, my friend suggested that that kind of behavior can
sometimes indicate sibling sexual abuse. How could one recognize
such abuse? If one does suspect it, what does one do?
</P>
<P>
   A. Can you have an open conversation with one or both parents?
That's what ideally needs to happen, says Joan Tabachnick, director
of public education for Stop It Now!, a national, nonprofit, child
sexual abuse prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents either get desensitized to a behavior and assume
it's age appropriate, a `boys-will-be-boys' kind of thing, or they
get so panicked by it, they are immobilized,'' she says. A trusted
friend who can bring it to their attention and give them a place
where they can take their questions can be the jump-start they
need.
</P>
<P>
   That a 6-year-old would moon adults does not on its own indicate
a sexual behavior problem; it's possible that the developmentally
normal fascination at this age with bathroom humor and behavior
could fuel it. But Tabachnick concurs that the combination of other
behaviors, as well as not responding to the mother's request to
stop, point in that direction. What probably needs to occur, she
says, is for an adult, preferably a parent, to have a quiet
conversation with the child, asking him a range of questions from,
``I'm wondering why you did that?'' to, ``Has anyone ever done
something like that to you?''
</P>
<P>
   Stop It Now! has a free phone line where counselors answer
questions and offer help (888-773-8368) as well as a Web site,
www.stopitnow.com. You may hear more about this organization in the
near future: A newly inaugurated national public-service campaign
is aimed at getting adults to ask questions about children's
sexualized behavior. ``This reader is doing exactly what we're
encouraging adults to do more of,'' says Tabachnick. ``Not enough
people have the courage to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, this comment from a reader:
</P>
<P>
   Re. your column of May 20, ``Should boys have war toys?'' my
answer is a loud NO. Several years ago I was baby-sitting a
grandson, then about 8. He had his GI Joes out and wanted to play
war. I told him that first we should play ``Let's go camping,''
which my husband and I did for many years with our children, and
which he knew about. We used the Joe figures to put up a tent, go
fishing, and do other fun things at a campsite. We had a great
time, and the next day when he got out his GI Joes again, he said
to me, ``Let's play camping.'' I think this is a good illustration
of how an adult can influence a child and turn their thoughts
around from playing in a destructive way to an instructive one.

ACURA 3.5RL: QUIET, SMOOTH, YET LESS THAN SPECTACULR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's shakeout time in Luxury Sedan City.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, as drivers aged, they longed for that Caddy, Lincoln
or Benz, the bigger the better, the softer and boatier the ride the
better.
</P>
<P>
   Time was.
</P>
<P>
   Now, automakers are trying to find just the right luxury sedan
to keep the aging wave of baby boomers from opting en masse for
swank SUVs and even fancy pickup trucks. So while they are covering
their flanks by building myriad variations of the latter pair, they
are also trying to find just the right luxury sedan: Lincoln with
its 2000 LS, Mercedes with its sportier 2000 S Class, Cadillac with
its Seville SLS.
</P>
<P>
   And Acura with its ``flagship sedan'' the Acura 3.5RL.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a ``luxury sedan,'' the 3.5RL is quiet, it is
relatively roomy and it is smooth. It has the requisite wide stance
look and the street-sloping hood meant to say ``luxurious yet
sporty.''
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, this does not feel like a luxury car, it's not very
exciting to drive, and it's not distinctive in its appearance. It's
got Mercedes/Lexus written all over it. Park it, and no one will
walk up to you and say, ``Hey, hey, what's that you're driving?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this car is probably not aimed at the types who are struck
by the appearance of parked cars. Instead, it is aimed at those who
want wonderful reliability, quiet Point A to Point B driving, a
solid (4-year, 50,000-mile) warranty, free 24-hour road service,
concierge and trip routing services, and 100,000 miles before their
first tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   That would be travelers, not drivers.
</P>
<P>
   They plunk down their $41,900 (there are no options except a
navigational system) and go on their quiet way.
</P>
<P>
   And they do so in simple comfort. The expansive dashboard rises
sharply up and away, seemingly from knee level, giving a great
feeling of openness. The easily adjusted leather seats are firm at
back and on the sides, though the fronts are a bit too soft and let
the thighs drop on long trips. The back seats are tipped back at a
most comfortable angle.
</P>
<P>
   Slip into the driver's seat _ it can be programmed to remember
who you are and adjust accordingly _ and grip the wheel. You have
cruise control beneath your right thumb, audio and channel controls
for the sound system beneath your left _ excellent touches and
wonderful for safety.
</P>
<P>
   All else is most simple: tachometer, speedomoter, fuel guage,
temperature guage, and shift indicator dead ahead behind the wheel.
At center, wrapped in a spilling flow of wood from dash to
shiftlever are the climate controls and Bose sound system controls
(6-disc CD changer is standard).
</P>
<P>
   In the driver's side sunvisor are three buttons that can be
programmed to operate your garage door, home lights, home security
or take over other functions ordinarily performed by separate
remote controls.
</P>
<P>
   To your right is a multilevel bin in the console, a nice concept
since the top portion is quite shallow for flat items _ coins,
notebooks, maps _ that might get lost if mixed in with large items
that go into the lower portion, which also houses a 12-volt
auxiliary jack.
</P>
<P>
   You are surrounded by airbags, front and side, and the front
bags are of the new smart variety. They deploy according to
severity of crash _ they don't come screaming out at you in a minor
fender bender _ while the front passenger bag sensors pick up the
size and position of the passenger and can opt not to deploy if a
small child is seated there during a minor crash.
</P>
<P>
   One area where makers of luxury sedans (and especially those
aiming at a certain sportiness) seem to be still wandering is over
engine size. I drove both 6-cylinder and 8-cylinder 2000 Lincoln LS
models on short hops recently and cannot figure out why Lincoln is
even bothering with the 6-cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Acura 3.5RL can be sneaky fast with its
210-horespower V-6, it just doesn't seem to have the ``power to
spare'' feel you'd expect in a luxury cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it got just over 20 miles per gallon _ certainly owing
to the economy of the V-6 _ but I'm not convinced that those
looking for luxury sedans put gas mileage at the top of their
lists. Power would seem a better option to many of them.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, as I said, is smooth and quiet. Double wishbone
suspension with myriad trailing arms and stabilizer bars, keep it
smooth. The car flows gently in and out of highway traffic and,
yes, gets you from A to B comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the corners, it's soft, not up to the stiff cornering of
other luxury sedans and reminiscent of older luxury cars with their
boat-like feel.
</P>
<P>
   Power-assisted, four-wheel, disc brakes, vented in front and
guided by ABS, bring the car to relatively straight, quick stops
from moderate speeds and slow it quickly at higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. This is a truly fine automobile and for
some folks it deserves to be the auto of choice. But at almost
$42,000, it has been ratcheted right up there in price with some
great performers and it outstrips in price several cars I would
look at before I would drop that much money here.
</P>
<P>
   Is the 3.5 RL, for instance, really worth $6,000 more than the
Audi A6 Quattro, better than the same-priced BMW 528i, $5,000
better than the Volvo S80, or $7,000 better than Volvo's S70 AWD
sedan, or Chrysler's surprising 300M, a wonderful luxury sports
sedan that comes $10,000 cheaper?
</P>
<P>
   And finally, despite better airbags and other appointments, is
this car worth $14,000 more than Acura's own 3.2tl, which has more
power?
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   _ The way the center console, besides its two levels of storage,
has a soft top that pops up and forward and serves as a comfortable
armrest on long trips.
</P>
<P>
   _ The thruback hole to the trunk behind the drop-down armrest
between the rear seats. Wonderful to haul skis, fishing gear and
other long objects.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   _ The way the speakers mounted in the front doors eat up most of
the storage racks hung low on those doors.

CATCH UP WITH GREAT PERFORMANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
BY ROB LOWMAN 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With ``Affliction'' and ``Hilary and Jackie''
coming out this week, and ``Life Is Beautiful'' coming out Tuesday
on video, it's a perfect time for those who didn't see these
smaller films to catch up on some terrific Academy Award-nominated
acting. (Did you ever notice that it's the smaller films that
garner most of the acting nominations?)
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hilary and Jackie,'' nominees Emily Watson and Rachael
Griffiths shine as renowned cellist Jacqueline Du Pre and her
sister. Like 1996's ``Shine,'' this true story revolves around the
cutthroat and high-pressure world of classical music and family
relationships. And like ``Shine,'' there were those who were
unhappy with the way the story was brought to the screen. As the
high-strung virtuoso, Watson brings believability to Jackie's
volatile mood swings as she faces the rigors of concert life and
pitfalls of being married to a famed concert pianist, while
Griffiths, in a less splashy role _ she's an accomplished flutist
who opts for quieter life and a loving marriage _ shows an
emotional strength in Hilary. Even when this highly stylized film
is less than successful, Watson and Griffiths' performances keep
you watching. &QL; 
 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   While it may be unfair to say that Roberto Benigni, the star,
director and co-writer (with Vincenzo Cerami) of ``Life Is
Beautiful'' didn't deserve the best-actor Oscar, it seems a shame
that Nick Nolte didn't win it for ``Affliction.'' (We'll leave
``Life Is Beautiful'' for another time.) It would seem that the
59-year-old actor was made for the role of Wade Whitehouse, a
small-town cop and a big-time burnout whose wife has left him. A
1991 New York magazine article called Nolte the ``dysfunctional
version of the Hollywood leading man. Nolte is himself a recovering
alcoholic and former drug abuser who has been through divorce three
times and a palimony suit once, and the misery shows in his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in an action-comedy such as ``48 HRS.,'' it was Nolte's
loser-outsider that gave the film some heft. In the 1991 Barbra
Streisand-directed film ``Prince of Tides,'' the only other film
role for which he received an Oscar nomination, Nolte gave an
outstanding and believable performance as a man who kept a lifetime
of torment locked up inside of him. From comic characters (``Down
and Out in Beverly Hills'') to a racist cop (``Q&AMP;A'') to a
sympathetic father struggling to find a cure for his young son's
disease (``Lorenzo's Oil''), Nolte has consistently given
outstanding and credible performances.
</P>
<P>
   While Nolte didn't win an Oscar, veteran actor James Coburn, who
plays Wade's sadistic father, did pick up the best-supporting-actor
statuette in the Paul Schrader film. There is something
synchronistic about the pairing of Nolte and Schrader _ call it
their dark, downbeat sides. It would be nice if Hollywood and the
academy would recognize Nolte _ one of their own _ at least before
he's Coburn's age of 70.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Schrader appears to be another American artist
who is too often overlooked when it comes to handing out Oscars. In
fact, he's never even been nominated. As a screenwriter, he is
best-known for his work with Martin Scorsese _ ``Taxi Driver,''
``Raging Bull,'' ``The Last Temptation of Christ.'' But you'll see
the same intensity in the scripts he's done for his own films _
``Blue Collar,'' ``American Gigolo,'' ``Light Sleeper'' and
``Touch.'' The onetime film critic, however, has turned out a
striking body of work that is always provocative while remaining
entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader has, for the most part, recently worked outside the
Hollywood system in order to adhere to his own vision without
studio interference, and by doing so has elicited numerous
wonderfully nuanced performances. As harrowing as it is to watch
sometimes _ especially when Nolte and Coburn go toe-to-toe _
``Affliction,'' adapted from the Russell Banks novel, shows off
Schrader's strength: a willingness to get to the grittiness of a
subject. American cinema could use more of that.
</P>
<P>
   It's interesting to note that Schrader's script for the Steven
Spielberg film ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind'' was rejected.
But that was 1977. I wonder what the post-``Saving Private Ryan''
Spielberg would think of it now.!end! &QL;

NEWCOMBE, ROCHE TRUE TEAM PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   White City Stadium had a capacity of 10,000, but that wouldn't
do for this epic. Not even close. So 16,000 seats were added just
for the occasion, this showdown for the 1954 Davis Cup between
Australia and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed all of Sydney _ no, all of New South Wales _ was
there. At least that was the impression of 10-year-old John
Newcombe, who came across town with his father, a local dentist.
And it was perhaps even more special for 9-year-old Tony Roche, who
traveled the 220 miles from Tarcutta, a hamlet of 300 halfway
between the big cities of Sydney and Melbourne, with his dad, a
country butcher, for the big event.
</P>
<P>
   They were tennis nuts, young Newcombe and Roche, and as they sat
in separate sections of this makeshift arena swollen with humanity
_ the largest crowd ever to watch an official tennis match _ they
were inspired by the efforts of the great Lew Hoad and Ken
Rosewall, gallant losers to American aces Tony Trabert and Vic
Seixas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to do that someday,'' thought Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to do that someday,'' thought Roche.
</P>
<P>
   Now they've gone past someday.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Telepathy? Coincidence? Call it whatever. John Newcombe and Tony
Roche have formed perhaps the most enduring alliance in tennis
history _ vise-tight even by the standards of the Australians, who
long have been renowned for their bonhomie.
</P>
<P>
   It's an inevitable byproduct of place, of growing up in and then
venturing forth from an isolated island nation-continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you leave Australia,'' says Newcombe, now 55, ``you don't
leave for two weeks. You leave for a long time. You become
dependent on your mates. You develop a close bond. Mateship is very
important to the Australian way of life. If someone doesn't look
after his mates, the other guys ostracize him.''
</P>
<P>
   No chance of Newcombe or Roche being drummed out of the club.
Their 35-year doubles partnership _ which continues in Grand Slam
senior events today _ produced 11 major championships and a
relationship of such fiber that their families still vacation
together.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, they fulfilled their Davis Cup dreams. With a
vengeance. Playing both singles and doubles, they helped the
vaunted Australian dynasty of a generation ago capture five
championships _ four in a row from 1964-67 and again in 1973, five
years after tennis entered the open era and the first year contract
professionals were allowed to compete for the Cup. In other words,
five straight, for all intents and purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't stop there. When the Australians visit Longwood
for a quarterfinal Davis Cup match against the United States July
16-18, Newcombe and Roche will be running the show. Together.
Continuing a precedent they established six years ago when, as
usual, they refused to separate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In late 1993, Neale Fraser stepped down as the Australian Davis
Cup captain. The sport's governing body, Tennis Australia, was
unaccustomed to the hiring process, since its Davis Cup team had
been run by only two captains in the previous 50 years _ the
legendary Harry Hopman and then Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   Applications were solicited. Newcombe and Roche both submitted
resumes. As a unit.
</P>
<P>
   Under their arrangement, Newcombe would be the captain. Roche
would be the coach. One problem. Tennis Australia had never had a
Davis Cup coach. Tennis Australia didn't want a Davis Cup coach.
Tennis Australia wanted the status quo _ a Davis Cup captain.
Period.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe and Roche both were offered the job, though Newcombe
swears he can't remember who was approached first. Didn't matter.
Each told Tennis Australia he wouldn't work without the other.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis Australia now has a Davis Cup coach.
</P>
<P>
   That's Roche, a full-time employee of the organization who
travels 22 weeks a year and is responsible for the tennis tutelage.
The captain is Newcombe, who is more or less the front man,
handling the administrative details, the public and media
functions, and the actual matches in addition to assisting Roche
with the on-court work.
</P>
<P>
   It's a part-time position _ Newcombe hasn't the time to devote
exclusively to the Cup squad, given his other enterprises: a tennis
resort he owns in San Antonio, a marketing company he owns in
Australia, overseeing his personal investment portfolio, and
serving as an Australian television commentator for such events as
Wimbledon and the US and French Opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the job requires two people now,'' he says. ``Tony's
total concentration is to give 100 percent to the boys and what
they need on the court. But there's 101 other things to do off the
court, and I take care of those. Plus, I'll ask Tony, `What do you
want me to do with this guy?' or `What does that guy need?' He'll
tell me what needs to be worked on, and I'll help there.''
</P>
<P>
   Truth be told, this brain trust hasn't had the success of its
predecessors _ perhaps because Newcombe has no player in his ranks
the caliber of the young John Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His parents played tennis socially. John took it to another
level. ``I was good at all hand-eye coordination sports,'' he
recalls. ``Cricket. Rugby. Tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially tennis. From the age of 10, he was Australia's
top-ranked junior. He won convincingly at every age level. Until he
got to the 18-and-under clay final.
</P>
<P>
   ``First time I played Rochey,'' he says. ``Our match was before
the national final. It took us three hours. Rochey beat me, 6-4,
14-16, 6-4.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's when it occurred to Newcombe that if he couldn't
beat Roche, he should join him. Actually, the choice was eventually
made for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1964 on a trip overseas, my partner, Ken Fletcher, got a
chance to play with Emmo (Roy Emerson),'' recalls Newcombe. ``The
selectors decided Tony and I should play together.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, Newcombe experienced far more success in
singles than Roche _ or any other Australian of the
post-Emerson/Rod Laver era. Playing in the period that bridged the
sham of so-called amateur tennis, with its clandestine payments,
and the inclusion of legitimate professionals in Grand Slam events,
Newcombe won seven major singles titles: three Wimbledons, two US,
and two Australians. He and Roche numbered five Wimbledons among
their doubles trophies, and Newcombe earned six other Grand Slam
doubles titles with other partners; his total of 17 Grand Slam
doubles crowns remains a record.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he earned universal admiration as a man without
pretense or guile, and now he tries to impart that approach to the
players under his stewardship. At Longwood, that means Patrick
Rafter and 17-year-old rookie Lleyton Hewitt, the replacement for
injured Mark Philippoussis, in singles, and the veteran doubles duo
of Mark Woodforde and Todd Woodbridge, the Roche-Newcombe of this
era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony and I are very strong on team spirit,'' says Newcombe.
``We really believe in working together as a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   That philosophy was put to the ultimate test after the Davis Cup
debacle of 1995, when Australia lost to Hungary and was relegated
out of the World Group, meaning it could not compete for the Cup
the following year. ``It was a national disaster,'' says Newcombe.
And the team was under siege. Newcombe and Roche used the
opportunity to reinforce a sense of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said to the guys, `The true mark of a champion is when you
get knocked down, can you stand up taller than before?' '' he
recalls. ``We said it was up to us to prove to people that we were
champions and we'd be at their side every step of the way. I think
that was a turning point for Australian tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in an individual context. Newcombe said the Aussies felt
a sense of achievement if one of their number gained a major
quarterfinal during the dark days. Since then, Rafter has won the
last two US Opens, was a Wimbledon semifinalist this year, and
Philippoussis reached the US final last year and had eventual
champion Pete Sampras on the ropes in the Wimbledon quarters this
month before a knee injury knocked him out of the tournament and
the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger scope, there is still a lack of fulfillment by the
Aussies. Their best Cup finish under Newcombe and Roche was the
1997 semifinals, where they were eliminated by the US. And Newcombe
believes that the loss of Philippoussis tips the balance slightly
toward the Americans at Longwood. ``Before, I'd call it 50-50,'' he
says. ``Now it's more like 55-45.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Australians fail again, Newcombe won't go into
hiding. He never has. ``The flak comes with the territory,'' he
says. ``I've never minded it. The funny thing is, if people know
it's going to get to you, they give you more. If they know it
doesn't, they leave you alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he doesn't envision being on the firing line much longer,
Cup or no Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we'll finish up at the end of 2000,'' says Newcombe.
``That's what Tony wants to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And they've always been on the same wavelength.

WHERE EMUS AND CATTLE ROAM, A SUBURBAN COWBOY GOES TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROGER CROTEAU  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGSBURY, Texas _ On a recent afternoon, Bubba Jahns wandered
pastures and rural roads around here for hours, looking for a
cantankerous, retired rodeo bull that was wreaking havoc by
knocking down fences and chasing property owners.
</P>
<P>
   Jahns, driving a pickup truck and armed with a tranquilizer dart
gun, never spotted his quarry.
</P>
<P>
   It was an off day for Guadalupe County's ``contract cowboy.''
</P>
<P>
   Jahns, 39, uses his truck, his horse, six dogs, plenty of rope
and the occasional tranquilizer dart in his part-time job.
</P>
<P>
   The suburban cowboy is responsible for rounding up livestock
that gets loose in this county east of San Antonio where
subdivisions and ranches exist side by side, though not always
harmoniously.
</P>
<P>
   When livestock _ be they goats, emus or bulls _ get out of their
pastures and become a traffic hazard, the county calls on Jahns to
take care of the problem. The problem can be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Guadalupe County Sheriff's Deputy Anthony
Slaughter was seriously injured when he hit a horse while driving
his patrol car. Slaughter is not expected back at work for several
months.
</P>
<P>
   Jahns earns a fee only when he catches a stray, and often the
hours are tough. And on days like Thursday, when his target gives
him the slip, Jahns does not even get paid for the mileage he
drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really need it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get plenty of business rounding up cattle for other people.
A lot of times the county calls at two in the morning and I don't
really want to go. Half the time the animal gets back into the
pasture and I can't even find it. So I get out of bed at two in the
morning, saddle my horse, drive 30 miles or so, spend an hour
looking for the darn animal, and I get nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some weeks the county never calls and other times the calls
stack up. But the average is three or four times a week, and Jahns
always loads up his horse and goes to work.
</P>
<P>
   His least favorite calls involve lassoing loose emus,
flightless, ostrich-like birds from Australia that were a huge fad
in Texas ranching during the 1980s. Then the bottom fall out of the
emu market and it became easier for owners to turn them loose
rather than feed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not really worth anything,'' Jahns said. ``What I
generally do is get them along a fence and just drive alongside
them in my truck and put a rope on them right out the window of my
pickup truck. When you get a rope on them, they really try to kick
it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Roping emus, after all, is not real cowboy work.
</P>
<P>
   When he does find a bull, the regular routine is to shoot it
with a tranquilizer, wait for it to go down, then rope it, and get
it moving into a waiting trailer with a cattle prod.
</P>
<P>
   His boss at his real job at the Seguin Cattle Co., Benno
Luensmann, doesn't seem to mind that Jahns regularly disappears for
a couple of hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good cowboy,'' Luensmann said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Jahns' six dogs that impress his boss the most.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll back up the trailer along a fence and those dogs will go
get the cow and put it right in the trailer. That's unbelievable,
but it works. It takes a special dog to do that. Not every dog can
be trained to do it. He trains them from the time they're pups,''
Luensmann said.

TRAILER DOES DISSERVICE TO THIS THRILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Arlington Road'' is one of those movies that is
done a disservice by its preview trailer. That's because the less
you know about this taut thriller, the better off you are.
Unfortunately, the film's advertising campaign seems determined to
give away most of the movie's surprises, reducing its essence to a
rote roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because ``Arlington Road'' offers its audience
pleasures that go beyond most brainless summer fare. It's smart,
nerve-racking and features fine performances from a couple of
underappreciated masters of acting, Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins.
In a summer full of snickers, this movie provides an
edge-of-your-seat alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Director Mark Pellington (known mostly for music video work)
establishes an intense, apprehensive tone immediately during the
opening credits sequence. We see a young boy, blood dripping on his
Converse sneakers, staggering down the center of a residential
neighborhood street outside Washington, D.C. (Angelo Badalamenti's
haunting music adds to the disorienting effect.)
</P>
<P>
   Driving home, history professor Michael Faraday (Bridges) comes
across the horrific sight and speeds the boy to the hospital
emergency room. It turns out the child, Brady (Mason Gamble), is
the oldest son of Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Robbins and Joan Cusack),
Faraday's congenial neighbors from across the street. Brady had
been playing with fireworks and had one explode in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two months they've lived there, and I haven't said one word to
them,'' Faraday tells his girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis), full of
the kind of guilt and remorse that anyone living in a detached,
suburban climate can understand.
</P>
<P>
   The accident brings the neighbors together. Faraday's son, Grant
(Spencer Treat Clark), becomes close to Brady, and the Langs invite
Michael and Brooke over for a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   But Faraday begins to notice some contradictions in Oliver's
stories. Oliver says he's never lived in the East before, but
Michael sees an alumni letter from the University of Pennsylvania.
Oliver claims to design shopping malls, but his blueprints seem to
be of office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Faraday, though, could easily be suffering from paranoid
delusions. He's a widower; his FBI agent wife was killed by
militant extremists during a botched raid. He also teaches a class
in American terrorism at George Washington University and spends
his time debunking the government's ``official'' anti-conspiracy
explanations. He's still bitter about his wife's death, a tragedy
he believes could have been easily avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a cat-and-mouse game between Faraday and Lang is
established and director Pellington, working from an edgy script
from first-time screenwriter Ehren Kruger, has the perfect actors
working in those roles. Robbins, with his little boy's face and
cryptic grin, plays the enigmatic Lang as a Fred Rogers (the
cardigan sweaters are a nice touch) with militia leanings. (He's
always sweetly telling Faraday that ``someone should pay'' for his
wife's shooting.)
</P>
<P>
   As for Bridges, his natural weariness and wounded ease have
rarely been used to better effect. We watch Faraday become consumed
with finding the truth about Lang, and, in the process, begin to
resemble the sort of loose cannon that he teaches his students (and
his little boy) to fear. It's another wonderfully textured turn
from Bridges, who has made a career at delivering this kind of
understated performance.
</P>
<P>
   (Added bonus: Cusack's spooky work as a housewife straight out
of ``Pleasantville.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' isn't perfect. The film occasionally veers
back and forth in tone, breaking its hypnotic mood with a jokey
line that would have been more at home in another sort of movie.
(``The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,'' for instance.) The last act,
at times, resorts to genre cliches to move the plot. For the most
part, though, Pellington has managed to effectively evoke the
sickening vulnerability that many Americans now feel after
incidents like those in Littleton and Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   There's one scene, a conversation between Faraday and Lang in
Faraday's back yard, that neatly encapsulates the encroaching
claustrophobia prevalent in America's suburban sprawl. The two men
warily talk, inches from the other's face and surrounded on all
sides by the looming presence of their neighbors' homes, dwellings
that seem to be stacked on top of each other. With such suffocating
proximity, is there any way Faraday couldn't let his suspicions get
the better of him?
</P>
<P>
   The film's shattering conclusion provides the answer to that
question with the brutal force of a kick in the gut. ``Arlington
Road'' may not be the studios' feel-good movie of the summer, but
you probably won't see a more powerfully disturbing movie about
America during this traditionally silly season. &QL;

BAKER LOOKING FOR A SIGN HE'S BOSTON BOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ He's easily lost among the supernovas in
attendance. Vin Baker doesn't automatically command the presence of
a Tim Duncan, Gary Payton, Kevin Garnett, or even a Tim Hardaway
and, based on what he did last season, probably deserves to be
somewhere other than where he is _ playing for USA Basketball's
Olympic qualifying team.
</P>
<P>
   He's here because of what he did in his first five years in the
league: four All-Star appearances (1995-98), one all-NBA second
team (1998), and an all-NBA third team (1997). In that span, he was
one of the top power forwards in the league, an enviable
combination of power and quickness.
</P>
<P>
   But like a lot of veterans, Baker was a casualty of the lockout.
He is coming off what he called a ``nightmare'' of a season, one
that saw precipitous drops in his customarily impressive stats and
his team, the Seattle SuperSonics, a defending division champ, fail
to make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in addition to being ultra determined to return to his
previous, stellar form, he is a free agent. If timing is
everything, one might think that Baker picked the absolute worst
time to offer his wares on the open market. He, of course, thinks
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the dreams that I've had can possibly become a reality
this summer,'' said the Connecticut native.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, he still hasn't given up on his one, unrelenting
hoop quest: to play for the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been a dream of mine to come back (to New England)
and don the Celtic green,'' Baker said Wednesday after working out
with his USA Basketball teammates at the Orlando Magic's practice
facility. ``So we'll see what can we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker has long professed a desire to play in Boston, but this is
his first crack at free agency. The Celtics don't have any cap room
_ nor does anyone else who would be appealing to him _ so any deal
would be an enormously complicated scenario, given that salary cap
complexities are sure to surface. That's not to say something
couldn't be worked out; Baker at least knows the mechanics by which
any deal would have to be consummated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know if it's going to be done, it's going to be a sign and
trade,'' he said, referring to a situation where the Sonics would
re-sign him and trade him, much the way the Bulls re-signed Scottie
Pippen, then traded him to Houston. ``It's definitely something I'd
want to do. Seattle is right up there, too, and I've had some good
times there and it's been a great city. But, obviously, coming home
and closing out my career right up the street would be great.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't talking about the Connecticut Pride of the CBA.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost, however, is getting back his game to a point
where anyone would want him. Was there any more pathetic sight last
season than an overweight Baker clanging one shot after another
from the free throw line? (He missed his first 14 and 19 of his
first 20.) He, along with Shawn Kemp and Antoine Walker, basically
submarined their respective teams' playoff chances by showing up
out of shape and never recovering.
</P>
<P>
   Baker also was hurt by injuries to his right knee and thumb. He
missed 16 games and his 13.8 scoring average was his lowest since
his rookie year. He had career lows in rebounding (6.2 per game),
shooting percentage (45.3), free throw percentage (45.0) and
assists (1.62 per game). The Sonics couldn't even crack the top
eight in the Western Conference after winning the Pacific Division
the year before in Baker's first season in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the most disappointing time in my career,''
Baker said. ``I let myself get out of shape, thinking there wasn't
going to be a season. It was a bad, bad situation. This summer,
more than getting a new contract or signing with any team, my
biggest goal is to get myself ready to play, returning to All-Star
form, and being one of the top players in this league again.''
</P>
<P>
   He says he's already lost 15 pounds. Larry Brown, the coach of
the qualifying team, isn't giving the boys a free ride either;
they're working for two hours-plus with a lot of running. Baker
thinks playing for this team is ideal for his summer plan. The
tournament, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, is from July 14-25, and the
United States needs to finish first or second to qualify for the
2000 Olympics in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Baker will be on that team as well. What he doesn't now, at
least now, is what NBA team he will be on for the 1999-2000 season.
He will talk it over with his parents in Connecticut, and his
agents, the Goodwin brothers who also handle Paul Pierce among
others, are due here Friday to talk about options and scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The way he spoke Wednesday, whatever team gets him is going to
be glad it did. The evil twin from last season is gone, Baker said,
never to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say 50 percent, maybe even 75 percent of the battle is
recognizing that you have a problem and doing something about it,
which I've already done and am still in the process of doing,'' he
said. ``I won't allow myself (to fall off the map.) Everyone who
knows me and has been around me knows that the most important thing
for me is getting back to where I was. Like (Muhammad) Ali said,
`All it's going to take is dying.' I'm doing that right now. No one
is going to stop me next year from getting back on top.''

STEWART CHECKS OUT THE COUNTRY CLUB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ No knickers, no cap, but no mistaking the
persona, either. It was Payne Stewart playing a practice round at
The Country Club Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh off his second US Open triumph and ready to head on a golf
vacation in Ireland to prepare for next week's British Open,
Stewart squeezed a little bit of homework into his schedule. He was
answering captain Ben Crenshaw's challenge to his Ryder Cup
players: Play the golf course, study its subtleties, be prepared.
</P>
<P>
   It was a trip Stewart was anxious to make and it was in the
works even before he secured a spot on the team with his US Open
triumph at Pinehurst No. 2 June 20. Stewart has never tried to hide
his passion for the Ryder Cup, an event he played in four times _
1987, '89, '91, and '93. But he failed to make the team in 1995 and
1997 and since those years resulted in US losses, Stewart is
anxious to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a special event,'' said Stewart. ``I can't feel for
anybody else. I can't get their emotions the way mine are. So
hopefully they'll see my emotions and something may rub off.''
</P>
<P>
   The Country Club, which will host the international golf
spectacle Sept. 24-26, is a course cut in the ``classical'' mold, a
type today's players play infrequently. That makes it imperative,
Crenshaw has said repeatedly, that players familiarize themselves
with the layout.
</P>
<P>
   If Stewart is any indication, there is much to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not one of those players who can remember every shot of
every round for years, not like a Lanny Wadkins,'' said Stewart
after his round. ``I played here in the 1988 US Open, but haven't
seen it since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I played well that year (he shot 73-73-70-67_283 and
was tied for 10th), but I didn't remember many of the holes.''
</P>
<P>
   As he toured The Country Club, Stewart took notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to see what Ben was thinking about with the width of
the fairways. And they are ample. They are much wider than I
remember them being in 1988.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough will also be down from what he remembers. Those are
the good parts, said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side? ``I don't remember these greens being as small as
they are. These greens are small. I thought the greens at Hilton
Head were small, but these greens are tiny.''
</P>
<P>
   It is this aspect of The Country Club that is mentioned most
often when observers discuss the course's character. While it will
not play long, at least not for the world's finest players, hitting
those small targets will offer the most demanding challenge. And
when you miss the greens at TCC, you often are left with awkward
chips from funky lies in rough.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart discovered this in his round Wednesday, which was casual
(he was dressed in shorts and a white Ryder Cup baseball cap),
though quite solid. ``He kept hitting it in the fairway and on the
greens,'' said Toni Facella, an assistant golf professional at The
Country Club. It was her job to video the round for club archives,
but ``he didn't give me much to film because he played so well. No
bunker shots, no trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The only greens he missed (the par-4 eight and 15th) resulted in
his two bogeys. He offset that with birdies at the par-5 14th
(driver, 4-wood, two putts) and par-3 16th in an even-par round of
71.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great day today. We had fun,'' said Stewart, who
played with his longtime coach, Chuck Cook.
</P>
<P>
   And the fun, he said, will continue overseas. He flew out of
Boston Wednesday night and will be in Ireland through Sunday. There
are four days of golf planned with some pretty fair players _ Tiger
Woods, David Duval, Mark O'Meara, and Stuart Appleby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always enjoying over there the week before the British
Open,'' said Stewart. ``You get yourself on the right time zone and
get accustomed to the wind that you have to play in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a friend who hosts us and the Irish people are so
great to us. It's a lot of fun.''

CHRISTY PLAYING INSPIRED GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thousands of miles away, back at his home in Ireland, the phone
kept ringing and ringing. Congratulations were in order, though the
hero wasn't even in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred-thirty-two calls,'' said Christy O'Connor Jr., who
prompted the outpouring of support by winning last weekend's Senior
PGA Tour event in Columbia, Md. ``Can you believe it?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes. A figure 10 times that would be believable, too.
We are, after all, talking about one of the truly splendid
gentlemen in the world of golf, a man whose great character and
unending charm and dignity have been put to the ultimate test the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   Darren, the youngest of his beloved children, was killed in a
car accident last August. That he was one of Ireland's most
promising golfers and represented another generation of this
celebrated golfing family was just a footnote to this tragic
reality: Darren O'Connor was a mere 17 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means so much to me and my family,'' O'Connor told the
crowd after his victory at Hobbit's Glen Golf Club. ``I won today
for my son. He was with me today.''
</P>
<P>
   They were going to be together last fall, before fate cruely
interferred. The man affectionately known as Junior (he is named
after his legendary uncle, Christy O'Connor Sr.) was going to turn
50 on Aug. 19 and head to the United States to pursue the Senior
PGA Tour. Darren was going to go with him and look at colleges in
hopes of gaining a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   The accident changed that plan and it was six months before
O'Connor got back to golf, accepting an invitation to the PGA
Seniors' Championship in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. He wrestled with
his emotions as he sandwiched a pair of 76s around a 71 and 73 to
finish in a tie for 50th. O'Connor was disappointed in the way he
played, but his many friends and admirers were just thrilled that
he played at all.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Keefe is one of those friends.
</P>
<P>
   Business had taken him to Ireland many times over the past 10
years or so and one great bonus was the friendship developed with
O'Connor. No surprise then that when the PGA Seniors' Championship
got under way, O'Keefe and his wife walked all 72 holes with their
friend.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise, either, that the O'Keefes had a small party at
their summer home on the Cape to watch Sunday's final round on
ESPN. It was not broadcast back to Ireland, so the phone calls went
back-and-forth with updates. ``I'll probably have a $400 bill,''
said O'Keefe, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's victory was lost in the glare of a most impressive
weekend for professional golf. There was Tiger Woods and his
magical game, flop shots and all, at the Western Open; a six-way
playoff in the LPGA Tour stop in Ohio; and a 19-year-old Spaniard,
Sergio Garcia, charging from behind with a charismatic and youthful
game that won the Irish Open.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderful stories, all of them, but none more so than O'Connor's
triumph in a furnace that passed as a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It nearly killed me,'' said O'Connor of the intense heat at
Hobbit's Glen. He comes from the land of ``soft rain'' where
golfers routinely look at pins that are nearly bent in half thanks
to wind, which probably isn't even considered wind until it reaches
gale proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Was he used to such heat? ``No. God no. It was something like
112 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a few days after the victory and O'Connor was laughing,
which is such a nice thing to hear. Another heat wave beckons, this
time in Des Moines, where the US Senior Open begins Thursday (July
8) but O'Connor has confronted far more difficult tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The three-shot lead he took into the final round at Hobbit's
Glen meant it was his event to lose. No problem with that. The best
player this year, Bruce Fleisher, was supplying even more heat. No
problem with that, either.
</P>
<P>
   But how was O'Connor to hold up when (not if) images of Darren
popped into his head?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was: Just fine. On the strength of a 65-66-67
performance, the popular Irishman had earned not only a $195,000
prize, but a one-year exemption on the Senior Tour. ``It was so
tough,'' said O'Connor. ``But it was so fantastic. It was like a
miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   When he went to Chicago Sunday night to meet his wife, Ann,
O'Connor thought he'd be the one telling her the good news. ``But
she already knew. She had called our daughter (Ann) back home. The
poor girl was back there answering all those phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann and Christy continued on to Des Moines for the Senior Open.
No surprise to his many friends, but he said ``I'd like to be out
celebrating.'' This is a man, after all, who enjoys a good
``sing-song'' and whose singing voice and ability to play the
spoons are legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, said O'Connor, a party would be nice, but Ann would have
none of it. She reminded him that there is another golf tournament
to be played. ``I don't know how I can win two in a row, but we'll
try our best,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, said O'Connor, ``I'm going home to get my thoughts
together and re-schedule my whole year.'' The Maryland victory will
then be celebrated in the company of his wife, daughter, son Nigel,
and many, many friends.
</P>
<P>
   Darren will be there, too. As he always will be.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SIDEBAR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His victory last week at the State Farm Senior Classic assures
what was already a pretty sure thing: Christy O'Connor Jr. will be
in the field at the BankBoston Senior Classic (Aug. 20-22).
</P>
<P>
   Tracy West, tournament director, confirmed that O'Connor would
be playing at Nashawtuc CC in Concord. West is in Des Moines for
this week's US Senior Open, a trip that also yielded a commitment
from Lee Trevino. He is the latest to say yes to a tournament that
is quickly establishing itself as a strong one.
</P>
<P>
   The Senior Tour's leading money winner, Bruce Fleisher, will be
in Concord, as will two-time defending champion Hale Irwin, and
Dana Quigley of Rhode Island. Dave Stockton, Chi Chi Rodriguez, Bob
Charles, and Isao Aoki are also committed.
</P>
<P>
   All those names in addition to arguably the biggest attractions
_ Arnold Palmer and Gary Player.
</P>
<P>
   For O'Connor, the trip to Boston will feel like a homecoming as
he visits the city often and has lots of friends here. Many of his
visits to Boston involve corporate outings that raise money for
charity back in his native Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, is a rookie to the Senior tours, having turned 50 last
August. A longtime favorite in Europe, he is well remembered as the
author of a dramatic 2-iron into the 18th hole at The Belfry that
stunned Fred Couples and helped Europe to a dramatic Ryder Cup
victory.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor has been playing in Senior events in the US on
sponsors' exemptions, though his victory earns him a one-year
exemption. Still, his goal is to finish Top 31 on the money list
(he's currently 22d). He will return to Europe for the British
Seniors Open and Wentworth Senior Masters, then come back to the US
in August.

GONDOLIERS UNDULATE, AGITATE AS CITY EYES CALMER MOTOR CRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNE WEIL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE _ Paolo Dalla Pieta hopped across a row of slender,
bobbing black boats. His was the fifth from the dock. He stripped
off its tarp and dipped the long, single oar in the water.
</P>
<P>
   Then he stepped to the stern, planted his feet firmly, and _
churning with both hands _ glided away from the land.
</P>
<P>
   Dalla Pieta, 35, is a born gondolier. His family has been
guiding this swan of a vessel and its predecessors for four
centuries. It is in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally he gets his blood up over a problem that has dogged
the gondoliers of Venice for more than 30 years: motorboats, and
the damage they leave in their wake.
</P>
<P>
   More than air or water pollution, or even the occasional
high-speed crash, the main complaint about powerboats in Venice is
``il moto ondoso,'' or wave motion. It is blamed for eroding the
city's foundations, eating away at 14th-century palaces, and
wrecking the powerless craft that are this city's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Venice agreed to buy a new wake-flattening hull
design for its fleet of water buses, which may promise smoother
waters if it catches on. But for the 405 gondoliers, powerboats
from private launches to the public transit vessels produce daily
aggravation: A run-in with a quay chips the paint; tourists get
nervous and stay away; muscles are sprained while fighting to keep
a sliver of a boat upright.
</P>
<P>
   In one such struggle two years ago, Dalla Pieta suffered a
hernia and could not work for a month.
</P>
<P>
   The waves are especially tough on the gondolas themselves. ``If
they topple over,'' said gondola-maker Roberto Tramontin, ``they
can lose parts that are hard to replace. And when a boat smashes
into something hard, it takes 40 to 50 days to put everything
right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually a gondola will last up to 25 years,'' he added, ``but
with the punishment they take in the waters of Venice today, they
have a life span of maybe 10 to 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalla Pieta's father, Fausto, was head of a gondoliers'
cooperative when he called the watery problem to city authorities'
attention in an April 1970 letter.
</P>
<P>
   It read, in part: ``Our beautiful gondolas . . . find themselves
ever more frequently tossed about by the incessant increase in wave
motion, provoked by motorized means in ever greater numbers and
driven without conscience, without scruples, by people who could
not possibly love their city.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The city wrote back,'' Paulo said with a grin over a
cappuccino. ``Their response was, `Wait until after the next
elections _ then we will talk.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, the elections passed, and nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did anything happen eight years later, when the gondoliers
demonstrated by hauling their boats out of the lagoon and onto St.
Mark's Square.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Paolo Dalla Pieta has joined numerous other
protests, such as the gondola blockade on the Grand Canal in August
1995. It slowed traffic on the city's main thoroughfare for about a
week.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, gondoliers put up a 120-foot-long, floating
fence across a choppy stretch of water in an attempt to create a
breakwater. The illegal contraption worked, but the mayor had it
removed. He said that the city council would propose a similar
barrier, but months later, the agency responsible for safety in
Venice's lagoon rejected the idea because it would have meant
relocating a water-bus stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political will is not there to solve this problem,'' Paolo
Dalla Pieta sighed. ``It has never been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the turbulence has increased. The busy seaport has
become the city's main industry, surpassing tourism. The number of
powerboats plying the waters for public transit, to deliver goods,
and for personal use has grown dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,500 Venetians own registered motorboats. And a fleet of
150 water buses is the main public transit for Venice's 264,000
residents and 17 million annual tourists. Several-hundred more
powered vessels serve as ambulances, police vehicles, and garbage
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Venetian problem is that we have all the means of
transport of any city,'' said Deputy Mayor Michele Vianello. ``But
the impact of the transport on the city and its environment is more
dramatic because of the water. The more boats there are, the more
the water will be tossed, and the more damage will be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Vianello ticked off a list of proposals to calm the waves that
had been rejected due to cost or for other reasons. He also listed
some of the 21 local, regional, and national agencies that have a
say _ and a veto _ on any issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been our experience through the years that once in a
while someone proposes to us the `solution,' '' he added. ``Then
`the solution,' shall we say, encounters reality.''
</P>
<P>
   One program, though, seems to be going full steam ahead:
replacing part of the municipal fleet with ``wave-eating'' boats. A
prototype, a sort of catamaran, has been tested. By January, local
boat yards may be making them by the dozen.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from the front, the special hull looks like two parallel
tunnels. These tunnels reduce the water resistance, creating a
smaller wave off the bow.
</P>
<P>
   The tunnels also lessen turbulence under the boat, further
diminishing drag. Propellers are mounted in the middle, rather than
on the stern. The resulting wake is smaller and less churned-up
than that of conventional craft.
</P>
<P>
   A shipping magnate and former US deputy secretary of state,
Charles W. Robinson, who owns a home in Venice, designed the hull
and called it ``Mangia Onda'' _ wave eater in English, except that
someone had copyrighted that name before Robinson got his idea.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Santa Fe, N.M., Robinson said he
paid the development costs for the craft himself. On July 2, he
signed a $700,000 contract with the Venetian transit system giving
it the right to use his hull design. Officials plan to use it first
for a new fleet of boats that will carry 150 passengers each.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who divides his time between Santa Fe and Venice,
knows there is still a sales job to be done. Gondoliers, water-taxi
operators, and boat builders are all skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is sensitive to Venetian sensibilities, but has ``not
been handicapped by experience or by tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Alessandro Cassone, in charge of project development at the
Venice Transport Authority, is enthusiastic. ``Chuck Robinson is a
real inhabitant of Venice,'' he said. ``He has a home here in
Venice. And Venice is not only for Venetian and Italian persons.
Venice is the patrimony of all the world, and Mr. Robinson has the
right solution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Giorgio Piva, president of Venice's largest cooperative of
powered water taxis, is not so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Mangia Onda' is not right for this city,'' he said from
the pilot's seat of a lacquered craft with a high-powered engine at
the back. ``We in Venice have been building boats for hundreds of
years. We know how to construct boats. We do not need new ones from
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Piva similarly dismissed other plans to reduce wave motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always waves,'' he said. ``Bad weather also brings
waves. Why try to stop them?''
</P>
<P>
   As she watched a baby-blue patrol boat trail a water taxi like a
shark, Gabriella Cigogne, 62, whose family has lived near the
Renaissance-era Rialto Bridge since the early 1800s, expressed
little faith in the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are doing their best, poor things,'' she shrugged. ``We
should not expect too much of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Venice was born for traveling by gondola. Sadly, the modern
era is taking that away from us. The wave motion is a dolorous note
for our city.''
</P>
<P>
   If the gondolas are to fall victim to powerboat wakes, despite
such innovations as the Mangia Onda, it won't be because no one
tried to save them.
</P>
<P>
   A city agency, the Institute for the Conservation of the Gondola
and the Tutelage of the Gondolier, mediates between gondoliers and
the authorities, intervenes in disputes over right of way, and
promotes the gondola as a symbol of Venice.
</P>
<P>
   But its president, Franco Vianello Moro, said gondoliers are
engaged in a ``quixotic battle,'' and noted that many of them own
powerboats themselves.
</P>
<P>
   And their motivation for preserving the classic vessels in this
tourist mecca, he said, has more to do with ``an occasion for good
earnings than an occasion for taking part in the city's culture and
tradition. Still, some of them have a passion for it because, in
their personal culture, they have the history of the gondola.''
</P>
<P>
   Paolo Dalla Pieta is clearly one of those. But lately, he said,
even the call of the blood has not been enough to rouse his
colleagues to anger over Venice's troubled waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become tired,'' he sighed, gazing across a row of
gently rocking black boats with bows tethered to the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier this year, a few of the gondoliers asked me to
organize a protest. I told them there was no point. They will not
stick together in a fight. And out of one hundred rabbits, you
cannot make a horse.''

`AMERICAN PIE' A SLICE OF HORMONAL   TEEN   LIFE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
Our rating: 2 1/2 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Cross ``Porky's'' with a modern-day ``Dawson's
Creek'' sensitivity, add about a quart of bodily fluids and a dash
of female perspective and you've got ``American Pie,'' the heavily
hyped, hormonally charged teen movie that finds new and creative
uses for baked goods and musical instruments.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, everything in ``American Pie'' _ the conversations,
the parties, the clothes and, yes, the musical instruments and
baked goods _ revolves around one subject: s-e-x.
</P>
<P>
   From the first scene in the movie _ teen boy watching scrambled
porn and getting friendly with a tube sock _ the filmmakers make
their randy intentions plain and clear. All that's missing is Barry
White on the soundtrack, a startling omission since there are more
than 30 songs included in the 95-minute movie. (Teens love music _
and they love to buy soundtracks.)
</P>
<P>
   Given the now-familiar carnal encounter one boy has with a warm
apple pie, it would be easy to peg this movie as gross raunch-fest.
But the virgin filmmaking team of director Paul Weitz, producer
Chris Weitz (his brother) and screenwriter Adam Herz have sweeter _
and more conventional _ aspirations for their slice-of-teen-life
tale. And, ultimately, it's that earnestness, along with keen eye
for the way teen-agers talk and act, that make this ``Pie''
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of simple enough: Four high-school seniors vow to lose
their virginity by prom night. There's Jim (Jason Biggs), who
develops an affinity for pie much to the dismay of his well-meaning
dad (Eugene Levy, funny as always). There's the boy most likely to
succeed, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), given his long-standing
relationship with his girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid). There's the shy
jock, Oz (Keanu Reeves look-alike Chris Klein). And there's Finch
(Eddie Kaye Thomas), the nerd with an aversion to the school's
bathrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows them on their quest, borrowing elements from
``Porky's'' and the superior ``Fast Times at Ridgemont High'' along
the way. Certain cliches are upheld and celebrated. Thus, we have
the sexually voracious older woman (Jennifer Coolidge), the
sexually voracious foreign exchange student (Shannon Elizabeth) and
the sexually voracious nerdy girl (the excellent Alyson Hannigan
from TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer''). Notice a theme here?
Notice a fantasy here?
</P>
<P>
   So, yes, ``American Pie'' salutes the lewd and crude. (Four
different involuntary bodily functions are honored along the way.)
That doesn't mean it isn't pretty darn funny at times. The
filmmakers also never forget that behind all the adolescent
bluntness and bravado lies a great deal of fear and uncertainty.
This movie has poignancy _ real and manufactured _ in spades. It's
just not always easy to see it through the cloud of gas. &QL;

CLEVELAND FANS KNOCK STUFFING OUT OF AL VOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Cleveland outfielder David Justice has been in
this position before, sitting back in a clubhouse chair waxing
semi-philosophical about All-Star voting. In this state where a
bald-headed former athlete serves as governor, the similarly shaved
Justice sounds as if he's on the campaign trail. He wants to bring
the vote not just to the people, but also to the players. He talks
about reform. He wonders if a balloting system so entrenched can be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got players that have been voted in that have not
deserved to be there every year, but that's just the way baseball
is,'' said Justice. ``That's just the way the system is. If you
want to change the system, then change the system. Every year
somebody comes around and asks about players who won't make it and
players who are unhappy. At what point are people going to say,
`Let's do something about the problem.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Added shortstop Omar Vizquel: ``I don't want to mention any
names, but you can see that some players deserve more votes than
others and some don't deserve as many as they get. It's like a
popularity contest more than what you do in the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Indians were the main beneficiaries of a voting
system that lets fans decide who will start the All-Star Game,
Justice and Vizquel take an interesting stand. Then again in the
Cleveland clubhouse, look a few locker stalls away and you can see
the skewed effects of the current voting system.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians dominated the popular vote the way they have
dominated their opponents this season, finishing with four starters
and placing at least one player among the top three in every
position. Wednesday, American League manager Joe Torre named
Vizquel a reserve, while pitcher Charles Nagy was chosen to replace
the Yankees' Mariano Rivera, who will take care of personal
business during the break. The additions bring Cleveland's All-Star
total to six, equaling the second greatest number of players the
Tribe has sent to the midsummer classic. On four occasions (1943,
1955, 1995, 1998), six Indians represented the AL. In 1952,
Cleveland had seven All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   If Vizquel hadn't dropped in the final count, an Indians player
would have been either first or second in all seven categories.
Justice finished fourth in the outfield balloting, behind top
vote-getter Ken Griffey and Indians teammates Manny Ramirez and
Kenny Lofton. Besides Ramirez and Lofton, Cleveland's Jim Thome
(first base) and Roberto Alomar (second base) will take the field
for the American League in the first inning Tuesday night at Fenway
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans understand the game and they know who they want to see
out there and they pretty much vote that way,'' said Lofton.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the power of the Cleveland vote displaced deserving players
and angered others. Thome's victory of 679,801 votes over Texas
first baseman Rafael Palmeiro raised more than a few eyebrows as
Palmeiro has better statistics across the board. Entering Wednesday
night, Palmeiro was batting .349 with 20 home runs and 73 RBIs,
while Thome lagged behind at .276 with 13 homers and 46 RBIs. The
oft-injured Travis Fryman's second-place finish among third basemen
also is dubious. Fryman's numbers (.259, 8 HRs, 42 RBIs) pale when
compared with those of Toronto's Tony Fernandez (.382, 5 HRs, 56
RBIs).
</P>
<P>
   And three Indians outfielders finishing among the top four?
Texas right fielder and reigning AL MVP Juan Gonzalez was so
incensed by the balloting that he made it known he did not want to
take part in the All-Star Game as a reserve. Consequently, the
outfielder, whose statistics (.316, 23 home runs, 77 RBIs) rank up
there with Griffey and Ramirez and far exceed the 1999
accomplishments of Justice and Lofton, will stay home. He placed a
distant fifth in the voting.
</P>
<P>
   The most logical explanation for Cleveland's voting influence
lies with its league-leading attendance and the zealous efforts of
Tribe fans. The people of Cuyahoga County have become a popular
SportsCenter punch line in recent days. And they have sold out a
major league-record 337 consecutive games. For the last four years,
the Indians have sold out the entire season before Opening Day.
Cleveland averages 42,543 fans per home game at Jacobs Field, the
highest mark in the American League. Owning the best record in
baseball and sitting atop the Central Division doesn't hurt either.
</P>
<P>
   The fans' enthusiasm is matched only by constant Cleveland
campaigning. When balloting in Cleveland began May 11, the Indians
held a pregame ceremony to get fans involved. Team mascot Slider
punched out a super-size All-Star ballot, casting all his votes for
Cleveland players. Every night during the voting period, which
ended June 26, the Jacobs Field public address announcer exhorted
fans to vote for their favorite Indians as the ballpark Jumbotron
flashed the names of prospective All-Stars on the home team.
Cleveland also used the big screen to inform spectators where they
could vote _ on the Internet, at games, and at seven team shops in
the Cleveland area. Ushers, called ``hosts and greeters'' in
Cleveland, handed out ample stacks of ballots during homestands.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez argued that the disproportionate number of home games
each team plays is a major factor. The Rangers played just 22 home
games in May and June (only the A's, with 20, had fewer), while
Boston had 33 and Cleveland 32 in that span. Additionally, in
mid-June, the Indians played three-game series in nearby Cincinnati
and Toronto, which drew large numbers of Cleveland fans, many of
whom probably couldn't get tickets to sold-out home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I attribute it to the fact that they're all good players and
people around the country voted for them,'' said Indians manager
Mike Hargrove of his team's All-Star dominance. ``I don't buy into
the fact that I've heard people whispering that Indian fans are
stuffing the ballot boxes. They're good players. They deserve to be
on the team and they're on the team. That's the way the system was
designed and that's how it's played out. I think the system is as
fair as you can get.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players that got voted on the team deserve to be
on the team. Then there are guys like Omar Vizquel, who's hitting
(.336 entering Thursday night) and catching everything in sight.
You've got David Justice, who has (16) home runs and (61) RBIs. I
don't see any of them getting in because fans stuffed the ballot
box or getting a high vote total because of that. Certainly, more
people voted for these guys than just the people in Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cleveland factor does recall other All-Star voting
oddities. In 1957, folks in Cincinnati took ballot-box stuffing to
the extreme. Reds fans voted almost exclusively for their players,
disregarding such stars as Hank Aaron and Willie Mays and giving
their local heroes the top spots at seven of eight positions.
Commissioner Ford Frick straightened out the matter, replacing
Cincinnati players Gus Bell and Wally Post with Mays and Aaron, and
took the vote away from the fans. The fan balloting was restored in
1970.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the Phillies' Mike Schmidt was voted to start at
third base despite the fact that he had retired in May. In 1991,
Indians catcher Sandy Alomar, who was hurt early in the season and
wound up missing 111 games, was voted a starter. This season,
despite being limited to 82 at-bats after undergoing knee surgery
May 21, Alomar finished second among AL catchers.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries aside, the players often hurt most by indiscriminate
fan voting are those left to contend for reserve positions.
Hargrove knows this well. Last season, he selected the Yankees'
Derek Jeter and Vizquel as reserves at shortstop behind starter
Alex Rodriguez, leaving the Red Sox' Nomar Garciaparra as odd man
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through and picked everybody I thought deserved to be
on it and then went back through and repicked and started
eliminating people,'' said Hargrove, noting that each team must
have at least one representative. ``I probably had 45 different
lists at one time or another.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hargrove was asked if there was a time he felt particularly
bad about not naming a player, the Indians manager had a one-word
answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garciaparra,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Justice has a solution. He suggests expanding the
roster and taking all the players considered All-Star caliber. Even
then, the debate about which players merit selection probably would
continue. And there would still be sentimental favorites _ and
quite a few Indians _ in the mix.

GOP WINCES AT BUCHANAN'S 4-YEAR ITCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Patrick J. Buchanan is back for his third White
House run, and is poised to replay the skunk at the Republican
presidential garden party.
</P>
<P>
   He's going against the GOP grain again, as he did in 1992 and
1996, proudly defending his protectionist beliefs, pounding the
front-runner as wishy-washy, and proclaiming his solidarity with
working men and women whom the economic boom has passed by.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the forgotten Americans, those who this Goldilocks
economy has left behind?'' Buchanan, 60, asked during a brief
interview. ``For them, my message is resonating. I've always spoken
for those folks, and I'm going to speak for them again.''
</P>
<P>
   The combative CNN commentator is in full campaign cry on issues
pollsters urge the GOP to play down in 2000. Buchanan is an ardent
America First opponent of free trade and open borders, an
impassioned crusader against abortion, and a pure isolationist in
foreign affairs. He can't stand the United Nations and calls the
Kosovo conflict ``one of the stupidest wars in American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan also is making a punching bag out of Texas Governor
George W. Bush, a rival for the GOP nomination and the candidate
party elders regard as their best hope for regaining the White
House after eight years. ``I do not think he is deep on the
issues,'' said Buchanan, who in 1992 battered Bush's father, then
the president, with biting verbal jabs.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has not put a stop to the current buzz that he is so
disillusioned with the Republican centrist drift that he will
abandon the GOP and make a third-party bid. Last week, Buchanan
said that if the GOP ``ceased to be pro-life, it would cease to be
my party.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have to take the threat seriously. On the stump in
Iowa and New Hampshire, Buchanan for months has been firing up
small groups of loyal followers, invoking his so-called Pitchfork
Brigade to ``mount up and ride to the sound of the guns!'' And as
the surprise winner of the 1996 New Hampshire primary, Buchanan has
a history of giving GOP front-runners fits.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, and Bush partisans in particular, contend that
if Buchanan had not challenged and weakened President Bush during
the 1992 primaries, third-party candidate Ross Perot could not have
siphoned off so many general-election votes from Bush and handed
the presidency to Democrat Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat Buchanan was a royal pain in 1992,'' said Richard Bond,
who was Republican Party chairman at the time. ``He was a
consistent distraction to the Bush political operation, and his
constant stream of invectives was one of the ingredients in tearing
Bush down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buchanan was not helpful then, and he is not helpful now.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's as a Republican. ``Mr. Buchanan is running for the
nomination for the Republican Party for president. His focus is as
a Republican,'' Bob Adams, Buchanan's communications director, said
last week after syndicated columnist Robert Novak kindled
speculation to the contrary. Novak had reported Buchanan's
deepening ``alienation from his party and the prospective
nominee,'' George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have watched Buchanan for decades in Washington say he
is fundamentally too traditional to go the independent route. He
grew up here in an affluent home, one of nine children in a
Scottish-Irish Catholic family ruled by a father who demanded his
sons be as conservative as they were streetwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is as Republican as he is Catholic,'' said Paul Weyrich,
president of the conservative Free Congress Foundation. ``He will
die a Catholic, and he will die a Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Verney, chairman of Perot's Dallas-based Reform Party,
said he had not spoken to Buchanan but believed he could be ``a
very competitive candidate'' for the Reform Party's nomination next
year. ``There are no disqualifiers with respect to Buchanan on the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In these good economic times, Buchanan's populist message of
economic nationalism _ imposing protective tariffs on foreign
imports, rejecting global treaties to promote trade, protecting US
jobs from foreign labor _ may have more appeal to disenchanted
independent voters and blue-collar Democrats than to the Republican
Party that Buchanan has long called home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat has a constituency out there that is his alone,'' said Lyn
Nofziger, a veteran GOP operative who is a senior Buchanan adviser.
``The trouble is, that constituency is probably more Democratic
than it is Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Nofziger said two things about a third-party run are
``tempting'' to Buchanan. One is that it would give Democrats a
chance they don't have in party primaries to vote for Buchanan. The
other is that the Reform Party candidate is going to be eligible
for millions of dollars in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Buchanan said there is not the kind of
economic angst today that propelled him to a victory over Robert
Dole in the 1996 New Hampshire primary and got him 37 percent of
the primary vote in 1992. ``I'm glad that New Hampshire is out of a
depression, because that's good for New Hampshire and for the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan has made a career of articulating policy for the GOP,
first as a speechwriter for President Nixon, later as
communications director for President Reagan, as a presidential
candidate in 1992 and 1996, as an author, and as the sharp-tongued,
quick-witted voice of Republican conservatism on CNN's
``Crossfire'' and other talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Buchanan says, he's ready for one more great debate for the
soul of the party and the destiny of the nation, a debate that pits
a cultural conservative/economic patriot against the Republican
establishment. He puts himself in the first category. In the second
category he puts Bush, former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole,
Arizona Senator John McCain, and publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of these wins the GOP nomination, we risk a replay of
1992 and 1996, where both major parties will agree on most major
issues, and a pillow fight will ensue over some dinky tax cut,''
Buchanan said in a speech last month before the National Press
Club. Buchanan called his rivals ``virtual Xerox copies'' of
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan's flirtation with an independent run could arise
from a fear that this great GOP debate will never take place. In a
recent fund-raising letter to supporters, he accused the Republican
Party of ``cutting backroom deals'' to eliminate straw polls, where
he could show grass-roots strength, and ``rigging'' the primary
calendar to help the well-financed Bush, whom he calls the party's
``anointed candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   He also calls George W. Bush ``the Prince of Wales,'' as in the
offspring of King George, his name for President Bush. ``I cannot
see anything thus far that justifies elevating this young man to be
president of the United States and the leader of the Western
world,'' Buchanan said recently on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Duprey, the Republican Party chairman in New Hampshire,
denied that the party is manipulating the primaries or abandoning
its principles, but he admitted that the GOP, hungry for a winner,
is eager to unite behind one candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing like eight years out of power to introduce a
healthy dose of pragmatism into the Republican Party,'' Duprey
said, noting that Buchanan's 1992 state chairman, former US
representative Chuck Douglas, was backing Bush this time. ``Not
even grass-roots activists like losing,'' Duprey said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Buchanan's bid for 2000 might be handicapped as much by
fellow conservatives as by GOP moderates. In 1996, Buchanan had
little competition when he ran to the right of Dole and needled him
throughout the primary season. This time, the field of social
conservatives is crowded with Gary Bauer, Alan Keyes, former vice
president Dan Quayle, and Senators Bob Smith of New Hampshire and
Orrin Hatch of Utah. Forbes also has been courting antiabortion
activists.
</P>
<P>
   However, Shelly Uscinski, who stepped down as chairman of New
Hampshire's Christian Coalition to manage the Buchanan campaign in
the state, has been encouraged by the loyalty and enthusiasm of his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a few people have been conflicted because there are a
lot of different conservative candidates this time,'' Uscinski
said. ``But for the most part, Buchananites who were Buchananites
are still Buchananites.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who is energized by even a backyard full of true
believers, seems undaunted by his meager, $1 million war chest and
single-digit standing in recent national polls. He says he has a
better organization and more money than he did in 1995, and he
proved he can rally his supporters by handily winning a straw poll
at a New Hampshire conservatives' picnic Sunday in Hopkinton.
</P>
<P>
   The pace is grueling, says Shelley Buchanan, the candidate's
wife of 28 years and his constant traveling companion, and it's
only July 1999. ``He loves it,'' she says, explaining why the
couple leaves the comfort of a suburban Washington home every four
years and hits the campaign trail. ``It gives Pat a lift.''

HAITI STILL IN CHAOS, 5 YEARS LATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ When bandits attacked his wife outside a
beauty salon and made off with the family's Nissan, Richard
Widmaier did what any citizen might be expected to do: He called
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, Widmaier spotted the car and summoned
authorities again. Instead of returning the stolen property, police
demanded he show papers proving he was the car's owner. It was only
after pleading with the precinct chief that Widmaier, the owner of
one of the country's largest radio networks, had the keys thrown at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got played around,'' Widmaier recalled. ``But I refused to
give in.''
</P>
<P>
   Widmaier's experience with crime in Haiti is mild compared to
other recent episodes.
</P>
<P>
   In January, President Rene Preval's sister was shot at after he
dissolved the parliament. Last month, 11 people were gunned
execution-style by police during a raid in a slum. Three weeks ago,
a US military vehicle was pelted by rocks when it stalled on a
Port-au-Prince street.
</P>
<P>
   The growing sense of unease and insecurity that now shrouds this
small Caribbean nation is once again feeding doubts about Haiti's
ability to build a stable democracy after decades of authoritarian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   And as the United States and its allies begin a new peacekeeping
chapter in Kosovo, many of those who have lived through the
5-year-old, US-led efforts in Haiti say that little, if anything,
has improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Americans first came, they were applauded and cheered
here, just like in Kosovo,'' Prime Minister Jacques-Edouard Alexis
said in an interview. ``But they have to be careful to deliver what
they promise.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the 20,000 troops that landed on Haiti's shores in
September 1994 quickly reinstated the country's democratically
elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, and disbanded the ruling
military group that ousted him three years earlier, that ``was only
part of the problem,'' Alexis added.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were entire questions of economic and social development
that have never been properly taken into account by these
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the US troops withdrew from Haiti three years ago,
handing over peacekeeping and rebuilding work to a smaller United
Nations force. But the country's path to prosperity seems as broken
and treacherous as the pothole-scarred streets that snake their way
around the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The government here has been without a budget for two years
because of ongoing disputes between the parliament and the Preval
administration. Hundreds of millions of dollars in international
aid has not been delivered because stubborn political factions will
not stop squabbling. And the country still does not have a
functioning parliament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians don't see themselves as serving the general
population and they don't believe in sharing power,'' said one
European diplomat. ``After a while the people will begin to wonder
what the whole point of this thing called democracy is.''
</P>
<P>
   That frustration is already beginning to show. Street protests,
some of them involving rock-throwing demonstrators, have grown both
in size and frequency over the past three months, against the
government's gridlock and the worsening economic plight.
</P>
<P>
   Several international observers and Preval government officials
privately accuse Aristide loyalists of fomenting the street
disruptions to set the stage for the former president's messianic
return to office in the next elections. Already, scores of walls
throughout the capital have Aristide's nickname _ ``Titid 2001'' _
scribbled on them.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide did not respond to requests for interviews. But Yvon
Neptune, a spokesman and top-ranking official of the Family Lavalas
political coalition headed by Aristide denied involvement in the
uprisings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people have already stated that they are waiting for''
Aristide ``to return,'' Neptune said during an interview at the
offices of Aristide's Foundation for Democracy. ``We have no need
to invent some scenario for his return to office.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the disappointed voices of those discouraged by Haiti's
current plight echo throughout this mountainous nation of 8 million
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, tourists came to Haiti and they bought many
things,'' said Felder Revolis, 46, who once sold hand-woven baskets
but now practices a more practical but less lucrative trade
peddling mangoes from a wooden stand in downtown Port-au-Prince.
``I'm not wishing for the old days of dictators, but there is so
much chaos today.''
</P>
<P>
   To help end the political paralysis, Alexis pledged that new
parliamentary elections will be held in November and December. ``We
all agree that the way to get things back on track is to have
elections,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Without political stability, Haiti, already the poorest country
in the hemisphere with an annual per capita income of $250, risks
tumbling deeper into poverty, economists say.
</P>
<P>
   To help keep some basic services running, the government has
increased taxes, mostly on manufacturing businesses, where there
has been slight growth. The country also relies heavily on
approximately $800 million residents receive every year in
remittances from Haitian immigrants who live abroad, mostly in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Another more troubling source of wealth into the country has
come from the growing drug trade, officials said. Located on the
western end of the island of Hispaniola due north from Colombia,
Haiti's sparsely populated southern coast has become a popular
drop-off point for South American cartels.
</P>
<P>
   US and Haitian authorities now say that as much as 20 percent of
the cocaine destined for the United States passes through Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fractiousness of the political atmosphere has helped
create a climate where poor people are willing to take big risks,''
said one high-ranking US official in Haiti who requested anonymity.
``And drugs has become one of the biggest attractions.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite unemployment levels that exceed 60 percent and an even
higher illiteracy rate, there are signs everywhere of new,
unexplained wealth.
</P>
<P>
   On the northern edge of Port-au-Prince, clusters of bright pink
and yellow Miami-style homes have sprouted. Shiny sport utility
vehicles, many of them bearing the names of car dealers in Florida,
zip along the capital's narrow, hilly streets alongside local
vehicles that sputter and belch black clouds of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The growing drug trade has also stretched the resources and
ethics of Haiti's young national police force.
</P>
<P>
   The force was formed in 1995 after the country's military was
disbanded and trained by a multinational UN group. Many of the
6,000 officers have found themselves either the victims of Haiti's
growing crime wave or accused of adding to it. Over the last three
years, 56 officers have been jailed for drug corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an inexperienced police force and we're desperately
short of resources, so sometimes an agent will seize other
opportunities,'' said Pierre Denize, Haiti's National Police chief.
``This is a country where political gridlock was usually ended by
the military or public force. This time it will have to be solved
by the politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the insecurity grows, many of the international
groups whose presence here over the past five years has provided at
least a symbolic sense of safety for many Haitians are preparing to
leave.
</P>
<P>
   Both the UN Observer's office and the police-training group are
scheduled to close their operations at the end of November. The
commander of the US military's Southern Command, General Charles E.
Wilhelm, told Congress in February that he would like to pull out
the remaining 500 troops, who mostly provide medical and
humanitarian assistance, out of concern for their safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more intolerance and more threats,'' said Colin
Granderson, chief of the UN Civilian Mission in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I wouldn't say that any one group has been targeted.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to compare the task ahead for international workers
in Kosovo with the lessons learned in Haiti, Granderson said, ``The
transition to democracy is a long, slow and often painful process.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to build institutions, it can't happen
overnight. It requires a long-term commitment.''

<P>
   BOSTON -- Like millions before her, Wenjie Qin came to America
to taste the fruits of liberty.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-year-old Chinese immigrant and her husband, Henry, have
built a new life in Brighton. They live in a modest two-bedroom
condominium _ a palace by the standards of their hometown in Anhui
province. Doctorate in education in hand, she revels in her
independence, a feeling she never knew in China, where prudence
dictated self-censorship and conformity.
</P>
<P>
   Qin cherishes this freedom. It's why she and her family watch US
history videos on Independence Day and why in early July they
always take a bus trip to explore the country _ this year
Tennessee. It's why a small US flag sits on a pedestal beside the
TV. ``That,'' says Qin who came to America shortly after the 1989
Tiananmen crackdown, ``is why we stay here: the freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Qin watches her 11-year-old sons, Yelun and Yening,
head off to school in their Lee jeans and Nikes (they will only
wear Nikes), she worries they are taking the freedom of America in
directions that she never wanted or anticipated. They have embraced
a different America, that of Burger King, Star Wars, and Michael
Jordan. They pump their fists in the air at the very mention of his
name.
</P>
<P>
   The story of two generations of immigrant families is a
bittersweet tale of changing values and expectations. It is also
the story of the United States and what it means to be an American
living on the edge of the millennium. And it is an old story.
</P>
<P>
   It was John Adams, America's second president, who wrote in 1780
that he studied war and politics so that his sons could study
mathematics and philosophy, so their children might study
``painting, poetry, music . . . tapestry and porcelain.''
</P>
<P>
   The new immigrants, like the waves of Irish, Italians, and Balts
who preceded them, have fled famine, war, tyranny or economic
hardship to sell their labor on the open market. For many of the
families, the new life has been characterized by toil.
</P>
<P>
   In her native land, Honduras, Leslie Garo was a teacher; her
husband was an accountant for a luxury resort. In the United
States, they've worked as personal care assistants, emptying
bedpans and bathing the sick, so their three children might one day
go to college. A colleague from her old school wrote her in Boston
and asked how someone with her education could be cleaning
Americans' behinds. The remark still stings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a struggle,'' said Garo, whose job now is providing
AIDS education for a community service agency. ``We're young _ not
even halfway down our road _ but we're already tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The new immigrants love America's freedom, but their patriotism
for their homelands remains. Victims of the Argentine junta's
atrocities in the 1970s can still be moved to tears by talk of the
country's claim to the Falklands. You can talk to Chinese
immigrants who will be sharply critical of their government's human
rights record, but who still insist that China must never part with
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   And many still pine for their native lands. Garo, who says she
will return to Honduras the very day her youngest child enters
college, dreams of the cocoanut and mango trees in her yard.
</P>
<P>
   Abebe Woldu, an Eritrean who owns Asmara Restaurant in
Cambridge, goes home once a year and says he looks forward to the
day when he can retire to Eritrea. ``If you don't have money, you
are nothing'' in the United States, Woldu said. ``Over there, if
you are my friend, I'm your friend forever. If you are rich and
become poor, I will support you until you die.''
</P>
<P>
   The children of immigrants have complicated senses of their
identities. Marina Belozerskaya of Cambridge is deeply grateful to
her mother and father for leaving the Soviet Union. When
Belozerskaya was 13, they left because of anti-Semitism. At the
same time, after nearly two decades in this country, Belozerskaya
still doesn't feel like an American.
</P>
<P>
   When she travels in Europe she tells people she is a Russian.
``I feel that my home is where I am and what I create around myself
rather than a particular country,'' said Belozerskaya, a Bunting
Fellow at Harvard University. ``I have a sense of being a turtle
with a home on my back.''
</P>
<P>
   However, her younger sister Eugenia, 17, was born in the United
States, and, to her parents' utter bewilderment, has developed
American sensibilities. Her parents, who converse in Russian
(except when they lecture Eugenia) are enthusiastic readers and
wish she would spend more time reading the Russian classics. But to
Eugenia, freedom means watching ``Dawson's Creek.'' It means
shopping trips to the Gap, ``chilling'' with friends and body
piercing _ ears, nose and tongue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I was put in the wrong family,'' Eugenia says. ``I
belong in an American family, but I am stuck in a Russian family.
Though I do love them to death.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wenjie Qin's house on a recent weekday evening, the air was
redolent with the smell of frying bok choy and duck. Qin's husband,
Henry, served while Qin sat at the table. The two boys, Qin noted
proudly, helped with the cooking and the laundry. In the old days,
back in China, Henry never would have done the dishes. But in
America, where he is a BMW salesman, she has persuaded him to pull
his weight around the house. ``I became stronger in this country,''
she said. ``Women have more power here.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, she noted with dismay that her children were
also staging a quiet revolution for more freedom and rights. ``They
want to be equal,'' she said. She sighed. ``They are very
Americanized.''

<P>
   As the World Wide Web expands at a staggering rate, search
engines are failing to keep up, according to a study released
Wednesday by two New Jersey researchers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers estimate that the Web more than doubled in size
between December 1997 and February 1999, but major search engines _
services that probe the Web and provide links to sites matching key
words _ combine to cover less than half of the available cyber
information.
</P>
<P>
   None of the 11 major Internet search engines covers even
one-sixth of the Web's estimated 800 million publicly accessible
pages, according to the study in the journal Nature by Steve
Lawrence and C. Lee Giles of NEC Research Institute in Princeton.
That figure is down from about one-third just 14 months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The search engines are finding the Web very difficult to
manage,'' Giles said.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted in February, found Cambridge-based Northern
Light to be the most expansive engine and Waltham-based Lycos and
Euroseek the least. About 85 percent of Web browsers use search
engines to locate information, they wrote. The study also found
that it may take months for new pages to be recognized by search
engines.
</P>
<P>
   Rajive Mathur, Lycos's director of search services, said his
company's database is five times as large as represented in the
study. Some of the growth has come since the study was completed,
spokesman Brian Payea said.
</P>
<P>
   ``February 1999 is a long time ago in the Internet world,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers entered 1,050 queries and analyzed the responses
of search engines. They found the return rates of the engines and
compared them to Northern Light, which said it had indexed 128
million _ or 16 percent _ of the estimated 800 million pages.
</P>
<P>
   Giles said his research indicates that ``catch-all'' search
engines are becoming increasingly inadequate for the sophisticated
Web user. Those users are looking for more specialized information
_ such as science studies _ than Joe Internet, who is logging on
for a cyber test drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't all drive the same kind of car,'' Giles said. The
all-inclusive search may go the way of the Model T, he said. The
concept will last, he said, but there is a growing market for
services that find specialized information, such as the lowest
price for a book.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the Web's expansion, Giles said, can be traced to
electronic commerce. He was startled to find that 83 percent of
servers _ which house hundreds of Web sites _ have commercial
content.
</P>
<P>
   New pages are being added to the Web at a clip of 3 million a
day, but the study found that, on average, it took more than six
months for a major search engine to find new documents matching a
given query.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers specifically cited updating scientific
information as an area that would greatly improve the lagging
search engines. Research articles are often available on the Web
much sooner than in traditional databases, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``An index of all scientific information on the Web would be
feasible and very valuable,'' they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence and Giles conducted a similar study in December 1997
using six search engines. During that study, they estimated the
size of the Web at only 320 million pages. The Web will continue to
grow, but the pace will likely slow, Giles said.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1997 study, the researchers found HotBot covered 34
percent of the pages and the engines combined covered about 60
percent of the Web. Lycos purchased HotBot last year, but continues
to run it as an independent search engine.
</P>
<P>
   The new study found the overlap between engines remains
relatively low, and the major engines combine to cover 42 percent
of the Web, they wrote. Search sites such as MetaCrawler that
combine the results of multiple engines provide a great deal more
coverage, they wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Next after Northern Light were Snap and AltaVista, which covered
15.5 percent of the Web. HotBot covered 11.3 percent; Microsoft,
8.5 percent; Infoseek, 8 percent; Google, 7.8 percent; Yahoo, 7.4
percent; Excite, 5.6 percent; Lycos, 2.5 percent, and Euroseek, 2.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   He said the widely used search engines are not indexing more
because it does not help them make more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true for a lot of companies,'' said Marc Krellenstein,
Northern Light's chief technical officer. ``But it's not our
feeling. We've had a goal from the beginning to have a
comprehensive database.''

IN SOME QUARTERS, US MILITARY ROLE IS APPRECIATED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ In the heart of one of the poorest slums
in the poorest country in the Western hemisphere, the people gather
at dawn on the days they know the US troops are coming to run their
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the medical personnel arrive, usually by 1 p.m.,
hundreds of residents of the Cite Soleil neighborhood and other
areas of Port-au-Prince have come with ailments that run from
tuberculosis to a gangrene-infected leg that requires immediate
amputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a challenge, because this is a country that
clearly needs a lot of help,'' said Captain Adam Robinson, who last
month was overseeing an army group of doctors, nurses and
assistants based in Jacksonville, Fla. ``But the Haitians accept
us. Sometimes when we arrive, there are 1,000 people waiting for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Three times a week, the remaining US troops here run this clinic
in the dusty courtyard of a school run by the Brothers of Charity
in this slum of cramped, tin-roofed shacks where mountains of trash
sit next to streams that run with sewage and seawater.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner of the clinic, there is a primary care cluster to
diagnose patients. In another, there is a minor surgery section.
And a third corner holds the dental area.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic is part of the overall humanitarian assistance
program run by the US military, but now seems to be in jeopardy.
Once a 20,000-member strong force that in 1994 ran the military
junta out and reinstated Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the democratically
elected president, the US presence now numbers about 500 soldiers
who provide mostly medical assistance and build schools and
bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago during testimony before a congressional
subcommittee, General Charles E. Wilhelm, the commander of US
forces in Latin America and the Caribbean, recommended that the
United States end its five-year military presence in Haiti, arguing
that the remaining troops in Haiti are in danger.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the House of Representatives voted to stop funding
the $22 million-a-year operation in December. But some
representatives say in a country that needs still needs so much
help, pulling out the troops would be a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the last signal that we should be sending to a country
that is trying so hard to develop its own democracy,'' said
Representative William Delahunt, of Quincy, who visited Haiti last
month with two Florida congressmen. They are asking the House to
rethink their vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``During such a tenuous time, there ought to be more of an
international presence in Haiti, not less, because more instability
could result in more refugees in boats for the US,'' he added in a
phone interview from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Haitian officials insist that no international workers have been
targeted by Haiti's growing wave of violence, which has come amid
continued bickering between the country's political parties and a
worsening economy.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, a US military vehicle was pelted with rocks
by residents after it stalled on a street near the makeshift base
it operates in an waterfront industrial park. No serious injuries
were reported, but soldiers now are required to wear flak jackets
and carry weapons whenever they leave the compound.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a wakeup call for us that not everybody here
considers us friends,'' said Colonel Walton Walker, the commander
in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   But those at the clinic said its loss would only make a bad
situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at us, our own government doesn't take care of us like
these soldiers do,'' said Jacque Maraud, 42, whose wife, two sons
and three daughters have all been treated at one time or another at
the clinic. ``Unfortunately, we cannot pay. All we can do is say,
`Thank you very much.' ''

`HOME PAGE' DOCUMENTS ON-LINE SEARCH FOR SELF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back in 1996, documentary filmmaker Doug Block went looking for
the heart of the Internet, searching for the people who were
defining what was then a strange new medium. Who were these folks
who bared their souls _ and sometimes their bodies _ on-line? Were
they simply starved for attention, misfits screaming `Me, me, me''
in computer code? Or were they tapping into something deeper, some
primal need for connection by whatever medium possible?
</P>
<P>
   Block's film ``Home Page,'' which debuts Sunday at 8 p.m. on
HBO, takes us on a rambling odyssey to find the answers to those
questions; it sheds light on the giddy excitement and chaos of the
Web before it became a giant shopping mall. But while the film
introduces us to the gurus and geeks who became mini-celebrities
during the early days of the Web, it isn't really about technology
per se, but rather about the curious human impulse that drives
these individuals. They're looking for home on a home page; in the
words of one character, they're ``looking for Bo Bo'' _ that is,
``the person who makes it all OK.'' Block somehow manages to make
his subjects _ who are maddeningly narcisistic, wistful, and tragic
at the same time _ seem like pilgrims on an almost spiritual quest.
Like Odysseus or Peer Gynt or even Dorothy of Kansas, they embark
on wild adventures, only to discover that you don't find
fulfillment on the Information Superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   But you can sure have a good time on the ride. By sheer
coincidence, Block ends up following the lives of several Web
pioneers, who frew up along with the medium. We meet Justin Hall,
an outrageous college student with an unruly mane who broadcasts
every intimate detail of his life on-line. He hooks up with Howard
Rheingold, the cult-like celebrity who wrote ``The Virtual
Community.'' Along the way, we also meet Julie and Jim Petersen;
Block captures the pair at the time when green-haired Julie and her
lover, Patrick, are posting news of their affair on their Web
sites. And we meet Carl Steadman, the founder of the ironic
commentary site suck.com who can't hide his overwhelming sadness
behind the rims of his spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Hall, with his rat-a-tat guffaw and dreadlocked mane, is
the centerpiece of the film, maintaining youthful enthusiasm and
optimism despite a troubled past. Hall is High Drama to the nth
degree: Let's put it this way, he might amuse you in class, but you
wouldn't want to have him move in next door.
</P>
<P>
   But the beauty of the film is that Block doesn't try to sustain
High Drama; instead, he focuses his lens on the small moments of
insight, the tiny epiphanies, the sigh after the storm. We see Jim
Petersen talking quietly about his wife's amorous adventures, and
we see Julie Petersen lamenting the end of the affair: ``Nine
letters and a Web site. That's when you start wondering. What's it
all about?'' We even see Hall admitting that his shenanagins
on-line are really about carving out ``some idealized, intimate
relationship.'' And we see Steadman explaining how he documented
the tragic death of his girlfriend on his home page; quietly,
soberly, he reveals that the Web hasn't revolutionized human
interaction, despite its great promise. ``There is no revolution at
hand,'' he says. ``There are new technologies, but that doesn't
change the nature of desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Desire, after all, is what it's all about; the only difference
in cyberspace is that it's measured in what Net folks call
``traffic,'' or views of a Web page. And Block isn't immune to that
desire himself. When he starts the film, he is ``half-way between
college graduation and retirement,'' and like the people he
chronicles, he is on a journey himself. We don't see him until he
creates his own home page, and then suddenly he becomes a character
in the story, filming his wife and children, his nephew's bar
mitzvah, his parents' 50th anniversary party. He goes on the road
with the cyberpunks, only to discover that there's no place like
home. While Hall is ``all connections and no grounding,'' Block's
wife Marjorie is the grounded force of stability in the film. She
doesn't have a home page; she doesn't read her husband's Web page.
Unlike the others, she is satisfied with her life, maintaining a
spiritual center.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast of a real home life and a virtual home page is
striking here. But Block doesn't judge his subjects; he becomes one
of them and learns the same lessons. ``I'm trying to show that
there are some consequences,'' Block says from his office in New
York. ``It can jeapordize your relationships. At the same time, it
gives them a forum to get stuff off their chest. It beats standing
on a street corner.''
</P>
<P>
   While providing a glimpse of the early days of the Web, Block
manages to get at something much deeper. ``We were looking for some
spark to our lives,'' says Block. ``We were looking for something
to come along and shake us out of our lethargy and give life some
zest and meaning. I thought there was something missing in my life,
and my journey was to realize `There's no place like home,
Dorothy.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That aside, Block and all of the others in the film still
maintain their own home pages, although some of them are are more
discriminating about the details they reveal. You can find all the
links Block's site, www.d-word.com. All of the characters, in fact,
are identified by their Web addresses at the end of the film. Do
they mind having their ``homes'' revealed, now that they've
acquired distance from the early euphoria? ``Are you kidding? It's
traffic,'' Block says. ``That's the name of the game. It's
attention.'' But it's not, in the end, that abstract concept we
call home.

A GRIZZLY OBSESSION SUITS HIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTH BAY, Ontario _ Lost cause just isn't a concept to give
pause to Troy Hurtubise. The 34-year-old former scrap metal dealer
is a natural-born dreamer of big dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He quit school to become a modern-day mountain man. And in the
mountains, he found his fate when a grizzly bear charged. Or ambled
over. Versions vary.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, since then, Hurtubise has chased a vision of the day
when bear researchers, as he considers himself, can clump through
the grizzly-haunted wilds of the West in perfect safety, protected
from fang and claw _ indeed, protected from anything short of
nuclear blast _ in his soon-to-be-patented Ursus Mark VII
anti-grizzly bear suit.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the Genesis model, or ``G-Man,'' as he calls it.
The one with thermal night vision, a bite-meter on the arm to
measure the power of the grizzly's chomp and even a black box to
record the researcher's final shrieked ``field notes'' in the
unhappy event of a systems failure during an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to get down with grizzlies, you've got to have
gear you can count on,'' says Hurtubise, a buckskin-clad inventor
of the old school _ the school whose motto might be ``perseverance,
improvisation, duct tape.'' He used nearly 7,000 feet of the stuff
on the last prototype suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you want to cover every possibility, even the possibilities
you don't want to think about,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   For 13 years now, Hurtubise has endured ridicule, rejection,
financial ruin and domestic disharmony as the result of his
obsessive quest to build the world's first effective anti-grizzly
armor.
</P>
<P>
   He's also routinely risked his life testing the suit, although
very little of the risk has come from actual bears. But more on
that later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objective of the suit is to achieve the protective
capability to conduct close-quarter research on the world's most
dangerous land mammal,'' he says. ``But the G-Man also has
applicability for bomb disposal, firefighting, UN peacekeeping,
police work and professional sports.''
</P>
<P>
   For his efforts, Hurtubise has been mocked by Harvard, scorned
by serious investors, and _ perhaps the unkindest cut _ made the
subject of a National Film Board of Canada documentary movie
portraying him as a Quixotic nutcase.
</P>
<P>
   But along the way, he's also become a sort of northlands folk
hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something very Canadian about Troy and his suit, this
attempt to keep savage nature at bay,'' said Peter Lynch, director
of the quirky 1996 film, ``Project Grizzly,'' which Hollywood's
Quentin Tarantino hailed as one of the finest documentaries ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtubise himself has mixed feelings about the flick, which has
gained something of a cult following, especially in Europe and
Japan. On the plus side, it brought attention to his life's work.
On the negative side, it strongly suggested that his life's work is
lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science-wise, the film is garbage,'' he said. ``I mean you
come away thinking, `Here's this crazy guy, and he's kind of
pathetic.' But what gets left out is the science of what I'm trying
to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have been six more or less functional prototypes
of the bear suit, and Hurtubise is now working on the most advanced
design, the Ursus Mark VII Genesis, or G-Man.
</P>
<P>
   The particulars of the latest model are shrouded in secrecy
since he can't afford the costs of patenting a design that's ``10
years ahead of its time,'' he says. Having gone through more than
$100,000 of his own money _ not to mention watching his scrap metal
yard go bust while his wife, Lori, very nearly took that last walk
out the door with their 7-year-old son, Brett _ Hurtubise is
desperate for financial backing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has good saleability, but I'm going to need $1.2
million to get it off the ground,'' he says, stressing: ``Make sure
you say $1.2 million Canadian,'' or just a bit more than $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to an article in New Scientist, a British publication,
the contrivance is made mostly of Boralyn E5 _ a lightweight metal
composite produced by California's Alyn Corp. _ with a
``honeycomb'' shock-absorbing system packed between the
endoskeleton and exoskeleton. Hardly any duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suit makes Robocop look like the Tin Man in `The Wizard
of Oz,' '' Hurtubise says. ``With the G-Man, you can tap dance in a
minefield. You can take a dynamite blast. You can take AK-47 rounds
all day. You can walk through 4,000-degree Fahrenheit heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking one tough suit.''
</P>
<P>
   The G-Man's predecessor, the Mark VI, came to a sad end, seized
by creditors _ although they were forgiving enough to let Hurtubise
borrow it for a trip last fall to Harvard, where he accepted an
``Ig-Nobel'' award in the field of safety engineering.
</P>
<P>
   The annual awards are tongue-in-cheek Nobel opposites, bestowed
for ``research that cannot or should not be replicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtubise stole the show, happy to endure an evening of jibes,
jabs and guffaws from university slickers for the chance to stand
behind an honest-to-God Harvard lectern and speak passionately _ if
somewhat unintelligibly, given his strong up-north-Canada accent _
about the Genesis suit and its endless possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Possibilities such as live volcano exploration. Or riot control.
</P>
<P>
   Even cynical souls were charmed by his earnestness.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, an anti-grizzly suit may not be what the world is waiting
for, but there really is something wonderful about Troy and his
work,'' said Marc Abrahams, editor of Annals of Improbable
Research, the Cambridge-based journal that chooses the Ig-Nobel
winners. ``He's a classic inventor, just like Edison and a lot of
others who've been labeled crackpots.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurtubise said: ``Sure, the award was a set-up: Let's all hoot
at the bear suit guy. But, face it, for a researcher from North
Bay, Ontario, getting invited to Harvard for any damn reason is a
real breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps especially so for a 9th grade dropout who seemed
destined for a drifter's aimless life until one hot day in August
1984.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtubise, age 19, was panning for gold on Humidity Creek,
British Columbia. Then, pounding down through a mountain meadow,
came an enormous speciman of Ursus arctos horribilis, the
``horrible bear,'' or grizzly.
</P>
<P>
   The bear knocked Hurtubise to the ground with a snout-shove to
the chest. Then padded off.
</P>
<P>
   It was vaguely anti-climactic. Not getting torn apart or
gobbled. But a great fascination was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave me a sense of mission. I wanted to study these
awe-inspiring animals at close quarters,'' says Hurtubise.
``Trouble is, I realized right away, if you hang out too close to
grizzlies, you can get killed.''
</P>
<P>
   He went back to class, got that high school diploma. He
completed courses in ``forest recreation technology'' at Ontario's
Sir Sanford Fleming College.
</P>
<P>
   And he started working on the Ursus Mark I, the first of the
bear suits.
</P>
<P>
   Field tests conducted by Hurtubise swiftly became legend.
</P>
<P>
   To test the awful forces of a bear mauling, for example, he'd
enlist a few local biker types, stoke their empirical instincts
with beer, provide blunt instruments _ planks, baseball bats, axe
handles _ clamber inside the anti-bear armor as their boisterous
spirits rose. Then he would give his colleagues in science the
thumbs up. Or chainmail mitts up. And let them rip.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe tests couldn't be as carefully calibrated as in one of
those fancypants labs run by grant-happy geniuses at NASA or MIT or
wherever.
</P>
<P>
   But Troy and his ``Project Grizzly'' team of brothers, uncles,
pals and assorted hangers-on got the job done, more or less.
</P>
<P>
   And give the guy credit, he never used stand-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, in the pursuit of lighter, more rugged and more
flexible anti-bear suits, Hurtubise has been head-whacked by logs
swung from ropes, withstood pointblank blasts from a 12-gauge
shotgun, fallen intentionally off the 150-foot Niagra Escarpment
and hacked with chainsaws.
</P>
<P>
   Also: bounced off the mattress-wrapped bumper of a pickup truck
traveling at 25 miles per hour. Also: run over by the same pickup
18 times.
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasizes that the armored suit is just a means to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, I want to be studying bears at close quarters, I
want to work among bears the way Jacques Cousteau worked among
creatures of the deep,'' he says, naming one of his great heros.
</P>
<P>
   Hurtubise's particular obsession is to film a live grizzly bear
birth, no easy undertaking given that bear moms are proverbially
defensive of their cubs, and would presumablytake unkindly to
strangers crawling into the den in the last moments of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   On the commercial front, he's had tentative expressions of
interest in the suit from fire departments in the United States,
Germany and Japan. Then there was that lady who called from the UN.
But she never called back.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Troy Hurtubise has heard the laughter, and it stings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirteen years is a long time to carry a dream. I've been
discouraged at times,'' he acknowledges with a sigh. ``You'd like
your work to be taken seriously, you'd like to win respect as a
scientist or at least a technologist _ not some crazy person who
wants to wrestle bears.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a long pause. Another sigh. But when he speaks again,
his voice has regained its bravado.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm on to something grand here, something that goes way
beyond grizzlies,'' he says. ``Maybe they'll remember my name 100
years from now, maybe not. All I know is I'm never giving up.''

<P>
   Take my word. These cars are small.
</P>
<P>
   How small?
</P>
<P>
   So small that if you drive one, you dance on the razor edge of
political correctness: Fume at that looming Bulbous Bug, the new
Volkwagen Beetle, as you hope it doesn't crush you. Rage at that
gas-guzzling, view-blocking Volvo station wagon whose imperious
owner doesn't care that she could be driving something smaller,
safer (for you), and more fuel efficient.
</P>
<P>
   So small that if you lined up a brood of these tiny autos behind
a Volkswagen bus, called it installment art and placed it, say, in
the heart of green space in downtown Boston, you could name your
work ``Make Way for Ducklings _ with Motors.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the mini- and microcars whose genesis was the need for
cheap transportation (not to mention jobs in idled aircraft
factories) in Europe in the years after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   How small? Microcar engines have three or fewer cylinders and a
displacement of 510 ccs; minis are four cylinders, or less than
1,000 ccs, or less than 13 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   The first prototypes were produced in the late 1940s and early
'50s and, with Germany at the forefront, most were built in Europe.
Messerschmitt, the aircraft manufacturer, took the lead when Fritz
Fend, a German designer, showed his tiny vehicle, which he had
designed as a car for those disabled in the war, to Willy
Messerschmitt, whose factory, under post-war agreement, was not
allowed to produce aircraft. By 1953, little Messerschmitt autos
were rolling off the lines. They look like small planes with their
wings clipped. The cockpit canopy is derived from the fighter plane
and the steering yoke is right out of the aircraft. A single
passenger sits behind the driver, just like pilot and copilot.
</P>
<P>
   It fit the bill for those looking for cheap-to-buy, cheap-to-run
autos. At $520 new, that was about $1 per pound. But Messerschmitt
was not alone in cranking out cars that cost between around $200 to
$1,100, were cheap to register, were taxed low, and got 60-100
miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with what Charles Gould, a Newton, Mass. collector,
calls ``a clean sheet of paper,'' Heinkle, Vespa (under aircraft
manufacturer Piaggio), and BMW, among others, produced the little
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Many were exported to the United States, but in 1950s America,
gas was cheap and the people were in love with big chrome, big
steel, and speed. Sixty-miles-per-hour was screaming fast for many
of these microcars _ and that often required a good tailwind. So
they never caught on here in any serious way and by the time the
Austin Mini and Mini Cooper were introduced in the early 1960s _
small cars that were real cars _ the microcar craze was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese manufacturers produced some in the late 1960s and into
the '70s, and even today in California an electric mini called the
Sparrow (looking remarkably like a Messerschmitt) is in the works.
But for all intents and purposes, the micro- and minicar realm is
now dominated by collectors who scour garages and fields and
cellars and barns for the few tens of thousands that may still
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Gould says they are found in two distinct conditions: rotting
where they were tossed away, or in near perfect condition where,
because they were so small, people were able to carry them indoors
to store away from the ravages of time. Remember: These cars were
so cheap, they were almost disposable. Gould found one of his
Messerschmitts hanging on a wall in a barn. Today, they can be had
as cheaply as $1,000 or less, or up to $20,000 for the rarest
models. The latter would include such prizes as the 4-wheel
Messerschmitt Tiger; a Goggomobile Transporter Van, and Honda S600
and S800 Roadsters from early '60s, with 4-cylinder, 4-carb, DOHC,
600 cc engine that redlined at 9500 RPMs.
</P>
<P>
   The Messerschmitt KR 200, with its 191 cc, two-stroke, aircooled
engine, had an integrated four-speed gear box and no reverse. But
the car can be run in reverse by turning off the engine and
restarting it to run backwards _ thus, four speeds in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The Goggomobile, built in Dingofing, Germany, features an
elaborate electric preshift so it runs through the gears much like
an old, far more expensive Cord.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW Isetta is perhaps the most easily recognized example of
these cars for those outside the craze _ familiar because its front
opens, much like a refrigerator door, to allow access. An
articulated steering linkage with two universal joints lets the
steering wheel and column move up and out of the way when the door
is opened.
</P>
<P>
   Besides many of the standards, there are some rarities: the
Velorex, a Czech auto made as a crude tubular frame covered with
fabric that has at its heart a Jawa motorcycle; a 1958 Brutsch
Mopetta, the smallest car ever manufactured and resembling a
motorcycle sidecar. It is steered by motorcycle handlebars and is
one of three still known to exist from the original 11
manufactured; and the George Jetson-mobile, a 1964 Peel Trident,
fiberglass with a clear bubble dome, built on the Isle of Man and
sold as ``cheaper than walking'' at about $200 new.
</P>
<P>
   Also there is the BMW Isetta 300, 600 and 700s, and cars from
Messerschmitt, Kleinschnittger, Goggomobile, Zundapp, Vespa,
Heinkle, Fiat, Crosley, King Midget, Fuji, Daihatsu, Honda and
Subaru.

WOOD POLISH GAVE PANELING AN ODOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wood paneling has a peculiar odor after I applied some
Olde English polish. I tried straight vinegar and the odor got
worse. I washed with detergent but it didn't help much. How can I
reduce that odor?
</P>
<P>
   A. J., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Use lots and lots of ventilation; get the air really moving
through the room. Try paint thinner to remove that polish, which I
feel strongly should not be used on paneling. And that applies to
all polishes. Several applications of paint thinner, with vigorous
rubbing may be necessary. If that doesn't work, make a strong
solution of baking soda and water, and wash the paneling with that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a lot of double-hung wooden windows that I would like
to keep. Where can I find someone who will repair and reglaze them?
Would I have to take the windows to the repairer, or would he fix
them while they are on the house?
</P>
<P>
   HAIG AVEDISIAN, Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try the Yellow Pages under ``Windows _ Repairing.'' Whether
he does the work in situ (at the house) or wants them in his
workshop is up to him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My Victorian house needs paint. I was looking at a Dutch (not
Dutch Boy) paint called Schroeder. It is an alkyd (oil) paint that
costs $130 a gallon and is warranted for 20 and 30 years. The
manufacturer says it is self-priming and breathable. Is it worth
that much?
</P>
<P>
   J.C., Melrose, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If it does what it promises, it is worth $130 a gallon, and
therefore worth buying. But those promises (20 and 30 years?) sound
too good to be true. Most paints fail because of moisture behind
the clapboards or shingles. You could try the paint in one area, or
even on one wall. If it passes muster for five years or more, then
you can be safe in doing the rest of the house. If your problem is
moisture, this paint might work because of its claim to be
breathable (allowing water vapor to pass through it). But the
handyman has heard too many horror stories of failing paint because
of moisture to make him a believer.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My new deck is made of pressure-treated lumber. The people at
Hingham Lumber told me not to use solid acrylic on the floorboards.
The people at Home Depot suggested Behr vinyl-acrylic solid stain
for the floor, adding that it will last 10 years. Who am I to
believe, and what should I use?
</P>
<P>
   LAURIE DIODATI, Hull, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Who to believe is a good question that the handyman is
reluctant to answer. So let's evade the question and suggest this:
Never use a solid stain or paint on a deck floor; anything that
forms a film can peel, sooner or later; if it does not form a film,
it is too tender for foot traffic. Something that is claimed to
last 10 years on an outdoor deck floor is too good to be true. If
you want a color on the floor, use a semitransparent house stain.
Colors are limited with semitransparent stain, but the good thing
about it is that it has a 95 percent chance of not peeling, only
one coat is needed, and it should last three to five years. As it
begins to wear or fade, apply another single coat. In fact, I think
such a semitransparent stain is good for the entire deck: railings,
framework, and all.
</P>
<P>
   While semitransparent house stains are not exactly designed for
deck floorboards, they do perform well on them. A semitransparent
deck stain will also work, but the main characteristic of any such
stain _ house or deck _ is that it is semitransparent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I bought a ladybug house at the Mill Stores. How can I use
it?
</P>
<P>
   MAUREEN O'CONNELL, Kingston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. It seems to me that the store could tell you, or there should
be instructions as to where to put it and how. At any rate, you can
hang it almost anywhere in the yard, but generally close to shrubs
and bushes. Hang it above head height and see what happens. If you
get no tenants, you must have done something wrong.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My four-family was rehabbed in 1983. The new kitchen cabinets
have round hinges that are set into the back of the door and into
the jamb, but there is nothing showing on the outside. I need some
more of those hinges as replacements. Where can I find them?
</P>
<P>
   KEN LaBRICQUE, Newburyport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Those hinges sound like Blum hinges, the European invention
that is completely invisible from the outside and allows many ways
to mount a door. Try the Woodworker's Catalog, which carries two
pages of Blums and a page of other concealed hinges; telephone
800-279-4441.

PACKING UP THE HISTORY THAT MOVES US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've been moving. At one point last week, as the Worst Movers
in the World (name supplied on request) threw yet another gross or
so of boxes into their trucks, I actually found myself envying
people who lose all their belongings in a natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
   I wished for a small, selective tornado that would rip through
the neighborhood, sparing everybody and everything except all our
carefully packed stuff, so I would never have to see it or think
about it ever again. Where did all this rubbish come from? These
books? These dishes? And how many changes of underwear does one
woman really need?
</P>
<P>
   I asked myself similar questions last year, when we moved my
mother into an apartment, after some drunken fool drove his
Cadillac through her living room. My mother was shocked, but
unhurt. The worst was over, or so I thought. Then we started
cleaning out her house.
</P>
<P>
   There was her Army nurse's uniform from WWII, her tax returns
dating back to 1953, a trove of painting supplies from her
watercolor period, her college biology textbooks, three bureau
drawers of tissue-wrapped underthings that appeared to date back to
the early 1950s. My mother grew up during the Depression; she has
the pack rat instinct so common in her generation. That's her
excuse for hoarding unnecessary stuff. What's mine?
</P>
<P>
   A week before we moved, my husband and I took my mother on a
trip to Nova Scotia, where she was born, a place she last saw 77
years ago, when she was 7. It was a wonderful trip. I've seldom
seen my mother so happy. She was a little dismayed, though, to find
a highway running through the family farm. There were no buildings
to remind her of her childhood; the fields were overgrown with
trees. But the stream that powered her grandfather's grist mill is
still there, running down from a spring on Skye Mountain, the water
so clear and fresh that local people stop to fill bottles to take
home.
</P>
<P>
   We asked the postmistress in the nearby town, Whycocomagh, where
we could find the old cemetery. She didn't know, but she called the
former postmistress who, the incumbent said, knew everybody and
everything. And so she did.
</P>
<P>
   Was my mother a Campbell from the west or the east side of Skye
Mountain? the former postmistress asked. She directed us to the
cemetery, on a dirt road, about a quarter of a mile up the
mountain. We found the family plot in a little grove of linden
trees. My mother moved slowly from stone to stone, her face alight.
There they were. Her grandparents, Donald and Maggie Belle. Aunt
Margaret and Aunt Minnie and Uncle George and all the others.
</P>
<P>
   The people who settled that part of Cape Breton were highland
Scots, some immigrants by choice, many driven off by English
landlords. I looked around at the gravestones, at all those
Campbells and MacDonalds and MacKenzies and Stewarts and Fergusons
and MacKinnons and wondered what everyone must wonder about all our
immigrant forebears: How did they do it? Where did they get the
strength? It's humbling to think how tough they were, how far they
came, how relatively little they possessed.
</P>
<P>
   I thought about them Tuesday, as I sifted through the
post-moving day mess, trying to decide what to keep and what to
toss. I wondered how many changes of underwear my
great-great-grandmother carried with her to Canada. I thought about
how many I'd carried from Cambridge to Arlington. I remembered the
expression on my mother's face as she studied her grandparents'
gravestone and reminded myself that the most valuable things can't
be packed up in boxes.

OS MUTANTES/``EVERYTHING IS POSSIBLE! WORLD PSYCHEDELIC CLASSICS 1:
BRAZIL _ THE BEST OF OS MUTANTES'' (Luaka Bop/Warner Bros.)
<TEXT>
<P>
   More fruitful results of David Byrne's excavation of '60s and
'70s Brazilian pop, this is a wonderful overview of one of the
grooviest and brain-bending of the tropicalia groups. Os Mutantes,
a favorite of Beck, Stereolab, the Beta Band and other contemporary
musical collage artists, gleefully integrated pop, samba, feedback
and lysergic juices with synthesizer, theremin and electric guitar
for a particularly Brazilian variety of psychedelia. Some tracks on
this multilingual compilation lifted from Os Mutantes' innovative
first five albums from 1968-72 seem a little dated, but others,
like the lush reading of Caetano Veloso's ``Baby,'' could've been
cut yesterday in Silver Lake. Hipsters everywhere will love
visiting this delightfully strange trio's surreal universe. 3 stars
</P>
<P>
   _ David Bloom &QL;

 &QL; 
GEORGE JONES/``COLD HARD TRUTH'' (Asylum/Elektra)
</P>
<P>
   The man called the greatest living country singer was working on
this album when his near-fatal car crash took place, curtailing
future sessions beyond the guide vocals already taped. Luckily,
that work is among Jones' most relaxed, subtly powerful singing of
the decade. Like fine wine, Jones has only mellowed and improved
with age, easily outclassing the pop-country contingent that
includes Garth Brooks and Shania Twain. Thanks to top-notch
material like the title track, the radio hit ``Choices'' and ``Our
Bed of Roses,'' and the cream of Nashville's studio crew, ``Cold
Hard Truth'' ranks with Jones' finest records. 3 1/2 stars
</P>

 &QL; 
DIANA KRALL/``WHEN I LOOK IN YOUR EYES'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   After two hit albums with her incomparable trio, this Canadian
jazz chanteuse faced a decision: stay the course or expand her
repertoire. Not surprisingly, Krall went the ambitious route,
employing orchestral arrangements and expanded lineups for nine of
the 12 cuts on her new album. The emphasis here is on vocals, not
piano, which may disappoint fans accustomed to Krall's breezy
keyboard work. It's hard to argue with these results, though. This
is a beautiful album of well-chosen standards, tasteful string
arrangements (courtesy of orchestrator Johnny Mandel) and sultry
singing. Highlights include slow samba versions of ``Let's Face the
Music and Dance'' and ``I've Got You Under My Skin'' as well as the
jaunty ``Popsicle Toes.'' 3 1/2 stars

MEL TORME/``MEL TORME AT THE MOVIES'' (Rhino)
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks after the crooner's death comes a collection of his
movie work. A huge film buff, Torme first appeared on screen at age
17 in 1943's plotless ``Higher and Higher,'' a film notable mainly
as Frank Sinatra's first major film effort. Unfortunately, the
seven selections from it and 1947's ``Good News'' include
less-than-fascinating duet and group work from Torme. But the rest
of this collection, spanning nearly 50 years, includes such lushly
romantic material as Torme's signature tune, ``Blue Moon,'' plus
various rarities and silliness like ``Monsters Lead Such
Interesting Lives.'' The disc comes with excellent liner notes, as
always with Rhino compilations, and some marvelous archival shots.
``Mel Torme at the Movies'' is not the retrospective a great voice
deserves, but an entertaining look at one small section of his
much-beloved oeuvre. 2 1/2 stars

BETA BAND/``THE BETA BAND'' (Astralwerks)
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited full-length debut from London's bizarre Beta
Band manages to touch on almost every style of pop music
imaginable, making the album difficult to classify beyond
``sample-adelic.'' The quartet wear their very diverse influences
on their sleeve _ reggae, '70s jazz-fusion, '60s rock, hip-hop,
soul, punk, blues _ and while the music is layered and dense, the
Betas clearly know the value of a groove. Odd but enjoyable. 3
stars

 &QL; 
LYLE LOVETT/``LIVE IN TEXAS'' (MCA)
</P>
<P>
   This album could be subtitled ``Lyle's Greatest Hits'' since it
compiles the majority of the witty Texan's most popular songs on a
single disc. As Lovett's first live record and the second made
entirely with his celebrated 18-piece Large Band, ``Live'' is a
winner. Recorded over five nights in Austin and San Antonio during
a 1995 tour, the disc spotlights the many talents of Lovett's back
line (cellist John Hagen and singer Francine Reed have particularly
big moments) as well as the timeless beauty of the songs.
Alternating between rave-ups (``Church,'' ``She's No Lady'') and
delicate gems (``Nobody Knows Me,'' ``If I Had a Boat''), ``Live''
neatly sums up the first 10 years of Lovett's career. Irresistible.

VARIOUS/``DAVE GODIN'S DEEP SOUL TREASURES VOLS. 1 AND 2'' (Kent
Soul)
</P>
<P>
   British soul enthusiast/journalist Godin here compiles his
favorite rare singles from the '60s and early '70s, and the two
volumes are essential for anyone who loves the less obvious strains
of this wonderful genre. Practically an underground music these
days, rare soul is highly sought-after by collectors on both sides
of the pond but rarely reissued in a worthy form. The illuminating
``Deep Soul Treasures'' lives up to its name, offering tear-stained
gems from such little-known but mighty talents as Jean Wells,
Bessie Banks, the Knight Brothers, Timmy Willis and the
Incredibles. Both volumes are available on import through various
Internet music retailers. 4 stars (both)

EARL HOOKER/``SIMPLY THE BEST'' (MCA)
</P>
<P>
   Considered one of the greatest guitarists by such legends as
Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy and Otis Rush, the late Hooker remains one of
those word-of-mouth artists known only to educated blues fans.
Finally, the amazing slide guitarist and cousin to John Lee Hooker
gets his due with this sterling 19-track collection that delves
into Hooker's most stirring recordings of the '50s and '60s. Drawn
from the vaults of Chess, Blue Thumb and ABC-BluesWay, ``Simply the
Best'' features one great track after another, among them ``Sweet
Black Angel,'' ``Hookin' '' and ``You Shook Me'' (with Muddy
Waters). A real eye-opener. 4 stars

LOOKING FOR MOM AT THE MALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All my life I've had a shopping compulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not quite correct. It's been more of a browsing
compulsion, an ongoing desire to examine the merchandise in any
store I pass. Sometimes I make expensive purchases. Mostly, I come
home with little things, like candles or underwear. I'm not judging
whether this is good or bad. What has been disturbing about it is
the feeling that it's not entirely within my conscious control.
</P>
<P>
   I understand why I do this. My mother rarely gave compliments,
and although I knew she was proud of my swimming medals and pleased
with my good grades, I had proof of my success in those areas
already. As an adolescent, what I wanted to hear, because it was
what I doubted, was whether I was pretty enough to be loved, and
the only time my mother ever praised how I looked was when we went
shopping together.
</P>
<P>
   My mother, you have to understand, weighed 180 pounds. As a
teenager, my measurements were 36-26-36, just right according to
1950 standards. It can't have been easy for my mother to watch me
twirling in the triple mirrors of the department store, but she'd
say things like, ``I can't believe your waist is that tiny,'' or
``Linda, you look like a dream in that dress.''
</P>
<P>
   I soaked up every word.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the family was in agreement that my cousin Margie
was the pretty one while I had to settle for being the smart one,
but here was my mother, delighted by how I looked. ``That's
stunning on you,'' she'd say, and my heart would rise up with hope
that Prince Charming himself would be bowled over when I walked
into the room.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, whenever I felt depressed, at loose ends,
unappreciated, bored or restless, I felt an intense pressure to
escape those feelings by going shopping. As I went through racks
and tried on outfits, I had the sense that my mother was somehow
present, murmuring, ``lovely color on you,'' or ``so flattering,''
or ``you look lovely.'' When I left the store, with or without
packages in hand, all the magic vanished and I'd be standing alone
in a parking lot, right back where I'd started. I knew that was how
the process always ended and yet, although over the years the
pressure to shop has waxed and waned, it still has power over me.
</P>
<P>
   I was speaking to a friend, an English professor in Illinois,
the other day, and he began reminiscing about spending his
childhood summers in a cottage on a little lake near DeKalb.
Fishing with his dad, Bill experienced a deep companionship with
his father, a closeness that was otherwise missing in their
relationship. Bill inherited the cottage when his folks died, and
he confessed that for years, he used to go fishing, mostly as a way
of re-creating an experience that brought feelings of inner
tranquillity back into his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a while,'' Bill said, ``I realized I liked casting, but
not catching fish, so I began to go out in the boat and simply sit
there, casting without using a hook. I was still in the boat. Then
it occurred to me that I could just as easily re-create the feeling
of fishing by casting from my deck. From there it was a very small
step to engaging in what I call Zen fishing. I wait for a lovely
warm afternoon. I sit on my deck. And then I go through the motions
in my head. It has exactly the same effect.''
</P>
<P>
   For Bill, Zen fishing is a spiritual practice. He believes that
what is transpiring is a connection that transcends the limitations
of time and place, one that, he says, ``enables me to feel the flow
of love and energy through the universe.'' Later, I thought about
whether Bill's feeling of oneness with nature when he was with his
dad bore any resemblance to my shopping trips with my mom. As I
remembered our times together in all those dressing rooms, I
started to cry.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't about dresses or flattery, even then. My mother was
often distracted and inattentive; I felt as if for once I had my
mother's full attention. Despite her own issues about her body, she
gave herself over to loving me. For some reason, in this one
setting she was able to appreciate and affirm the insecure girl
standing before her. I see now that the intensity of that
experience came from the fact that it was one of the few times we
actually felt the loving energy of the universe flowing between us.
</P>
<P>
   I think I may be able to forgo walking into stores and go
straight to Zen shopping as a spiritual practice. I think Bill's
right. My mom will be waiting for me anywhere I look for her.

THE RIGHT WAY TO PROTECT THE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It will take 67 votes in the Senate to send the proposed
flag-protection amendment on to the states for ratification. That
is two more votes than the amendment is believed to have, and so
for the fourth time since 1989, the amendment will fail.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment's supporters want to undo the Supreme Court's
rulings in its 1989 and 1990 flag-burning cases. They are right to
reject the court's holding that torching the star-spangled banner
is protected by the First Amendment, but wrong to think that their
only option is to change the Constitution. The Supreme Court, its
own propaganda notwithstanding, is not the final authority on what
the Constitution means. And when the justices err, it does not
require a constitutional amendment to correct their mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed amendment reads, in its entirety: ``The Congress
shall have power to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag
of the United States.'' But nothing in the Constitution withholds
that power from the Congress. Certainly, the First Amendment _ as
it has traditionally been understood by most Americans and most of
the states _ does not.
</P>
<P>
   After all, flag-burning was illegal in 48 states and the
District of Columbia when the Supreme Court reached its
idiosyncratic 5-4 decision in 1989. No sooner was the ruling in
Texas v. Johnson handed down than Congress passed, and George Bush
signed, the Flag Protection Act of 1989. When that statute was
struck down in the 1990 case, US v. Eichmann, 49 states passed
resolutions calling for the decision to be undone. That adds up to
a lot of officials _ legislators, governors, members of Congress,
the president _ who believe the malicious burning of an American
flag should be a crime. And each of those officials, like justices
of the Supreme Court, took an oath to uphold the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the policy of the government upon vital questions affecting
the whole people,'' Abraham Lincoln declared at his first
inaugural, ``is to be irrevocably fixed by decisions of the Supreme
Court the instant they are made . . . the people will have ceased
to be their own rulers, having . . . resigned their government into
the hands of that eminent tribunal.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Supreme Court does not have the last word on what
is and isn't constitutional. The people do. If they feel strongly
enough that the justices have gotten something wrong, they can
correct the error.
</P>
<P>
   It would be best, of course, if the Supreme Court corrected its
own error. Congress and the states can pass new flag-protection
statutes and allow them to be challenged. Four of the justices who
decided the Johnson and Eichmann cases _ William Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry Blackmun, and Byron White _ are no longer on the
bench. A majority of the current court might well reverse the
1989-90 holdings.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans have other options. They can pressure Congress
into stripping the Supreme Court of the authority to hear
flag-desecration cases. (Article III of the Constitution empowers
Congress to carve out ``exceptions'' to the high court's appellate
jurisdiction.) They can demand that presidential candidates declare
themselves on the issue. White House hopefuls are routinely asked
whether they would have an abortion ``litmus test'' for Supreme
Court nominations. Why not ask about a flag-burning test _ and
refuse to support candidates who refuse to apply one?
</P>
<P>
   The First Amendment's guarantee of free speech does not
encompass the public incineration of flags. It isn't only
mossbacked strict constructionists who think so.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years before Texas v. Johnson, another flag-burning case
reached the Supreme Court. The defendant, a black man named Street,
burned an American flag in Brooklyn on June 6, 1966. That was the
day James Meredith, the civil rights leader, was shot by a sniper
in Mississippi; Street heard of the shooting on the radio, and
boiled over with outrage. From a drawer in his apartment he took
his own flag and burned it at the corner of St. James Place and
Lafayette Avenue. ``We don't need no damn flag,'' he said. ``If
they let that happen to Meredith, we don't need an American flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Street was convicted under a New York law that made it a crime
to ``cast contempt'' on the flag. When the case reached the Supreme
Court, a bare majority found a way to avoid ruling on the
constitutionality of New York's statute. Four justices dissented,
among them some of the most liberal interpreters of the First
Amendment in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe,'' Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote, ``that the state
and the federal government do have the power to protect the flag
from acts of desecration and disgrace.'' Hugo Black, the great
First Amendment absolutist, was even more adamant: ``It passes my
belief that anything in the federal Constitution bars a state from
making the deliberate burning of the American flag an offense.''
Byron White and Abe Fortas expressed similar views. ``Protest,''
Fortas said, ``does not excuse lawlessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Reasonable people can differ on the wisdom of flag-burning laws.
I would rather rely on stigma and social condemnation to protect
the national symbol than on prison terms. But it is not irrational
for the states, or for Congress, to decide otherwise. What is
irrational is the notion that because Americans are free, they may
not guard their foremost symbol of freedom from mockery. That isn't
what the Constitution says. If a Supreme Court justice says
otherwise, it is the justice, not the Bill of Rights, that must be
amended.

<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL;

   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL;

<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL;

   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home

depending on how things go over the next few months.

<P>
   In the land of the wealthy, dirt is king.
</P>
<P>
   Take a stroll through Jupiter Island, Fla., for instance. A
one-acre plot of land with 150 feet of waterfront fetches between
$2 million and $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The house sitting on that dirt might be palatial, but that
hardly matters: On this island of exclusivity, houses come and go
with alarming speed. ``There are a number of houses going up right
now, and every single one of them will eventually be knocked
down,'' says Gene Albarelle, a local broker who deals in high-end
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a speculator paid $1.65 million for an acre of ground
with a five-bedroom house on it. The house was immediately torn
down, and though its replacement has not yet been finished, the
owner is now asking $4.4 million for this small parcel of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Jupiter Island is prime territory, removed by 574
feet of bridge from the strip-malled Florida mainland and situated
just 20 miles north of Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Jupiter Island is also the number-one town on WORTH's
annual list of America's wealthiest enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was number two, right behind Aspen, Colo.; in
previous years it has ranked seventh and ninth. In other words,
Jupiter Island is a well-credentialed top town.
</P>
<P>
   It has been the winter residence of some of the oldest names in
American business (Field, Doubleday, Ford) as well as some of the
newest, like Chuck Curcio, founder of Tire Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   His former home, a six-bedroom, 16,000-square-foot behemoth on
five acres with waterfront, sold in April for $12.5 million; the
buyer was Stephen Garofalo, CEO of Metromedia Fiber Network
Services, who paid another $4.2 million for an adjacent piece of
property that Curcio also owned.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Island ranks number one on this year's list because its
median home sales price for 1997 and 1998 combined was $1.7
million, the highest in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In compiling the list, we gathered data as we have for the past
three years: through public records and multiple-listing services
and with the help of Prudential Real Estate agents and brokers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   We found (no surprise) that Americans are buying houses as never
before: 1998 was a record year for existing-home sales; some 4.78
million houses changed hands, according to the National Association
of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of newly constructed single-family homes reached levels
not seen since 1977, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and the
nation's home-ownership rate soared to a new high of 66.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many factors driving our housing market _ it's
hard to list all of them,'' says Kory Bockman, an economist with
NAR. ``We have a tremendous job market right now, unemployment is
near historical lows, consumer confidence is high, the stock market
is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 800) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 525 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,025) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,700) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.

is strong, oil prices are low...The list just goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the appreciation in the median home price last year
outstripped inflation by 3.6 percentage points. (The median home
price for our entire list of 250 towns is $504,144, an increase of
13.3 percent over last year.)
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, according to NAR data, the West showed the greatest
existing-home-price appreciation: 7.23 percent, followed closely by
the Midwest, with 7.20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Gains were especially high around hubs for the high-tech
industry. Economist Bockman says, ``I think the strength of the
high-tech industry may be the most important driving factor in the
high-end market right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The California towns of Atherton (No. 3), Woodside (No. 12), and
Palo Alto (No. 89) moved up on our list from last year, as did the
Seattle suburbs of Medina (No. 48), Yarrow Point (No. 50), and
Mercer Island (No. 157).
</P>
<P>
   Because of stock options and bonuses, a remarkable number of
home purchases at the very highest end are increasingly transacted
in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Ellen Zinn, an entrepreneur who's in the process of starting a
manufactured-housing company, says she achieved peace of mind when
she and her husband, Tim, paid cash for a $1.8 million,
7,000-square-foot Mediterranean-style house in Rancho Santa Fe,
Calif. (No. 10).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe in having a mortgage,'' she says. ``I like to
think that whatever happens, my home is my home.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinn may sound a bit like Scarlett O'Hara surveying Tara _
though in the current housing market, Tara would be a teardown and
the land would be subdivided into miniature ``estates.'' &QL;

   The Zinns have 2.5 acres, which isn't bad these days. In fact,
Zinn says, ``we have total privacy, because the property is high up
and protected by trees. We could have a whole nudist colony in the
backyard, and no one would know'' _ a plot, perhaps, for ``Gone
With the Wind, Part IV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns weren't the only high-end cash buyers in Rancho Santa
Fe, an expensive suburb just 25 miles north of San Diego. &QL;

   According to analyst John Karevoll at Acxiom/DataQuick, a
national real-estate research firm in La Jolla, Calif. (No. 83),
Rancho Santa Fe was the greenest town in the Golden State last
year: 46.1 percent of all homes sold there were bought with cash.
</P>
<P>
   In another wealthy spot _ Palm Beach, Fla. (No. 26) _ 52 percent
of the homes sold in 1998 were paid for in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, cash purchases are often made in wealthy
markets like Southern California, Colorado, and Florida, which
attract the middle-aged and successful (who are looking for a
second home) and retirees (who arrive with decades' worth of
accumulated wealth).
</P>
<P>
   The Zinns, for instance, spend part of the year in their
turn-of-the-century brownstone in Chicago's Lincoln Park area and
part of the year in their sunny California home. ``My heart is
slowly moving West,'' says Ellen Zinn, 53.
</P>
<P>
   Other such hot spots: Vail (No. 43), Telluride (No. 113), and
Mountain Village (No. 6), all in Colorado, and the Town of Paradise
Valley (No. 56) in Arizona. &QL;

   The high-end ``is the segment of the market that emerged the
fastest in the mid-1990s and has done the best since then,'' says
Karevoll.
</P>
<P>
   In University Park (No. 190), near Dallas, homeowners were
practically leapfrogging one another to trade up ``from cottage or
ranch to Tudor or two-story traditional,'' says Cheryl Saldana, a
local Prudential real-estate agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much that home prices have appreciated,'' she
adds, ``but that land value has skyrocketed. A typical
70-by-150-foot lot that sold for $300,000 in 1997 sold for $450,000
last year. It's the biggest boom year we've seen since the 1980s.
People are comparing this market to California's.''
</P>
<P>
   In some wealthy California towns, home buying has become a
high-speed, high-stakes challenge. ``Just last week, some clients
of mine made an offer on a house in Palo Alto (No. 89) that was
listed for $559,000,'' says Prudential broker Linda Hollister.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the brokers were basically standing in line, waiting
their turn to make their pitches. I was number 13 of 13, and I knew
we didn't stand a chance _ my clients couldn't afford to go more
than $22,000 above asking.''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to make an acceptable offer has also resulted in a
few unusual situations: Last year, a couple of Hollister's clients
huddled in the study of a house they wanted to buy _ and didn't
leave _ as the owners huddled in the living room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sellers' agent and I ran from den to living room and back
again with offers and counteroffers,'' Hollister says, ``until we
got the deal worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   Such frantic competition has created an auction-house atmosphere
in some markets and led to a phenomenon known as ``gazumping,''
British slang for a situation in which one buyer, who thinks he has
made a acceptable offer on a house, loses out to another, who
offers more money on the sly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the celebrity wars over houses not even on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld offered $14.5 million for a spread in East
Hampton, Long Island, N.Y., had his offer rejected, and
subsequently lost out to clothing designer Helmut Lang, who also
liked the property but came up with an acceptable $15.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, wealthy Americans continue to express themselves
through their houses in large, grandiose strokes. A few towns, like
Newton, Mass. (No. 227), have instituted house-to-plot-size ratios,
and a few have rules and regulations about architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain Village, Colo. (No. 6), which sprang up in the last
four years near Telluride, is small (population: 1,000) and very,
very rich.
</P>
<P>
   As mandated by the town administration, all new homes in this
young Rockies resort have to ``contribute to a single identity''
and ``foster a sense of visual harmony and lasting value.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have very strict design guidelines,'' says Andy Hanley,
mayor of Mountain Village (and a real-estate broker and developer),
``so there's a little bit of a process you have to come through.'' &QL;

   Homeowners are quick to follow the trends of those above them.
Stuart Cohen, architect and professor of architecture at the
University of Illinois at Chicago, says that ``the high-end
construction market trickles down in terms of presenting a kind of
ideal that people buying $300,000 to $400,000 houses aspire to.''
</P>
<P>
   Particularly unfashionable are the ranch-style, low-slung
modernist rectangles created in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, very few of them are of any kind of architectural
distinction, because they're coming down like crazy,'' says Cohen.
But architectural distinction _ even historical significance _ is
no protection against the bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   In Hinsdale, Ill. (No. 139) _ known as the teardown capital of
the Midwest _ more than 100 homes were leveled last year, some of
them Victorians.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenwich, Conn. (No. 23), fat green dumpsters parked in
driveways have replaced Mercedeses as neighborhood status symbols. &QL;

<P>
   Tearing down a house, though, is not always a swift or easy
decision. The Maloneys of Greenwich bought a waterfront house in
nearby Riverside (No. 62) for $2.3 million and struggled with the
decision of whether to renovate or level.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family is Midwestern, with Quaker roots,'' says Nancy
Maloney. ``And philosophically, they're not people to tear things
down. There's something that really bothers me about just razing
the place, and I keep asking, `Can't we use anything?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although her husband and their architect finally convinced her
that building around the elements she liked would be more expensive
than replacing them, she hopes to salvage what she can: She
mentions a porthole window and a favorite faucet.
</P>
<P>
   Some architectural details, like the staircases, would not meet
current building codes even if they could be saved. ``You just
can't get away with some of these things anymore,'' she says
wistfully, ``even if you like them.'' &QL;

   After a record-breaking year of home sales, the market shows few
signs of slowing down. California has 76 towns on our list this
year, and next year looks just as strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are initially forecasting an 8 percent decrease in home
sales,'' says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist with the
California Association of Realtors. ``And I hate to change a
forecast, but I think that sales this year are going to be
extremely strong. The biggest constraint on the market is supply.
When the market is this hot, there just isn't that much
inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, says Bockman, the NAR economist, ``our numbers are
actually coming out ahead of where we were last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting the beginning part of the year to be strong
and then the second part of the year to tail off a little bit. We
expect to settle in for 1999 right around the same levels that we
had for 1998, and we may even end the year a little bit higher,
depending on how things go over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our forecasts is that mortgage rates are going to drop
shortly, and if this happens, we expect to see another glut of home
buyers hitting the market. All of those people who missed out on
the last opportunity will finally get off the fence and make that
purchase.'' &QL;

   Higher home prices? Smaller lots? Bigger houses? It takes a
historian to put these trends into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Jackson is a former chairman of Columbia University's
history department and an expert on suburbia who lives in Rich Town
No. 163 (Chappaqua, N.Y.). He makes the point that no matter how
expensive houses may seem ``they're still cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Similar dwellings in Japan, Germany, France, or Switzerland
would almost certainly be more expensive, if they were available at
all _ and most likely they wouldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have space,'' he explains. ``Both our land and our
construction costs are less expensive in the United States than
elsewhere. An acre of land in Japan would be an undreamed-of
luxury: nothing in San Marino (No. 72), Greenwich (No. 23), or even
Atherton (No. 3) could compare to it. In world terms, a million
dollars an acre is not an expensive price to pay.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Atlanta actors have found a summer home in `Hills'
 &HT;    By Doug Hamilton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cherokee, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, a small troupe of Atlanta actors pack up and
travel unto these hills to flex their dramatic chops in _ talk
about an apt title _ ``Unto These Hills.'' The venerable outdoor
drama, in its 50th year of retelling the story of the Cherokee
Indians, has become sort of a theater camp in the country for these
refugees from Atlanta's progressive stage scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the Cherokee Mafia,'' jokes Rita Dolphin, a
Marietta (Ga.) actress who plays sympathetic white settler Anne
Worcester in the physically demanding saga that compresses three
centuries into a three-hour event. Dolphin, 23, was last in the
children's production ``Let's Talk About AIDS'' at the Alliance
Theatre this spring.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta posse also includes Decatur's Frank Roberts as
Cherokee Removal enforcer Major Davis and Bill Murphey of East
Atlanta as Cherokee folk hero Tsali. Roberts was in a recent,
critically acclaimed adaptation of Dostoyevsky's ``The Devils'' at
Actor's Express; Murphey won raves for his hilarious portrayal of
Sir Andrew Aguecheek in Shakespeare's ``Twelfth Night'' at Seven
Stages earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Artistic director Peter Hardy is another Georgia boy _ he's the
dramaturge (artistic adviser) for Marietta's Theatre in the Square
and the director of the Essential Theatre company, which recently
produced three plays at PushPush Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The tight-knit group keeps adding members _ when a part comes
open, the Atlantans will tell friends back home to come up and
audition. Not that parts come open often. ``Most of the actors
playing principal characters have been here at least 10 years,''
says Murphey, who boasts a 15-year run in the drama, the last six
as Tsali.
</P>
<P>
   The play's story line, by Kermit Hunter, has changed little
since 1949, although a few scenes, such as a pivotal wedding, have
been made more authentic. Gun-popping battles and elaborate dance
numbers still drive home the sobering message: that the Cherokees
were robbed of the land they so loved.
</P>
<P>
   For the actors, the show can be grueling. Along with the fancy
footwork and faux armed skirmishes, it requires much forceful
enunciation _ the better to be heard over a symphony of outdoor
night noises.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Fowler of Mableton, who plays a villainous deputy, says the
main difference between doing ``Unto These Hills'' and other plays
is that ``you have to do this one 63 times.'' (The drama runs from
early June through late August every year.) Others complain about
the strenuousness of dancing on the sand stage, swallowing a bug
midbellow and even spying a snake or two backstage. So what keeps
the Atlantans coming back, taking their place in the 175-member
cast, 50 of whom are Native American?
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is very close to me,'' says Roberts, who first
witnessed the drama the year it opened, when he was 6 years old.
``I still remember being so excited by the battles.'' Roberts vows
he'll stay in the show ``as long as I possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphey likes the stable paycheck. ``If you're an actor and you
have a chance to get good, steady work, you take it.'' But the
thirtysomething thespian also relishes the cameraderie among his
fellow Atlantans and the other cast members. After many
performances, actors gather in the canteen of their homey dormitory
area behind the amphitheater for a potluck supper. Every Saturday
night, they put on plays for each other _ Murphey recently directed
a production of Martin McDonagh's ``The Beauty Queen of Leenane.''
</P>
<P>
   And after 15 years, Murphey admits he's emotionally invested in
the play, too. ``Before I played Tsali, I was in another role, and
one night I did this gesture with my hand which has since become
part of the character's blocking. You really get the chance to put
your own stamp on the production.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Unto These Hills.'' 8:45 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays through July
24; 8:30 p.m. Mondays-Saturdays July 26-Aug. 21. Reserved seats
$14; general admission tickets $11 adults, $5 children 6-12. Call

 &HT;    Loaded like a pack mule with the essentials of survival, we
venture forth into the wide world
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 11.
 &HT;    By Michelle Hiskey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The wait at the ticket counter at the Raleigh-Durham Airport was
long enough to hear repeated warnings from the ticket agent that
all passengers were limited to two checked bags. Finally, it was my
turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two bags,'' the agent chirped, more statement than
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I have ... all this,'' I said wearily.
</P>
<P>
   At my feet lay the flotsam and jetsam from a family beach
vacation: a trunk-size duffel bag, suitcase, set of golf clubs,
portable crib, mesh baby gate, box full of hand-me-down clothes and
plastic seat that clamps to a table in lieu of a high chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you're traveling with an infant,'' she replied, limits
suddenly vaporized. She swiftly tagged the huge pile of belongings
and lugged them to the conveyor belt. It was the sort of
benevolence you imagine from a cop who's about to ticket an
illegally parked car then discovers the driver is handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, my 18-month-old daughter played in the metal contraption
that shows the size limits for carry-on luggage. Hmm. I couldn't
help but notice she'd fit quite easily under a seat or in an
overhead compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with a little kid can make you imagine scenarios that
keep DFACS busy. Calling it an adventure is like describing a
marathon as a long race. You can imagine the challenge, but you'll
never truly know how exhausting it can be until you've done it
yourself. After the memory of all the hassles subsides, a certain
elation sets in from enduring it all.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna has flown 19 times now, and I look at loading up all her
necessities like the provisioning of a small militia. Keeping this
29-pound dervish entertained for any amount of time in close
quarters brings to mind the phrase ``by any means necessary.''
Survival sometimes depends on the kindness of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   As we boarded the Boeing 757, I made my way down the narrow
aisle, trying not to bash anyone with my Santa Claus-size diaper
bag. Joey was dressed in a 1960s-looking sundress with huge
flowers. Other parents may save a child's best outfits for church
or the portrait studio, but I always try to maximize cuteness on
the days we fly, to build goodwill with other passengers. The
strategy seemed to be working. Lots of people smiled at her,
including one of the men sitting next to us. I apologized to the
surly-looking one on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least it's a short flight,'' I said weakly. He didn't
respond.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to empathize with the members of the traveling
majority, the ones without kids, who travel leisurely and
unencumbered. The line demarcating the two is as absolute as the
Atlanta Perimeter _ either you're in or you're out. You're either
stuck with an overloaded stroller as you wait for an elevator or
striding confidently down the concourse unfettered by no more than
a single, sleek rolling suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago and child-free, my husband and I were rooted on
the other side. We spent five months seeing the world, proud of our
shoestring budget and that all we needed fit in our backpacks. When
foreigners asked us if we were parents, we replied, ``No, maybe one
day,'' with all the insouciance of Phileas Fogg.
</P>
<P>
   Now that that day has come, so has all the baggage, both literal
and otherwise. We get to the airport early; we can't exactly
picture ourselves bolting to the gate. We don't cram a lot of
sightseeing into our trips; we prefer modest outings. We spent
hundreds of dollars extra on a trans-Atlantic flight that would
coincide with Joey's bedtime, and it was worth it when she slept
almost the whole way.
</P>
<P>
   We are no longer among those fliers paging through the latest
best seller; we read material from the seat pocket in front of us.
The cartoonlike safety instructions provided a few minutes'
diversion on the flight from Raleigh, until Joey started popping
out the Airfone and jamming it back in. Countless times. With
squeals of pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   That might have bothered the passenger in front, but thank God
she was busy with her own squirming toddler. We were supposed to
sit beside them, but the flight attendant switched us because there
weren't enough oxygen masks in that row. I fantasized that if those
suddenly descended, I'd forgo the safety warning and put one on my
kid first _ just to silence her.
</P>
<P>
   We sang. We read. We snacked. NBA seasons have gone by faster
than these 88 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At least she didn't have a meltdown this time. On our last trip
together, from Texas, she woke up with a look of agitated betrayal
as if to say, ``WHY ARE WE STILL ON THIS PLANE?'' and proceeded to
wail inconsolably for the longest 20 minutes of my life. I had to
stand up to rock her, alerting everyone to the source of all the
ruckus.
</P>
<P>
   As I'm writing this, I'm wondering why we don't just stay home.
And a vision flashes in my mind of my parents packing up my two
brothers and me for cross-country trips each summer. My husband's
family of six went on long excursions, too. Of course we don't
remember where we went as toddlers, but as we grew up, we learned
to look forward to new discoveries, and return with renewed
appreciation for home. We learned to see ourselves as part of a
much larger world that wasn't just on paper or TV, and that's what
I hope traveling will eventually impart to Joey.
</P>
<P>
   One day, we would love to take her around the world with us, to
see what we have seen and to explore new places together. But one
thing's for certain: She'll have to pack her own stuff and carry
it.
</P>
<P>
   We've done enough of that already.

 &HT;    Come on in _ the waterfront's fine
 &HT;    By Marylin Johnson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAUFORT, S.C. _ Beautiful Beaufort by the sea, 26 miles from
Yemassee.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, kids have chanted this rhyme that aptly describes
South Carolina's second oldest town, on the Beaufort River. More
than 300 visitors a day flock to shop, eat and tour its stately
pre-Revolutionary War and antebellum homes and enjoy the
picturesque waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 437 historic houses in Beaufort (pronounced
BEW-fert) boast charming gardens and stand along narrow streets
shaded by dreamy-looking, moss-covered live oaks. One of the most
photographed homes is James Fripp's 1856 Tidalholm, a two-story
white mansion seen in the films ``The Big Chill'' and ``The Great
Santini.'' Like other visitors, Hollywood honchos love Beaufort and
have made 13 movies here.
</P>
<P>
   This picturesque Lowcountry town is nestled between Savannah,
about 55 miles to the south, and Charleston, about 75 miles to the
north. Established by charter in 1711, Beaufort's history actually
goes back much further.Spanish explorers visited in 1514, and
French Huguenots attempted a settlement at nearby Parris Island in
1562. The Spanish reappeared from 1564 to 1587. Others, including
the English and Scots, battled over the coastal plain while
Yemassee and Tuscarora Indians fought to protect their claims.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged is Beaufort, today home to 10,000 year-round
residents and more than 60 shops and art galleries. They offer
tourists everything from a special-edition Madame Alexander doll
($199) to a utilitarian lobster cracker ($4.98) to a one-of-a-kind
Taylor Nicole Turner sculpture of a Gullah woman ($1,000).
</P>
<P>
   For the past two decades, downtown Beaufort has been a vibrant
shopping destination. Duncan Nelson, manager of the visitors center
at the Chamber of Commerce, attributes this to the opening of the
Henry C. Chambers Waterfront Park in '79. ``Before the park, the
area was a landfill,'' she said. ``After the park opening,
restaurants moved in and built patios that overlooked the water.
People with creative minds and merchandise came to town and soon
shops and galleries followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Bayden, who's lived in Beaufort 10 years, gives the town
high marks for a ``really quality shopping area.'' Said Bayden, ``I
like the fact there are several independent booksellers as well as
good art galleries and gift shops such as Rossignol's for wedding
gifts and Boombears for toys, which I think rivals the toy store
FAO Schwarz.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are a local or a visitor, you can do most of your
shopping on foot, after parking your car in a city lot (two hours'
free parking) or anchoring your boat in the marina. Bay Street is
the heart of the shopping area, where Lipsitz's department store
has outfitted its customers from head to toe for more than 97
years.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Joe Lipsitz, who was born 79 years ago on the store's
second floor, says more and more tourists have discovered his
hometown. ``We have the same things to offer as a Savannah or
Charleston but on a smaller scale,'' said the unofficial historian
of Beaufort.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife, Lucille, and I used to know everybody who walked down
the street. But not anymore. We see visitors from Germany and
France as well as all over the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Lana Hefner, who co-owns Bay St. Gallery, is a transplanted
Atlanta artist who fell in love with Beaufort. ``The natural beauty
of the area brought me here,'' she said. ``I wanted to be on the
coast yet not too far from Atlanta.'' Her gallery features the
world-famous sweet grass baskets _ so called because of the
pleasant fragrance of the grass _ woven by descendents of slaves
from West Africa. Twice a month, Hefner spends the day going up and
down the Carolina coast locating the best baskets for her
customers. They start at $75 for a small-handled basket and top out
at $400 for a large one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming a lost art,'' she said. ``Sweet grass is getting
scarce because of extensive coastal development, and many of the
basket makers are elderly women. But shoppers love the baskets.
They want to take this area home with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to spend a fortune for a South Carolina
souvenir. Stones &AMP; Bones is a neat Bay Street gift shop selling
shark teeth found in the Lowcountry starting at $1.50 as well as
cedar boxes ($20-$50) and all types of jewelry ranging from $2 to
$200. And the Beaufort Butterfly Co. offers, you guessed it, all
types of butterfly-trimmed gifts, including rock paperweights
($15), canvas totes ($18) and kids' T-shirts ($14). On a recent
Friday, 8-year-old Patti Alexander of Dayton, Ohio, was snapping up
``fluttering'' butterfly hair clips ($3 each), which she pronounced
``awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   If you're in need of a bit of heavenly support, stop by the shop
in the 1790 John Mark Verdier museum house on Bay Street and buy a
``coastal angel.'' This $5 trinket, which makes a good tree
ornament or knickknack, is fashioned from one part shell, one part
moss and wood, and two parts cotton _ the perfect reminder of your
shopping foray to beautiful Beaufort.

   One year before completing their home in Ross, Calif., Mary and
Bill Poland began scouting for a Valley oak, a picture-perfect
wide-branched tree that would exactly match the one depicted by
their architect in his sketch of their new home.
</P>
<P>
   After searching up and down the state, Mary eventually found one
_ a 30-foot, 50-year-old beauty for $12,500 _ at a nearby nursery.
</P>
<P>
   She reserved it, waited for her house to be finished, and then
had it brought over by truck and planted by her driveway, where it
offers shade for her house and takes the newness off her property.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can tell when the home was built. It has an old-world
look,'' Mary says.
</P>
<P>
   Trophy trees: The trend was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   As people look to recreate the grand houses of the past (the
Polands' is 8,000 square feet, in the French Mediterranean style),
they want the trees around them to be just as lofty.
</P>
<P>
   Says Barry W. Starke, president of the American Society of
Landscape Architects, ``Older trees, the really large ones, used to
be bought by older folks, who didn't have the time to watch a tree
come into its glory. But now it seems the younger people with money
don't want to wait.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, trophy trees are American classics such as
maples, oaks, and beeches; most are found on farms and older
estates about to be subdivided or in large nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   A lush, ample copper beech, valued for its leaf color and
beautiful bark, can cost $25,000. A 60-year-old disectum Japanese
maple _ typically slow growing and prized for its delicate, lacy
leaves _ can command over $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Tom Verderosa, a landscaper in East Hampton, Long
Island, trees and shrubs go through fashions, much like houses.
</P>
<P>
   Sargent hemlocks were popular a few years ago in the Long
Island/Connecticut region; now he says, the demand is for topiaries
at least 60 years old and big hydrangeas, preferably 50-plus (their
prices range from $20,000 to $30,000).
</P>
<P>
   Dallas landscape architect Caye Cook says that live oaks, cedar
elms, magnolias, and American sweet-gum trees are now status
symbols par excellence in residential neighborhoods and commercial
parks in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Many new homeowners are surprised by the lead time trophy trees
require.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the tree's extensive root system must be pruned in
stages, a process that can last roughly a year and a half or the
time it can take for the architect to secure the proper permits
from highway authorities; sometimes traffic lights have to come
down.
</P>
<P>
   And the home's value? Says Jo Bishop, a Kentucky-based realtor
who specializes in affluent communities, ``Trophy trees can easily
add 20 percent to a home's value, especially on smaller
properties.'' &QL;

<P>
   SEOUL _ North Korea has softened its enemies in the South using
a weapon that no one could have imagined during the long years of
North-South confrontation _ cold noodles, Pyongyang-style.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans are shipping buckwheat, bean paste and liquor
here to satiate the appetites of South Koreans yearning for a taste
of life above the Demilitarized Zone that still divides the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The food is arriving here at a time when millions of North
Koreans survive on tree bark and the husks of corn kernels and the
country is getting millions of tons of emergency food aid from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer is an unabashedly capitalist entrepreneur whose
Okryukwan Restaurant takes its ingredients, cuisine _ and name _
from the original restaurant founded on orders from the late North
Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting 10 tons of buckwheat a month for noodles,'' said
the owner, Kim Young Baek, who sees the venture as a marriage
between his own capitalist drive to open up North Korea and North
Korea's need for hard cash. ``We don't think about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That is all in accordance with the ``sunshine policy'' promoted
by President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea to reduce border tensions
after years in which South Korea's national security law forbade
the least sign of Pyongyang influence in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   These days, bags shipped from the North Korean port of Nampo to
the South Korean port of Inchon litter the office of the Okryukwan.
Their labels clearly say ``DPR Korea'' for Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, a name banned in Seoul in print until a year or
so ago.
</P>
<P>
   The original Okryukwan in Pyongyang used to dish up 10,000 daily
servings, but now serves just occasional foreign visitors and VIPs,
Kim said. His own Okryukwan, meanwhile, can hardly cope with the
crowds lined up at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Customers try not to think of the horrors of the Korean War or
the current suffering of starving North Koreans as they wait
happily for a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the North Koreans, but what can you do?''
asked Eum Seong Jin, a university student, standing in line with a
couple of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Beside him, Shin Hyun Joo, working for an American company,
contrasted her response to the North with that of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents' generation went through the Korean War,'' she
said. ``Many left families behind in the North. They have strong
feelings. We don't have those feelings. It's like it's a different
country.''
</P>

said. ``This is the first such business in the South.

   ``Until now all economic transactions between North and South
were based on crops and raw materials,'' he said. Now Koreans ``can
feel real cooperation since this is a service sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Pyongyang, he added, ``is going to register the name of
Okryukwan in the South,'' and the South Korean government has
promised to accept it. ``That means, if a South Korean company
wants to sell anything in the North, North Korea will register its
brand as well.''
</P>

   The question, however, is how long supplies can last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the food shortage problem in the North, we

asked for three shipments of buckwheat a month as well as a ton a

</P>
<P>
   He talks every day to representatives of a trading company in
North Korea, patching calls through Tokyo. A Korean-Japanese
company handles the paperwork for shipments that Pyongyang still
does not want to recognize as moving directly to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure where they get the buckwheat and the mung bean,''

<P>
   SEOUL _ North Korea has softened its enemies in the South using
a weapon that no one could have imagined during the long years of
North-South confrontation _ cold noodles, Pyongyang-style.
</P>
<P>
   The North Koreans are shipping buckwheat, bean paste and liquor
here to satiate the appetites of South Koreans yearning for a taste
of life above the Demilitarized Zone that still divides the Korean
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   The food is arriving here at a time when millions of North
Koreans survive on tree bark and the husks of corn kernels and the
country is getting millions of tons of emergency food aid from
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The buyer is an unabashedly capitalist entrepreneur whose
Okryukwan Restaurant takes its ingredients, cuisine _ and name _
from the original restaurant founded on orders from the late North
Korean leader, Kim Il Sung, in the North Korean capital of
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting 10 tons of buckwheat a month for noodles,'' said
the owner, Kim Young Baek, who sees the venture as a marriage
between his own capitalist drive to open up North Korea and North
Korea's need for hard cash. ``We don't think about politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That is all in accordance with the ``sunshine policy'' promoted
by President Kim Dae Jung of South Korea to reduce border tensions
after years in which South Korea's national security law forbade
the least sign of Pyongyang influence in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   These days, bags shipped from the North Korean port of Nampo to
the South Korean port of Inchon litter the office of the Okryukwan.
Their labels clearly say ``DPR Korea'' for Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, a name banned in Seoul in print until a year or
so ago.
</P>
<P>
   The original Okryukwan in Pyongyang used to dish up 10,000 daily
servings, but now serves just occasional foreign visitors and VIPs,
Kim said. His own Okryukwan, meanwhile, can hardly cope with the
crowds lined up at the door.
</P>
<P>
   Customers try not to think of the horrors of the Korean War or
the current suffering of starving North Koreans as they wait
happily for a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for the North Koreans, but what can you do?''
asked Eum Seong Jin, a university student, standing in line with a
couple of friends.
</P>
<P>
   Beside him, Shin Hyun Joo, working for an American company,
contrasted her response to the North with that of her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents' generation went through the Korean War,'' she
said. ``Many left families behind in the North. They have strong
feelings. We don't have those feelings. It's like it's a different
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, all 360 seats on three floors were filled with diners
tucking in on the famous cold noodles.

 McCAIN FOCUSES ON CHANGING THE POLITICS OF MONEY  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Looking for traction in his uphill campaign
for the presidency, Arizona Sen. John McCain is tying his chances
for the Republican nomination to his crusade for an overhaul of the
nation's campaign finance laws.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is betting that voters, fed up with the money politics of
Washington, will be attracted to a candidate who promises changes.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason why this fall he plans to try to force a
discussion on the Senate floor of legislation that would ban
so-called soft money contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he admits he doesn't have the 60 votes he needs to
break a Republican filibuster of his bill, he is hoping to reignite
debate on campaign finance as the 2000 presidential race heats up.
And if it becomes a top national issue, that it will in turn boost
his own chances in the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   With the possible exception of Republican hopeful Steve Forbes
and his flat tax, no candidate in the presidential hunt is as
closely identified with one issue as McCain. He raises the way
campaigns are funded in every speech. He says his name has become
so closely connected to that of the co-sponsor of his bill, Sen.
Russell Feingold, D-Wis., that his colleague sometimes gets letters
addressed to ``Mr. McCain Feingold.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``soft money'' the McCain-Feingold bill attacks is
designated for party-building purposes and is separate from
donations to a specific candidate, although soft money often is
used to tout issues advocated be a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Feingold bill would outlaw soft money donations to
the Republican and Democratic parties from companies, unions or
special interest groups. And it would impose restrictions on
organizations that mount independent ad campaigns within two months
of an election. It also would require new disclosure requirements
on campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans typically have the edge over Democrats in such
donations, McCain has said his own campaign has followed the intent
of the bill in raising money.

   McCain delivered a campaign speech Wednesday at the Hoover
Institution, the conservative think tank at Stanford University,
with a simple message: Until there is a change in campaign finance
laws, there will be no tax reform, no education reform, no tort
reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't reform anything until we first reform the way we
finance our political campaigns,'' he told an audience of 100 at a
lunch to benefit the Hoover Institution. ``As long as special
interests dominate campaigns, they will dominate legislation as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, McCain singled out major contributors to both
Democratic and Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   He attacked teachers unions for opposing teacher competency
standards and school vouchers. He targeted Archer Daniels Midland
Co., the agribusiness giant, for giving huge sums to both parties
to help secure a multibillion dollar ethanol tax subsidy. He
criticized trial lawyers for nearly derailing the recent Senate
bill to limit liability for companies if computer problems develop
related to the Year 2000 glitch.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the former Navy pilot who was a war prisoner in Vietnam
for 5 1/2 years, attacked Pentagon suppliers for lobbying for more
money for sometimes outdated or unnecessary military equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reform is not possible when defense contractors and their
patrons in Congress use their influence to protect sales rather
than promote national security,'' said McCain, 62. ``Our nation can
do better.''

</P>
<P>
   McCain's rhetoric on campaign finance also serves a political
purpose. By railing against fat-cat interest groups and
money-obsessed politicians in Washington, he can appear to voters
as an outsider, a candidate for change, even though he served two
terms in the House and has been elected to the Senate three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is the reform candidate in this race,'' insists
Dan Schnur, his California political adviser. ``He's talking about
pork-barrel spending. He's running against the Republican
establishment.''
</P>
<P>
   For McCain, the campaign finance issue will be what Schnur calls
a ``campaign within a campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain is taking a risk by putting such a strong emphasis on
campaign finance, one analyst said.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Wolfinger, a political science professor at the University
of California at Berkeley, said many voters might agree with
McCain's call to ban soft money. Yet at a time when voters are
generally content with a booming economy, they may not be
sufficiently angry at Washington to join McCain's crusade.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the country were in a different mood _ for example, back in
1976, when one thing that helped Jimmy Carter get elected was that
he didn't know anything about Washington _ I think there would be
more punch to this issue,'' Wolfinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfinger said McCain's stance on campaign finance reform has
gained him support among Democrats and independents, who applaud
him for bucking GOP leaders who have resisted changes in the way
soft money is handled. But he said the Arizona senator has yet to
prove that he has strong enough support in his own party to win the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``To succeed in the contest for the nomination, you either have
to have a constituency or you have to have money,'' he said. ``It's
not clear that McCain will have a constituency.''
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, it's not clear if he'll have the money, either.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush took in more than $36 million in less
than four months. McCain was second on the money list among
Republicans, but a very distant second, with just over $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he expects to raise about $15 million for the race,
not including the $6 million he expects to add in federal matching
funds. It will be enough, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's over March 7, when California and 15 other
states vote, so you don't have to have a whole lot of money for the
long haul,'' he explained.

   All at once it got very serious. Ken Newport looked up from the
600-page document he had printed from the Internet. He had been
ploughing through its interminable ramblings about horsemen and
brides, scrolls and seals, beasts and Babylon, demon armies and
divine punishments. But then something clicked.
</P>
<P>
   What it meant, he realized with a sudden chill, was blazing gun
battles, burning buildings and more dead children.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors of Waco were looking for a repeat of the awful
inferno in which some 80 people died in the siege of their
headquarters in Texas six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, did an unknown academic from Liverpool like
him go about contacting the FBI? It had all begun innocently
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Newport is a theologian who, for the past two years, has
been gathering material for an academic volume on how groups
throughout history have interpreted Revelation, the final book of
the Bible which is consumed with surreal visions about the end of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Almost without exception, he discovered, those who became
obsessed with the Apocalypse became filled with the conviction that
it was a timetable of real events and that the end was about to
come in their own time.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century Baptist, Benjamin Keach, thought it would
happen in 1689. One of the founders of Methodism, Charles Wesley,
thought Doomsday would be 1794.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most famously, the American preacher William Miller
gathered his followers around him on Oct. 22, 1844, all having sold
their worldly possessions, quit jobs and moved to upstate New York,
which was where Christ was due to return.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the Branch Davidian cult at Waco, under their
wild and charismatic leader David Koresh, were seized with the same
mindset.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something more. From time to time there appeared a
group that was not simply content to wait for Armageddon. They saw
it as their duty to provoke it.
</P>
<P>
   It was in gathering material on the history of the Branch
Davidian cult that he came across evidence that Koresh's
successors, who style themselves the Students of the Seven Seals,
are engaged upon a process whose logic seems to be taking them
remorselessly to the creation of another Waco _ sometime between
now and Friday Aug. 6, when they are convinced that the world will
end.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his neat modern study at Liverpool Hope University
College, amid racks of box files and a world away from the madness
of Waco, Dr. Newport began to correspond _ by letter and e-mail _
with the new generation of Branch Davidians, who have fled Texas
and are now dispersed throughout the U.S. and UK.
</P>
<P>
   He contacted them through their websites and by writing to the
seven members who are in American jails, serving a total of 238
years between them. Slowly he began to piece together the story
which has so unnerved him. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The first piece in the jigsaw went back to Oct. 23, 1844 _ the
day after the world didn't end as William Miller had predicted. It
was then that his followers began the long process of coming to
terms with what they dubbed The Great Disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Among the several new groups which sprang from the disillusioned
Millerites was the Seventh Day Adventists, whose recruits included
one John Kellogg, who developed for his brethren a special
vegetarian breakfast food called corn flakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a movement doomed to schism. A washing machine
salesman called Victor Houteff led a breakaway called the Davidian
Seventh Day Adventists. And after Victor's wife and successor
Florence gathered the movement's 940 members together for another
unsuccessful Doomsday on April 22, 1959, it split again, with Ben
Roden and his wife Lois forming the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the succession should have passed to their son
George. But by then David Koresh was on the scene and things began
to turn from the merely eccentric to the downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the leadership issue, Ken Newport discovered, George
Roden dug up the remains of an 85-year-old Davidian who had died
some 20 years earlier, and challenged Koresh to a Resurrection
Contest.
</P>
<P>
   A gun battle ensued and, though the police arrested everyone, no
one was convicted _ though George was given six months for contempt
of court for threatening the judge with plagues and herpes.
</P>
<P>
   George was later sent to an asylum after drawing a third
Davidian into a row over whether George or Koresh had been chosen
by God to be the seventh and final angel named in the Bible; when
the third man insisted it was neither of them but him, George
chopped him up with an axe.
</P>
<P>
   But it was none of this which prompted the Davidians' letters
and e-mails to Ken Newport suddenly to halt. Nor was it his
questions about the awful events at Waco, at which the FBI
acquitted themselves so poorly. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The cult members began to get wary when Dr. Newport started to
ask about their belief that Koresh is due to return from the dead
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Their massive documents on the Web revealed that a code-breaking
of a combination of dates in Revelation and the prophetic book of
Daniel suggested that Koresh would return on Aug. 6, at the head of
200 million horsemen (see Rev. 9:16) to cleanse the earth and
slaughter the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Those of Koresh's followers who were not consumed in the flames
of Waco were to prepare for the event under the guidance of a
Davidian by the code name of The Chosen Vessel.
</P>
<P>
   It was when Ken Newport began to find out who this might be that
all communication was ended with a final e-mail: ``We perceive now
that you are not a seeker after the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Newport continued to comb through what had already been
made available to him. The conclusions he was forced to make
disturbed him.
</P>
<P>
   For the survivors to join Koresh's divine army they, too, would
have to be dead before Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no reference to self-sacrifice in any of the
documentation. Rather there was the suggestion that the remnant,
under the direction of The Chosen Vessel, would have to be killed
by the same forces who killed Koresh.
</P>
<P>
   ``The logic is clear,'' says Dr. Newport. ``It all makes perfect
sense if you take on board the hypotheses they start with. It is
entirely possible that they are provoking some horrendous
confrontation with the U.S. authorities.'' His estimate is that
around 40 to 50 individuals might be involved in such an outrage.
</P>
<P>
   Across the world, security services have decided they have to
take this kind of thing seriously. The propensity of cults to turn
fantasy into grim reality is evident from a mere recital of names
like Jonestown, the Solar Temple, Heaven's Gate, Aum Shinri Kyo.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Israel recently expelled 14 members of a
Denver-based Doomsday sect called Concerned Christians, accusing
them of plans to attack the al-Aqsa mosque in an attempt to spark
off the apocalyptic war of Armageddon.
</P>
<P>
   In the UK, the anti-terrorism squad is alive to fears that a
fanatical U.S. group has targeted the Millennium Dome for attack.
</P>

   In Montana, the FBI is monitoring groups it fears are storing
explosives for some millennium outrage. &QL;

   Perhaps they have learned the lessons of Waco. When I contacted
them in Washington recently, their cults department was remaining
taciturn. The FBI knows that its strategists made fools of
themselves over Waco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had they taken the trouble to find out anything about what was
going on in the heads of those in the Waco compound, they might
have defused the whole situation peacefully,'' says Ken Newport.
Instead, their actions seemed calculated to produce the worst
possible outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonization of the U.S. government which is found
ubiquitously in Seventh Day Adventist sources predisposed members
of the Branch-Davidian movement (nearly all of whom, including
Koresh himself, were drawn from the Adventist church) to view the
siege of their headquarters by the FBI as of apocalyptic
significance,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorities added to such a perception by shining
unceasing lights into the compound, playing demonically loud music
alternately punctuated, one Waco survivor claimed, with the sound
of rabbits being slaughtered and of Tibetan monks chanting.
</P>
<P>
   It all fitted into the weird end-of-the-world scenario of those
final chapters of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dealing with a group which believed that, just
before the end of the world, the great Satanic power would seek to
destroy the last faithful remnant of God's people,'' says Dr.
Newport.
</P>
<P>
   ``No wonder that, with all that going on outside their Mount
Carmel compound, Koresh's people thought that the eschatological
dawn had broken,'' he says. &QL;

A STIRRING DESCRIPTION OF AN AMERICAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a copy of a creed that begins ``I do not choose to be
a common man.'' What information is available on this?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.S., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: That creed was written by Dean Alfange, a founder of the
Liberal Party of New York, and first published in This Week
magazine in December 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The text: ``I do not choose to be a common man. It is my right
to be uncommon _ if I can. I seek opportunity _ not security. I do
not wish to be a kept citizen, humbled and dulled by having the
state look after me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take the calculated risk; to dream and to build, to
fail and to succeed. I refuse to barter incentive for a dole. I
prefer the challenges of life to the guaranteed existence; the
thrill of fulfillment to the stale calm of utopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not trade freedom for beneficence or my dignity for a
handout. I will never cower before any master nor bend to any
threat. It is my heritage to stand erect, proud and unafraid; to
think and act for myself, enjoy the benefit of my creations, and to
face the world boldly and say, this I have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is what it means to be an American.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: In the very early '70s there was a song by a group named Rose
Colored Glass that I used to play on a local restaurant's jukebox
every day at lunch. For the life of me, I can't remember the name
of the song. What's the title?
</P>
<P>
   _ R., Wilkes-Barre, Penn.
</P>
<P>
   A: Rose Colored Glass had two Top 100 singles on the Bang
Records label in 1971: ``Can't Find the Time'' and ``You're Good
for Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't Find the Time,'' which reached No. 54, had ``Mystic
Touch'' on the flip side. ``If It's Alright With You'' hit No. 95
and was accompanied by ``You're Good for Me.''
</P>
<P>
   Record Finders, a dealer in out-of-print LPs and other music,
has both singles in stock. For ordering information, call (804)
264-0300 or write to Box 1047, Glen Allen, VA 23060.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't Find the Time,'' which sometimes is called ``I Can't
Find the Time to Tell You,'' is also on the 1996 CD collection
``Dick Bartley Presents Collector's Essentials Vol. 2: The '70s.''
That CD is available from the online retailer CDNow at
www.cdnow.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is Bob Ross of ``The Joy of Painting'' deceased?
</P>
<P>
   _ U.C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ross, who painted ``happy little trees'' on his PBS
art-instruction show for 12 years, died of lymphoma in 1995 at age
52.
</P>
<P>
   He became interested in painting while in the Air Force,
inspired by a 1963 assignment to Alaska. After retiring from the
service in 1981, Ross taught art and was offered a program by a PBS
station after officials there saw a tape of his class. He lived in
Florida and filmed his show at a Muncie, Ind., station.
</P>
<P>
   The Bob Ross Co. continues to offer art instruction, supplies
and other products. To request a catalog, call (800) 262-7677 or

 &HT;    Inspiring masters of zinnias plant seeds of hope for next year
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Failure has company. So it is with my inability to
grow zinnias from seed. Since detailing my zinnia misery in a June
17 column, I've heard from a number of gardeners in similar
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Dean Carpenter of Duluth (Ga.), for example, writes in an
e-mail that he identifies with unfulfilled ``expectations of great
things from seeds.'' For him, ``Herb seeds seem to be the most
difficult.'' On the up side, he's growing great buckwheat from
seed.
</P>
<P>
   And in her e-mail, Sandy Springs gardener Madonna Powers says,
``I can relate to your frustrations,'' noting that, ``Zinnias seem
to you what lavender is to me. I have tried and tried to grow every
variety of lavender from seed, to no avail.'' She finds some solace
in marigolds from seed and in seed-grown morning glories, which
``have helped ease my sense of seed-starting failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Too, there were notes of triumph _ gardeners letting me know
they had succeeded in producing hearty zinnias in colorful
profusion. Among those who invited me to visit and marvel and,
maybe, learn, was the Rev. Ron Crispens of Cumming, who with his
wife, Helene, lives on a verdant 50 acres, some of which also is
home to their three grown children and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Ron has gardened and farmed that spot for 19 years, growing just
about any food you'd want or need, growing flowers, too, including
radiant marigolds and sunflowers. But the zinnias are the thing.
He's proud for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Several large patches, blooming mostly orangy-red, light up
spaces around the house. No straggly stems here. No skanky leaves.
These plants are rock solid from head to root, standing some 3 feet
tall.
</P>
<P>
   After a walkabout, we retired to the screened porch, a space
that catches the breeze in the same way as those roomy verandas on
Charleston homes by the bay. Sipping Coke, we talked zinnias.
</P>
<P>
   When we got around to how he grows them, Ron couldn't resist a
good-natured dig at the zinnia-challenged: ``Unlike some people,''
he said, giving me a hard look, ``I find them easy to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Easy for him to say.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, his method does sound easy _ and straightforward. His
foundation is rich earth, compost-filled beds. ``I save all my
leaves,'' he says, adding to them vegetable scraps and composted
pine straw, whose consistency is much like peat.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as spring planting time nears, Ron starts his zinnia
crop indoors, sowing last year's seeds in little pots. When they're
big enough (3 or 4 inches tall), and that rich outdoor soil is warm
enough (at least 50 degrees at night), in go the baby zinnias. With
that rich soil and some hot weather, the plants shoot up like
rockets. And bloom the same way.
</P>
<P>
   What a payoff those blooms are. (Several zinnia growers say that
while the plant is an annual, it readily reseeds for them.) Always
a popular flower in old-style gardens, zinnia, with its big
pinwheel flowers, enjoys ever wider popularity among gardeners and
commercial growers alike. Not surprising, as its range of colors,
including red, orange, yellow, purple, pink, add a bright rainbow
quality to the garden, attracting butterflies by the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Helene points out, as a cut flower, zinnia works: ``At
least a week they last.''
</P>
<P>
   She is quick to acknowledge that she leaves the gardening to
Ron. ``I love picking flowers, but I don't grow them,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I don't grow them from seed, but not because I haven't
tried. When I try again, I'll use some of Ron's seeds _ seeds
gathered from this year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however, I had to have zinnias for this year. So,
spying a roadside flower and vegetable stand in Hiawassee during a
Sunday drive, I wheeled in (no vehicle I ever drive can pass plants
for sale) and sure enough, I was in luck. Now, I've got zinnias.
Not many, but enough to satisfy my need for having this old-timey
plant as a reminder of the lovely country gardens I've known and
lived with.
</P>
<P>
   About a foot tall, the half-dozen zinnias are in full flower _
yellow, red, white, pink. Nearby, those seedlings I planted this
spring remain stuck at 2 inches.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all right; I've been to the zinnia patch, met the
Zinnia Man. Come next year, inspired, I'll seed again.

 &HT;    Giving kids room to grow
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sarah Thornton is living in a dream world. To be more accurate,
a dream room.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Atlanta interior designer Gretchen G. Edwards,
Sarah has everything a 14-year-old could want in her bedroom _ and
then some.
</P>
<P>
   A queen-size sleigh bed in whitewashed pine. A custom-made
curtain canopy that hangs gracefully from the ceiling, draping
either side of the headboard. Matching window treatments that are
fancier than those you'd find in some living rooms. A pine dresser
and matching cabinet to store her collection of porcelain tea sets
and whatnots. Custom-made, blue-and-white-checked lampshades and
blue wall-to-wall carpeting to complete the theme. Sarah's closet
was redesigned to maximize storage space, and her bathroom was
wallpapered to coordinate with the bedroom decor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly what she had visualized. It's just a little
girl's dream,'' said Edwards, who started the project when Sarah
was 12.
</P>
<P>
   Money was no object. Decorating costs for Sarah's bedroom?
Almost $20,000. But the Thorntons won't be changing the decor for
their only child any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was it, and she knew that when we did this,'' said Betty
Thornton, Sarah's mother. ``It absolutely has to last through
college. My thinking is she'll take this furniture with her
someday, when she gets married or has a household of her own.''
</P>
<P>
   The price might seem steep, but the Thorntons aren't alone when
it comes to spending large sums on children's bedroom furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts say the spending spree starts shortly after
conception. Juvenile products are one of the hottest-selling
segments in the children's market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1980, the juvenile product market has increased 400
percent. In 1980 it was $850 million and in 1997 it was $4.4
billion,'' said Kathleen Baier, vice president of communications
for the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association. ``We have a
number of things we attribute this to,'' Baier says. ``Parents
today are having much smaller families. Grandparents have a lot
more disposable income, so grandparents are buying additional items
for grandchildren that our parents may not have bought for us.''
</P>
<P>
   When parents make the second round of major purchases for their
children, which typically occurs some time in grade school, many
aren't settling for mismatched furnishings. They want quality
furniture that will take them from those in-between years, when the
kids have outgrown Winnie-the-Pooh, to a tasteful guest room after
they've left the nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most parents don't use hand-me-downs,'' Baier said, because
``we have more disposable income than our parents had.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumer demand for high-end children's bedroom furnishings has
become a manufacturer's delight.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, Ethan Allen introduced a line of youth
furniture called e.a. Kids. Pottery Barn came out with a mail-order
catalog of kids' furnishings in January. Rooms to Go was ahead of
the curve 2 1/2 years ago when it opened the first of several Rooms
to Go Kids stores in Marietta. The childrens' stores carry about 15
different bedroom collections in addition to accessories, rugs and
bed-in-a-bag sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't quite sure we could justify it, but that's a chance
owner Jeff Seaman decided to take,'' said Eyal Rappoport, vice
president of merchandising at Rooms to Go.
</P>
<P>
   The hunch paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because youth furniture has been emphasized by so many
companies, business has been better than ever, from the
manufacturing sector to the retail sector,'' Rappoport said.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for good-looking youth furniture has also boosted
interest in creating themes that reflect the child's personality
and interests.
</P>
<P>
   Gerard Benatar, vice president of design for Rooms to Go, says
ballet and romantic themes are popular with girls. Canopy beds and
sleigh beds are popular. So are accessories with dolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doll has been the one we've been doing the most. It's more
the classic doll, collectibles,'' Benatar said.
</P>
<P>
   Boys are still wild about sports, he said, particularly
baseball, football and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   A basketball theme was a natural choice for Garvis and Gavar
Long, sons of Atlanta Hawks player Grant Long.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Long, Grant's wife and an avid interior decorator, played
the theme to the hilt in the boys' room.
</P>
<P>
   Garvis, 9, and Gavar, 7 1/2, have full beds with custom-made
basketball headboards. Nikki Long had bed skirts made in the same
color as the pro basketballs. She had a muralist paint a basketball
scene on the boys' armoire, with a likeness of Dad dunking a shot.
The knobs on their bedroom door and chest of drawers are
mini-basketballs. A basketball toy box serves as a hamper. There's
also a basketball table, basketball lamps, a basketball border
around the room and basketball players on the valance over their
curtains.
</P>
<P>
   A life-size cardboard figure of Grant Long, who is 6 feet 9
inches tall, towers over a corner of the room. The boys hang their
backpacks in basketball lockers.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki Long can't begin to estimate what it cost to decorate the
room. ``I think I started looking for basketball stuff when my
oldest was first born,'' she said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Although money isn't an issue when your husband works for the
NBA, Long said many of her purchases came from garage and estate
sales, secondhand stores and discount chains such as Target,
Wal-Mart and the Dollar Store.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really don't have to spend a lot of money to make
something look good,'' she said. ``There's no place you can't
look.''

 &HT;    Summer Workshop: Create a custom shower curtain
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shower curtains can be purchased in all colors, patterns and
fabrics. But when it comes to length and width, manufacturers take
a one-size-fits-all approach.
</P>
<P>
   These days, people may want something more than the standard
size, particularly if they want their shower curtain to resemble a
custom window treatment. That means having it custom made, but
there's a downside to that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having someone come out and sew it for you can be expensive,''
said Margie Ryan, a seamstress who conducts classes on home decor
sewing at JoAnn's Fabrics in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   ``For just a plain shower curtain, I would charge $90, and that
includes labor and the lining _ they would have to supply the
fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   A more economical approach is to make it yourself. All it takes
is a sewing machine, a couple of hours and fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they get remants or fabric on sale, they could do it for
under $25,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, contact Ryan at ``Classes by Margie''
770-518-1220.Supplies:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  6 yards of 54-inch fabric
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  18 shower curtain hooks
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thread
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ruler or tape measure
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Tailor's chalk or marking pen
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Scissors
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Straight pins
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Sewing machine capable of making buttonholes
</P>
<P>
   Step 1: Determine how long you want shower curtain to be by
measuring from curtain rod to side of bathtub, adding 14 inches to
total (for top and bottom hems). Cut fabric into two pieces, each
the length of your total. If using plaid or print fabric, make sure
to match pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Step 2: Right sides together, sew the two pieces of fabric
together lengthwise and press seam open. Fold bottom up 4 inches,
then turn another 4 inches, so hem is doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Step 3: Sew hem by machine or by hand and press smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Step 4: Fold left side of fabric over 1 1/2 inches, then turn
another 1 1/2 inches and hem. Repeat on right side of fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Step 5: Fold fabric down 3 inches, then turn another 3 inches
and press. With a straight stitch, sew close to edge of inner fold.
</P>
<P>
   Step 6: Using chalk or marking pen, mark space for 18
buttonholes. Start buttonholes one inch from edge of fabric,
spacing them about every 5 3/4 inches across the header. Holes
should be sewn vertically. When all holes are finished, open with a
pair of scissors and insert shower curtain rings. Hang on shower
rod (top).

ACURA 3.5RL: QUIET, SMOOTH, YET LESS THAN SPECTACULR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's shakeout time in Luxury Sedan City.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, as drivers aged, they longed for that Caddy, Lincoln
or Benz, the bigger the better, the softer and boatier the ride the
better.
</P>
<P>
   Time was.
</P>
<P>
   Now, automakers are trying to find just the right luxury sedan
to keep the aging wave of baby boomers from opting en masse for
swank SUVs and even fancy pickup trucks. So while they are covering
their flanks by building myriad variations of the latter pair, they
are also trying to find just the right luxury sedan: Lincoln with
its 2000 LS, Mercedes with its sportier 2000 S Class, Cadillac with
its Seville SLS.
</P>
<P>
   And Acura with its ``flagship sedan'' the Acura 3.5RL.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a ``luxury sedan,'' the 3.5RL is quiet, it is
relatively roomy and it is smooth. It has the requisite wide stance
look and the street-sloping hood meant to say ``luxurious yet
sporty.''
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, this does not feel like a luxury car, it's not very
exciting to drive, and it's not distinctive in its appearance. It's
got Mercedes/Lexus written all over it. Park it, and no one will
walk up to you and say, ``Hey, hey, what's that you're driving?''
</P>
<P>
   Yet this car is probably not aimed at the types who are struck
by the appearance of parked cars. Instead, it is aimed at those who
want wonderful reliability, quiet Point A to Point B driving, a
solid (4-year, 50,000-mile) warranty, free 24-hour road service,
concierge and trip routing services, and 100,000 miles before their
first tuneup.
</P>
<P>
   That would be travelers, not drivers.
</P>
<P>
   They plunk down their $41,900 (there are no options except a
navigational system) and go on their quiet way.
</P>
<P>
   And they do so in simple comfort. The expansive dashboard rises
sharply up and away, seemingly from knee level, giving a great
feeling of openness. The easily adjusted leather seats are firm at
back and on the sides, though the fronts are a bit too soft and let
the thighs drop on long trips. The back seats are tipped back at a
most comfortable angle.
</P>
<P>
   Slip into the driver's seat _ it can be programmed to remember
who you are and adjust accordingly _ and grip the wheel. You have
cruise control beneath your right thumb, audio and channel controls
for the sound system beneath your left _ excellent touches and
wonderful for safety.
</P>
<P>
   All else is most simple: tachometer, speedomoter, fuel guage,
temperature guage, and shift indicator dead ahead behind the wheel.
At center, wrapped in a spilling flow of wood from dash to
shiftlever are the climate controls and Bose sound system controls
(6-disc CD changer is standard).
</P>
<P>
   In the driver's side sunvisor are three buttons that can be
programmed to operate your garage door, home lights, home security
or take over other functions ordinarily performed by separate
remote controls.
</P>
<P>
   To your right is a multilevel bin in the console, a nice concept
since the top portion is quite shallow for flat items _ coins,
notebooks, maps _ that might get lost if mixed in with large items
that go into the lower portion, which also houses a 12-volt
auxiliary jack.
</P>
<P>
   You are surrounded by airbags, front and side, and the front
bags are of the new smart variety. They deploy according to
severity of crash _ they don't come screaming out at you in a minor
fender bender _ while the front passenger bag sensors pick up the
size and position of the passenger and can opt not to deploy if a
small child is seated there during a minor crash.
</P>
<P>
   One area where makers of luxury sedans (and especially those
aiming at a certain sportiness) seem to be still wandering is over
engine size. I drove both 6-cylinder and 8-cylinder 2000 Lincoln LS
models on short hops recently and cannot figure out why Lincoln is
even bothering with the 6-cylinder.
</P>
<P>
   And though the Acura 3.5RL can be sneaky fast with its
210-horespower V-6, it just doesn't seem to have the ``power to
spare'' feel you'd expect in a luxury cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it got just over 20 miles per gallon _ certainly owing
to the economy of the V-6 _ but I'm not convinced that those
looking for luxury sedans put gas mileage at the top of their
lists. Power would seem a better option to many of them.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, as I said, is smooth and quiet. Double wishbone
suspension with myriad trailing arms and stabilizer bars, keep it
smooth. The car flows gently in and out of highway traffic and,
yes, gets you from A to B comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the corners, it's soft, not up to the stiff cornering of
other luxury sedans and reminiscent of older luxury cars with their
boat-like feel.
</P>
<P>
   Power-assisted, four-wheel, disc brakes, vented in front and
guided by ABS, bring the car to relatively straight, quick stops
from moderate speeds and slow it quickly at higher speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Don't misunderstand. This is a truly fine automobile and for
some folks it deserves to be the auto of choice. But at almost
$42,000, it has been ratcheted right up there in price with some
great performers and it outstrips in price several cars I would
look at before I would drop that much money here.
</P>
<P>
   Is the 3.5 RL, for instance, really worth $6,000 more than the
Audi A6 Quattro, better than the same-priced BMW 528i, $5,000
better than the Volvo S80, or $7,000 better than Volvo's S70 AWD
sedan, or Chrysler's surprising 300M, a wonderful luxury sports
sedan that comes $10,000 cheaper?
</P>
<P>
   And finally, despite better airbags and other appointments, is
this car worth $14,000 more than Acura's own 3.2tl, which has more
power?
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   _ The way the center console, besides its two levels of storage,
has a soft top that pops up and forward and serves as a comfortable
armrest on long trips.
</P>
<P>
   _ The thruback hole to the trunk behind the drop-down armrest
between the rear seats. Wonderful to haul skis, fishing gear and
other long objects.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   _ The way the speakers mounted in the front doors eat up most of
the storage racks hung low on those doors.

SMALL CARS? SOME PEOPLE REALLY GET INTO THEM

<TEXT>
<P>
   Take my word. These cars are small.
</P>
<P>
   How small?
</P>
<P>
   So small that if you drive one, you dance on the razor edge of
political correctness: Fume at that looming Bulbous Bug, the new
Volkwagen Beetle, as you hope it doesn't crush you. Rage at that
gas-guzzling, view-blocking Volvo station wagon whose imperious
owner doesn't care that she could be driving something smaller,
safer (for you), and more fuel efficient.
</P>
<P>
   So small that if you lined up a brood of these tiny autos behind
a Volkswagen bus, called it installment art and placed it, say, in
the heart of green space in downtown Boston, you could name your
work ``Make Way for Ducklings _ with Motors.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the mini- and microcars whose genesis was the need for
cheap transportation (not to mention jobs in idled aircraft
factories) in Europe in the years after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   How small? Microcar engines have three or fewer cylinders and a
displacement of 510 ccs; minis are four cylinders, or less than
1,000 ccs, or less than 13 feet long.
</P>
<P>
   The first prototypes were produced in the late 1940s and early
'50s and, with Germany at the forefront, most were built in Europe.
Messerschmitt, the aircraft manufacturer, took the lead when Fritz
Fend, a German designer, showed his tiny vehicle, which he had
designed as a car for those disabled in the war, to Willy
Messerschmitt, whose factory, under post-war agreement, was not
allowed to produce aircraft. By 1953, little Messerschmitt autos
were rolling off the lines. They look like small planes with their
wings clipped. The cockpit canopy is derived from the fighter plane
and the steering yoke is right out of the aircraft. A single
passenger sits behind the driver, just like pilot and copilot.
</P>
<P>
   It fit the bill for those looking for cheap-to-buy, cheap-to-run
autos. At $520 new, that was about $1 per pound. But Messerschmitt
was not alone in cranking out cars that cost between around $200 to
$1,100, were cheap to register, were taxed low, and got 60-100
miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with what Charles Gould, a Newton, Mass. collector,
calls ``a clean sheet of paper,'' Heinkle, Vespa (under aircraft
manufacturer Piaggio), and BMW, among others, produced the little
cars.
</P>
<P>
   Many were exported to the United States, but in 1950s America,
gas was cheap and the people were in love with big chrome, big
steel, and speed. Sixty-miles-per-hour was screaming fast for many
of these microcars _ and that often required a good tailwind. So
they never caught on here in any serious way and by the time the
Austin Mini and Mini Cooper were introduced in the early 1960s _
small cars that were real cars _ the microcar craze was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese manufacturers produced some in the late 1960s and into
the '70s, and even today in California an electric mini called the
Sparrow (looking remarkably like a Messerschmitt) is in the works.
But for all intents and purposes, the micro- and minicar realm is
now dominated by collectors who scour garages and fields and
cellars and barns for the few tens of thousands that may still
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Gould says they are found in two distinct conditions: rotting
where they were tossed away, or in near perfect condition where,
because they were so small, people were able to carry them indoors
to store away from the ravages of time. Remember: These cars were
so cheap, they were almost disposable. Gould found one of his
Messerschmitts hanging on a wall in a barn. Today, they can be had
as cheaply as $1,000 or less, or up to $20,000 for the rarest
models. The latter would include such prizes as the 4-wheel
Messerschmitt Tiger; a Goggomobile Transporter Van, and Honda S600
and S800 Roadsters from early '60s, with 4-cylinder, 4-carb, DOHC,
600 cc engine that redlined at 9500 RPMs.
</P>
<P>
   The Messerschmitt KR 200, with its 191 cc, two-stroke, aircooled
engine, had an integrated four-speed gear box and no reverse. But
the car can be run in reverse by turning off the engine and
restarting it to run backwards _ thus, four speeds in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   The Goggomobile, built in Dingofing, Germany, features an
elaborate electric preshift so it runs through the gears much like
an old, far more expensive Cord.
</P>
<P>
   The BMW Isetta is perhaps the most easily recognized example of
these cars for those outside the craze _ familiar because its front
opens, much like a refrigerator door, to allow access. An
articulated steering linkage with two universal joints lets the
steering wheel and column move up and out of the way when the door
is opened.
</P>
<P>
   Besides many of the standards, there are some rarities: the
Velorex, a Czech auto made as a crude tubular frame covered with
fabric that has at its heart a Jawa motorcycle; a 1958 Brutsch
Mopetta, the smallest car ever manufactured and resembling a
motorcycle sidecar. It is steered by motorcycle handlebars and is
one of three still known to exist from the original 11
manufactured; and the George Jetson-mobile, a 1964 Peel Trident,
fiberglass with a clear bubble dome, built on the Isle of Man and
sold as ``cheaper than walking'' at about $200 new.
</P>
<P>
   Also there is the BMW Isetta 300, 600 and 700s, and cars from
Messerschmitt, Kleinschnittger, Goggomobile, Zundapp, Vespa,
Heinkle, Fiat, Crosley, King Midget, Fuji, Daihatsu, Honda and
Subaru.

ALL-STAR GAME A GRAND SLAM FOR A HOST CITY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BOSTON -- Only two sports events in Massachusetts history are
likely to have more impact on the economy: the 100th running of
Boston Marathon in 1996 and the Ryder Cup upcoming in September at
The Country Club in Brookline.
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball's All-Star Game opens with the John
Hancock FanFest at the Hynes Veterans Memorial Convention Center
Friday. Companies are striving to promote the game and the events
surrounding it, hoping to polish their images by association.
Tourism officials see a promotional bonanza with an impact long
after the last baseball fan leaves. And observers say the huge
event will help the Red Sox demonstrate why they need a new
stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who thinks sports don't have a financial impact on a
city ought to try to get a hotel or restaurant reservation in
Boston this weekend. It's going to be impossible,'' said Soosie
Lazenby, president of the Massachusetts Sports Partnership, which
is organizing 2,000 volunteers to staff the event, including
college athletes and Little League players. ``Events like this are
good for cities. They show that we can undertake the tremendous
collaborative effort that is required and that we're capable of
pulling it off.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball estimates that the game, and five days of
events leading up to it, will generate $62 million in the local
economy. The Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau is more
conservative, pegging its estimate at $50 million to $54 million.
The 100th Boston Marathon generated $173 million, and the Ryder Cup
is expected to generate $150 million, according to Patrick B.
Moscaritolo, president and chief executive of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts caution that such estimates are inflated, in part
because the disposable income likely would have been spent on
something else in the local economy if the event had not occurred.
But Moscaritolo says he has been conservative in estimating the
revenues, and others say that in the summer tourism season a lot of
that $50 million to $60 million would not have been spent in the
Boston area at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest dividend is going to come two, three, four, five
years from now, when people remember the images they see of Boston
on television or their visit here for the game, and they decide to
visit again, or for the first time,'' Moscaritolo said. ``About 205
countries around the globe get the television feed from the
All-Star Game and it's broadcast in 12 languages. No convention or
visitors bureau has a marketing budget to pay for that kind of
exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game is such a prime attraction for Major League
Baseball that, even in cities with much larger stadiums than Fenway
Park, officials seek to maximize the opportunity for fans to
participate by hosting the FanFest, a Home Run Derby, and eight
other events on the days leading up to the game. And with only
about 34,000 seats for the game, fewer people will attend it than
any All-Star Games since the last one at Fenway Park in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau estimates 100,000 visitors will
come to Boston for the All-Star Game and related events, and that
some 80,000 will attend FanFest.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are among the companies leveraging their association
with the game and five days of related events. Originally, this
year's game was to have been played in Milwaukee. But it became
clear in 1997 that the Brewers' new stadium would not be ready, and
the Red Sox, the city, and the convention bureau were persuaded by
Major League Baseball to switch their approach from campaigning for
the 2001 game to the 1999 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually these games are awarded to teams with new stadiums so
they can show them off,'' said a businessman who works extensively
with sports franchises and leagues. ``This time, it is coming to a
team that says it needs a new stadium. And it's prime marketing for
the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole event will demonstrate all of the magic and the big
impact that baseball has, at the same time that it provides a great
example of why Fenway Park is obsolete,'' he said. For their part,
the Red Sox were not saying much about the proposed new ballpark
when they talk publicly about the All-Star Game. But they intend to
release their financial plan for the proposed stadium soon after
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Sox are just happy to be contributing in our role as a
player in the local community,'' said Richard L. Bresciani, vice
president of public affairs for the Sox. ``This is the kind of
impact a ball club has on a city, and it's part of our financial
commitment to the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Other firms are leveraging the game as part of their marketing
plans. The official sponsors of the game include Stop &AMP; Shop,
Century 21, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co., Fleet Financial
Group, Gulf Oil, PepsiCo Inc., Anheuser-Busch, and The Boston
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think as a leading company in the community a good way to
show our leadership is to tie in with premier events that come to
town,'' said Terry Vanderwater, vice president of public affairs
for Stop &AMP; Shop, which has 196 stores in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New York. ``It's going to be a long
time before the All-Star Game is back on the East Coast, so we
thought this was a prime opportunity. We think it will sell more
products and drive customer loyalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers say Hancock is spending $800,000 to $1 million to help
finance the John Hancock FanFest, which will cost Major League
Baseball in excess of $3 million to produce. Hancock will open
FanFest unofficially Thursday night, with employees invited to
visit the interactive exhibits and partake of the full immersion in
baseball that the event is intended to produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hancock has been great, and this is a very important part of
All-Star week,'' said Reg Bronskill, the executive producer of
FanFest. ``It is a way for Major League Baseball and its partners
to expand the All-Star experience to many, many people who could
not buy or afford tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game annually provides Major League Baseball with
one of its largest sales of licensed products at a single event.
Pro Player, in Hudson, N.H., has been selling shirts, jackets and
other products bearing the official All-Star logo for a year.
Shirts with large images of the Red Sox All-Stars Pedro Martinez
and Nomar Garciaparra will debut on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Pro Player, the sports licensing division of Fruit
of the Loom, say sales have totaled about $2 million to date,
including $750,000 to $1 million in sales in June alone.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reebok International Ltd., of Stoughton, Mass., is
providing players who are signed with the company and who will play
in the game with a commemorative shoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, we give our players who are selected to play in
the game a special shoe,'' said Dave Fogelson, director of public
relations for Reebok. ``This year, it is a lighter, leather-colored
shoe, sort of brown or tan, with the All-Star logo on the tongue
and heel of the shoe.''

COURT INTERPRETERS TO GET PAY RAISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EMILY GURNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hoping to slow the loss of translators in
California courts, a state panel has announced it is increasing the
daily pay for certified interpreters from the $200 most were being
paid a day to $243.
</P>
<P>
   The increase is necessary because the state's pool of certified
interpreters has fallen 39 percent in the last four years _ from a
total of 1,675 in 1995 to 1,026 this year, the state Judicial
Council said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely essential ... that we have competent
interpretation services available,'' said William C. Vickrey,
administrative director of the courts for the Judicial Council.
``It's an issue of access and fairness to the citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 languages are spoken in California, and more than
100 on any given day are interpreted in the courts, Vickrey said.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the high proportion of Cantonese speakers,
particularly in San Francisco, there are only 22 certified
Cantonese interpreters in the state, according to the Judicial
Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Judicial Council is the policy-making body for the state
courts and is in charge of setting pay rates for interpreters in
the criminal courts.
</P>
<P>
   With California's non-English-speaking population growing, the
courts are in dire need of more qualified people to translate court
proceedings for defendants, interpret non-English-speaking
witnesses' testimony for juries, and make sure that lawyers
themselves know what their clients are saying, interpreters and
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not do my job without the services of very qualified,
competent, professional interpreters,'' said Cheryl H. Wallace, a
private criminal defense attorney in San Francisco. ``The system
couldn't function without them, particularly in San Francisco,
where we have so many people of different backgrounds and different
languages.''
</P>
<P>
   The interpreters are independent contractors and not court
staff. Interpreters in the criminal courts earn far less than those
working in the private sector, where they are paid as much as $100
per hour.

MORE AIR PASSENGERS GETTING LEFT BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Overbooked planes and crowded skies mean more
and more passengers are getting left on the ground, involuntarily
bumped from their flights.
</P>
<P>
   During the first quarter of 1999, the number of ticketed
passengers who were denied a flight because of overbooking rose 55
percent compared to the same period last year, according to the
Department of Transportation. The government figures also showed a
general increase in consumer complaints about air travel.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers are bumped when an airline oversells seats to
compensate for no-shows. An average of 10 to 15 percent of ticket
holders never show up at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   More than 17,000 passengers were involuntarily bumped during the
first three months of the year, the government said. Another
282,500 volunteered to take later flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airlines want to ensure there are no empty seats and the
only way to guarantee that is to overbook the flights. The result
is a lot more people are getting bumped,'' said Brad Hudson, owner
of the Travel Zone agency in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines had the worst record with 8,144 of its 24.4
million passengers being denied flights because of overbooking,
nearly as many as the nine other major carriers combined.
</P>
<P>
   Based strictly on the number of passengers bumped, United
Airlines came in second with 2,142 of its 18.3 million passengers
involuntarily left at the gates. Southwest Airlines fared only a
little better with 1,938 of its 14.6 million customers being told
they had to wait for another flight.
</P>
<P>
   As required by federal law, airlines have guidelines for
bumping. First, the airlines offer incentives to tempt ticketed
passengers to give up their seats. If that doesn't work, they start
bumping either on a first-come, first-served basis or in a pecking
order with first-class passengers least likely to lose their seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overbooking, it's great that it gives the profits to the
airlines but it's hell on the business traveler,'' said Udaya
Kotamarti, a marketing representative for a Washington, D.C.,
telecommunications company who was traveling from San Francisco to
Seattle on United Shuttle Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His colleague, Amir Dehdashty, had a ticket on an overbooked
United Airlines flight from Washington to San Francisco Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dehdashty said he volunteered to give up his seat for a $300
voucher. But just before the plane took off, United rescinded the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get on the plane and it's all booked up _ someone has taken
my seat and I ended up in the middle seat,'' said Dehdashty, adding
that he had trouble finding room for his carry-on.
</P>
<P>
   A Delta representative acknowledged Wednesday that the airline
had problems correctly forecasting its passenger loads.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully intend to significantly reduce involuntary (bumpings)
to an acceptable level. That is a corporate goal,'' said Delta
spokesman John Kennedy.

TRAILER DOES DISSERVICE TO THIS THRILLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Arlington Road'' is one of those movies that is
done a disservice by its preview trailer. That's because the less
you know about this taut thriller, the better off you are.
Unfortunately, the film's advertising campaign seems determined to
give away most of the movie's surprises, reducing its essence to a
rote roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because ``Arlington Road'' offers its audience
pleasures that go beyond most brainless summer fare. It's smart,
nerve-racking and features fine performances from a couple of
underappreciated masters of acting, Jeff Bridges and Tim Robbins.
In a summer full of snickers, this movie provides an
edge-of-your-seat alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Director Mark Pellington (known mostly for music video work)
establishes an intense, apprehensive tone immediately during the
opening credits sequence. We see a young boy, blood dripping on his
Converse sneakers, staggering down the center of a residential
neighborhood street outside Washington, D.C. (Angelo Badalamenti's
haunting music adds to the disorienting effect.)
</P>
<P>
   Driving home, history professor Michael Faraday (Bridges) comes
across the horrific sight and speeds the boy to the hospital
emergency room. It turns out the child, Brady (Mason Gamble), is
the oldest son of Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Robbins and Joan Cusack),
Faraday's congenial neighbors from across the street. Brady had
been playing with fireworks and had one explode in his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two months they've lived there, and I haven't said one word to
them,'' Faraday tells his girlfriend, Brooke (Hope Davis), full of
the kind of guilt and remorse that anyone living in a detached,
suburban climate can understand.
</P>
<P>
   The accident brings the neighbors together. Faraday's son, Grant
(Spencer Treat Clark), becomes close to Brady, and the Langs invite
Michael and Brooke over for a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   But Faraday begins to notice some contradictions in Oliver's
stories. Oliver says he's never lived in the East before, but
Michael sees an alumni letter from the University of Pennsylvania.
Oliver claims to design shopping malls, but his blueprints seem to
be of office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Faraday, though, could easily be suffering from paranoid
delusions. He's a widower; his FBI agent wife was killed by
militant extremists during a botched raid. He also teaches a class
in American terrorism at George Washington University and spends
his time debunking the government's ``official'' anti-conspiracy
explanations. He's still bitter about his wife's death, a tragedy
he believes could have been easily avoided.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, a cat-and-mouse game between Faraday and Lang is
established and director Pellington, working from an edgy script
from first-time screenwriter Ehren Kruger, has the perfect actors
working in those roles. Robbins, with his little boy's face and
cryptic grin, plays the enigmatic Lang as a Fred Rogers (the
cardigan sweaters are a nice touch) with militia leanings. (He's
always sweetly telling Faraday that ``someone should pay'' for his
wife's shooting.)
</P>
<P>
   As for Bridges, his natural weariness and wounded ease have
rarely been used to better effect. We watch Faraday become consumed
with finding the truth about Lang, and, in the process, begin to
resemble the sort of loose cannon that he teaches his students (and
his little boy) to fear. It's another wonderfully textured turn
from Bridges, who has made a career at delivering this kind of
understated performance.
</P>
<P>
   (Added bonus: Cusack's spooky work as a housewife straight out
of ``Pleasantville.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' isn't perfect. The film occasionally veers
back and forth in tone, breaking its hypnotic mood with a jokey
line that would have been more at home in another sort of movie.
(``The Hand That Rocks the Cradle,'' for instance.) The last act,
at times, resorts to genre cliches to move the plot. For the most
part, though, Pellington has managed to effectively evoke the
sickening vulnerability that many Americans now feel after
incidents like those in Littleton and Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   There's one scene, a conversation between Faraday and Lang in
Faraday's back yard, that neatly encapsulates the encroaching
claustrophobia prevalent in America's suburban sprawl. The two men
warily talk, inches from the other's face and surrounded on all
sides by the looming presence of their neighbors' homes, dwellings
that seem to be stacked on top of each other. With such suffocating
proximity, is there any way Faraday couldn't let his suspicions get
the better of him?
</P>
<P>
   The film's shattering conclusion provides the answer to that
question with the brutal force of a kick in the gut. ``Arlington
Road'' may not be the studios' feel-good movie of the summer, but
you probably won't see a more powerfully disturbing movie about
America during this traditionally silly season. &QL;

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Sometime in mid-January, a farmer in West
Flanders noticed that some of his chicken eggs had failed to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   From the ones that did hatch emerged deformed chicks. He called
a veterinary inspector, who had the eggs and chicks tested. To the
inspector's shock, the tests revealed dioxin -- a notorious
carcinogen -- in concentrations several hundred times greater than
accepted levels. Thus began what some Belgians call
``Chicken-Gate,'' a complex affair that helped bring down a
government and ended the career of a veteran prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It also set off a chain of events that so far has cost
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. $60 million and incalculable damage to
its image.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian food scandal, which is highlighted by nightly news
footage of piles of pink chicken and pig carcasses buried in pits,
has reverberated far beyond the borders of this country of 10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe fears about food and drink have become a potent
force in the '90s, dividing nations, terminating political careers
and making every sip and bite an unappetizing source of
contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Coca-Cola with a lapse in quality control sufficient
enough to make some of its bottles and cans to smell and taste like
rotten eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's misadventure came with the a public in near panic and a
discredited government grasping for the appearance of competence
and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   These virtues seemed sorely missing in the government's handling
of the dioxin crisis, which came to light months after the initial
discovery when the news was broken by a television reporter. The
level of outrage among the public simmered to full boil by late
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Voters vented their fury at the polls June 13, ending the
government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene(CQ, the respected
politician who held together a fractious coalition for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the crisis, government ministers dropped like dinner
chickens. In late May with the chaos in full blossom, Luc Van den
Bossche, a dour, battle-tested bureaucrat and deputy prime
minister, was assigned to fill the vacant posts atop the ministries
of environment, social affairs and health.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the chain-smoking former prosecutor was
parachuted in to sort out the mess, the Coca-Cola file hit his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, a dozen students at a Catholic school in the
prosperous town of Bornem were taken to a local hospital
complaining of vomiting, nausea and headaches after drinking small
bottles of Coca-Cola during their late morning break.
</P>
<P>
   During the day another 21 kids trickled in; and overnight six
arrived at the hospital. Fifteen of the 39 were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian Coca-Cola executive came to the school in the
afternoon after getting a call from its headmaster. Samples were
gathered and dispatched to labs in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the company faxed a letter to the school
acknowledging that the illnesses may have had something to do with
its products.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, eight students at a school in Brugge, a favorite
tourist destination, reported getting sick after drinking Coke
products. This incident prompted Van den Bossche to pay closer
attention.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, 30 students of about the same age in the town of
Lochristi 20 miles away from Bornem reported similar symptoms after
drinking cans of Cokes and Coke products from a vending machine.
They were transported by ambulance to Ghent, the largest city in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Images of retching children being rushed to hospitals were
featured on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Similar reports began to flood the government -- 112 students
from five schools reported they were getting sick after drinking
Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   In Van den Bossche's office, it was becoming obvious that the
Belgian government had a potential new crisis on its hands. ``I'm
eating dioxin and drinking Coca-Cola,'' said one bureaucrat as the
new crisis joined the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Coke began withdrawing some of its products, but the reports of
illnesses persisted. In all, 249 people sought medical attention in
Belgium for symptoms they associated with drinking Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week, government officials complained that Coke was
neither sensitive to the government's position nor forthcoming with
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, a clearly exasperated Van den Bossche surprised
everyone by banning the sale of all Coca-Cola products until
someone could tell him out why all these people were getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, he was telling aides that the soft drink company
deserved what it was getting for not being more open and failing to
understand the sensitivity of public sentiments about food safety.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche also found it irritating and arrogant that Coke
would not divulge its secret formula, which raised suspicions that
something may have gone awry with the syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Very early on, an advisory panel of doctors advised him that the
Coca-Cola crisis could be explained as a mass psychosomatic
reaction -- now the broadly accepted explanation -- but he was
unwilling to risk the wrath of Belgian parents by telling them that
it was all in their children's heads.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed concern about appearing soft on the American
corporate giant. ``Coca Cola is a big company, it's a symbol, it's
the United States,'' said Michel de Muelenaere, the home news
editor for the national daily Le Soir.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it soon became clear that government scientists, who tested
the beverages for 15,000 toxins, could find nothing to warrant a
continued ban. Coca-Cola provided its own explanation that the
bottles had become contaminated with sulfur-laced carbon dioxide
gas and the cans had come in contact with a fungicide on wooden
pallets. Neither substance was found in high enough levels to
explain the symptoms, adding credence for the psychosomatic theory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to the vexation of Coke executives assembled in a war room
at the company's suburban Brussels plant, Van den Bossche agreed
only to ease but not lift the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the minister feared to lose face,'' said Benoit
Nemery, a toxicologist and a member of the government's advisory
team of doctors. ``After being so radical, it would have been very
difficult for him to say, 'Sorry, that wasn't really necessary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the air of suspicion continued in Belgium other
countries either joined in restricting Coke products -- as in the
case of France -- or took pains to reassure their citizens that
Coke products sold in their countries were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Coke had a full-scale crisis on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   While executives in Belgium seemed to understand the perilous
environment in Europe, the situation seemed to be grasped slowly by
Coca-Cola executives in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the ban was enacted, Coke finally responded in a
big public way with chairman Douglas Ivester issuing an apologetic
statement. Two days after that, Ivester arrived in Brussels to
focus his personal attention on the crisis -- 10 days after it
began.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lenfant, a Belgian Coca-Cola executive, said the
company perhaps reacted too slowly. ``I admit we perhaps lost
control of the situation to a certain extent,'' Lenfant said during
a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a crisis-management strategy,'' Lenfant said. ``But
the crisis was bigger than any worst-case scenario we could have
imagined. The first couple of days of the crisis we didn't know
(the cause), and I humbly admit that we should have said so more
clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban was lifted June 23, even though Van den Bossche lamented
that no one had yet given him sufficient explanation as to why so
many people fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Atlantans could be forgiven for failing to master
the mind-numbing nuances of Belgian politics -- one frustrated Coke
executive observed: ``You don't have to have banana trees to have a
banana republic.'' -- or comprehend that the concern over food
already bordered on hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   The dioxin scare is only the most recent in a series of such
crises involving European governments and failures either to
adequately inform the public of a risk or to color the truth enough
to lose all credibility. After the mad-cow disease scare in
Britain, occasional bouts of e-coli, fears over hormone-laced beef
from the United States and even aspersions of beef blood
derivatives used in French wine, consumers don't know what to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, consumers for months have had to eat breakfast
contending with newspaper reports on the creeping threat of
Genetically Modified food -- called ``Frankenstein Food'' by
tabloid headline writers.
</P>
<P>
   The public rejection of such foods has been intense -- even
though they are common in the United States and have not been shown
to pose any health threats. Two major European food producers
decided to capitalize on the concern. Nestle and Unilever are
introducing lines of ``GM-free'' foods, while other companies have
decided to pull their products containing these genetically
modified foods from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   All this has created an atmosphere both complex and hostile for
companies such as Coca-Cola, to whom image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Had this all occurred before that farmer observed the problems
with his eggs and chicks, Coke's problems would have been greatly
reduced, said Muelenaere, the Le Soir editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been something because it is Coca-Cola,'' said
De Muelenaere, whose newspaper featured Coke stories side-by-side
the dioxin stories for a week last month. ``But you would not have
seen the government behave as aggressively as it did or the media
causing so much -- I don't want to use the word 'hysteria' --
interest.''

it was all in their children's heads.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed concern about appearing soft on the American
corporate giant. ``Coca Cola is a big company, it's a symbol, it's
the United States,'' said Michel de Muelenaere, the home news
editor for the national daily Le Soir.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it soon became clear that government scientists, who tested
the beverages for 15,000 toxins, could find nothing to warrant a
continued ban. Coca-Cola provided its own explanation that the
bottles had become contaminated with sulfur-laced carbon dioxide
gas and the cans had come in contact with a fungicide on wooden
pallets. Neither substance was found in high enough levels to
explain the symptoms, adding credence for the psychosomatic theory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to the vexation of Coke executives assembled in a war room
at the company's suburban Brussels plant, Van den Bossche agreed
only to ease but not lift the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the minister feared to lose face,'' said Benoit
Nemery, a toxicologist and a member of the government's advisory
team of doctors. ``After being so radical, it would have been very
difficult for him to say, 'Sorry, that wasn't really necessary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the air of suspicion continued in Belgium other
countries either joined in restricting Coke products -- as in the
case of France -- or took pains to reassure their citizens that
Coke products sold in their countries were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Coke had a full-scale crisis on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   While executives in Belgium seemed to understand the perilous
environment in Europe, the situation seemed to be grasped slowly by
Coca-Cola executives in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the ban was enacted, Coke finally responded in a
big public way with chairman Douglas Ivester issuing an apologetic
statement. Two days after that, Ivester arrived in Brussels to
focus his personal attention on the crisis -- 10 days after i
began.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lenfant, a Belgian Coca-Cola executive, said the
company perhaps reacted too slowly. ``I admit we perhaps lost
control of the situation to a certain extent,'' Lenfant said during
a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a crisis-management strategy,'' Lenfant said. ``But
the crisis was bigger than any worst-case scenario we could have
imagined. The first couple of days of the crisis we didn't know
(the cause), and I humbly admit that we should have said so more
clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban was lifted June 23, even though Van den Bossche lamented
that no one had yet given him sufficient explanation as to why so
many people fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Atlantans could be forgiven for failing to master
the mind-numbing nuances of Belgian politics -- one frustrated Coke
executive observed: ``You don't have to have banana trees to have a
banana republic.'' -- or comprehend that the concern over food
already bordered on hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   The dioxin scare is only the most recent in a series of such
crises involving European governments and failures either to
adequately inform the public of a risk or to color the truth enough
to lose all credibility. After the mad-cow disease scare in
Britain, occasional bouts of e-coli, fears over hormone-laced beef
from the United States and even aspersions of beef blood
derivatives used in French wine, consumers don't know what to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, consumers for months have had to eat breakfast
contending with newspaper reports on the creeping threat of
Genetically Modified food -- called ``Frankenstein Food'' by
tabloid headline writers.
</P>
<P>
   The public rejection of such foods has been intense -- even
though they are common in the United States and have not been shown
to pose any health threats. Two major European food producers
decided to capitalize on the concern. Nestle and Unilever are
introducing lines of ``GM-free'' foods, while other companies have
decided to pull their products containing these genetically
modified foods from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   All this has created an atmosphere both complex and hostile for
companies such as Coca-Cola, to whom image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Had this all occurred before that farmer observed the problems
with his eggs and chicks, Coke's problems would have been greatly
reduced, said Muelenaere, the Le Soir editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been something because it is Coca-Cola,'' said
De Muelenaere, whose newspaper featured Coke stories side-by-side
the dioxin stories for a week last month. ``But you would not have
seen the government behave as aggressively as it did or the media
causing so much -- I don't want to use the word 'hysteria' --
interest.''

<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Sometime in mid-January, a farmer in West
Flanders noticed that some of his chicken eggs had failed to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   From the ones that did hatch emerged deformed chicks. He called
a veterinary inspector, who had the eggs and chicks tested. To the
inspector's shock, the tests revealed dioxin -- a notorious
carcinogen -- in concentrations several hundred times greater than
accepted levels. Thus began what some Belgians call
``Chicken-Gate,'' a complex affair that helped bring down a
government and ended the career of a veteran prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It also set off a chain of events that so far has cost
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. $60 million and incalculable damage to
its image.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian food scandal, which is highlighted by nightly news
footage of piles of pink chicken and pig carcasses buried in pits,
has reverberated far beyond the borders of this country of 10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe fears about food and drink have become a potent
force in the '90s, dividing nations, terminating political careers
and making every sip and bite an unappetizing source of
contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Coca-Cola with a lapse in quality control sufficient
enough to make some of its bottles and cans to smell and taste like
rotten eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's misadventure came with the a public in near panic and a
discredited government grasping for the appearance of competence
and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   These virtues seemed sorely missing in the government's handling
of the dioxin crisis, which came to light months after the initial
discovery when the news was broken by a television reporter. The
level of outrage among the public simmered to full boil by late
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Voters vented their fury at the polls June 13, ending the
government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene(CQ, the respected
politician who held together a fractious coalition for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the crisis, government ministers dropped like dinner
chickens. In late May with the chaos in full blossom, Luc Van den
Bossche, a dour, battle-tested bureaucrat and deputy prime
minister, was assigned to fill the vacant posts atop the ministries
of environment, social affairs and health.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the chain-smoking former prosecutor was
parachuted in to sort out the mess, the Coca-Cola file hit his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, a dozen students at a Catholic school in the
prosperous town of Bornem were taken to a local hospital
complaining of vomiting, nausea and headaches after drinking small
bottles of Coca-Cola during their late morning break.
</P>
<P>
   During the day another 21 kids trickled in; and overnight six
arrived at the hospital. Fifteen of the 39 were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian Coca-Cola executive came to the school in the
afternoon after getting a call from its headmaster. Samples were
gathered and dispatched to labs in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the company faxed a letter to the school
acknowledging that the illnesses may have had something to do with
its products.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, eight students at a school in Brugge, a favorite
tourist destination, reported getting sick after drinking Coke
products. This incident prompted Van den Bossche to pay closer
attention.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, 30 students of about the same age in the town of
Lochristi 20 miles away from Bornem reported similar symptoms after
drinking cans of Cokes and Coke products from a vending machine.
They were transported by ambulance to Ghent, the largest city in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Images of retching children being rushed to hospitals were
featured on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Similar reports began to flood the government -- 112 students
from five schools reported they were getting sick after drinking
Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   In Van den Bossche's office, it was becoming obvious that the
Belgian government had a potential new crisis on its hands. ``I'm
eating dioxin and drinking Coca-Cola,'' said one bureaucrat as the
new crisis joined the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Coke began withdrawing some of its products, but the reports of
illnesses persisted. In all, 249 people sought medical attention in
Belgium for symptoms they associated with drinking Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week, government officials complained that Coke was
neither sensitive to the government's position nor forthcoming with
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, a clearly exasperated Van den Bossche surprised
everyone by banning the sale of all Coca-Cola products until
someone could tell him out why all these people were getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, he was telling aides that the soft drink company
deserved what it was getting for not being more open and failing to
understand the sensitivity of public sentiments about food safety.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche also found it irritating and arrogant that Coke
would not divulge its secret formula, which raised suspicions that
something may have gone awry with the syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Very early on, an advisory panel of doctors advised him that the
Coca-Cola crisis could be explained as a mass psychosomatic
reaction -- now the broadly accepted explanation -- but he was
unwilling to risk the wrath of Belgian parents by telling them that
it was all in their children's heads.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed concern about appearing soft on the American
corporate giant. ``Coca Cola is a big company, it's a symbol, it's
the United States,'' said Michel de Muelenaere, the home news
editor for the national daily Le Soir.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it soon became clear that government scientists, who tested
the beverages for 15,000 toxins, could find nothing to warrant a
continued ban. Coca-Cola provided its own explanation that the
bottles had become contaminated with sulfur-laced carbon dioxide
gas and the cans had come in contact with a fungicide on wooden
pallets. Neither substance was found in high enough levels to
explain the symptoms, adding credence for the psychosomatic theory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to the vexation of Coke executives assembled in a war room
at the company's suburban Brussels plant, Van den Bossche agreed
only to ease but not lift the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the minister feared to lose face,'' said Benoit
Nemery, a toxicologist and a member of the government's advisory
team of doctors. ``After being so radical, it would have been very

OF MOOSE AND MEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM LEFERINK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After spending parts of three days in Glacier National Park and
seeing only three deer and a couple of chipmunks, the first thing
to cross my mind was, ``Wow, a moose.''
</P>
<P>
   Next I exclaimed, ``Oh, my gosh.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Brenda, my wife, engrossed in yet another novel in the
front passenger seat of the minivan, looked up and said, ``You're
going to hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, right there at mile 57.6 of U.S. 2, approximately
20 miles southeast of Libby, Mont., on the second leg of our family
trip in June, it happened: We smashed into the right front shoulder
of a moose. I later learned the moose was ``just a baby,'' though
its head easily towered above the top of the van.
</P>
<P>
   In the rearview mirror, I watched the animal stagger into a
thicket on the side of the highway, while I maneuvered the minivan
to the side of the road just beyond a guardrail.
</P>
<P>
   Our sons, Derek, 11, and Connor, 4, were certainly distracted
from the tape they had been watching, but fortunately, none of us
was injured. I cringed, however, about the damage to the minivan.
Having spent six years living in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan
when I was a teen-ager, I have seen what a deer can do to a
vehicle, much less a moose.
</P>
<P>
   Getting out, I noticed that the left side mirror was dangling
from its support. The driver's door would open only about halfway.
</P>
<P>
   Later, an insurance adjuster would estimate the damage to the
left front fender, driver's door and the left sliding passenger
door at $2,000. The van was still running, however, and a highway
patrol officer who wrote up the accident report said, ``That's the
least amount of damage I've ever seen from a moose.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said there had been eight or nine such accidents in the
area this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Although all of this was comforting, I found myself worrying
about the condition of the moose. We were out of cell phone range
and did not know what to do after we hit it. Of course, the boys
were more than eager to go see the moose.
</P>
<P>
   A few drivers stopped or slowed down to ask about what had
happened, and finally a state highway department truck pulled up. I
walked with the driver to the spot where I saw the moose enter the
thicket. Seeing us approach, the moose tried to get up and get
away, but collapsed. I'll never forget that moose looking me square
in the eye and letting out just an awful moan. I know he's going to
haunt me.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have long,'' the highway worker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we do have to put him down?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   The highway worker's partner had radioed the Fish &AMP; Wildlife
Department, the state police and a couple of his fellow highway
workers, telling them to bring a gun.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after, a second set of highway workers showed up, but
without a weapon. It was decided that the first worker would hit
the animal over the head with a metal pipe, confident one blow
would kill it.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't watch.
</P>
<P>
   One blow did it.
</P>
<P>
   They pulled the moose to the side of the road just as the Fish
and Wildlife official pulled up.
</P>
<P>
   I had retreated to the van and told the boys I would take them
for a quick glimpse of the moose, so they could see how big it was.
As we approached, the wildlife official had just begun gutting the
animal, not a sight I particularly cared for the boys to see. So I
held them back about 10 yards while one of the highway workers
lifted the moose's head, easily two feet long from snout to the
back.
</P>
<P>
   About that time the state trooper pulled up and asked if we were
OK. One of the pleasant memories of this adventure was the concern
that everyone had for my family's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   As the trooper finished taking notes, the Fish and Wildlife
official pulled away with the moose in the back of his pickup. The
highway workers told me the moose would be taken to the local food
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The highway workers pulled away. The trooper got into his car,
looked out the window and said, ``Be careful, now.''
</P>
<P>
   How prophetic. We drove off and not five miles down the road,
two deer darted across the highway about 20 yards in front of us.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you're probably thinking that as a journalist, I must have
documented our experience with a photo or two. Unfortunately, in
all the excitement after hitting the moose, I forgot to pull out
the camera to chronicle what will be remembered as one of the most
memorable moments of this or any of our family vacations.

FENWAY: ISLAND OF CHARM IN A SEA OF MUCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Major-league baseball can't get to Fenway Park
fast enough. The All-Star Game is close and the event will look
spectacular in Boston, at the sport's most charming venue.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball needs a dose of Fenway, a reprieve from the decidedly
less charming events of recent weeks. The sport should still be
wallowing in the good will created by Misters Sosa and McGwire last
season, but most of it has already been spent.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the owners have cost overruns. They're out of charm,
and out of money for their new park, the cacophonously named Safeco
Field. After draining $340 million from the public till, the
Mariners want at least another $100 million. They're not asking
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask your kids what they'll think when we (can't) afford
Griffey or Rodriguez,'' one team executive said to a member of the
board that oversaw construction of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When this statement was reported, Ken Griffey Jr. reacted by
saying that he didn't want to be used as a pawn. Who can blame him?
He and Alex Rodriguez both have contracts that expire after next
season. They are worthy of monstrous deals, and Mariners management
is trying to pretend that their contract expectations are the only
reason that the team has to beg for public funds.
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the greedy players. That's the easy way to go. But
in Seattle, it might not work. Management botched its dealings with
Randy Johnson last year, creating a malcontented superstar who had
to be traded at a bargain price. The team already used Griffey as
extortionist bait once, to get the original ballpark funding after
the 1995 playoff run. But some franchises have no shame.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Mariners should have drafted pitcher Ben Christensen
out of Wichita State. He, too, has no shame. He was chosen by the
Cubs in the first round, about a month after he threw at a college
opponent's head. Just baseball, right, part of the game? But
Christensen wasn't a modern-day Bob Gibson or Don Drysdale,
claiming every scrap of the plate. When Christensen threw his
beanball, the other player, Evansville's Anthony Molina, was in the
on-deck circle, 30 feet away from home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Molina's vision was damaged. He was scheduled for laser surgery.
He has no idea whether he can play baseball again.
</P>
<P>
   Christensen faces a lawsuit for his actions, but the Cubs have
already tacitly condoned his behavior by taking him with the 26th
pick in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, a lot of fans in Chicago have made it clear
that they disapprove of the decision. Christensen appeared at a
news conference two weeks ago to explain himself. All he could say
was that it was an accident, even though he had already said that
his college coaches trained him to go head-hunting in exactly that
manner.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs have pleaded for the fans and the media to give
Christensen a second chance. But, as a first-round draft choice, he
seems to have lost not a single perk. Maybe he was drafted lower
than he might have been before the beaning, but the first round
looks like an unmitigated reward. If Darryl Strawberry could spend
time rehabbing his image in the Northern League, why couldn't
Christensen? And for all of Strawberry's misdeeds, he never
committed a grotesque act of violence on the field.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, even Juan Gonzalez's prima donna snit seems mild.
Peeved that he finished fifth in the All-Star voting among American
League outfielders, Gonzalez said he didn't want to be a reserve.
So Joe Torre, the AL manager, obliged by not picking him.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has been criticized for letting the fans down, which is
only partly true. After all, if the fans really wanted him to be an
All-Star, they would have voted him into the top three. Instead,
the folks in Cleveland went berserk at the ballot box and placed
all three of their starters ahead of Gonzalez, a two-time MVP who
is having another spectacular season.
</P>
<P>
   But Gonzalez protested too much. He could have bailed out
discreetly, saying simply that he wanted to rest his body, a
reasonable view. Or he could have just gone to Fenway, just to
enjoy a national spectacle in the world's greatest ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, once everyone is in Boston for the game, the old
yard's short comings will be placed prominently on display _ the
cramped aisles, the narrow seats, limited bathrooms, the woeful
dearth of luxury boxes. The Red Sox want a new park, a near-replica
of the beloved and cursed Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, they'll be telling their fans: ``If we'd had proper
luxury boxes in here 80 years ago, we might not have traded that
kid named Ruth.''

 &HT;    Copland bio long on facts, short on editing
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 11.
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not quite a decade after Aaron Copland's death comes a
definitive biography of America's most important composer. Howard
Pollack, a musicologist at the University of Houston, sets the
standard for years to come with ``Aaron Copland: The Life and Work
of an Uncommon Man.'' But as decent and thorough as it is, no one
but a dedicated musical scholar would want to wade through almost
700 pages _ 556 of which are text, and rather routine text at that.
</P>
<P>
   Copland was born in 1900, the son of Russian Jewish immigrants
(original name: Kaplan) who accepted his musical ambitions
politely; his was not the struggle of a passionate artist with a
stern and materialistic father. But there was an artistic gene
somewhere in the family pool: Copland's cousin was Harold Clurman,
the brilliant director who founded the Group Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   Once past a rather routine apprenticeship, which included three
years of study with Nadia Boulanger in Paris, Copland became one of
the few American composers to make a living from composition. He
wasn't a university teacher like Walter Piston or a
composer-performer like Philip Glass (though in later years he
became a proficient conductor) but cobbled together a living from
commissions, book reviews and essays, lectures, books based on the
lectures, teaching the occasional course or tutoring the occasional
younger composer, and various odd projects such as State Department
tours to promote American music.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his life was singularly without drama. A discreet
homosexual, Copland carried on his affairs quietly and ended them
without rancor. His sole controversial gesture seems to have been
taking a leftist political stance in the '30s. The House
Un-American Activities Committee took him to task for it during the
paranoid '50s, but Copland emerged from the inquisition with his
musical reputation intact and without betraying his friends or his
ideals.
</P>
<P>
   The biography recognizes that the events of his life are
secondary to the music he produced. It was Copland who placed
American music on the map with works including ``Appalachian
Spring,'' ``Rodeo,'' ``El Salon Mexico'' and Symphony No. 3, which
incorporates the ``Fanfare for the Common Man'' (hence the book's
title).
</P>
<P>
   Pollack sensibly weaves together a thematic and a chronological
approach. Using the biographical facts as a spine, he'll insert a
chapter on, for instance, ``Copland and His Peers,'' a
well-supported discussion of Copland's lifelong championship of
musical colleagues through avenues such as the League of Composers,
essays and concert reviews in Music &AMP; Letters magazine, the
Copland-Sessions concerts and the Berkshire Music Center in
Massachusetts, to which he brought composers from all over the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Pollack also explores such influences as jazz, Jewish religious
and secular music, Latin American music, and 12-tone and other
20th-century musical movements on the composer's work. (Copland was
a barely observant Jew, but the klezmer colorations of many pieces,
and even a shofar call or two, assert that the Old Country left its
mark.) Some of these observations are readily accessible to any
reader, some only to a music professional, but all would be helped
by a listening guide for each topic.
</P>
<P>
   Musical discussion is always intelligent but often on far too
technical a plane for the general reader. And these chapters cry
out for musical examples. This is inexcusable for a quality
publication. At one time, musical excerpts were expensive to
engrave, but now that music notation programs are available on
computer, there's no excuse for the publisher of a major musical
biography to cut corners.
</P>
<P>
   The book has many pleasures, among them the threads that weave
so many great artists into the fabric of Copland's life. The
composers range from Leonard Bernstein and Marc Blitzstein to
Israel Citkowitz, Harold Shapero, Bernard Herrmann (who composed
serious music in addition to the scores to Alfred Hitchcock's
films) and Ingolf Dahl, among others. Most are not household names,
but they wrote a lot of useful work, and it's interesting to see
how they peopled the American musical landscape from 1930 to about
1965.
</P>
<P>
   If only Pollack were a livelier writer! He manages to make even
Copland's sex life dull. The biography may be intended primarily
for scholars, but with a little effort and a better editor it could
be enjoyed by everyone.

 &HT;    The presidency and `Shadow' of Watergate
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 11.

   &QR;  Shadow: Five Presidents and the Legacy of Watergate. By Bob
Woodward. Simon &AMP; Schuster.
</P>
<P>
   On March 31, in an interview on CBS with Dan Rather, the only
president in this century to be impeached by the House of
Representatives confessed his human fallibility and said he did not
regard impeachment ``as some great badge of shame.'' The U.S.
Senate had acquitted President Clinton of the House's charges, and
now, in speaking with Rather, he seemed relieved he could put
behind him the events that had come at last to a political
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact, as Bob Woodward argues in the epilogue of his new
book, Clinton's words were directed more to the future than to past
or present. The disgraced president, Woodward writes, ``had set out
to drive his impeachment from the first paragraph of his obituary.
Somehow he would remove the shadow.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shadow,'' Woodward sets out to exhume long-dead
presidential scandals and perform a final autopsy on one that many
are eager to bury, others to keep on life support. The common
thread in all _ from Gerald Ford to Bill Clinton, with Jimmy
Carter, Ronald Reagan and George Bush in between _ is denial
accompanied by coverup, and Woodward, for one, is astonished that
American presidents do not learn from the mistakes of their
predecessors:
</P>
<P>
   ``After Watergate, I never expected another impeachment
investigation of a president in my lifetime, let alone an actual
impeachment and a Senate trial. (Richard) Nixon's successors, I
thought, would recognize the price of scandal and learn the two
fundamental lessons of Watergate. First, if there is questionable
activity, release the facts, whatever they are, as early and
completely as possible. Second, do not allow outside inquiries,
whether conducted by prosecutors, congressmen or reporters, to
harden into a permanent state of suspicion and warfare.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporting based on anonymous sources
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of all these post-mortems is the interview, whose
subject is usually anonymous. In a perceptive New Yorker article,
Nicholas Lemann, who acknowledges professional debts, writes that
Woodward's reporting technique depends on scenes presented
firsthand. ``In an omniscient voice,'' Lemann writes, ``he offers
an account of the meeting at which the deal went down as if he had
been there, though he hadn't.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but the problem in a book like ``Shadow'' is that
the degree of scandal and impropriety varies widely from president
to president. The reticence of one is not the dishonesty of
another. Ford, Woodward believes, did the right thing in granting
Nixon a pardon, but then cast himself in doubt by refusing to
disclose details of an agreement with his predecessor. Reagan lied
about Iran-Contra _ Deep Throat here is clearly former Secretary of
State George Shultz _ and then, in depositions given to independent
prosecutor Lawrence Walsh, sank into a haze of not remembering.
Woodward asks Walsh how Iran-Contra will affect Reagan's name in
history. ``I think it'll be remembered as a nonsordid disregard of
constitutional restraints,'' Walsh tells him. ``I think the
President was wrong, he was defiant, he was deliberate, but he
wasn't dirty.'' Indeed, Walsh _ by Woodward's account _ has a
grudging respect for Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of Carter's moral high ground
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's predecessor, Carter, had become president by claiming a
moral high ground lost during Watergate. But he, too, found the
footing slippery once in office. When Bert Lance, his budget
director, was accused of corruption, Carter told reporters, ``My
faith in the character and competence of Bert Lance has been
reconfirmed.'' Soon after, Carter was asking for Lance's
resignation. A claim to a higher morality, Carter acknowledged,
``helped me get elected, but it also came back to haunt me later
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter was not a president for whom Woodward has great
admiration. He may not have engaged in sex with White House interns
or conspired to violate the Constitution, but he ``regularly broke
his most basic promise when he campaigned for the presidency. He
did not always tell the truth.'' Neither did Bush, who knew more
about Iran-Contra than he admitted (``I wasn't really in the
loop'') but was never in danger of impeachment. Like the three who
preceded him, Bush wanted the truth to serve him rather than the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
   And then came Bill Clinton, ``the most self-defeating'' of
modern presidents. When an aide asked that he level with him so he
could best present his case, Clinton said, ``I get the sense you
don't believe me.'' To which the aide replied: ``Mr. President, my
job is to run the pump and the motors, not to fix the hole in the
bottom of the boat.'' It's of only incidental interest that the
aide happened to be Dick Morris, whose own raft would soon sink
when allegations of time with a prostitute were made public.
</P>
<P>
   From all of this, Woodward draws no overarching conclusions
about the presidency, only the familiar one that the office is a
smaller one than Lincoln and Roosevelt occupied. Perhaps the men
are smaller as well. But after Vietnam and Watergate, the
presidency ``has been limited and diminished. Its inner workings
and the behavior of the presidents are fully exposed.'' They've
been exposed despite the efforts of one president after another to
conceal them. They leave office, but the shadow remains.

 &HT;    MISSING FATHERS A KEY FACTOR IN 'DIGITAL DIVIDE,' STUDY SHOWS

   WASHINGTON _ To a surprising degree, daddies are the drivers
getting children onto the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   While race and income play an enormous role in determining
whether a child has access to the Internet, having a father in the
home appears to be a key factor in computer literacy, according to
a study released Thursday by the U.S. Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department's ``Falling Through the Net'' survey shows huge
numbers of Americans are buying or seeking out computers to use the
Internet for sending messages via e-mail, searching for job
information, learning new skills and more.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Internet's popularity is growing in every corner
of the country, access remains very uneven. Money, education and
location are major factors in determining who uses the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study found that a family living in an urban
area with annual income exceeding $75,000 a year is 20 times more
likely to have Internet access than a rural, low-income family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, education and income are only part of the picture. The
government study found that among families earning $15,000 to
$35,000, more than 32 percent of whites owned computers, but only
19 percent of blacks did. ``Even when holding income constant,
there is still a yawning divide among different races and
origins,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at the statistics suggests that even more than
race, family structure determines whether children get access to
the Internet, either through a computer at home or through one at a
library, school or community center.
</P>
<P>
   A white child growing up in a home with two parents is nearly
twice as likely to have access to the Internet as a white child in
a single-parent household, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The gap was even greater for African-American children. A child
in a black family is almost four times as likely to have Internet
access as a child in a single-parent black household.
</P>
<P>
   Among single-parent households, those headed by fathers used
computers far more than those headed by women. For example, the
government found that in urban households headed by a man with
children, 21.5 percent used the Internet. But among female-headed
urban households, only 15 percent used the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The families most likely to own a computer are of Asian ethnic
origin, with 55 percent having one in the home. About 47 percent of
whites own computers, but only 23.2 percent of blacks do. About
25.5 percent of Hispanic families own computers.
</P>
<P>
   _ A white child in a low-income two-parent family is three times
more likely to have Internet access as a child in a comparable
black family, and four times more likely than a Hispanic child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Regardless of income, people living in rural areas are lagging
in Internet access. At the lowest income levels, those living in
urban areas are more than twice as likely to have Internet access,
compared with those earning similar amounts in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the third in a series by the government since 1995,
did not suggest specific policies to boost Internet use except to
recommend more online access at community centers, such as schools,
libraries and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference held to release the study,
representatives of Ameritech Corp. and the National Urban League
also announced they will spend $350,000 to build five new Internet
community centers in Aurora, Ill., Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis
and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 3Com Corp. said it plans to offer $1 million in
donated equipment and training to 10 cities to help teach students
to be computer network engineers.

`AMERICAN PIE': REMEMBERING THOSE THRILLING DAYS OF LUST AND
DISGUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Which scene is the grossest? The beer scene? The pie scene? The
toilet scene? All over the country during the next few weeks,
teen-agers able to wangle their way into the R-rated comedy
``American Pie'' will be comparing notes and debating the carefully
measured jolts of a high school sex farce that knows exactly how
far to push the envelope without seriously offending anyone. Basic
bathroom humor, after all, doesn't have to worry about being
politically incorrect. That's one reason it's so popular nowadays.
</P>
<P>
   As you may recall, a similar flurry of titillating questions
followed the opening a year ago of ``There's Something About
Mary,'' with its now-infamous hair-gel scene, its zipper crisis and
its doggie-on-drugs set pieces. The runaway success of ``Mary''
suggested that you don't have to be an adolescent to appreciate
such shenanigans. For buried in the breast of every American
grown-up is a smirking 13-year-old sex fiend who used to blush and
titter when chancing upon a word like ``bosom'' in the church
hymnal. Like ``Mary,'' ``American Pie'' beckons us with a leer and
a crooked finger to revisit those thrilling days of lust and
disgust and laugh at our own pubescent body shame.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that ``American Pie'' happens to have more than twice
as many gross-out jokes as its forerunner doesn't mean that this
studiously raunchy movie, directed by Paul Weitz from a screenplay
by Adam Herz, is twice as funny. Quite the opposite. ``American
Pie,'' whose dirty jokes are inserted at regular intervals like pop
songs to perk up the action, lacks the antic levity of the Farrelly
brothers' box-office smash. There's no strolling Greek chorus
serenading the title character, and no underlying sense of the
absurd. More like an upper-middle-class ``Porky's,'' ``American
Pie'' is unable to transcend its own dirty mind. Among this year's
bumper crop of shallow teen-age movies, it is the shallowest and
the most prurient. It may well be the biggest hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' follows four boys, all high school seniors
somewhere in Michigan, who make a pact to lose their virginity by
the end of the school year. The dumbest and horniest is Jim (Jason
Biggs), a compulsive onanist who resembles a younger, more
addlebrained Adam Sandler with a roll of baby fat. Poor Jim's
experiments in self-pleasure, which include a bout with one of
Mom's freshly baked apple pies (let's not even think of the Oedipal
implications), are inevitably interrupted by the untimely intrusion
of his father (Eugene Levy), who is only too eager to lecture his
son on the birds and bees.
</P>
<P>
   Jim's quest to certify his own manhood eventually leads him to
stage an embarrassing online striptease and sex show and to ask
Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), a mousy flute-playing classmate (and
latent dominatrix), to the senior prom. On their big night Michelle
undergoes the kind of instant personality transformation that can
only happen in mindless, exploitative comedy.
</P>
<P>
   The jock of the group is Oz (Chris Klein), a handsome lumbering
star of the high school lacrosse team who shambles around with a
big grin and is in dire need of tutoring in the techniques of
seduction. Oz is so determined to score with smart, self-possessed
Heather (Mena Suvari) that he joins the high school jazz choir in
which she is a soloist, and the two become Nelson Eddy and Jeanette
MacDonald-like songbirds entwining their voices in an excruciating
version of ``How Sweet It Is.'' Klein, who suggests Keanu Reeves as
a dumb pumped-up lug, brings the same oafish charm to Oz that he
brought to his very similar role in ``Election.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the foursome are Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), a
bookish pseudo-sophisticate who spreads false rumors about his own
sexual prowess, and the earnest, college-bound Kevin (Thomas Ian
Nicholas), who spends the whole movie wheedling his steady
girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) into going all the way.
</P>
<P>
   Peripheral phonies include Stifler (Seann W. Scott), a rich,
arrogant party-giver who is far too pleased with himself to remain
unscathed, and Sherman (Chris Owen), a smug high school braggart
whose vaunted conquests sound too good to be true. Finally, we have
Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), a sexually precocious exchange student
from Eastern Europe; Jessica (Natasha Lyonne), a wisecracking
know-it-all who claims to have been ``duped'' out of her virginity,
and Stifler's mother (Jennifer Coolidge), a bleary-eyed late-90's
Mrs. Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   In parading its jokes as proudly and crassly as an oldtime
burlesque show, ``American Pie'' portrays a teen-age culture that
harks weirdly back to the 1950's. These teen-agers may have
computers and be familiar with gangsta rap, but they're as naive,
gawky and embarrassed about sex as high school students were 40
years ago. As much as they joke about sex, the issues of virginity
and old-fashioned notions of good girls versus bad really do matter
in this culture (as they also do in the recent, more sophisticated
``Cruel Intentions''). Almost without exception, these teen-agers
exhibit varying degrees of sexual performance anxiety. Even the
best-looking are visibly uncomfortable in their bodies. You can
feel the dogs of a re-surgent American Puritanism snapping at their
heels.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``American Pie'' is rated R (Under 17 requires
accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations,
some strong language and many gross-out jokes involving assorted
bodily fluids.

TWO AIR FORCE INSTRUCTORS CHARGED WITH SEXUAL MISCONDUCT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Two Air Force sergeants face a hearing next month
on charges they had sex with several female students at a Brooks
Air Force Base training center.
</P>
<P>
   Master Sgt. Mark E. Gibson and Tech. Sgt. Apolinar Paul Bernal
have been accused of having ``unprofessional relationships'' with
seven women, all of them recent basic training graduates from
Lackland Air Force Base, Maj. Erin Campbell, a spokeswoman at
Brooks, said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal, a Gulf War veteran with 17 years in the Air Force, also
reportedly gave advance copies of tests to two women with whom he
is accused of having sex, Campbell said, citing legal documents.
</P>
<P>
   Both sergeants are charged with multiple violations of the
Uniform Code of Military Justice and last year were removed from
their jobs as instructors at the U.S. Air Force School of Aerospace
Medicine at Brooks.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has been closed and no other allegations have
been made against instructors at the school, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Air Force is dedicated to providing a safe, professional
environment for its members,'' said Brig. Gen. John Jernigan,
commander of the 311th Human Systems Wing that oversees the school.
``These instructors allegedly used their authority over newly
enlisted trainees to entice them into unprofessional conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, a 15-year veteran, is accused of having sexual
relationships with two women and making sexual overtures to a third
from Oct. 1, 1996, through March 1998. He faces a maximum of 21
years in a military prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bernal is accused of having sexual relations with two women,
groping a third, and attempting to develop an unprofessional
relationship with a fourth student from January 1997 to May 21,
1998. He could get up to 17 years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Both face an Article 32 hearing, similar to a grand jury
investigation, in early August. The Air Force then will determine
if there is enough evidence to proceed with a court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said some of the women were students of the
instructors, but did not know how many. She said the trainees are
considered victims and will not be prosecuted for anything they may
have done, including possible cheating on exams.
</P>
<P>
   The women have since left the School of Aerospace Medicine for
other assignments in the Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said she did not know how the case first came to the
attention of commanders at Brooks. However, Campbell said the Air
Force's Office of Special Investigation began a probe in late May
1998. Bernal was relieved of instruction duties the next month,
while Gibson was relieved in mid-July 1998, she said.

HOME VIDEO: VIEWING PIECES OF PALESTINE; NEW RELEASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viewing Pieces Of Palestine
</P>
<P>
   Playing himself in his film ``Chronicle of a Disappearance,''
Elia Suleiman is called onto a stage in Jerusalem to explain his
less than obvious methods of moviemaking to an audience of ordinary
citizens, among whom, it is supposed, he will be shooting parts of
``Chronicle of a Disappearance.'' But as he adjusts the microphone
to speak, audio interference develops. A technician darts out to
correct the problem and withdraws. Again Suleiman begins to speak,
but again there is interference. Again the technician scrambles.
After several repetitions of this, the audience begins to lose
interest, reading, making cell phone calls and finally leaving.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders what Suleiman was going to say about his movie,
which got good reviews when it was released in 1997 and was issued
last week on videocassette by Fox Lorber. ``Theme and story are
never exactly centered,'' he said the other day from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In and out of art houses in a flash, films like this usually
present a fuller view of themselves on video. On a structural
level, ``Chronicle of a Disappearance'' is a series of vignettes,
some of them recurring. Whether acting as a suspected political
operative who draws a SWAT team to his apartment or listening to
stories of old Istanbul from Palestinian writer Paha Mohamed Ali,
Suleiman is seen throughout. But, he explained, the film is not
about him. ``It's an invitation to participate through my camera,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Nazareth in 1960, he returns to his homeland after long
periods in Europe and New York. What he finds doesn't make much
sense to him personally or politically. ``I can't tell you what is
going on,'' he said. ``I can only tell you what I see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first part of the film, set in Nazareth, a woman sits in
her sister's house and cattily rips her family apart in the
nastiest of terms. At a store by the road different pairs of men
stop their car and get out to fight each other, only to be
separated by the shopkeepers and sent on their way again.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Holyland gift shop, full of religious bric-a-brac,
two men endlessly sit and smoke as a rack of postcards turns
squeakily in the breeze. A gangster has his underlings check his
car for a bomb. On the radio, a report from Bosnia says the land is
being partitioned as all sides wear down.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, a Palestinian woman trying to rent an apartment on
the telephone is rebuffed but is complimented on how well she
disguises her accent. Later she reappears as the head of a
surveillance team that does nothing but rush around on her orders,
accomplishing nothing and finally withdrawing. Jerusalem ``is
nothing special,'' she concludes.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, these pieces suggest a question: What does any
of it matter? ``The hopelessness of the politicians and racist and
tribal notions,'' Suleiman said. As for expressing that in his
film, he added: ``Image comes first. After that I try to understand
what I saw. When it comes together, a certain attitude becomes
apparent.''

   `A Civil Action'
</P>
<P>
   A self-serving Boston lawyer, Jan Schlichtmann (John Travolta)
at first doesn't see much promise in the case of a group of
citizens whose children have been poisoned by a river. Then he
spies some sudsy water and traces it to a tannery with links to
deep-pocketed corporations. For Schlichtmann that might have
spelled a big pay day in a movie with the standard conspiracy and
environmental ramifications. Instead, Steven Zaillian's film avoids
anything that obvious in, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times,
``a finely nuanced tale of right, wrong and the gray area in
between.''

   1998. Touchstone. $107.37. 113 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.

   `Blast From the Past'
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, at the start of the Cuban missile, crisis Calvin Webber
(Christopher Walken) hustles his pregnant wife, Helen (Sissy
Spacek), into his elaborately equipped fall-out shelter. For the
next 35 years they and their son, Adam (Brendan Fraser), labor
under the impression that the superpowers have traded big ones and
they will have to remain entombed until the radioactivity subsides.
By the late '90s Helen has imbibed all the cooking sherry and Adam
would appreciate getting out of Calvin's pastel '50s underworld and
finding a woman. That he does in the person of a tough babe named
Eve (Alicia Silverstone), but ``it's mostly the fallout shelter
notion that makes for the laughs'' (Maslin). &QL;

   `Little Voice'
</P>
<P>
   Here is the unlikely story of Jane Horrocks, who gets her own
movie to showcase her astounding talent for mimicking great voices
from Judy Garland's to Marilyn Monroe's. In the film, Little Voice
(Ms. Horrocks) has a blowsy mother (Brenda Blethyn) with a low-life
talent agent for a boyfriend (Michael Caine), altogether the
perfect pair to exploit her vocal gifts to the fullest. They and
Little Voice's soulmate (Ewan McGregor) give a conventional twist
to ``the enchanting notion that beneath the mousiest exterior may
lurk a spectacular diva festival'' (Maslin). &QL;

</P>

   In another high school adventure, a standoffish intellectual
type named Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) is pursued by Zack (Freddie
Prinze Jr.), the star of the senior class. So why would that
happen? Zack, it seems, has been dumped by the school bombshell
(Jodi Lyn O'Keefe) and to retain his image makes a wager that he
can turn the geekiest girl in school into the prom queen. Behind
the plain looks and snappish disposition, of course, Laney is quite
a zinger in a comedy with ``enough glimmerings of originality and
wit to make you wish it were much bolder and funnier than it turns
out to be'' (Stephen Holden). &QL;

   Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a
theater release at one time, appeared on television or been on
videocassette in earlier editions.
</P>
<P>
   `WACO: THE RULES OF ENGAGEMENT': William Gazecki's grim
documentary methodically assails the United States government for
its siege of the Branch Davidian sect's compound in Waco, Texas,
and the assault, on April 19, 1993, that left four federal agents
and 76 sect members dead. Maintaining the detached, scholarly tone
of a courtroom inquiry, the film takes the position that the sect
acted in self-defense. Heat-sensitive infrared photography appears
to catch the government firing at the compound from tanks. ``How
persuasive is the evidence?'' Stephen Holden asked in his review in
The New York Times. ``It depends on how much you trust
technological expertise.'' 1997. New Yorker. $29.95. 135 minutes.
No rating.
</P>
<P>
   `DASH AND LILLY': A bad script undermines two strong
performances by Sam Shepard and the fiercely energetic Judy Davis
as Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman, turning their messy,
decades-long affair into something trite primarily, Caryn James
wrote in The Times, so ``the characters can float through pretty
period settings of the '30s, airily dropping names.'' 1999. A&AMP;E.
$19.95. 100 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   `THE ADVENTURES OF ICHABOD AND MR. TOAD': In a 50-year-old
animated pairing, Washington Irving's ``Legend of Sleepy Hollow,''
sung and narrated by Bing Crosby, and Kenneth Grahame's ``Wind in
the Willows,'' narrated by Basil Rathbone, are presented on the
same videocassette. Toad sells out to weasels, leading to a
conclusion that ``should even get laughs from cynics and realists
well into the age of reason,'' A.H. Weiler wrote in The Times.

`ARLINGTON ROAD': THINK AGAIN BEFORE BORROWING A CUP OF SUGAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suspect Thy Neighbor was the commandment behind some of the
best, most delectably unnerving films of the 1970s. And with its
strong echoes of paranoid classics like ``The Parallax View'' and
``Rosemary's Baby,'' the crackerjack thriller ``Arlington Road''
keeps that alarmist spirit alive.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping into fears much more contemporary than those stirred up
by old staples like witchcraft and assassination plots, the film
dares to suggest that the convivial people in khakis at the
suburban back-yard barbecue could be a lot like Rosemary's
neighbors. Only worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road,'' a major boon for anyone realizing that
there's life beyond the lead-footed summer blockbuster, stars Jeff
Bridges as Michael Faraday, a recently widowed history professor
whose specialty is domestic terrorism. This tight, ingenious second
feature directed by Mark Pellington (``Going All the Way'') and
written by first-time screenwriter Ehren Kruger begins with a
near-hallucinatory encounter, the kind that shows why not all '70s
nostalgia need be of the shagadelic variety.
</P>
<P>
   Driving home along an antiseptic suburban street, Faraday
happens upon a wounded boy. After racing to the hospital, he finds
out that the boy is his immediate neighbor on Arlington Road, a
name that deliberately resonates with thoughts of patriotism and a
national cemetery. The boy's wholesome-looking parents, Oliver and
Cheryl Lang, are effusively grateful, explaining that ``a failed
rocketry experiment'' injured their son.
</P>
<P>
   The release of ``Arlington Road'' was tactfully postponed after
the Columbine High School shootings, since this is a film in which
schoolboys play with explosives casually, and their parents do it
for real.
</P>
<P>
   The Langs, played to smiling, sinister perfection by Tim Robbins
and Joan Cusack, begin treating Faraday like a newfound best
friend. And even in a movie whose characters make a back-patting
show of bonhomie and address one another as ``neighbor,'' their
blandishments seem excessive. But Faraday seems weary and lonely,
even though he lives with a former student (played by Hope Davis,
in a film with an especially high-caliber cast). So he lets himself
grow close to the over-eager Langs.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ``Arlington Road'' starts innocently enough. But it has
delved into a terrorist network as malevolent as anything in
``American History X'' by the time it's over. Methodically building
its tension, the film watches Faraday grow suspicious about
Robbins' diabolically pleasant Lang and start wondering who Lang is
and where he came from.
</P>
<P>
   It also ponders the scheme that destroyed a government office
building like the one in Oklahoma City and considers how convenient
it is to have a disgruntled Timothy McVeigh-like individual to
blame for such an elaborate crime. In his classroom, Faraday
eloquently doubts whether knowing the names of terrorists who
supposedly acted alone should make Americans sleep any more easily.
</P>
<P>
   The film, well paced and cleverly constructed as it builds to
one last killer twist, becomes a battle of nerves between Faraday
and Lang. It also becomes a splendid showcase for two exceptionally
commanding actors as their characters square off.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from slouching hilariously through ``The Big Lebowski,''
Bridges begins by playing Faraday as a disheartened, grieving man,
then lets him spring back to life on a whiff of galvanizing
suspicion.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins plays Lang with such expert duplicity and such a wary,
glittering gaze that the character is capable of keeping endless
tricks up his figurative sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Planted loyally by his side, Ms. Cusack's squeaky-clean Cheryl
makes the blood run even colder.
</P>
<P>
   While this film's conception of a terrorist threat is apparent
early on, its strength lies in a string of ingenious little
surprises, and in an overall deviousness that doesn't show until
the story is over, unless you happen to have ``The Parallax View''
clearly in mind. If the coincidences within ``Arlington Road'' are
sometimes a shade too convenient, the material is so vividly
fleshed out that that's hard to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Alert to real underground terrorist activities like those it
depicts, ``Arlington Road'' turns a sharp eye on the disparity
between carefully colorless surfaces and murderous secrets. When it
contrasts a fiery argument between Lang and Faraday with the flat,
impersonal backdrop of a plain wooden fence and the roof next door,
it starkly illustrates the jarring dissonance that can keep an
audience on edge, or a nation stunned by seemingly inexplicable
acts of vengeful fury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' makes imaginative use of its unremarkable
settings, thanks to behind-the-scenes personnel not usually
associated with straight-arrow Americana. The score by Angelo
Badalamenti is suitably spooky; the taut editing is by Conrad Buff,
who edited the best of James Cameron's films and whose work won an
Oscar for ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bukowski's cinematography is crisp yet eerie, and Therese
DePrez, whose production-design credits include ``I Shot Andy
Warhol'' and ``Living in Oblivion,'' knows how to invest bland
settings with quiet malaise. Ms. DePrez is also the production
designer for ``Summer of Sam,'' another film worth leaving the
megahits to see.

 RIDING the BUBBLE of the INTERNET BOOM

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For a homeless shelter's annual charity auction not long ago,
Steve Jurvetson, a venture capitalist, donated a breakfast with
himself at Buck's Restaurant.
 &HT;    Buck's is a bustling diner in Woodside, Calif., a
single-intersection hamlet nestled into an oak grove at the base of
the San Mateo County foothills. The booths at Buck's are
upholstered in ocher Naugahyde and the menus have the feel of
political-action newsletters and the owners are mighty proud of
their coffeecake.
 &HT;    Buck's also happens to be the place where Netscape and many
other high-tech companies were hatched.
 &HT;    ``Breakfast at Buck's'' was sold off by way of the Internet site
Ebay at the end of February; 78 bids after the auction started, a
budding Manhattan entrepreneur named Mark Hernandez offered to pay
$4,400 for the privilege of flying out to Silicon Valley two weeks
later to present his business idea.
 &HT;    That might sound like a lot of money to have breakfast with
someone, but Jurvetson is a venture capitalist with a reputation _
young, enthusiastic, open-minded.
 &HT;    He can be found at Buck's most mornings. He bounds in like a
kangaroo, exuberant, flashing a joyous smile, his youthful face
tanned from his noon-hour games of ultimate Frisbee.
 &HT;    He is generally more dapper than his colleagues, wearing a
charcoal Czechoslovakian hand-made suit over a cobalt shirt with
faint royal blue pin-stripes. His tie picks up these colors
perfectly; the black wing tips on his large feet shine. In the
plastic window of his wallet is the bridal portrait of his wife of
eight years, Karla, who is a psychiatrist at Stanford.
 &HT;    He has a prototypical resume for a Silicon Valley VC: earned
bachelor's and master's degrees from Stanford, designed microchips
at Hewlett-Packard, learned management consulting at Bain &AMP; Co.,
returned to Stanford for his MBA and then beat out 250 other
applicants for a position at Draper Fisher, the venture firm.
 &HT;    Prototypical resume, except for the date column: As an
undergrad, he tricked the registration computer _ which blocked
signing up for more than 20 units _ by penciling in just two units
of credit on what were five-unit classes. In this way, he was able
to take eight classes at once and finish in two and a half years
with an A-plus average.
 &HT;    Think that's fast? The conventional wisdom in Silicon Valley is
that it takes three years to learn the craft. Jurvetson made
partner in six months. He was 28.
 &HT;    Venture capitalists' favorite unit of measurement is the factor
X. They live life on multiplication scale, and anything less than X
is inconsequential. When they invest, they ignore 12 percent or 15
percent or 18 percent returns. They start to take notice when they
see potential for 10X returns.
 &HT;    In this lingo, Jurvetson blasted through college at nearly 2X
the normal rate, and made partner at 6X speed. Now he's
accelerating _ straight into what could be a precarious stretch of
road.
 &HT;    Only 32, Jurvetson is in for the summer of his life, with no
fewer than 11 of the Internet-related companies he has backed (Wit
Capital, Goto.com, Tumbleweed and Netzero among them) at various
points along the road to an initial public offering.
 &HT;    The brand name he has built for himself with investments in a
couple of other successful Internet start-ups _ his firm's
specialty and the hottest destination for venture capital _ will be
put to the test. That's because the market's taste for Internet
stocks appears to have soured.
 &HT;    Dave Marquart, a Silicon Valley veteran who was the only venture
investor in Microsoft and the co-lead investor of Sun Microsystems,
warns: ``To be a bona fide venture capitalist, you have to go
through a complete cycle. Those who've entered the business since
the mid-'90s have never seen a down cycle. Everything has been to
the right and up _ very up.''
 &HT;    To understand why Jurvetson is a folk hero for so many of those
looking to convert their dreams and visions into Net wealth,
consider what happened in February 1996.
 &HT;    Sabeer Bhatia was an immigrant from India with zero experience
running a company, zero experience in consumer products and zero
experience in software. (He had been a hardware engineer at Apple.)
He was Jurvetson's age less two years, or J - 2. Bhatia had already
been turned down by 21 other venture capital firms. He had produced
no prototype, not even a graphic printed on a piece of paper.
 &HT;    What he did have was what Jurvetson called ``hallucinogenic
optimism'' and one intriguing idea, which he sketched out on a
conference room white board.
 &HT;    Jurvetson invested $300,000 to buy 15 percent of the project.
Less than two years later, the company that emerged from that
meeting, Hotmail, was sold to Microsoft for $400 million. Jurvetson
became an instant legend, the guy every young entrepreneur wants to
meet, even if it means paying 250X the cost of breakfast at Buck's.
 &HT;    Increasingly, successful venture capital firms are sheltering
themselves from the hail of unsolicited business plans by invoking
the Inverse Rule of Referrals: All good ideas come by referral, so
if it didn't come by referral it must not be a good idea.
 &HT;    Here's how a typical venture firm might catalogue the incoming
slough. Administrative staff scans the first paragraph of the cover
letter for a referral by a ``trusted third party,'' which is
entered in a database. Partners scan the database; they'll look at
the plan only if they trust the referral.
 &HT;    But Draper, Fisher, Jurvetson has cultivated a reputation for
ignoring that rule. The firm is located in Seaport, a sailing
harbor in Redwood City _ psychologically far from VC ground zero,
Sand Hill Road (but close enough to zip there in 10 minutes for a
meeting).
 &HT;    The problem with referral networks, as DFJ sees it, is that as
the venture capitalists age, so does their referral network,
cutting them off from the original thinkers. At DFJ they say they
read every one of the 5,000 plans sent to them each year. Theirs
was the first venture capital firm to run an advertisement.
 &HT;    DFJ is a ``seed'' firm, meaning it gets in on the first round of
financing for nascent businesses. ``Getting companies started is
the hardest part,'' says Tim Draper, the firm's founder, ``and it's
the most rewarding _ both financially and personally.''
 &HT;    To Jurvetson, it's even more rewarding than being an
entrepreneur. ``I get bits and pieces of several success stories,
sort of a highlight reel,'' he says.
 &HT;    Jurvetson has succeeded so far by making himself accessible to
the kind of young people who he figures come up with unusual ideas
_ as opposed to what the industry calls ``Me, Too'' product. One
recent month's ``Me, Too'' was on-line gift registries. He saw 30
business plans on that concept. The month before, it was
Web-calendar companies. He saw three Web-calendar plans out of Sun
Microsystems' employees alone.
 &HT;    Having lunch in San Francisco one day, he bumped into an old
friend who said he had left Netscape to found his dream start-up;
without much tact, Jurvetson jokingly blurted out, ``I hope it's
not another Web-calendar company!'' His friend's face fell. They
always think they're the only ones with the idea.
 &HT;    ``Truly original thinkers tend not to be entrepreneurs who've
spent 10 years at Cisco and can be trusted to know what they're
doing,'' Jurvetson explains. ``They tend to be 26 years old and
highflying. They often have a very childlike mind, with some
naivete. We're impressed by people who don't know what can't be
done.''
 &HT;    Just as the wild success of venture capital firms has made them
magnets for business plans, it has made them extremely popular with
fund investors (which tend to be pension plans, university
endowments and insurance companies). At a typical VC firm, money
under active management has gone up 40X; the number of partners to
manage that money has gone up only 4X. It's now common to raise
$350 million to $500 million every couple of years.
 &HT;    When Draper Fisher Jurvetson mailed out prospectuses for its
most recent fund, the firm received 3X the pledges it needed. The
partners drew the line at $180 million _ but even that is a huge
sum to deploy among early-stage firms, and easily the biggest fund
DFJ had ever raised.
 &HT;    VC firms have a fat incentive to raise more and more money,
because they get paid in two ways. First, when investors in a
specific fund are paid back after a set period of time has elapsed
(typically 10 years), the venture firm keeps 20 percent of all the
profits. Second is the gravy train: a 2.5 percent annual management
fee paid by investors, regardless of performance.
 &HT;    To deal with all the incoming money, most firms are ratcheting
up the size of investments, especially on secondary rounds, when a
company that has survived the seed stage needs large cash
infusions.
 &HT;    That means sticking with start-ups that have a high likelihood
of growing not just big but gargantuan, with billions of dollars in
annual sales. The Amazon of pharmacies, the Amazon of insurance,
the Amazon of auto parts _ consumer markets so big that even a
small slice of them guarantees a stellar payoff. They're not really
start-ups, they're bulk-ups. They put on weight fast and flex their
muscles and try to scare competitors off the beach.
 &HT;    But as Jurvetson sees it, something has been forgotten in this
process. Sure, it's cool to make so much money. And sure, it's cool
to be able to buy hair dye and condoms from the privacy of home.
But on-line superstores aren't creating new markets, and though
they might evolve the technology of E-commerce, they're not
revolutionizing it. They're just big Web sites. Where's the
adventure in that kind of venture?
 &HT;    Seed investing requires a special kind of hunger. Jurvetson's
parents were immigrants from Estonia, and he was reared in Dallas
by the creed that what he was to make of his life was entirely up
to him; there were no entitlements.
 &HT;    In an undergraduate psychology class, he answered a series of
Enneagram questions meant to divine his character type. He so fit
the description of a Type 3, the Performer (as in star performer),
that he was asked back in following semesters to lecture about the
traits of Type 3's: tremendous need for achievement, with an inner
drive to do something beyond the ordinary.
 &HT;    That drive is why he belongs dead center in the creation zone of
the new economy: where there's constantly a new goal to keep him
from getting bored, and where he has all of Silicon Valley as an
audience to perform for.
 &HT;    He seems very similar in character to the headstrong young
entrepreneurs he deals with, and perhaps that is partly why they
mind-meld with him so well.
 &HT;    At no time was this more clear than the day he drove across the
Dunbarton Bridge to meet Joe Chen, the CEO of a very new start-up,
See U There.com. Chen had 12 employees working in the living and
dining rooms of his Union City home. Jurvetson admits he's a sucker
for this kind of raw fertile atmosphere, and he grooved on it for a
while that day, talking to the employees and soaking up their
ambitious energy.
 &HT;    The whole point of money is that it's transferable legal tender,
that it retains its value no matter who possesses it _ your million
dollars is just as valuable as my million dollars. With venture
capital, that's not always the case.
 &HT;    Chen already had two other venture firms ready to give him the
million dollars he needed.
 &HT;    ``Literally, they are screaming at us, asking when we are going
to close the deal,'' Chen explained as we sat down at his
conference table in the garage. But he would rather have
Jurvetson's million dollars. His pitch: a plan to build an Internet
site to capture the largely untapped $60 billion market for event
planning. Jurvetson seemed inclined to invest (and two days later,
did).
 &HT;    Chen is J + 1 years old. He wanted Jurvetson's technical
fluency, but also a certain kind of cultural chemistry _ the
difference between working with someone who is just like your
father and working with someone who is just like you. As Chen puts
it, ``He's not some stiff suit walking in here.''
 &HT;    ``The hotmail story reached us even in Singapore,'' says
Eng-Siong Tan, the CEO of a start-up called Third Voice. Tan is J +
4 years old. ``It resonated and became part of the folklore of the
valley that he was willing to invest where 21 other firms had
passed. We knew Steve would be someone who gets our idea.''
 &HT;    Tan and eight other Singaporean engineers uprooted and came here
cold. They crammed into a cement-block storage warehouse in Foster
City, their front door an aluminum roll-up gate. In November, Tan
pitched Jurvetson.
 &HT;    Third Voice would make software that allows users to post
comments, viewable only by other users, directly onto the front
page of any Web site. It's the Web equivalent of empowering people
to spray-paint the State Capital. Jurvetson got it: This could do
to on-line chat what Ebay did to classified ads.
 &HT;    Internet companies are like Bazooka bubble gum. It takes a lot
of chewing and manipulation _ a tremendous amount of effort _ to
get the first bubble started. Then, with the slightest additional
effort, a mere exhale, it expands 100X. For a while it's customary
to double in size every month. That's what Tan is about to go
through. He's ready to exhale.
 &HT;    The first of Jurvetson's 11 IPO-bound companies _ Wit Capital,
an Internet investment bank _ went public early in June, right on
the heals of a disastrous week for Internet stocks. In late May,
Juno Online and Ziplink not only failed to post triple-digit
first-day returns, they both dropped below the offering price. Two
other IPOs were postponed.
 &HT;    Suddenly the center of the Internet boom seemed to a lot of
people like a scary place to be. But Wit went out and and finished
its first day up 85 percent _ a figure that would have been a
disappointment just months before, but now looked strong. And
Jurvetson sounded as chipper as ever.
 &HT;    Yes, some of the insane pops of early 1999 probably won't be
back, but Jurvetson says that only means offerings are being priced
more fairly and supply and demand are synching up. But the Internet
is the economy, he insists; businesses that still think it's just a
fad are in denial.
 &HT;    Of his IPO-bound companies, only one is considering putting off
its public offering by a quarter, he adds, and there is nothing in
his voice to suggest fear or unease about the future. That's what
the Type 3 description doesn't capture: This is a guy having time
of his life. The default setting on his face is a birthday-boy
smile.
 &HT;    And why not? ``I get to have the Steve Jobses of the next
century come to me and make their pitch. I can't define a better
recreation activity, let alone a job, that would be better than
that.''

 By HOWARD MEANS  
 FROM: Washingtonian  
 &HT;    Thirty years ago this month at 4:17 and 40 seconds p.m. Eastern
Daylight Time on the afternoon of July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11
lunar landing module Eagle touched down on the moon's bone-dry Sea
of Tranquility.
 &HT;    Seconds later, the Eagle's 38-year-old civilian commander, Neil
Armstrong, radioed back to Earth what was to become the second most
memorable broadcast from outer space:
 &HT;    ``Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.''
 &HT;    ``Roger, Tranquility,'' came the reply from the NASA mission
headquarters in Texas, ``we copy you on the ground. You've got a
bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a
lot.''
 &HT;    Six and a half hours would pass before Armstrong and Air Force
Col. Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin became the first earthlings to walk on
the moon. As he did so, Armstrong topped his earlier broadcast with
the 11 most famous words ever beamed back from the heavens:
``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
 &HT;    Above them orbited the only hope that Armstrong and Aldrin had
of returning home: the command module Columbia, piloted by Air
Force Col. Michael Collins.
 &HT;    The production values of the lunar broadcast watched that day
and night by hundreds of millions of people were terrible: grainy
black-and-white images delivered by choppy transmission to TV sets
that still weren't all that high in resolution themselves. But for
sheer drama, it was a moment almost impossible to top.
 &HT;    In the Oval Office, Richard Nixon placed a phone call that
traveled through the White House switchboard to the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, and from there to the Space Center in
Houston and via the Goldstone antenna in California to the two
astronauts posed in front of the TV camera they had planted on the
moon:
 &HT;    ``Hello, Neil and Buzz,'' the president began. ``I'm talking to
you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this
certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.''
 &HT;    NASA never tired in those days of reminding the public of all
the scientific advances already spun off from the space program:
filtering systems that could remove dust and airborne bacteria from
a command module or an operating room, sensors that were equally
adept at measuring meteorite hits on a spacecraft or muscle tremors
that might signal the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The list
went on and on.
 &HT;    As for future space conquests, the public's imagination didn't
need much stoking _ a lunar base, space labs, space wars, a landing
on Mars. Once you've gotten to the moon, what's to stop you from
going anywhere, doing anything?
 &HT;    What were more fascinating in many ways than the Apollo
program's future science or even its spinoffs were the actual
science and mechanics that went into the Apollo 11 flight. And it
was a triumphal moment for the engineers as well as for the
scientists.
 &HT;    But just in case there were any doubts, it seemed a good idea at
the time to invoke the aid of as many supernatural forces as one
could think of.
 &HT;    Then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who had contended for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1968, recalls his son's telling him that
at his Catholic elementary school all the students had been praying
as the Eagle left the command module for the lunar surface, but
nearly all of them had also kept their fingers crossed under their
desks.
 &HT;    ``I think most of us felt that way,'' McCarthy recalls.
 &HT;    In various areas of Washington, D.C., the power went out between
the Eagle's landing on the moon and the historic walk. A summer
thunderstorm had ripped through the area, sending broken limbs
crashing down on power lines.
 &HT;    Susan and Neil Sheehan hurried from their house in suburban
Wesley Heights to Neil's office at the New York Times' Washington
bureau to find a working television: ``Saw Neil Armstrong take
first step on moon!'' Susan Sheehan wrote in her dairy. ``Watched
with Neil and Max Frankel for an hour or two.''
 &HT;    Others had to catch it all on the fly. Current NASA chief
administrator Daniel Goldin was working for the TRW Space and
Technology Group in 1969. He was on his way to Harvard University
when the Eagle touched down.
 &HT;    ``I was changing planes at LaGuardia and everything came to a
halt,'' Goldin says. ``I remember there were many young people at
the airport that day _ people in uniform and people just on their
way. We watched the historic event on a black-and-white television
in the center of the lounge. For those few moments it didn't matter
what else was going on in the world. It felt great to be an
American.''
 &HT;    If the Apollo 11 mission now can be seen as a simple and pure
moment of triumph, it also has to be seen in its own time, and the
end of the 1960s was anything but simple. When and how you saw the
moon landing, and what it meant to you, had a lot to do with which
of the many conflicting realities of the day you happened to
inhabit.
 &HT;    A quick journey through the almanac of 1969 is a tour through a
tortured history. In Nigeria, the Biafran conflict and subsequent
starvation crisis became the first of a decades-long string of
highly publicized famines to sweep Africa. By mid-January more than
half a dozen planes had been hijacked to Cuba, and Cuban air maps
had become standard issue for U.S. commercial pilots.
 &HT;    The Six-Day War was over _ Arab forces had been trounced _ but
terrorism in the Middle East showed no signs of easing. In
February, the Palestine Liberation Organization was formed, under
the leadership of Yasir Arafat; less than six months later, Israeli
jets were striking Egyptian positions.
 &HT;    On March 10, 1969, James Earl Ray was sentenced to 99 years in a
Tennessee prison after he pleaded guilty to the murder of Martin
Luther King Jr., but for blacks that hardly seemed recompense. A
hundred African-American students seized the student union at
Cornell University on April 19.
 &HT;    Three months later, with Command Module Columbia still circling
the moon, Ohio Gov. James Rhodes called out the National Guard to
quell rioting in Columbus after the fatal shooting of a black man
by a white store owner. And then there was the war in Vietnam, and
the war here against the war there.
 &HT;    Alma Powell watched the walk on the moon in an Atlanta hotel
room. Beside her in bed, her husband, Colin, the future chair of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, slept like a log, having just flown in
that day from a second tour of duty in Vietnam.
 &HT;    Retired NASA scientist Homer Hickam, whose book ``Rocket Boys''
led to the wonderful movie ``October Sky,'' was just back from
Vietnam too when the Eagle set down.
 &HT;    ``I watched the landing in a Fort Lewis, Washington, barracks
television room with Army troops headed for Vietnam the next day,''
Hickam says. ``It was an eerie sensation being there with them,
giving advice on how to survive in Vietnam while we were waiting
for Neil to come down the ladder. ... I felt the irony of being
part of the greatest tragedy of the 1960s while watching one of the
century's greatest triumphs.''
 &HT;    Two years before Apollo 11 lifted off from the Kennedy Space
Center on its way to the moon, Navy pilot John McCain had been shot
down over North Vietnam and interned in the prisoner-of-war camp
known as the Hanoi Hilton.
 &HT;    McCain says he was ``overjoyed'' to learn of the moon landing
``but I didn't find out until two years later.'' McCain's source: a
speech by George McGovern broadcast through the prison camp in
which the Democratic presidential candidate said, ``The U.S. can
land a man on the moon, but it can't end the war.''
 &HT;    ``There were two different American visions colliding,'' says
Jeremy Rifkin, who today heads the Foundation on Economic Trends
and who then was coordinating the antiwar Citizens Commission of
Inquiry to investigate ``war crimes'' in Southeast Asia. ``We were
reaching beyond ourselves into outer space at the same time we were
involved in an epic struggle between generations and between
different visions of what the social contract was. The whole planet
was up for grabs.''
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, the Soviet Union, which had begun the space
race a dozen years earlier with the launch of Sputnik I, couldn't
leave the moment alone. The unmanned Soviet probe Luna 15 was in
its 27th orbit around the moon when Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins
arrived for their first orbit. Eventually Luna 15 would crash into
the moon about 500 miles from Tranquility Base.
 &HT;    For the Kennedy family, the Apollo 11 mission would have been a
double-edged sword in any event. The 1960s had begun with President
John F. Kennedy's pledge to put a man on the moon before the end of
the decade _ an audacious promise that seemed to signal a new,
audacious era.
 &HT;    Now, with only five months to spare, NASA was delivering on that
vow. But Jack Kennedy was dead, murdered five and a half years
earlier. So was brother Bobby, murdered only a little more than a
year before.
 &HT;    The political mantle of the Kennedy clan had fallen to Teddy,
the junior senator from Massachusetts, and the Washington Sunday
Star headline of July 20 speaks volumes: SPACEMEN SET TO LAND ON
MOON, the top headline reads. Just below it in slightly smaller
type is this headline: WOMAN DROWNS, KENNEDY UNINJURED.
 &HT;    For some people, Chappaquiddick Island and Tranquility Base
would be forever linked. Apollo 11 was still two days away from
Earth on July 22 when Ted and Joan Kennedy attended the funeral
service for Mary Jo Kopechne in Larksville, Pa. Photos of the event
show the senator looking broken and impossibly young.
 &HT;    For NASA too, Apollo 11 was a double-edged moment. Nothing could
have gone more perfectly, and because nothing could have, maybe
there was no topping that first manned landing on the moon.
 &HT;    NASA kept sending astronauts back to the moon _ there would be
six more flights in the Apollo series and five more landings on the
moon. But the last landing took place in December 1972, and by then
Americans were less enraptured. The deed had been done, and the
moon, for all its power in literature and the imagination, was an
undramatic place once you got there.
 &HT;    ``Even Walter Cronkite was getting bored,'' McCarthy remembers.
``He had announced at the first landing that the moon was a dead
body, which people had pretty much known at any rate. The second
time, he said it was deader than we thought. The third time, he
said it was even deader still. I guess there was nothing left to
say unless they discovered life on it.''
 &HT;    NASA's audience got tougher too. Many of those who cheered
Apollo 11 had been raised on Buck Rogers, Jules Verne, Superman and
Captain Midnight. Just behind them was a generation differently
conditioned.
 &HT;    The novelist Charles McCarry says that he and his wife, Nancy,
were ``enthralled'' by the moon landing but that their four
children, all under age 10, could not have been less interested:
``Sometime during the night I awoke and realized why: They and the
rest of their generation were the first cyborgs,'' McCarry says.
 &HT;    ``Their minds had been twinned with technology, and what was a
wonder to us was a perfectly ordinary moment for them. Having
watched television from infancy onward, they were used to having
their consciousness projected onto `Gilligan's Island' and beyond
at the flick of a switch. A trip to the moon was no different. They
required no imagination; the electromagnetic spectrum was their
constant companion.''
 &HT;    Not that NASA hasn't had its triumphs in the years since. Probes
sent to the edge of our planetary system and beyond have sent back
striking photos. The space station is a model of science and
international cooperation. Space exploration continues to spin off
high technology with far-ranging applications for life on Earth.
 &HT;    But budget pressures have squeezed the agency, and bureaucracy
seems in danger of stifling the burning curiosity that drove it in
the old days, or so many say. Goldin generally gets high marks for
his leadership, but he's leading a mature agency in a different
age.
 &HT;    Hickam says the secret to reviving the space program lies in the
rocket engine: ``NASA needs to get out of the low-earth orbit
operational business and hand it over swiftly to commercial
interests, and get on with the true exploration of space. To do
that it needs to build big new rocket drives based on fission,
fusion or anti-matter physics.
 &HT;    ``These drives are not science fiction. We can build one or more
of them in 10 years with a dedicated budget and necessary
legislative direction. Such drives will allow NASA to go out to the
moon in hours, to Mars in days. We can conquer, settle and exploit
the solar system with these machines during the next quarter
century.''
 &HT;    Maybe most important, such propulsion systems _ or whatever
other ones scientists might come up with _ would give NASA
something it hasn't had since that evening of July 20, 1969:
something, as F. Scott Fitzgerald once wrote, ``commensurate to our
capacity for wonder.''

 By HOWARD MEANS  
 FROM: Washingtonian  
 &HT;    Thirty years ago this month at 4:17 and 40 seconds p.m. Eastern
Daylight Time on the afternoon of July 20, 1969, the Apollo 11
lunar landing module Eagle touched down on the moon's bone-dry Sea
of Tranquility.
 &HT;    Seconds later, the Eagle's 38-year-old civilian commander, Neil
Armstrong, radioed back to Earth what was to become the second most
memorable broadcast from outer space:
 &HT;    ``Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed.''
 &HT;    ``Roger, Tranquility,'' came the reply from the NASA mission
headquarters in Texas, ``we copy you on the ground. You've got a
bunch of guys about to turn blue. We're breathing again. Thanks a
lot.''
 &HT;    Six and a half hours would pass before Armstrong and Air Force
Col. Edwin ``Buzz'' Aldrin became the first earthlings to walk on
the moon. As he did so, Armstrong topped his earlier broadcast with
the 11 most famous words ever beamed back from the heavens:
``That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
 &HT;    Above them orbited the only hope that Armstrong and Aldrin had
of returning home: the command module Columbia, piloted by Air
Force Col. Michael Collins.
 &HT;    The production values of the lunar broadcast watched that day
and night by hundreds of millions of people were terrible: grainy
black-and-white images delivered by choppy transmission to TV sets
that still weren't all that high in resolution themselves. But for
sheer drama, it was a moment almost impossible to top.
 &HT;    In the Oval Office, Richard Nixon placed a phone call that
traveled through the White House switchboard to the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, and from there to the Space Center in
Houston and via the Goldstone antenna in California to the two
astronauts posed in front of the TV camera they had planted on the
moon:
 &HT;    ``Hello, Neil and Buzz,'' the president began. ``I'm talking to
you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this
certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made.''
 &HT;    NASA never tired in those days of reminding the public of all
the scientific advances already spun off from the space program:
filtering systems that could remove dust and airborne bacteria from
a command module or an operating room, sensors that were equally
adept at measuring meteorite hits on a spacecraft or muscle tremors
that might signal the early stages of Parkinson's disease. The list
went on and on.
 &HT;    As for future space conquests, the public's imagination didn't
need much stoking _ a lunar base, space labs, space wars, a landing
on Mars. Once you've gotten to the moon, what's to stop you from
going anywhere, doing anything?
 &HT;    What were more fascinating in many ways than the Apollo
program's future science or even its spinoffs were the actual
science and mechanics that went into the Apollo 11 flight. And it
was a triumphal moment for the engineers as well as for the
scientists.
 &HT;    But just in case there were any doubts, it seemed a good idea at
the time to invoke the aid of as many supernatural forces as one
could think of.
 &HT;    Then-Sen. Eugene McCarthy, who had contended for the Democratic
presidential nomination in 1968, recalls his son's telling him that
at his Catholic elementary school all the students had been praying
as the Eagle left the command module for the lunar surface, but
nearly all of them had also kept their fingers crossed under their
desks.
 &HT;    ``I think most of us felt that way,'' McCarthy recalls.
 &HT;    In various areas of Washington, D.C., the power went out between
the Eagle's landing on the moon and the historic walk. A summer
thunderstorm had ripped through the area, sending broken limbs
crashing down on power lines.
 &HT;    Susan and Neil Sheehan hurried from their house in suburban
Wesley Heights to Neil's office at the New York Times' Washington
bureau to find a working television: ``Saw Neil Armstrong take
first step on moon!'' Susan Sheehan wrote in her dairy. ``Watched
with Neil and Max Frankel for an hour or two.''
 &HT;    Others had to catch it all on the fly. Current NASA chief
administrator Daniel Goldin was working for the TRW Space and
Technology Group in 1969. He was on his way to Harvard University
when the Eagle touched down.
 &HT;    ``I was changing planes at LaGuardia and everything came to a
halt,'' Goldin says. ``I remember there were many young people at
the airport that day _ people in uniform and people just on their
way. We watched the historic event on a black-and-white television
in the center of the lounge. For those few moments it didn't matter
what else was going on in the world. It felt great to be an
American.''
 &HT;    If the Apollo 11 mission now can be seen as a simple and pure
moment of triumph, it also has to be seen in its own time, and the
end of the 1960s was anything but simple. When and how you saw the
moon landing, and what it meant to you, had a lot to do with which
of the many conflicting realities of the day you happened to
inhabit.
 &HT;    A quick journey through the almanac of 1969 is a tour through a
tortured history. In Nigeria, the Biafran conflict and subsequent
starvation crisis became the first of a decades-long string of
highly publicized famines to sweep Africa. By mid-January more than
half a dozen planes had been hijacked to Cuba, and Cuban air maps
had become standard issue for U.S. commercial pilots.
 &HT;    The Six-Day War was over _ Arab forces had been trounced _ but
terrorism in the Middle East showed no signs of easing. In
February, the Palestine Liberation Organization was formed, under
the leadership of Yasir Arafat; less than six months later, Israeli
jets were striking Egyptian positions.
 &HT;    On March 10, 1969, James Earl Ray was sentenced to 99 years in a
Tennessee prison after he pleaded guilty to the murder of Martin
Luther King Jr., but for blacks that hardly seemed recompense. A
hundred African-American students seized the student union at
Cornell University on April 19.
 &HT;    Three months later, with Command Module Columbia still circling
the moon, Ohio Gov. James Rhodes called out the National Guard to
quell rioting in Columbus after the fatal shooting of a black man
by a white store owner. And then there was the war in Vietnam, and
the war here against the war there.
 &HT;    Alma Powell watched the walk on the moon in an Atlanta hotel
room. Beside her in bed, her husband, Colin, the future chair of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, slept like a log, having just flown in
that day from a second tour of duty in Vietnam.
 &HT;    Retired NASA scientist Homer Hickam, whose book ``Rocket Boys''
led to the wonderful movie ``October Sky,'' was just back from
Vietnam too when the Eagle set down.
 &HT;    ``I watched the landing in a Fort Lewis, Washington, barracks
television room with Army troops headed for Vietnam the next day,''
Hickam says. ``It was an eerie sensation being there with them,
giving advice on how to survive in Vietnam while we were waiting
for Neil to come down the ladder. ... I felt the irony of being
part of the greatest tragedy of the 1960s while watching one of the
century's greatest triumphs.''
 &HT;    Two years before Apollo 11 lifted off from the Kennedy Space
Center on its way to the moon, Navy pilot John McCain had been shot
down over North Vietnam and interned in the prisoner-of-war camp
known as the Hanoi Hilton.
 &HT;    McCain says he was ``overjoyed'' to learn of the moon landing
``but I didn't find out until two years later.'' McCain's source: a
speech by George McGovern broadcast through the prison camp in
which the Democratic presidential candidate said, ``The U.S. can
land a man on the moon, but it can't end the war.''
 &HT;    ``There were two different American visions colliding,'' says
Jeremy Rifkin, who today heads the Foundation on Economic Trends
and who then was coordinating the antiwar Citizens Commission of
Inquiry to investigate ``war crimes'' in Southeast Asia. ``We were
reaching beyond ourselves into outer space at the same time we were
involved in an epic struggle between generations and between
different visions of what the social contract was. The whole planet
was up for grabs.''

 FINDING the AMERICAN DREAM ... IN A MOTEL

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``You're getting the last room in Huntsville,'' the man at the
front desk rasped.
 &HT;    I was in the heart of a certain kind of Texas _ the kind I'd
probably only visit in pursuit of a story _ and the room was a
godsend. I thanked the man and we shook hands _ not a gesture you
often see enacted between owner and customer at the front desk of
an Econo Lodge. But he was Indian and so am I, and it was our
little way of touching base.
 &HT;    This was two years ago. As I was then new to America, I asked
him bluntly what on earth had brought him to a place like
Huntsville. My naked curiosity amused him.
 &HT;    ``Why shouldn't I be here?'' he said. Indians like him were
everywhere, especially in places like Huntsville. Go 15 miles west
and you'd find a motel run by his cousin. Ninety miles south and
there was another cousin in another motel. An uncle had a place,
too, somewhere in Georgia.
 &HT;    Wherever there was a motel in the United States, he said _ and I
mistook this assertion for hyperbole _ there were likely to be
people from India running it. The statement, I learned later, was
not all that far from the truth.
 &HT;    America's motels constitute what could be called a nonlinear
ethnic niche: A certain ethnic group becomes entrenched in a
clearly identifiable economic sector, working at jobs for which it
has no evident cultural, geographical or even racial affinity.
 &HT;    I don't mean Italians owning pizzerias, or Japanese people
running judo schools. I mean, to use an obvious example, the Korean
dominance of the deli-and-grocery sector in New York _ a city where
the Chinese run most laundries and Sri Lankans, in case you didn't
know this, run most porn-video stores. Or the Arabs in greater
Detroit, who have a stranglehold on gas stations, or the Vietnamese
who monopolize nail salons in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Farther afield, I could mention London's taxi drivers,
sharp-tongued in their big black cars, many of whom are Jews from
the city's East End; or the security guards outside New Delhi's
more affluent residences, virtually all of whom are Nepalese; or
the prostitutes in the United Arab Emirates, who are so often women
from Russia.
 &HT;    According to the latest figures from the Asian American Hotel
Owners Association (AAHOA), slightly more than 50 percent of all
motels in the United States are now owned by people of Indian
origin. Pull off any Interstate highway and look for a cheap bed
for the night and there is a better-than-even chance that the motel
you will curl up in belongs to Indians. (Looking at the broader
spectrum of all hotels of any sort in the United States - from
trendy boutique hotels in Manhattan to mom-and-pop outfits in the
boondocks _ almost 37 percent are owned by Indians.)
 &HT;    If you bear in mind that Indians constitute less than 1 percent
of America's population, the conquest of this economic niche
appears extraordinary.
 &HT;    Look a bit closer and the picture is even more arresting: about
70 percent of all Indian motel owners _ or a third of all motel
owners in America _ are called Patel, a surname that indicates they
are members of a Gujarati Hindu subcaste.
 &HT;    ``There's a thing our parents tell everyone, so don't yawn if
you've heard it already,'' says Mit Amin, an urbane 39-year-old who
owns the Beverly Hills Inn, a chic bed-and-breakfast in the
Buckhead section of Atlanta. ``In some American small towns they
think 'Patel' is an Indian word for 'motel.' Can you blame them? As
for me, I'm glad I'm called Amin. Wouldn't you want to be called
Brown if the rest of the world was called Smith?''
 &HT;    Patels and Amins, however, are not as far apart as Smiths and
Browns might be. They share the same slot in the elaborate Indian
caste structure, with its four principal castes and myriad
subcastes: They are both vaishyas, or traders, who were once
employed to calculate the tithes that were owed to medieval kings
by farmers in Gujarat, an Indian state on the Arabian Sea, where
their origins lie. Most Indians believe that these people have
commerce in their blood. And the Patels themselves seem to believe
it too.
 &HT;    ``Patels are maybe the shrewdest businesspeople in the world,''
chuckled Lata Patel, who with her husband, Pankaj (``Call me
P.J.''), runs the Budget Inn in Jasper, Ga., a mountain town of
some 3,000 mostly white inhabitants about an hour's drive from
Atlanta.
 &HT;    Lata, 44, is winsome and lively; when dressed in a formal silk
sari she must surely be the most glamorous woman in Jasper. Theirs
is a plain little motel, built in the local architectural
vernacular, with a gently sloping gray slate roof, a facade of
muted pink and a well-tended grass verge. At the time of my
midmorning visit, Lata was in slacks and a shirt, addressing a
female client as ``honey'' and buzzing about the front desk with
instructions for a dozy young cleaner.
 &HT;    This modest motel is where Lata and P.J. say they've found their
``American dream'' _ a phrase they used often, and
unselfconsciously. But why? Why did they, and thousands of other
Patels in America, seek their fortune in the lodging niche? Why not
hardware stores, pet shops, drugstores?
 &HT;    Hasmukh P. Rama, 51, is the chairman of the American Hotel and
Motel Association, the trade group representing America's $85.6
billion lodging industry. Rama is tiny, only 5 feet 3 inches tall,
and his pate is as smooth as a brand-new cricket ball. His surname
used to be Patel, but the family decided to adopt a new one
``because Patel, as you can see, is a very common name.''
 &HT;    He is the first Asian to head the 89-year-old organization, and
at a recent Indian hoteliers' convention in Atlanta he worked the
room like a politician at a rally. Rama seemed like the man who
could explain the motel-Patel phenomenon. But his answers to my
questions, it turned out, seemed more calculated to promote a
certain myth that successful hotel-owning Indians have begun to
spin for public consumption.
 &HT;    ``You must know the ancient Sanskrit phrase, `Atithi devo bhava'
_ 'The guest is God.' Hospitality is in our culture,'' he told me.
``It comes naturally to us. It is inherent in the nature of the
Indian. It is natural for us to be in the lodging sector.''
 &HT;    If that is so, I asked, how was it that hardly any of these
people ran hotels before they came to America?
 &HT;    ``It's all about opportunity and example,'' Rama replied sagely,
starting into a speech about hard work. He related how he arrived
in America in 1969 and noticed how ``our people'' were buying
motels; by 1973, he had bought one.
 &HT;    Now his company, JHM Enterprises, operates 23 hotels in six
states and one in India. Last year, his family created the Rama
Scholarship Fund for the American Dream, with a donation of
$1,000,001. (Hindus consider gifts of money ending in the numeral 1
to be especially auspicious.) The benefaction is intended to help
students from minorities go to schools for hotel management.
 &HT;    It's an inspiring tale, and Rama seems to want me to multiply it
by many thousands to explain the Indian dominance of the motel
business. But it isn't quite that simple.
 &HT;    ``If you look at an example of a domination of an economic niche
by an ethnic group,'' says Thomas Espenshade, a professor of
sociology at the Office of Population Research at Princeton
University, ``the general story is told in terms of the pioneers
and the followers. This is so whether you look at Indian motel
owners, Korean grocers, Chinese laundries.''
 &HT;    In this instance, the very earliest years are hazy. But the
first Indian motel owner in the United States is said to have been
an illegal immigrant named Kanjibhai Desai, who managed to buy the
Goldfield Hotel in downtown San Francisco in the early 1940s. By
the end of that decade, there was still only a handful of
Indian-owned motels, one of them owned by Bhulabhai Vanmalibhai
Patel _ whose grandson Pramod Patel is today a hotelier in the Bay
Area; his company's portfolio includes Holiday Inns, Ramadas and
Comfort Inns.
 &HT;    According to Pramod, his grandfather left his Gujarati village
in 1949, at the age of 29, for a better life in America. ``Only 100
Indians a year were allowed into the country in those days,''
Pramod says. ``My grandfather came, met Desai and decided to copy
him. So he leased the Auburn Hotel in downtown San Francisco that
same year.''
 &HT;    By the 1960s, Pramod estimates, there were still only 60 or 70
Indian-owned motels, mostly in California. Evolving immigration
laws helped the next wave of pioneers make their mark in the 1970s.
At the time, explains David Mumford, the president of Mumford Co.,
a hotel brokerage in Newport News, Va., ``many American motel
owners, people I call Mr. and Mrs. Jones, were aging. Motels were a
postwar thing, and by the mid-'70s a lot of the people who owned
them were of retiring age. Their kids were not interested in the
business.''
 &HT;    The concurrent global oil crisis meant people were taking fewer
driving vacations, which hurt the motel business. Property prices
were depressed. ``By the late 1970s and early 1980s, hundreds of
motels were up for sale,'' Mumford continues.
 &HT;    So why were these Indians attracted to them? I got a more
prosaic answer to that question from Vilpesh Patel, the owner of
the 85-room Flamingo Inn in Windsor, Conn. ``Technically, it's easy
to run. You don't need fluent English, just the will to work long
hours,'' he says. ``And it's a business that comes with a house _
you don't have to buy a separate house. Another important thing,''
he adds, ``is the cash flow. We like that.''
 &HT;    Vilpesh was a plain-speaker. True, the guest is God. But the
guest is also gold _ gold enough for Indian motel ownership to
spiral upward, year by year.
 &HT;    Buying a motel, even one that's in the red, usually requires a
substantial down payment, one beyond the reach of most new
immigrants. That, however, is one key to how this particular niche
was captured. The down payment was seldom a problem for a
prospective Indian purchaser, who was often able to turn to a
network of relatives and friends to help him out.
 &HT;    The story of Lata and P.J., for example, is not exactly the
hardscrabble tale associated with some immigrant groups. Following
an arranged marriage in 1976 in the Gujarati town of Nadiad, they
left for the United States, but not out of desperation or a lack of
options at home. They left behind enviable social status; their
families employed cooks, watchmen, sweepers, a chauffeur. P.J.'s
family owned a marble mine.
 &HT;    ``We had a comfortable life in India,'' he says. They simply
wanted independence _ freedom from the web of their extended
family, with its pressures to share and to conform _ and the simple
pleasure of living as a nuclear family.
 &HT;    In 1991, the Jasper motel's owner (also an Indian) offered P.J.
the place for $150,000; the couple cobbled together the $20,000
down payment from their own savings and loans from friends and
family. ``It was not hard for us to do.''
 &HT;    All of this is not to suggest that the road was an easy one. A
significant number of motel owners have come not directly from
India but from East Africa. The British brought thousands of
Indians to their colonies there in the last century to serve as
laborers and traders. They stayed on and flourished economically
after these colonies won their independence.
 &HT;    But the political and racial tensions of postcolonial Africa
made nomads of them yet again. About 70,000 were expelled from
Uganda by Gen. Idi Amin in 1972, and the majority resettled in
Britain. In time, many would move to the United States, joining an
unusual wave of well-educated Indian immigrants to this country
that had begun in the mid-1960s _ doctors, academics and
professionals _ and peaked in the late 1980s. By then, Indian
immigrants were predominantly nonprofessionals.
 &HT;    Vilpesh Patel's father, Jayantibhai, was one of those who had to
migrate against his will. He used to be a prosperous dry-goods
merchant in Lira, a town in central Uganda. In 1972, when
Jayantibhai was 32, Idi Amin ordered the confiscation of all Asian
property, stripping the owners of their Ugandan nationality.
 &HT;    After a few months in a refugee camp in Austria, where he was
separated from his wife and young children, Jayantibhai Patel ended
up working as a bus conductor in London. Things changed for the
family in 1989. Responding to the urgings of relatives, Jayantibhai
moved with his family to America. ``With some help from my
uncles,'' says his son Vilpesh, ``and with the money we had from
selling our house in London, Dad bought a motel.''
 &HT;    In the earlier days of the motel phenomenon, Indians tended
mostly to buy mom-and-pop establishments. ``They liked the
independence,'' Vilpesh Patel told me. ``We Patels, we Gujaratis,
we don't like working for other people.''
 &HT;    But there were other, less romantic factors keeping Indians out
of the franchise motel chains. According to Mit Amin, an
independent hotelier himself, ``The big brands didn't really want
us.''
 &HT;    Indeed, there was a time when Indians were the underdogs of the
lodging sector. Mike Patel, the industry-relations chairman of the
AAHOA, explains that some insurance companies thought Patels were
scam artists who bought, insured and burned down the property and
cashed in. He says that after a couple of fires in Tennessee in the
early 1980s, Indian moteliers had trouble getting insurance
coverage. The association was formed, he adds, ``in response to
that prejudice.'' It began with 160 members.
 &HT;    The first generation of Indian hotel owners, in a manner
consistent with many an emergent immigrant group, scrimped, went
without, darned old socks and never took a holiday. They did this
not merely to save money, but also because thrift is part of a
larger moral framework, one that regards all nonessential
expenditure as wasteful and unattractive.
 &HT;    It's an attitude buttressed by a puritanical aversion to frills
and frivolities, one that has its roots as much in the kind of
Hinduism that the Patels practice as in their historical tradition
as commercial perfectionists. You can hear it in Lata Patel's
description of the work that went into updating and improving her
property on the road to quadrupling its annual business.
 &HT;    Today, the AAHOA has 5,000 names on its rolls, plus seven
full-time staff members and an annual budget of $4.5 million. The
market value of properties owned by association members is $38
billion. They pay $725 million a year in property taxes and employ
800,000 people. ``The hotel establishment once didn't want to know
about us,'' chortles Amin. ``But now we are the establishment.''
 &HT;    That kind of success has, inevitably, bred resentment in some
quarters. In some parts of the rural South, white competitors have
been known to add a potent and less-than-subtle phrase to their
motel signs: ``American-Owned.''
 &HT;    Many of the Indian owners I spoke with acknowledge that they are
aware of such attitudes, but add pragmatically, as Mike Patel puts
it, they ''have learned to live with that sort of prejudice.''
 &HT;    ``It doesn't get us down,'' he insists. ``If we survived Idi
Amin, a couple of redneck motel owners aren't going to bother us
much. In any case, our motels are American-owned, too. We're
Patels, and Americans.''

 FINDING the AMERICAN DREAM ... IN A MOTEL

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ``You're getting the last room in Huntsville,'' the man at the
front desk rasped.
 &HT;    I was in the heart of a certain kind of Texas _ the kind I'd
probably only visit in pursuit of a story _ and the room was a
godsend. I thanked the man and we shook hands _ not a gesture you
often see enacted between owner and customer at the front desk of
an Econo Lodge. But he was Indian and so am I, and it was our
little way of touching base.
 &HT;    This was two years ago. As I was then new to America, I asked
him bluntly what on earth had brought him to a place like
Huntsville. My naked curiosity amused him.
 &HT;    ``Why shouldn't I be here?'' he said. Indians like him were
everywhere, especially in places like Huntsville. Go 15 miles west
and you'd find a motel run by his cousin. Ninety miles south and
there was another cousin in another motel. An uncle had a place,
too, somewhere in Georgia.
 &HT;    Wherever there was a motel in the United States, he said _ and I
mistook this assertion for hyperbole _ there were likely to be
people from India running it. The statement, I learned later, was
not all that far from the truth.
 &HT;    America's motels constitute what could be called a nonlinear
ethnic niche: A certain ethnic group becomes entrenched in a
clearly identifiable economic sector, working at jobs for which it
has no evident cultural, geographical or even racial affinity.
 &HT;    I don't mean Italians owning pizzerias, or Japanese people
running judo schools. I mean, to use an obvious example, the Korean
dominance of the deli-and-grocery sector in New York _ a city where
the Chinese run most laundries and Sri Lankans, in case you didn't
know this, run most porn-video stores. Or the Arabs in greater
Detroit, who have a stranglehold on gas stations, or the Vietnamese
who monopolize nail salons in Los Angeles.
 &HT;    Farther afield, I could mention London's taxi drivers,
sharp-tongued in their big black cars, many of whom are Jews from
the city's East End; or the security guards outside New Delhi's
more affluent residences, virtually all of whom are Nepalese; or
the prostitutes in the United Arab Emirates, who are so often women
from Russia.
 &HT;    According to the latest figures from the Asian American Hotel
Owners Association (AAHOA), slightly more than 50 percent of all
motels in the United States are now owned by people of Indian
origin. Pull off any Interstate highway and look for a cheap bed
for the night and there is a better-than-even chance that the motel
you will curl up in belongs to Indians. (Looking at the broader
spectrum of all hotels of any sort in the United States - from
trendy boutique hotels in Manhattan to mom-and-pop outfits in the
boondocks _ almost 37 percent are owned by Indians.)
 &HT;    If you bear in mind that Indians constitute less than 1 percent
of America's population, the conquest of this economic niche
appears extraordinary.
 &HT;    Look a bit closer and the picture is even more arresting: about
70 percent of all Indian motel owners _ or a third of all motel
owners in America _ are called Patel, a surname that indicates they
are members of a Gujarati Hindu subcaste.
 &HT;    ``There's a thing our parents tell everyone, so don't yawn if
you've heard it already,'' says Mit Amin, an urbane 39-year-old who
owns the Beverly Hills Inn, a chic bed-and-breakfast in the
Buckhead section of Atlanta. ``In some American small towns they
think 'Patel' is an Indian word for 'motel.' Can you blame them? As
for me, I'm glad I'm called Amin. Wouldn't you want to be called
Brown if the rest of the world was called Smith?''
 &HT;    Patels and Amins, however, are not as far apart as Smiths and
Browns might be. They share the same slot in the elaborate Indian
caste structure, with its four principal castes and myriad
subcastes: They are both vaishyas, or traders, who were once
employed to calculate the tithes that were owed to medieval kings
by farmers in Gujarat, an Indian state on the Arabian Sea, where
their origins lie. Most Indians believe that these people have
commerce in their blood. And the Patels themselves seem to believe
it too.
 &HT;    ``Patels are maybe the shrewdest businesspeople in the world,''
chuckled Lata Patel, who with her husband, Pankaj (``Call me
P.J.''), runs the Budget Inn in Jasper, Ga., a mountain town of
some 3,000 mostly white inhabitants about an hour's drive from
Atlanta.
 &HT;    Lata, 44, is winsome and lively; when dressed in a formal silk
sari she must surely be the most glamorous woman in Jasper. Theirs
is a plain little motel, built in the local architectural
vernacular, with a gently sloping gray slate roof, a facade of
muted pink and a well-tended grass verge. At the time of my
midmorning visit, Lata was in slacks and a shirt, addressing a
female client as ``honey'' and buzzing about the front desk with
instructions for a dozy young cleaner.
 &HT;    This modest motel is where Lata and P.J. say they've found their
``American dream'' _ a phrase they used often, and
unselfconsciously. But why? Why did they, and thousands of other
Patels in America, seek their fortune in the lodging niche? Why not
hardware stores, pet shops, drugstores?
 &HT;    Hasmukh P. Rama, 51, is the chairman of the American Hotel and
Motel Association, the trade group representing America's $85.6
billion lodging industry. Rama is tiny, only 5 feet 3 inches tall,
and his pate is as smooth as a brand-new cricket ball. His surname
used to be Patel, but the family decided to adopt a new one
``because Patel, as you can see, is a very common name.''
 &HT;    He is the first Asian to head the 89-year-old organization, and
at a recent Indian hoteliers' convention in Atlanta he worked the
room like a politician at a rally. Rama seemed like the man who
could explain the motel-Patel phenomenon. But his answers to my
questions, it turned out, seemed more calculated to promote a
certain myth that successful hotel-owning Indians have begun to
spin for public consumption.
 &HT;    ``You must know the ancient Sanskrit phrase, `Atithi devo bhava'
_ 'The guest is God.' Hospitality is in our culture,'' he told me.
``It comes naturally to us. It is inherent in the nature of the
Indian. It is natural for us to be in the lodging sector.''
 &HT;    If that is so, I asked, how was it that hardly any of these
people ran hotels before they came to America?
 &HT;    ``It's all about opportunity and example,'' Rama replied sagely,
starting into a speech about hard work. He related how he arrived
in America in 1969 and noticed how ``our people'' were buying
motels; by 1973, he had bought one.
 &HT;    Now his company, JHM Enterprises, operates 23 hotels in six
states and one in India. Last year, his family created the Rama
Scholarship Fund for the American Dream, with a donation of
$1,000,001. (Hindus consider gifts of money ending in the numeral 1
to be especially auspicious.) The benefaction is intended to help
students from minorities go to schools for hotel management.
 &HT;    It's an inspiring tale, and Rama seems to want me to multiply it
by many thousands to explain the Indian dominance of the motel
business. But it isn't quite that simple.
 &HT;    ``If you look at an example of a domination of an economic niche

 By PETER BOGDANOVICH  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    After Stanley Kubrick died in his sleep of a heart attack on
March 7, even the New York tabloids reported the news with an
auteur slant, headlining the director's generally bleak view of
life. Words like ``secretive,'' ``reclusive,'' ``strange,''
``mysterious'' and ``cold'' were repeatedly used to describe him.
It's true that the 13 feature-length films he made over 40 years
present a disenchanted, sardonic and generally pessimistic view of
humanity, but the lifelong friends, intimate associates and family
members I spoke to conjure a far more complicated picture of a man
who could be deeply reserved but also outgoing, meticulous and laid
back, loving and self-absorbed.
 &HT;    The precocious son of a Bronx, N.Y., doctor, Kubrick became a
staff photographer for Look magazine at 17, but from the start he
was captivated by the movies. He began as a kind of one-man band,
financing, directing, producing, writing, shooting and editing
three short documentaries _ ``Day of the Fight'' (1950), ``Flying
Padre'' (1951) and ``The Seafarers'' (1953) _ and then doing
virtually the same thing for his first two extremely low-budget
features, ``Fear and Desire'' (1953), backed entirely by an uncle,
and ``Killer's Kiss'' (1955).
 &HT;    In 1954, having already run through two marriages, Kubrick moved
to Los Angeles and formed a production company with his friend
James B. Harris, through which he made his first two professional
pictures, the film noir ``The Killing'' (1956), with Sterling
Hayden, and the powerful antiwar drama ``Paths of Glory'' (1957),
starring Kirk Douglas. While shooting ``Paths of Glory'' Kubrick
fell in love with and wed the German painter and actress Christiane
Harlan, with whom he would rear two daughters along with
Christiane's young daughter from an earlier marriage.
 &HT;    ``The Killing'' and ''Paths of Glory'' did not make money, but
they did make Kubrick's reputation as a budding genius among
critics and studio executives. In 1960, Kirk Douglas hired Kubrick
to replace another director on ``Spartacus,'' the only
all-Hollywood production Kubrick would ever make, and his first
box-office success.
 &HT;    He hated the experience. Disenchanted with the industry and
having developed a phobia about flying, the director soon afterward
moved with his family to England, never again to travel far from
home.
 &HT;    Over the next 38 years, he made only eight more films. Between
his controversial adaptation of Vladimir Nabokov's notorious
``Lolita'' (1962) and his grim but popular Vietnam war film, ``Full
Metal Jacket'' (1987), Kubrick achieved a kind of mythic status in
world cinema with three hugely successful pictures: his black
comedy of the Cold War, ``Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop
Worrying and Love the Bomb'' (1964), the mystical science-fiction
saga ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' (1968) and his ultraviolent
investigation of violence, ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971), based on
Anthony Burgess' novel.
 &HT;    (While ``Clockwork'' won the New York Film Critics Circle Award
for best picture, it was wildly criticized in England for inspiring
copycat crimes. Kubrick, wounded by the attacks, withdrew it from
circulation in the UK; to date, it is not available there even on
video.)
 &HT;    The gigantic and enduring box-office appeal and critical
enshrinement of these three films, coupled with the slimness of his
output and his distance _ physical and emotional _ from the
Hollywood mainstream, fueled a kind of legendary aura of integrity
and perfectionism that gave Kubrick enormous power in the industry
he avoided. Still, he was troubled by the fact that ``Barry
Lyndon'' (1975), his costume drama adapted from Thackeray, though
much admired in certain quarters, did not have a box-office
response commensurate with its cost.
 &HT;    His next work was his most openly commercial: ``The Shining''
(1980), based on a Stephen King horror novel and headlining a major
star, Jack Nicholson.
 &HT;    When he died, at 70, he had just completed ``Eyes Wide Shut,''
based on Arthur Schnitzler's ``Dream Story,'' a project he had been
thinking about for more than 30 years. The film, which deals
candidly with sexual relations between a contemporary New York
married couple, played by the husband-and-wife team of Tom Cruise
and Nicole Kidman, opens in the United States July 16.
 &HT;    I cannot say I knew Kubrick, though we spoke briefly on the
phone two or three times in the early '70s. He was preparing to
shoot ``Barry Lyndon'' and he called me out of the blue. His voice
sounded extremely youthful, with a subdued but definite Bronx
accent and a kind of reticence and self-effacement that was
disarming.
 &HT;    He asked what I thought about Ryan O'Neal, whom I had directed
in ``What's Up, Doc?'' Kubrick's young daughters were fans of the
movie and now were lobbying their father to cast O'Neal in ``Barry
Lyndon.'' Even in that brief exchange, Kubrick's obsessions _ film
and family _ were twinned. They would remain that way until the
end.
 -0- 
 &HT;    MATTHEW MODINE (actor; lead role in ``Full Metal Jacket''): One
day I said: ``I got a joke for you. ... You're dead.'' He said,
``It's not funny.'' I said: ``Let me tell the joke. Steven
Spielberg's dead too.'' He said, ``Steven's dead, oh, that's
funny.'' And I said: ``You're dead and you're up in heaven and
Steven Spielberg has just died and he's being greeted at the gate
by Gabriel and Gabriel says: 'God's really dug a lot of your movies
and he wants to make sure that you're comfortable. If there's
anything you need, you come to me, I'm your man.' And Steven says,
'Well, you know, I always wanted to meet Stanley Kubrick, do you
think you could arrange that?' And Gabriel looks at him and says:
'You know, Steven, of all the things that you could ask for, why
would you ask for that? You know that Stanley doesn't take
meetings.' He says, 'Well, you said that if there was anything I
wanted.' Gabriel says: 'I'm really sorry. I can't do that.' So now
he's showing him around heaven and Steven sees this guy wearing an
Army jacket with a beard riding a bicycle. And Steven says to
Gabriel: 'Oh, my God, look, over there, that's Stanley Kubrick.
Couldn't we just stop him and say hello?' And Gabriel pulls Steven
to the side and says, 'That's not Stanley Kubrick; that's God _ he
just thinks he's Stanley Kubrick.' `` Stanley liked that joke.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    RICHARD ANDERSON (actor; producer; dialogue coach and actor on
``Paths of Glory''): He had dark circles under his eyes, his hair
all over the place. Stanley was a pro at chess _ he'd sit down and
play chess on the set. He was very interested in people's motives,
people's psyches. ... One time when Kirk Douglas blew up at him on
the set, Stanley said, ``Jeez, Kirk, you don't have to do this in
front of everybody, do you?'' But he admired Kirk. He said, ``My
God, this guy always knows his lines.''
 &HT;    Stanley is very psychological to get what he wants. One time he
had done about 40 takes and Jimmy Harris (Kubrick's producing
partner on ``Paths of Glory'' and other films) comes and says,
``Stanley, it's now 1 o'clock and we're in terrible trouble and we
gotta break this up.''
 &HT;    That was the only time I saw Stanley go nuts. He shouted, ''It
isn't right _ and I'm going to keep doing it until it is right!''
He shot 84 takes. I think he wanted everybody to hear that _ he
wanted it to get around.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    TONY CURTIS (actor; co-star of ``Spartacus''): Stanley would
never capitulate. I remember he asked for 15 or 20 extras for a
little scene and the assistant director came over and said they had
talked it over (with the studio) and decided to cut down the amount
of extras. And Stanley said, ``No, we'll double the amount.'' He
refused to allow anybody to tell him how to do the picture.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SHELLEY WINTERS (actress; co-star of ``Lolita''): He was very
cognizant that actors are delicate. He would discuss the scene with
you and you never thought you were being directed until you saw the
rushes the next day. You almost said, ``Gee, wasn't I clever to
think of that?'' But it was Stanley who had sort of planted it very
subtly in your head. Like the dance I did with James Mason _ a sexy
sort of South American dance _ he didn't really tell me to make a
sexy dance. I decided to flirt with him while I was dancing in a
sexy way and he said, ``That's it.'' He was very elusive. Sometimes
you might rehearse and you didn't even know he was watching. He'd
be off somewhere, sort of hidden, watching.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KEN ADAM (production designer; designed ``Dr. Strangelove'' and
``Barry Lyndon''): I don't think I ever had such a close
relationship with a director. There was a certain naivete and charm
about him, but you very quickly found out that there was an
enormous brain functioning. I think the most difficult part was his
questioning, almost computerlike, mind. He knew most of the
technicians' work better than the technicians themselves. ...
 &HT;    He very often changed his mind. After two days of shooting, for
example, he wasn't happy with Peter Sellers playing the B-52
bomber-captain (in addition to his other roles) and he cast Slim
Pickens instead and then decided to have him ride the atomic bomb
bronco-fashion into the Russian missile complex. It was a very
exciting experience, but at the same time, I felt, you know, one
film would be enough. Being exposed to Stanley 16 hours a day, you
lost your resistance, and the danger was you would lose your
confidence.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JAMES EARL JONES (actor; small role in ``Dr. Strangelove''): His
manner was casual. Very, very laid back. Chewed gum. Cool. One day
he got pissed off at me when I didn't know my lines. I had missed a
section I was supposed to memorize. He said: ``You don't know these
words? Why don't you know these words?'' It was a quiet pissed, but
he was pissed.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JOHN MILIUS (director, screenwriter, producer): When he did
``Dr. Strangelove,'' the Air Force contacted him afterward and all
the big shots of Strategic Air Command, and General Le May, wanted
to talk to him. And he was afraid of going to see them. He was
afraid they'd be angry with him _ that they would do something to
him. I said: ``Stanley, how can you have been that paranoid? They
wanted to honor you. They loved 'Dr. Strangelove.' `` He said: ``I
know it's crazy. I wish I'd gone to Washington and seen them.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    KEIR DULLEA (actor; co-star of ``2001''): I was always aware
that he knew exactly what he wanted. He would invite (me) to have
dinner at his beautiful home. And he would invite a lot of other
people from all walks of life and different disciplines _ art
historians, authors and intellectuals. And he was as informed as
anybody about their disciplines. ... If Stanley had been an
octopus, with that many arms, he would have held his own camera,
done his own makeup, built his own sets. But I had a feeling he
wouldn't have acted in his own films.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    JAN HARLAN (producer; Kubrick's brother-in-law; production
assistant on ``A Clockwork Orange''): He felt very misunderstood
about (the violent, negative reactions to) ``Clockwork Orange,''
very insulted.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MILIUS: He was very vulnerable to criticism or to whether a
movie was a success or not. He wasn't completely comfortable with
``Barry Lyndon.'' He just felt that people didn't understand it.
People were bored by it. I think after that picture he felt no one
was going to let him make a film again. Apparently the only thing
that really bothered him a great deal was that ''Barry Lyndon''
failed commercially. He made ``The Shining'' after that. Nicholson,
I remember, at the time said: ``I'm glad to be off that one. That
was rough duty.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHRISTIANE KUBRICK: People always think he was this idiotic
dictator. He was always asking everyone's opinion on most things.
What do you think of this? What do you think of that? Do you think
I should have done this different? He spread his palette of ideas
for everyone to have a pick at, and would dismiss you brutally if
he thought that what you said was really irritating.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LEE ERMEY (Vietnam Marine Corps veteran; technical adviser,
script consultant, actor on ``Full Metal Jacket''): Stanley told me
he didn't understand actors. He had no actor friends _ they were
basically working associates, and he thought they were a little bit
strange, totally spoiled and in most cases had to be begged to give
him a decent performance. Half the time the actor would argue with
him.
 &HT;    Vince D'Onofrio didn't like Stanley's ``craziness look.'' He
wanted to try it some other way. The problem with Vince was this
was his first film, and he's telling Stanley Kubrick how he thinks
this look should be. They stand there arguing. Stanley finally
said, ``Look, do it my way and we'll load back up and we'll shoot
it your way.'' Well, when they shot it Vince's way they didn't have
any film in the camera.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    MODINE: I once asked him why he so often did a lot of takes. He
said it was because actors didn't know their lines. And he talked
about Jack Nicholson: ``Jack would come in during the blocking and
he kind of fumbled through the lines. He'd be learning them while
he was there. And then you'd start shooting and after take 3 or
take 4 or take 5 you'd get the Jack Nicholson that everybody knows
and most directors would be happy with. And then you'd go up to 10
or 15 and he'd be really awful and then he'd start to understand
what the lines were, what the lines meant, and then he'd become
unconscious about what he was saying. So by take 30 or take 40 the
lines became something else.'' Stanley'd say: ``I don't know how to
do it. People don't do their homework, the only thing I can do is
spend time doing multiple takes while the people are learning what
their job is supposed to be.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHRISTIANE KUBRICK: He thought it was boring away from home. He
liked all his stuff around him, all his telephones and televisions
and fax machines. Also, we have a zoo. We have a lot of animals and
he liked those and he liked the children and later the
grandchildren. He liked being at home. But not like a hermit _ he
had lots of friends _ they just weren't in the film business. He
talked to everyone _ he just didn't talk to the press.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    SYDNEY POLLACK (director, producer, actor; phone relationship
with Kubrick since early '70s; featured role in ``Eyes Wide
Shut''): My initial take on my part (in ``Eyes Wide Shut'') was
very different from what Stanley wanted. I came in with the idea of
being tougher with the character of Tom (Cruise) because he had
done something that I disapproved of strongly. And then Stanley had
an idea of my wanting to manipulate him more and therefore be
kinder, and he was very specific about how to communicate that. He
knew I was another director - he didn't have to beat around the
bush. He wasn't trying to work any psychological tricks with me.
And he was crazy about both Tom and Nicole.
 &HT;    I always think of Stanley literally on the edge of a smile. His
eyes always had mischief in them. He always had this sense of the
devil in him while he was very calmly asking questions. He read
everything, and knew absolutely all aspects of the business,
including literally what the box-office receipts of every theater
in the world were over the past few years. ...
 &HT;    Cruise woke me up on Thursday morning to tell me how great he
thought the picture was. I called Stanley and we talked for an hour
and a half or so and I told him how thrilled Tom was. Then I spoke
with Terry and Bob (Daly, co-chairman of Warner Brothers) and they
were absolutely ecstatic, and four days later he died.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    STEVE SOUTHGATE: ....... Two days before he died, he sent me
over to Las Vegas with the first trailer of ``Eyes Wide Shut'' for
the Sho West convention. As it was the first time ever that anyone
was going to see anything from the movie, he wanted to make sure
that the projection was perfect. He gave me specific instructions:
We had to clear the room at 3 o'clock in the morning, make sure
everybody was gone and just the projectionist and I rehearsed it.
The last conversation I had was: ``I trust you to go and do this in
Vegas. Let me know how everybody reacts. Ring me during the
screening _ take your mobile phone _ I want to hear what the
reaction is.'' And while I was on the plane, he died.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CHRISTIANE KUBRICK: I thought he was awfully tired, and he never
slept much _ ever _ in his whole life. Then I thought he was really
overdoing it with this last film. Sleeping less and less. He also
was a doctor's son and he wouldn't see a doctor. He gave himself
his own medicine if he wasn't feeling well or he would phone
friends _ it was the one thing he did that I thought was really
stupid.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    POLLACK: People say he had these phobias, he wouldn't go here
and wouldn't go there. The truth is he lived in a paradise _ there
wasn't any reason for him to go anywhere. It was a kind of a
heaven.

 By NORIMITSU ONISHI  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The delta region of southern Nigeria, where the mighty Niger
River drains into the Atlantic Ocean, includes some of the most
inhospitable territory on earth.
 &HT;    It's the world's largest mangrove swamp, 14,000 square miles of
thickets, channels and lagoons all but impenetrable to any but the
most practiced eye. It's also oil country, dotted with wells and
flow stations, where about 2 million barrels of crude are collected
each day and piped to central stations for transport abroad.
 &HT;    Helicopter is the preferred mode of transport, for the lucky few
who can afford it. One of those is Leonard Hutto, the
superintendent of Chevron's operations in the eastern Niger Delta,
and on this day it was his chopper that hovered tentatively above
one of Chevron's 30-odd oil stations in the area.
 &HT;    The landing pad, a few hundred feet below, was thronged with
hundreds of angry young Nigerians peering up at the midmorning sky,
clearly shouting and shaking their fists. Seeing that they did not
have guns, Hutto finally told the pilot to land.
 &HT;    At the same moment, down on the flow station, standing atop a
table inside a tiny office, surrounded by dozens of young men
brandishing machetes, Hutto's Nigerian assistant, Tony Okoaye, was
relieved to hear the helicopter's engine drown out the shouts of
his captors.
 &HT;    To hear Okoaye tell it, a predawn phone call had jerked him out
of bed: 400 villagers had invaded the site, carrying with them a
long list of demands. By 7 a.m., Okoaye had driven to the station,
only to be taken hostage. Okoaye, an American-educated engineer
normally prone to fits of delirious laughter, was not laughing.
 &HT;    The young men, many drunk or high on marijuana, made him stand
on the table for hours, slapping his pudgy frame and jabbing
forefingers into the soft belly above his Tommy Hilfiger jeans.
``Ah, hah!'' they taunted. ``You're a big man!''
 &HT;    They ordered him to shut down the oil wells. Okoaye did so,
reluctantly. ''You don't want to lose one barrel.'' Then they
demanded to see his boss, Hutto. ``We want to see the white man,''
they told him. ``The American.''
 &HT;    And so after a half-hour helicopter ride from Chevron's eastern
headquarters in the city of Port Harcourt, the American oilman from
south Texas had arrived. ``What a pain,'' Hutto remembers thinking,
as his chopper descended from the sky and the Nigerians scattered.
 &HT;    What came next would nonplus the most seasoned executive at a
Fortune 500 company, but to the oilman it was Kabuki. After the
youths agreed to let him call a police escort, Hutto got into a
Toyota pickup and drove a few miles to the village.
 &HT;    There, in the shade of a huge tree, he sat on a folding chair
through the afternoon, listening to the community's grievances and
demands: more scholarships for its youngsters and more regular
meetings with Chevron, which the locals would get, and other
demands, which they would not, including 25 jobs on the spot, about
$27,000 in cash and an unspecified amount for the wages they had
lost while busy invading the oil station.
 &HT;    Hutto instead slipped $50 to the town chiefs for drinks, $20 to
the youths and another $20 to a group of young men who had let the
air out of the tires of the Toyota _ to reinflate them.
 &HT;    His assistant was released, the valves were opened at the oil
wells and crude began coursing through the pipelines to the flow
station. A few thousand barrels had been lost. ``Not a big deal,''
Hutto says.
 &HT;    Routine, in fact, in the Niger Delta, where men usually focused
on finding and extracting hydrocarbons are forced to act as
politicians, diplomats and mediators. These are roles that Western
oilmen are increasingly playing as they seek crude in war-ravaged
and lawless places such as Angola and Congo, nations in name alone.
 &HT;    Hutto spent 12 years in Congo, the former Zaire, where frequent
crises forced him to sleep on an offshore oil platform, a fortress
in the Atlantic Ocean several miles from a land of chaos. The Niger
Delta is not just physically inhospitable. It is also the most
combustible oil-rich corner on the planet _ simply the most
difficult and dangerous assignment for an oilman.
 &HT;    In Hutto's office, a framed black-and-white photograph on the
wall is a constant reminder of the price of peacekeeping in the
delta. It shows Hutto standing next to some chiefs in Kula at the
dedication of a $125,000 town-hall center built by Chevron.
 &HT;    The photograph was taken a year ago, soon after Hutto arrived in
Nigeria, just in time to see the death of Gen. Sani Abacha unleash
a bewildering series of events that culminated in the installation
of a new civilian government in May.
 &HT;    In the past year, the troubles in the Niger Delta have become
more evident. Its boldest residents, whose anger had been contained
by Abacha's fiercely repressive dictatorship, have invaded oil
stations, kidnapped workers and committed sabotage against
pipelines.
 &HT;    Last fall, the unrest slashed Nigeria's daily oil production by
a third. The revolt, deadlier, more widespread and better organized
than the isolated protests of previous years, led many in Nigeria
to talk of a coming civil war.
 &HT;    All of which has transformed the simple task of pumping crude
into a strange exercise in diplomacy, civics and bluff, less the
oil business than an exercise in velvet-gloved imperialism. The
Western oil companies find themselves in the peculiar position of
providing services usually met by government _ supplying
electricity and water, building roads, bridges, schools and
hospitals. Mostly, they have done this to stop rising public
discontent from making it impossible for them to pump oil.
 &HT;    The unrest is rooted in four decades of gross state neglect.
Successive military regimes dominated by Muslim northerners have
kept the Niger Delta and its 7 million people severely undeveloped,
while enforcing few, if any, environmental standards.
 &HT;    ``Our responsibility, our duty, our obligation is to redress the
neglect of the past,'' Nigeria's newly elected president, Olusegun
Obasanjo, said during a visit this month to the delta. This was
after a new wave of violence swept the area the day after his
inauguration, leaving scores of Nigerians dead. ''But please,
please, give us the opportunity. Give us time.''
 &HT;    For now, while the roads in the rest of the country may be bad,
they are virtually nonexistent here. The state-owned power utility
lines do not reach here. Not only has little of the estimated $275
billion the country has earned from oil since the mid-1970s been
spent here, but $50 billion of it has just disappeared overseas,
according to a U.S. official in Nigeria.
 &HT;    In Port Harcourt, Chevron's offices are in a walled-off compound
of white one-story buildings. The chiefs drop by, one after the
other, every day Hutto is here. Overall, he says, he now spends at
least 60 percent of his time on community relations. Damian Obiagu,
a chief in a town called Izombe, has been pressing Hutto to make a
Chevron contractor hire local youths as casuals. In all likelihood,
ghost workers will be hired.
 &HT;    ``They don't show up for work,'' Hutto explains. ``You don't
want them to. You don't want a person on a jack-up barge or
drilling rig who doesn't know anything about safety.''
 &HT;    But the ghost workers serve an important purpose. They allow the
chief to claim he has won jobs for his people and the oil company
to say it has hired from the community. The fiction is necessary
because it is virtually impossible to find qualified oil workers
among the delta residents.
 &HT;    At one of the wells, Chevron awarded Obiagu a contract to
provide ``security.'' But one day, displeased, the chief's men
invaded the well. ``No, no, Damian, you don't understand,'' Hutto
recalls telling the chief. ``You're our security contractor, to
protect us. You're not looking to threaten us. 'Oh! oh!' he said.
He's a nice old man.''
 &HT;    Since taking over Gulf Oil in 1984, Chevron has pumped many
billions of dollars' worth of oil in Nigeria, 418,000 barrels a day
in 1998. In 1998, Chevron Corp.'s total worldwide revenues amounted
to $30.6 billion; Nigeria's gross national product was estimated by
the World Bank to be $30.7 billion in 1997. Nigeria's GNP, while a
pittance alongside the West's economies, is one of Africa's
biggest.
 &HT;    Kingdom Dateme, the king of a town called Idama, has been
pushing for a bigger personal contract, Hutto tells Okoaye. ``He
wants a contract so that he can get a big house now,'' Hutto says.
 &HT;    ``In his village?'' Okoaye asks.
 &HT;    ``No, here.'
 &HT;    ``Here in PH?'' Okoaye laughs, adding, ``That guy, he's
something else, eh?''
 &HT;    ``He's looking for a half-million, million Naira contract,''
Hutto says, the equivalent of $5,000 to $10,000. ``With those he
can buy his own big house here.''
 &HT;    Okoaye laughs uproariously, before adding with some finality,
``He's a pig.'' Then softening up a bit, Okoaye asks his boss:
``But he doesn't really make trouble for you. He doesn't really
bother you, does he? He's just greedy.''
 &HT;    ``Well,'' Hutto says, ``they're all greedy.''
 &HT;    After work, Hutto drives home in his white Toyota Landcruiser
through Port Harcourt's ``go slows,'' or traffic jams. Boys hawking
everything from toilet paper to power tools dart to his side with
cries of ``Master!'' A Nigerian policeman, gripping a tear-gas
rifle in his hands, rides shotgun. More policemen guard Hutto's
villa, a two-story white house.
 &HT;    Never married, Hutto lives alone, not counting the houseboy in
the backyard bungalow. Inside a large freezer, he keeps the 50 New
York sirloin and T-bone steaks that he brought back from his last
visit to the United States and has been cooking, at the rate of one
a week, on a grill that he keeps in his living room.
 &HT;    A year ago Hutto accepted the assignment in Port Harcourt, a
position the company considers difficult to fill because there is
no rotation schedule, no other Americans and constant interaction
with Chevron's delta neighbors. In Lagos, the Americans live inside
headquarters, a sprawling campus surrounded by high walls, a
surreal replica of America with wide streets and suburban houses
straight out of Westchester County. Here, Hutto is alone.
 &HT;    And to the thousands in the delta, Leonard Hutto is Chevron Oil.
For years, the oil companies ignored the squalid conditions in the
delta, content to pump oil and get their profits out. But,
particularly after 1995, they were forced to change their approach.
 &HT;    General Abacha's regime hanged the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa after he
demanded reparations for his Ogoni people, who remained
impoverished despite the long presence of Royal Dutch/Shell in
their region. Nigeria became an international pariah. Shell, the
biggest producer in the country, suffered a public-relations black
eye and began a review of its relations with its host communities.
The other companies increased their community contributions.
 &HT;    But violence has risen and taken on different forms. The
deadliest has been fighting among the delta's ethnic groups,
competing against one another for jobs or claims to oil-rich areas.
The Nigerian military has also engaged in battles with rioters, and
the oil companies have been criticized for their coziness with the
military.
 &HT;    A recent report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch says
the oil companies have looked away whenever the military has
brutalized or killed protesters. In Chevron's case, Human Rights
Watch says that twice in the last year the military used Chevron
boats and helicopters to crack down on protesters. Four villagers
were killed in one incident, according to the organization.
 &HT;    Like the other oil companies, Chevron argues that its hands are
tied in these situations. The companies are minority partners in
joint ventures with the government and say they cannot refuse any
requests by the military to use equipment leased by the joint
venture.
 &HT;    What's more, the companies point out, their workers have often
been hurt. In December, six of Chevron's Nigerian employees were
kidnapped and are presumed dead.
 &HT;    In Kula, about a year ago, 25 youths were jailed after invading
a Chevron oil rig. Shell, which has three stations and an extremely
strained relationship with Kula, experienced an average of two
shutdowns per month last year. In May, 50 young men invaded a Shell
station and closed it for five days, for a loss of 134,050 barrels
of oil, worth about $2.4 million.
 &HT;    Meanwhile, one wonders whether President Obasanjo's pleas for
time and another chance will be heeded. Will he push through
policies to reform the entrenched system of corruption and
pay-offs? Or will the angriest people of the delta grow ever more
angry? And will they be emboldened _ now that civilians, not
soldiers, rule the country _ to create more disorder?
 &HT;    At the office in Port Harcourt, Hutto and Okoaye are standing
outside under the canopy on one rainy day, and Hutto's voice is
raspy, sore from several days of negotiating for the release of an
American worker _ ``a big guy from Alabama.''
 &HT;    It seems he took his boat up a canal near the oil station in
Kula to check on a well when half a dozen young men jumped him. The
worker spent nine days in the mangrove swamp with his captors
pointing guns at his head. After a $25,000 ransom is paid, the
Alabama man is released.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how we'll operate,'' Okoaye says, worried that
such incidents will rise under the new civilian government. ``I
don't know, because security is going to be a big problem.'' Hutto
rubs his forefinger and thumb together.
 &HT;    ``Sometimes it doesn't go far enough, money alone,'' Okoaye
says.
 &HT;    ``Yeah, spend more money?''
 &HT;    ``Spend more money.''
 &HT;    ``Keep them quiet? Make them happy?''
 &HT;    ``Yup.''

 By NORIMITSU ONISHI  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    The delta region of southern Nigeria, where the mighty Niger
River drains into the Atlantic Ocean, includes some of the most
inhospitable territory on earth.
 &HT;    It's the world's largest mangrove swamp, 14,000 square miles of
thickets, channels and lagoons all but impenetrable to any but the
most practiced eye. It's also oil country, dotted with wells and
flow stations, where about 2 million barrels of crude are collected
each day and piped to central stations for transport abroad.
 &HT;    Helicopter is the preferred mode of transport, for the lucky few
who can afford it. One of those is Leonard Hutto, the
superintendent of Chevron's operations in the eastern Niger Delta,
and on this day it was his chopper that hovered tentatively above
one of Chevron's 30-odd oil stations in the area.
 &HT;    The landing pad, a few hundred feet below, was thronged with
hundreds of angry young Nigerians peering up at the midmorning sky,
clearly shouting and shaking their fists. Seeing that they did not
have guns, Hutto finally told the pilot to land.
 &HT;    At the same moment, down on the flow station, standing atop a
table inside a tiny office, surrounded by dozens of young men
brandishing machetes, Hutto's Nigerian assistant, Tony Okoaye, was
relieved to hear the helicopter's engine drown out the shouts of
his captors.
 &HT;    To hear Okoaye tell it, a predawn phone call had jerked him out
of bed: 400 villagers had invaded the site, carrying with them a
long list of demands. By 7 a.m., Okoaye had driven to the station,
only to be taken hostage. Okoaye, an American-educated engineer
normally prone to fits of delirious laughter, was not laughing.
 &HT;    The young men, many drunk or high on marijuana, made him stand
on the table for hours, slapping his pudgy frame and jabbing
forefingers into the soft belly above his Tommy Hilfiger jeans.
``Ah, hah!'' they taunted. ``You're a big man!''
 &HT;    They ordered him to shut down the oil wells. Okoaye did so,
reluctantly. ''You don't want to lose one barrel.'' Then they
demanded to see his boss, Hutto. ``We want to see the white man,''
they told him. ``The American.''
 &HT;    And so after a half-hour helicopter ride from Chevron's eastern
headquarters in the city of Port Harcourt, the American oilman from
south Texas had arrived. ``What a pain,'' Hutto remembers thinking,
as his chopper descended from the sky and the Nigerians scattered.
 &HT;    What came next would nonplus the most seasoned executive at a
Fortune 500 company, but to the oilman it was Kabuki. After the
youths agreed to let him call a police escort, Hutto got into a
Toyota pickup and drove a few miles to the village.
 &HT;    There, in the shade of a huge tree, he sat on a folding chair
through the afternoon, listening to the community's grievances and
demands: more scholarships for its youngsters and more regular
meetings with Chevron, which the locals would get, and other
demands, which they would not, including 25 jobs on the spot, about
$27,000 in cash and an unspecified amount for the wages they had
lost while busy invading the oil station.
 &HT;    Hutto instead slipped $50 to the town chiefs for drinks, $20 to
the youths and another $20 to a group of young men who had let the
air out of the tires of the Toyota _ to reinflate them.
 &HT;    His assistant was released, the valves were opened at the oil
wells and crude began coursing through the pipelines to the flow
station. A few thousand barrels had been lost. ``Not a big deal,''
Hutto says.
 &HT;    Routine, in fact, in the Niger Delta, where men usually focused
on finding and extracting hydrocarbons are forced to act as
politicians, diplomats and mediators. These are roles that Western
oilmen are increasingly playing as they seek crude in war-ravaged
and lawless places such as Angola and Congo, nations in name alone.
 &HT;    Hutto spent 12 years in Congo, the former Zaire, where frequent
crises forced him to sleep on an offshore oil platform, a fortress
in the Atlantic Ocean several miles from a land of chaos. The Niger
Delta is not just physically inhospitable. It is also the most
combustible oil-rich corner on the planet _ simply the most
difficult and dangerous assignment for an oilman.
 &HT;    In Hutto's office, a framed black-and-white photograph on the
wall is a constant reminder of the price of peacekeeping in the
delta. It shows Hutto standing next to some chiefs in Kula at the
dedication of a $125,000 town-hall center built by Chevron.
 &HT;    The photograph was taken a year ago, soon after Hutto arrived in
Nigeria, just in time to see the death of Gen. Sani Abacha unleash
a bewildering series of events that culminated in the installation
of a new civilian government in May.
 &HT;    In the past year, the troubles in the Niger Delta have become
more evident. Its boldest residents, whose anger had been contained
by Abacha's fiercely repressive dictatorship, have invaded oil
stations, kidnapped workers and committed sabotage against
pipelines.
 &HT;    Last fall, the unrest slashed Nigeria's daily oil production by
a third. The revolt, deadlier, more widespread and better organized
than the isolated protests of previous years, led many in Nigeria
to talk of a coming civil war.
 &HT;    All of which has transformed the simple task of pumping crude
into a strange exercise in diplomacy, civics and bluff, less the
oil business than an exercise in velvet-gloved imperialism. The
Western oil companies find themselves in the peculiar position of
providing services usually met by government _ supplying
electricity and water, building roads, bridges, schools and
hospitals. Mostly, they have done this to stop rising public
discontent from making it impossible for them to pump oil.
 &HT;    The unrest is rooted in four decades of gross state neglect.
Successive military regimes dominated by Muslim northerners have
kept the Niger Delta and its 7 million people severely undeveloped,
while enforcing few, if any, environmental standards.
 &HT;    ``Our responsibility, our duty, our obligation is to redress the
neglect of the past,'' Nigeria's newly elected president, Olusegun
Obasanjo, said during a visit this month to the delta. This was
after a new wave of violence swept the area the day after his
inauguration, leaving scores of Nigerians dead. ''But please,
please, give us the opportunity. Give us time.''
 &HT;    For now, while the roads in the rest of the country may be bad,
they are virtually nonexistent here. The state-owned power utility
lines do not reach here. Not only has little of the estimated $275
billion the country has earned from oil since the mid-1970s been
spent here, but $50 billion of it has just disappeared overseas,
according to a U.S. official in Nigeria.
 &HT;    In Port Harcourt, Chevron's offices are in a walled-off compound
of white one-story buildings. The chiefs drop by, one after the
other, every day Hutto is here. Overall, he says, he now spends at
least 60 percent of his time on community relations. Damian Obiagu,
a chief in a town called Izombe, has been pressing Hutto to make a
Chevron contractor hire local youths as casuals. In all likelihood,
ghost workers will be hired.
 &HT;    ``They don't show up for work,'' Hutto explains. ``You don't
want them to. You don't want a person on a jack-up barge or
drilling rig who doesn't know anything about safety.''
 &HT;    But the ghost workers serve an important purpose. They allow the
chief to claim he has won jobs for his people and the oil company
to say it has hired from the community. The fiction is necessary
because it is virtually impossible to find qualified oil workers
among the delta residents.
 &HT;    At one of the wells, Chevron awarded Obiagu a contract to
provide ``security.'' But one day, displeased, the chief's men
invaded the well. ``No, no, Damian, you don't understand,'' Hutto
recalls telling the chief. ``You're our security contractor, to
protect us. You're not looking to threaten us. 'Oh! oh!' he said.
He's a nice old man.''
 &HT;    Since taking over Gulf Oil in 1984, Chevron has pumped many
billions of dollars' worth of oil in Nigeria, 418,000 barrels a day
in 1998. In 1998, Chevron Corp.'s total worldwide revenues amounted
to $30.6 billion; Nigeria's gross national product was estimated by
the World Bank to be $30.7 billion in 1997. Nigeria's GNP, while a
pittance alongside the West's economies, is one of Africa's
biggest.
 &HT;    Kingdom Dateme, the king of a town called Idama, has been
pushing for a bigger personal contract, Hutto tells Okoaye. ``He
wants a contract so that he can get a big house now,'' Hutto says.
 &HT;    ``In his village?'' Okoaye asks.
 &HT;    ``No, here.'
 &HT;    ``Here in PH?'' Okoaye laughs, adding, ``That guy, he's
something else, eh?''
 &HT;    ``He's looking for a half-million, million Naira contract,''
Hutto says, the equivalent of $5,000 to $10,000. ``With those he
can buy his own big house here.''
 &HT;    Okoaye laughs uproariously, before adding with some finality,
``He's a pig.'' Then softening up a bit, Okoaye asks his boss:
``But he doesn't really make trouble for you. He doesn't really
bother you, does he? He's just greedy.''
 &HT;    ``Well,'' Hutto says, ``they're all greedy.''
 &HT;    After work, Hutto drives home in his white Toyota Landcruiser
through Port Harcourt's ``go slows,'' or traffic jams. Boys hawking
everything from toilet paper to power tools dart to his side with
cries of ``Master!'' A Nigerian policeman, gripping a tear-gas
rifle in his hands, rides shotgun. More policemen guard Hutto's
villa, a two-story white house.
 &HT;    Never married, Hutto lives alone, not counting the houseboy in
the backyard bungalow. Inside a large freezer, he keeps the 50 New
York sirloin and T-bone steaks that he brought back from his last
visit to the United States and has been cooking, at the rate of one
a week, on a grill that he keeps in his living room.
 &HT;    A year ago Hutto accepted the assignment in Port Harcourt, a
position the company considers difficult to fill because there is
no rotation schedule, no other Americans and constant interaction
with Chevron's delta neighbors. In Lagos, the Americans live inside
headquarters, a sprawling campus surrounded by high walls, a
surreal replica of America with wide streets and suburban houses
straight out of Westchester County. Here, Hutto is alone.
 &HT;    And to the thousands in the delta, Leonard Hutto is Chevron Oil.
For years, the oil companies ignored the squalid conditions in the
delta, content to pump oil and get their profits out. But,
particularly after 1995, they were forced to change their approach.
 &HT;    General Abacha's regime hanged the writer Ken Saro-Wiwa after he
demanded reparations for his Ogoni people, who remained
impoverished despite the long presence of Royal Dutch/Shell in
their region. Nigeria became an international pariah. Shell, the
biggest producer in the country, suffered a public-relations black
eye and began a review of its relations with its host communities.
The other companies increased their community contributions.
 &HT;    But violence has risen and taken on different forms. The
deadliest has been fighting among the delta's ethnic groups,
competing against one another for jobs or claims to oil-rich areas.
The Nigerian military has also engaged in battles with rioters, and
the oil companies have been criticized for their coziness with the
military.
 &HT;    A recent report by the New York-based Human Rights Watch says
the oil companies have looked away whenever the military has
brutalized or killed protesters. In Chevron's case, Human Rights

 &HT;    Like the other oil companies, Chevron argues that its hands are

requests by the military to use equipment leased by the joint

 &HT;    What's more, the companies point out, their workers have often
been hurt. In December, six of Chevron's Nigerian employees were
kidnapped and are presumed dead.
 &HT;    In Kula, about a year ago, 25 youths were jailed after invading
a Chevron oil rig. Shell, which has three stations and an extremely
strained relationship with Kula, experienced an average of two
shutdowns per month last year. In May, 50 young men invaded a Shell

 &HT;    Meanwhile, one wonders whether President Obasanjo's pleas for

pay-offs? Or will the angriest people of the delta grow ever more

 &HT;    At the office in Port Harcourt, Hutto and Okoaye are standing
outside under the canopy on one rainy day, and Hutto's voice is
raspy, sore from several days of negotiating for the release of an
American worker _ ``a big guy from Alabama.''
 &HT;    It seems he took his boat up a canal near the oil station in
Kula to check on a well when half a dozen young men jumped him. The
worker spent nine days in the mangrove swamp with his captors
pointing guns at his head. After a $25,000 ransom is paid, the
Alabama man is released.
 &HT;    ``I don't know how we'll operate,'' Okoaye says, worried that

rubs his forefinger and thumb together.

says.

 By JOHN HILLEN  
 c.1999 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The most striking feature of this year's defense budget debate
was that there was none.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the absence of the usual acrimony accompanying
the authorization of billions of federal dollars was congressional
exhaustion from the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Another and more important reason was that the military's
problems _ the ``three Rs'' of readiness, recruiting and retention
_ were well reported. President Clinton could not afford to be
caught cutting defense dollars while bombing Iraq and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's unease with traditional defense-cutting
arguments has spread across both aisles on Capitol Hill, where
almost any vote on three-R spending is treated as a litmus test for
patriotism. Thus in February, after only one day of debate, the
Senate voted 91-8 for a military pay raise that by itself could
amount to $55 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives, which could not even pass a
resolution supporting the air war in Kosovo, voted overwhelmingly
for a $13.1 billion emergency military spending bill only days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks should find Clinton's proposed $112 billion increase in
military spending over the next six years cause for celebration.
The armed forces have simultaneously been downsized and run ragged
by an unprecedented number of protracted overseas deployments. The
Pentagon has managed thus far by robbing funds intended for future
programs and equipment, but even that tactic has lost its useful
life. With combat readiness near a 20-year low, morale suffering
and acquisition sorely underfunded, the military could use the
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Even hawks should be troubled, however. The defense budget
crisis that forced the president's hand did not happen by accident.
True, top generals and admirals downplayed their readiness woes
until they were too obvious to hide and then sprang them on
Congress when the government surplus became evident, giving the
crisis a sudden and random character.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that the groundwork for the military's budget
crisis was laid long in advance and was fully predictable. And the
same system that created this defense ``train wreck'' will suck up
and waste even more substantial increases in military spending for
the foreseeable future unless Washington makes significant changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is locked in a budgetary death spiral simply
because the way it thinks about the world has not caught up with
the way it spends money. The process is the problem. The military
programs, strategies and weapon systems funded by the $270 billion
annual defense budget match neither the administration's national
security strategy nor the Pentagon's blueprint for future military
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic reforms and reorganizations have tried to centralize
planning authority within the Pentagon, leaving behind an alphabet
soup of some 30 procedures intended to marry budgeting with
strategy. But these attempts have dented neither the basic
prerogatives of the services nor the incentives that influence
their decisions. The system has proven amazingly resistant to
changes or updates based on U.S. strategy or the international
environment.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when then Secretary of Defense James R.
Schlesinger was asked why the military continued to fund itself
this way despite changes in national strategy, he reportedly
replied, ``Because it is too hard to do it any other way.'' His
successors would undoubtedly agree.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the services, the president, the secretary of
defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon's
elite Joint Staff, and the war-fighting commanders spread around
the world have almost no budgetary authority. Yet they must not
only devise U.S. military strategy but also control American forces
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Strong presidents and defense secretaries have sometimes managed
to bend the services' budgets to their strategy. But for the past
five years the services have mostly been left to their own devices,
spending their money and planning their forces as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, they have produced individual ``visions''
and spending plans to fit their distinct worldviews _ visions which
are not especially complementary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real problem for the Department of Defense is not
age-old interservice rivalries. Instead, it is the lack of
supervision and coordination of the services, which will bankrupt
an even bigger defense budget without addressing the countrywide
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Today the services are interested in neither the White House's
new wars (peacekeeping, terrorism, organized crime and the like)
nor the Joint Staff's futuristic technological blueprint (Joint
Vision 2010). Neither vision is compelling enough to induce the
services to change on their own nor specific enough to narrow
debate on what the services actually require.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Army, Navy and Air Force plan for the wars they
would like to fight. These future wars, unsurprisingly, look
remarkably like those of the past except that the same old type of
adversaries have slightly upgraded equipment _ as do we.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first days of the Clinton administration, top civilian
officials have warned that conflicts such as Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia
and Kosovo will be the order of the day. Nonetheless, with the
exception of the Marine Corps (which has historically specialized
in fighting ``small wars''), the services have hardly adjusted at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has sunk its money into upgrading the world's heaviest
tank and a new heavy artillery piece _ neither of which could be
shipped to Kosovo, for example, in time to make a difference. The
Air Force, meanwhile, has concentrated on stealthier, faster, more
precise and longer-range technologies rather than the mundane
close-support systems that might have stemmed the ravages of
Slobodan Milosevic's forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The services put little money behind the Pentagon's own
war-fighting blueprints. For example, the Navy has been told by
several high-level strategy documents and blue-ribbon commissions
that the aircraft carrier's age is soon over. Yet it recently
canceled production on an arsenal ship _ a stealthy barge bristling
with precision munitions _ and plans yet another carrier. The
Navy's single most expensive program is the upgrade of F-18 fighter
jets for carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force knows its future is in unmanned aircraft and
space, yet it clings maniacally to the superexpensive F-22 fighter
plane as its flagship program. And while the Army has criticized
itself for being too heavy, cumbersome and unwieldy, it has
canceled its light armored gun system, has suspended tests of more
agile formations and continues to spend the lion's share of its
budget on tanks and heavy artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   None of these systems are without merit, but they are invariably
created and advanced incompletely, without consideration for other
Pentagon programs, future war-fighting concepts or even the White
House's national security priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Because they cannot compel the services to think and act any
differently, the secretary of defense and the president are reduced
to rubber-stamping programs conceived 10 or 15 years ago and funded
well into the future _ where they will drive defense's chronic
underfunding to crisis proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1999 and 2003, the Congressional Budget Office and the
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimate, service
requests will exceed the projected defense budget by $20 billion to
$25 billion per year. The Center for Strategic and International
Studies estimates that the shortfall could be three or four times
that figure. The Pentagon simply cannot afford what its services
say they must have to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the national security strategy produced by the
White House does not prioritize very much, but it does clearly
emphasize new security threats such as intrastate conflict,
terrorism, nuclear proliferation, organized crime and drug
trafficking. The Pentagon's plan for future war-fighting concepts
suggests radical changes to achieve a high-tech ``revolution in
military affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The services, on the other hand, are all figuring out how to
fight the next Desert Storm better (and far less jointly than they
proclaim).
</P>
<P>
   Officials should recognize that the services are not
analytically prepared to decide everything by themselves _ but they
will if given the chance. To reverse the budgeting-planning
equation will require confident, timely and disciplined leadership
from the president and the secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Current White House and Pentagon plans are too vague and
ambiguous to command the attention or respect of the services.
National security strategies driven by platitudes will not lasso
and corral the budget. Planning must be synchronized _ not parallel
_ if strategic needs are to drive the budget.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the traditional budget allocation among the services
from limiting or determining U.S. strategy, some budget authority
must be shifted to the Joint Staff or Joint Commands. Reducing each
service's procurement budget by 20 percent and letting competition
between programs determine allocation would restore some sanity to
the planning process.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring 20 percent of service procurement budgets for major
programs to joint authority would leave intact the training
prerogatives, developmental authority and organizational
wherewithal of the services. At the same time, it would give a
joint authority the necessary means to make some hard choices about
redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   Currently there are no real incentives for the services to do
anything but mind their own interests. In times of finite resources
and wildly expensive programs, a more dispassionate system is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In order to buttress an American foreign policy that is growing
more imperial by the day, the Pentagon will need significantly
increased defense spending _ but the process must be fixed so that
national security needs, not budgetary inertia, lead the way.

<P>
   The most striking feature of this year's defense budget debate
was that there was none.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the absence of the usual acrimony accompanying
the authorization of billions of federal dollars was congressional
exhaustion from the impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Another and more important reason was that the military's
problems _ the ``three Rs'' of readiness, recruiting and retention
_ were well reported. President Clinton could not afford to be
caught cutting defense dollars while bombing Iraq and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's unease with traditional defense-cutting
arguments has spread across both aisles on Capitol Hill, where
almost any vote on three-R spending is treated as a litmus test for
patriotism. Thus in February, after only one day of debate, the
Senate voted 91-8 for a military pay raise that by itself could
amount to $55 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives, which could not even pass a
resolution supporting the air war in Kosovo, voted overwhelmingly
for a $13.1 billion emergency military spending bill only days
later.
</P>
<P>
   Hawks should find Clinton's proposed $112 billion increase in
military spending over the next six years cause for celebration.
The armed forces have simultaneously been downsized and run ragged
by an unprecedented number of protracted overseas deployments. The
Pentagon has managed thus far by robbing funds intended for future
programs and equipment, but even that tactic has lost its useful
life. With combat readiness near a 20-year low, morale suffering
and acquisition sorely underfunded, the military could use the
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Even hawks should be troubled, however. The defense budget
crisis that forced the president's hand did not happen by accident.
True, top generals and admirals downplayed their readiness woes
until they were too obvious to hide and then sprang them on
Congress when the government surplus became evident, giving the
crisis a sudden and random character.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that the groundwork for the military's budget
crisis was laid long in advance and was fully predictable. And the
same system that created this defense ``train wreck'' will suck up
and waste even more substantial increases in military spending for
the foreseeable future unless Washington makes significant changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon is locked in a budgetary death spiral simply
because the way it thinks about the world has not caught up with
the way it spends money. The process is the problem. The military
programs, strategies and weapon systems funded by the $270 billion
annual defense budget match neither the administration's national
security strategy nor the Pentagon's blueprint for future military
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Periodic reforms and reorganizations have tried to centralize
planning authority within the Pentagon, leaving behind an alphabet
soup of some 30 procedures intended to marry budgeting with
strategy. But these attempts have dented neither the basic
prerogatives of the services nor the incentives that influence
their decisions. The system has proven amazingly resistant to
changes or updates based on U.S. strategy or the international
environment.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, when then Secretary of Defense James R.
Schlesinger was asked why the military continued to fund itself
this way despite changes in national strategy, he reportedly
replied, ``Because it is too hard to do it any other way.'' His
successors would undoubtedly agree.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the services, the president, the secretary of
defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon's
elite Joint Staff, and the war-fighting commanders spread around
the world have almost no budgetary authority. Yet they must not
only devise U.S. military strategy but also control American forces
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Strong presidents and defense secretaries have sometimes managed
to bend the services' budgets to their strategy. But for the past
five years the services have mostly been left to their own devices,
spending their money and planning their forces as they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   As might be expected, they have produced individual ``visions''
and spending plans to fit their distinct worldviews _ visions which
are not especially complementary.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the real problem for the Department of Defense is not
age-old interservice rivalries. Instead, it is the lack of
supervision and coordination of the services, which will bankrupt
an even bigger defense budget without addressing the countrywide
security concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Today the services are interested in neither the White House's
new wars (peacekeeping, terrorism, organized crime and the like)
nor the Joint Staff's futuristic technological blueprint (Joint
Vision 2010). Neither vision is compelling enough to induce the
services to change on their own nor specific enough to narrow
debate on what the services actually require.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Army, Navy and Air Force plan for the wars they
would like to fight. These future wars, unsurprisingly, look
remarkably like those of the past except that the same old type of
adversaries have slightly upgraded equipment _ as do we.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first days of the Clinton administration, top civilian
officials have warned that conflicts such as Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia
and Kosovo will be the order of the day. Nonetheless, with the
exception of the Marine Corps (which has historically specialized
in fighting ``small wars''), the services have hardly adjusted at
all.
</P>
<P>
   The Army has sunk its money into upgrading the world's heaviest
tank and a new heavy artillery piece _ neither of which could be
shipped to Kosovo, for example, in time to make a difference. The
Air Force, meanwhile, has concentrated on stealthier, faster, more
precise and longer-range technologies rather than the mundane
close-support systems that might have stemmed the ravages of
Slobodan Milosevic's forces on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The services put little money behind the Pentagon's own
war-fighting blueprints. For example, the Navy has been told by
several high-level strategy documents and blue-ribbon commissions
that the aircraft carrier's age is soon over. Yet it recently
canceled production on an arsenal ship _ a stealthy barge bristling
with precision munitions _ and plans yet another carrier. The
Navy's single most expensive program is the upgrade of F-18 fighter
jets for carriers.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force knows its future is in unmanned aircraft and
space, yet it clings maniacally to the superexpensive F-22 fighter
plane as its flagship program. And while the Army has criticized
itself for being too heavy, cumbersome and unwieldy, it has
canceled its light armored gun system, has suspended tests of more
agile formations and continues to spend the lion's share of its
budget on tanks and heavy artillery pieces.
</P>
<P>
   None of these systems are without merit, but they are invariably
created and advanced incompletely, without consideration for other
Pentagon programs, future war-fighting concepts or even the White
House's national security priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Because they cannot compel the services to think and act any
differently, the secretary of defense and the president are reduced
to rubber-stamping programs conceived 10 or 15 years ago and funded
well into the future _ where they will drive defense's chronic
underfunding to crisis proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1999 and 2003, the Congressional Budget Office and the
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments estimate, service
requests will exceed the projected defense budget by $20 billion to
$25 billion per year. The Center for Strategic and International
Studies estimates that the shortfall could be three or four times
that figure. The Pentagon simply cannot afford what its services
say they must have to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the national security strategy produced by the
White House does not prioritize very much, but it does clearly
emphasize new security threats such as intrastate conflict,
terrorism, nuclear proliferation, organized crime and drug
trafficking. The Pentagon's plan for future war-fighting concepts
suggests radical changes to achieve a high-tech ``revolution in
military affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   The services, on the other hand, are all figuring out how to
fight the next Desert Storm better (and far less jointly than they
proclaim).
</P>
<P>
   Officials should recognize that the services are not
analytically prepared to decide everything by themselves _ but they
will if given the chance. To reverse the budgeting-planning
equation will require confident, timely and disciplined leadership
from the president and the secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Current White House and Pentagon plans are too vague and
ambiguous to command the attention or respect of the services.
National security strategies driven by platitudes will not lasso
and corral the budget. Planning must be synchronized _ not parallel
_ if strategic needs are to drive the budget.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the traditional budget allocation among the services
from limiting or determining U.S. strategy, some budget authority
must be shifted to the Joint Staff or Joint Commands. Reducing each
service's procurement budget by 20 percent and letting competition
between programs determine allocation would restore some sanity to
the planning process.
</P>
<P>
   Transferring 20 percent of service procurement budgets for major
programs to joint authority would leave intact the training
prerogatives, developmental authority and organizational
wherewithal of the services. At the same time, it would give a
joint authority the necessary means to make some hard choices about
redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   Currently there are no real incentives for the services to do
anything but mind their own interests. In times of finite resources
and wildly expensive programs, a more dispassionate system is
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In order to buttress an American foreign policy that is growing
more imperial by the day, the Pentagon will need significantly
increased defense spending _ but the process must be fixed so that
national security needs, not budgetary inertia, lead the way.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At his best, Robert Wilson can reduce you to the
state of a spaced-out, slack-jawed teen-ager, the sort who attends
midnight shows of Disney's ``Fantasia'' with an attitude of
religious awe. ``Oh, wow,'' you think, as Wilson summons yet
another phantasmal image that seems to have stepped right out of
your own subconscious. ``How incredibly cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Now you might attempt to formulate that reaction in loftier
terms, something more coherent and intellectual. But description,
for the most part, doesn't really become Wilson's work, and rigid
analysis even less.
</P>
<P>
   Try, for example, defining one of the more spectacular tableaux
in ``The Days Before: Death, Destruction and Detroit III,'' the new
Wilson extravaganza that runs at the New York State Theater through
Sunday as part of Lincoln Center Festival '99, and you may start to
feel embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's this floating, long-bodied blue angel with a deer's
head,'' you say, ``and it has a sash that turns out to be a scroll,
which keeps unwinding into the hands of this rooster. Now the way I
see it, the angel represents the limitations of religious
knowledge, because . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Oh, wow'' is probably as appropriate a response as
you could come up with, a tribute to a director who creates a
language of the stage that is as elusive as it is distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson addicts, a small but very chic cadre of esthetes, who are
in search of a new fix of this sense-scrambling imagery won't go
home feeling starved from his latest production, which is only the
second to have its world premiere in New York in the last two
decades. But they're also unlikely to feel entirely satisfied with
the alternately ravishing and tedious ``Days Before,'' which Wilson
has fashioned as a culture-blending meditation on visions of the
apocalypse throughout history.
</P>
<P>
   The intermissionless show, which lasts an hour and 45 minutes,
only occasionally achieves the hypnotic, dreamlike flow that was so
beguilingly realized in Wilson's masterpiece, ``Einstein on the
Beach,'' the 1976 opera he created with composer Philip Glass.
There's a jagged, disjunctive feeling to ``The Days Before'' that
causes you to step back and assess coolly. Wilson's intuitive work,
which he insists is not intellectual, suffers from this kind of
scrutiny; what you want it to do is sweep you away.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem here is in Wilson's use of a spoken text,
largely taken from ``The Island of the Day Before,'' Umberto Eco's
1995 novel about a 17th-century shipwreck survivor, and read aloud
by no less a personage than Fiona Shaw, the great Irish actress who
so memorably brought T.S. Eliot's ``Wasteland'' to theatrical life
several seasons ago. (Ms. Shaw is intermittently assisted by an
eclectic trio of actors who suggest the basis for a high-culture
``Hollywood Squares'': Isabella Rossellini, Tony Randall and Jeremy
Geidt.)
</P>
<P>
   Eco's novel is thick with labyrinthine reflections on time and
creation, eternity and decay, the subjectivity of human perception
and the ways we try to mark and measure an eternally mutable world.
Since these are all implicit themes of Wilson's work, the choice of
``Island'' would seem perfectly appropriate. But while the book may
be driven by metaphor and semiotic gamesmanship, it also has a
linear logic and explanatory clearness that are the opposite of
Wilson's usual style, which refuses to explain anything.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson is of course aware of this contrast and is making
deliberate use of it. ``His text, his ideas are very dense, like a
rock,'' Wilson said of Eco in a recent interview. ``I put some
space around them. And the text weighs down my ideas, keeps them
from flying up.''
</P>
<P>
   But that anchor is too heavy by half. Ms. Shaw is a commanding
reader, and her resonant voice is heavily amplified here. And since
what she, and her fellow narrators, are saying seems to bear some
thematic relation to the airier images onstage, you take Eco's
words more literally than you should, as though they provided an
annotative key to Wilson's mysteries.
</P>
<P>
   This tends to flatten things, to shrink Wilson's radiant,
shifting tableaux to the status of visual aids in a lecture. If
you're not careful, you wind up giving more attention to what is
said than to what you see, which is self-defeating in Wilson's
world. After all, this director has always insisted that, in his
own words, ``the `visual book' doesn't have to be subservient to
what you hear.'' Yet in ``The Days Before,'' it often is.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This is especially unfortunate, since much of Wilson's staging
is so ineffably eloquent on its own terms. Working with an ensemble
of more than 20 performers, and carefully mixing ritualized,
Kabuki-style motion (the choreography is by Suzushi Hanayagi) with
projected film and gorgeous, astral lighting (overseen by
Christopher Kondek and A.J. Weissbard, respectively), he creates a
gallery of melting pictures drawn by the grammar of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Several of these sequences are unqualified stunners, both
exquisite and deeply disturbing. In one, the assassination of the
Romanovs is enacted in grimly serene pantomime while photographs of
faces of the real royal family are projected onto transparent
scrims that undulate plaintively in midair.
</P>
<P>
   In another, a child, with what looks like a porcelain Bhudda's
head, peers through an immense white telescope at a tiny meteor
suspended from a pole. Behind her, on those ever-present,
ever-shifting rectangular scrims, is a black-and-white film showing
a landscape as seen from a moving train. Behind that, a light show
conjures a comet streaking through a multicolored sky. These images
coalesce into a magic visual poem of cosmic physics and our limited
perception of the forces that govern the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also makes as keen a use of basic human physiognomy as
any director working now. He can induce appreciative gasps simply
by having a literal giant of a man fully extend his arms. A
gnarled, bearded, gnomelike man, so frail-looking you expect him to
break, suddenly erupts into transporting laughter. And you are
always aware of the contrasts in the sizes and shapes of the people
onstage, who suggest a multiplicity of forms of being and, by
extension, seeing.
</P>
<P>
   The music, by Ryuichi Sakamoto, is correspondingly eclectic,
segueing between sappy New Age chords to ominous percussive thunder
to 1970s-style synthesizer disco vamps, which offer some witty and
welcome relief from the governing solemnity. So does the unexpected
deconstruction of Barry Manilow's hit song ``Mandy'' by autistic
poet Christopher Knowles. Tibetan singer Dadon Dawadolma introduces
the evening with a luminous chant that seems to keep expanding in
your ears.
</P>
<P>
   And in the evening's most haunting convergence of sound and
image, Semiha Berksoy, a 90-year-old Turkish opera singer, is
pushed across the stage on a red divan, looking like a Baroque-age
Norma Desmond, while she raspingly warbles along with Isolde's
``Liebestod.'' ``Sic transit gloria mundi,'' the vignette seems to
say. But it also speaks touchingly of the tenacity of the artistic
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the scenes in ``Days Before,'' especially those
featuring headless torsos and seemingly empty suits of clothes that
come to life, bring to mind the paintings of Magritte, de Chirico
and Dali. Others, which prominently display chairs and lighting
fixtures of Wilson's design, suggest a furniture showroom in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   The effect can be studiedly, glacially glamorous, as though
Wilson were auditioning to be the new editor of Harper's Bazaar.
And it's easy to see why the director, whose work is more
celebrated in Europe than in the United States, has always
attracted the rich and fashionable as fans and patrons.
</P>
<P>
   This quality of chic has traditionally been a part of Wilson's
cachet, but often the mise-en-scene is so enthralling that you
don't stop to isolate its individual elements. With ``Days
Before,'' you find yourself growing impatient with such familiar
Wilsonian touches as stately slow-motion choreography and silent
screams.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine who saw the production with me, a Wilson
admirer and an abstract painter with a high tolerance for the
obscure, said she sometimes felt as though she were back in high
school math class, waiting for the bell to ring. She's right; it's
hard to avoid feeling that way. But she was also right when she
said that this restlessness was a price worth paying for the
evening's most resplendent effects.
</P>
<P>
   When everything meshes in a Wilson vignette, there is a
transcendent sense of both the baffling chaos of existence and the
innate beauty of the forms we instinctively impose upon it. ``The
Days Before'' may be about the apocalypse, but it is also oddly
comforting. Would that the world could end as Wilson envisions it,
not with a bang but with a celestial shimmer.

TV WEEKEND: CHRIS ROCK FAMILY VALUES ON HBO; HOLLYWOOD FAMILY
SITCOM ON WB 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes follow Chris Rock item; air time given
is Eastern)  
 (bl)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chris Rock is making Littleton jokes. What's wrong with ``these
white kids shooting up schools?'' he asks, two and a half months
after the massacre in Colorado that left 14 students and a teacher
dead. And why, he wonders, are people looking for social ills that
caused it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever happened to crazy?'' says Rock. ``You can't be crazy
no more?'' Pretty soon, he predicts, ``you're going to have little
white kids saying, `I want to go to a black school _ where it's
safe.'''
</P>
<P>
   Great comedy is about going where no one else dares to tread and
making it work. Chris Rock's third HBO stand-up special, ``Chris
Rock: Bigger and Blacker'' (Saturday at 11:15 p.m.), is great
comedy. Rock hits the stage running, and his structure is flawless;
just as the laughter is dying down after a successful punch line,
he throws in a post-punch that refers back to some earlier riff
(Robitussin and ``La Vida Loca'' are used prominently in this way)
and keeps it going.
</P>
<P>
   Rock may use a lot of four-letter words, but his humor has a
real family-values morality at its core. He's in serious favor of
the old-fashioned two-parent family, for instance, because children
who grow up without fathers are headed for trouble, he says. ``If
the kid calls his grandmama Mommy and his mama Pam, he going to
jail,'' says Rock. So his family needn't bother with saving up
college funds, because ``that money's going to Johnnie Cochran.''
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, Rock even has something new to say about the Monica
Lewinsky scandal. It all comes down to a man lying about sex so his
wife wouldn't find out, he explains. ``Do you need a Supreme Court
for that one? Is that illegal? You could have took that one to the
People's Court!'' And what, Rock asks, was wrong with the
president's asking a friend to help Ms. Lewinsky get a job? ``After
what she did for him, the  &UR; least &LR;  he could do is give her a
recommendation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock is not happy with the tax system, particularly Social
Security. ``You don't get the money till you're 65; meanwhile, the
average black man dies at 54,'' he observes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't live that long,'' he adds a little later.
``Hypertension, high blood pressure, NYPD _ something'll get you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rock also complains about the state of medical research, makes
suggestions for better marriages, clears up the question of black
anti-Semitism (``We don't hate Jews. We hate all white people.'')
and makes a case against any form of racism or intolerance
(``Whoever you hate will end up in your family'').
</P>
<P>
   His comments on gun control are a little worrisome to the white
liberal mind-set (but his bullet-control idea sounds workable) and
no good feminist can sit back and let a stand-up comic lay the
blame for Monicagate at Hillary Rodham Clinton's bedroom door, but
having a couple of offenses in an hour of dead-on comic
observations isn't half-bad.

   How can you not like a series in which a child runs away from
home by hijacking Mom's limo and checking into Chateau Marmont?
Unfortunately, you can, if the rest of the situations are trite and
have no connection with the concept.
</P>
<P>
   In WB's new series about the home life of Hollywood royalty,
Harry Hamlin is appealing as Reese Hardin, action film star, and
Jennifer Grant (daughter of Cary and of Dyan Cannon) is likable as
his wife, Jacey Wyatt, an equally big star. They live in Malibu
with their adorable children, Apache and Moonglow. A wacky brother
and a levelheaded mother pop in and out. Lori, Reese's 16-year-old
daughter from a previous marriage, has just arrived to live with
them, and Marnette Patterson has apparently been instructed to play
her as Christina Applegate's trampy character in ``Married . . .
With Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking in at a world like this could be fun _ Dad has dinner at
Morton's, next weekend's children's birthday party is at Mel
Gibson's house, and Robin Williams is driving the car pool _ but
name dropping alone isn't comedy. The first two episodes have a few
funny, promising lines, but overall the plots and the
characterization fall flat.

C. WALTON LILLEHEI, A LEADER IN OPEN-HEART SURGERY, DIES AT 80  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Mass., South Africa)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. C. Walton Lillehei, a pioneer in open-heart surgery, valve
replacements and the electronic pacemaker, died on Monday at his
home in St. Paul. He was 80.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said St. Jude Medical Inc. in St. Paul,
the medical equipment manufacturer where Lillehei had worked as a
division medical director since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Among his peers, Lillehei (pronounced LILY-high) was often
referred to as the ``father of open heart surgery,'' responsible
for many implements used in the operation. At the University of
Minnesota, where he was a medical school professor, he was a leader
in developing techniques that first made surgery within the human
heart possible.
</P>
<P>
   His work was instrumental in making almost commonplace critical
operations on the heart that had been considered impossible.
</P>
<P>
   As late as 1950, there was no workable substitute for the
natural process that places oxygen into the bloodstream and
circulates blood throughout the body. Heart surgery was thus
limited to disorders that could be remedied without entering the
heart itself.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehei cleared that obstacle, initially trying ``cross
circulation,'' in which the bloodstream of the patient undergoing
surgery was linked by tubes to that of a healthy donor. It worked,
but only at some risk to the donor, and the process was later
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point came in 1955 when Lillehei and a colleague,
Dr. Richard A. Wall, succeeded with a heart-lung machine, called a
helix reservoir bubble oxygenator, which bubbled oxygen through the
blood during an operation.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehei played a prominent role in other breakthroughs that
made treatments of once-fatal heart conditions possible. Once such
condition is known as heart block, in which the body fails to
produce the small electrical signals that regulate the heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   By 1957, Lillehei and his colleagues in Minnesota had worked out
a method of hooking wires directly into the living heart, supplying
the electrical signals from outside the chest and taking the place
of the lacking natural ones.
</P>
<P>
   The signals were generated by a battery-powered electronic
device, a pacemaker, small enough to be worn under the clothing and
providing electrical pulses for a firm, steady heartbeat. Lillehei
introduced it at a conference on cardiovascular surgery, sponsored
by the New York Heart Association, the following January.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1960, he reported in The Journal of the American Medical
Association on the condition of 66 patients who by then carried
their pacemakers in shoulder holsters. The device, the size of a
pack of cigarettes, proved effective not merely as a temporary aid
after surgery, but also for long-term maintenance of nonsurgical
heart patients.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, he introduced a new type of compact artificial heart
device without valves or other interior moving parts. It consisted
of a multilayer sandwich of plastic sheets and silicone rubber
membranes and was intended as a booster pump to assist
disease-weakened hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehei and his associates contributed to the design of four
prosthetic heart valves, including the widely used St. Jude Medical
Mechanical Heart Valve.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehei, as chief surgeon at New York Hospital in 1969, led the
team that did the first transplant of the heart and both lungs to
be performed there. In that procedure the organs of a 50-year-old
woman were transplanted into a 43-year-old man suffering terminal
lung and heart failure from chronic emphysema. It was the second
such operation, and the patient survived for one week.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehei trained some 1,000 doctors in heart surgery and
contributed hundreds of papers and articles. Among his students at
Minnesota were Dr. Christiaan N. Barnard, the South African who in
1967 performed history's first heart transplant, and Dr. Norman E.
Shumway, who devised the technique for such transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Clarence Walton Lillehei was born in Minneapolis and graduated
from the University of Minnesota in 1939. He received his medical
degree there in 1942 as well as a master's in physiology and a
doctorate in surgery in 1951, by which time he had already built a
reputation as a surgeon-researcher of great promise.
</P>
<P>
   He went into private practice as a general, thoracic and
cardiovascular surgeon in 1945 after wartime service in the Army
Medical Corps in Europe, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant
colonel and won a Bronze Star. He joined the department of surgery
at the University of Minnesota Medical School as a full-time
instructor in 1949 and steadily rose through the academic ranks.
</P>
<P>
   He was a clinical professor of surgery in 1967 when he was named
Stimson professor of surgery and chairman of the department of
surgery at Cornell University Medical Center and surgeon in chief
at New York Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the University of Minnesota Medical Center in
1975 after being found guilty of tax evasion two years earlier. He
was fined $50,000 and sentenced to serve six months of community
service.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehei was a past chairman of the American College of
Cardiology and lectured on heart surgery at international meetings
until last year. Among his many honors was an Albert Lasker Award
in medical research in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Lillehei is survived by his wife of 52 years, Kay Lindberg
Lillehei; a daughter, Kimberle Loken of Duluth, Minn.; two sons,
Craig W., of Boston, and Kevin O., of Denver; a brother, James P.,
of Mendota Heights, Minn.; seven grandchildren, and two
great-grandchildren.

`AUTUMN TALE`: A VERY GOOD YEAR FOR MATCHMAKING 
</HEADLINE>
  (``Autumn Tale'' was shown as part of last year's New York Film
Festival as ``A Tale of Autumn.'' Following are excerpts from
Stephen Holden's review, which appeared in The New York Times on
Oct. 2, 1998. The film opens Friday.) 
(jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way to look at the films of Eric Rohmer, in which assorted
combinations of attractive, cultivated Europeans rearrange their
lives amid much exquisitely verbalized soul-searching, is to see
them as sophisticated fairy tales. Despite what blows fate may
deliver the characters, a divine plan usually emerges that
overrides earlier setbacks. Rational decision-making pays off, as
does trusting one's deepest intuitions. True love _ or the closest
thing to it one can find in this life _ is the ultimate reward, but
it can't be tasted until every moral quandary has been aired and
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Tale of Autumn,'' the final chapter in the director's
``Tales of the Four Seasons,'' is as sublimely warming an
experience as the autumn sun that shines benevolently on the
vineyard owned by the film's central character, Magali (Beatrice
Romand). A wiry, vital woman in her mid-40's with snapping eyes and
an unruly bush of hair, Magali, a widowed mother of two grown
children, is content with her life except for one thing. When
prodded by her married best friend, Isabelle (Marie Riviere),
Magali admits that she longs for a relationship with the right man
but believes it is too late for her to find love.
</P>
<P>
   Magali brings all the usual arguments to rationalize her
resignation. Potentially eligible partners would all want younger
women, she insists. And living in the country (in the gorgeous
Rhone Valley region of southern France), she is also isolated. When
Isabelle suggests placing a personal ad, Magali is revolted by the
idea.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows the confusions that ensue when two of Magali's
friends decide to play matchmaker. Isabelle places a personal ad in
Magali's behalf, and when a courtly, eminently suitable salesman
named Gerald (Alain Libolt) responds, she interviews him
extensively before revealing that she is merely acting as an
unbidden liaison to someone else. Meanwhile, Magali's son's
girlfriend, Rosine (Alexia Portal), whom Magali has taken under her
wing, proposes to fix the older woman up with her ex-lover and
former professor, Etienne (Didier Sandre).
</P>
<P>
   Both prospective partners are coaxed into attending the wedding
of Isabelle's daughter. The complications that follow at the
outdoor reception might be described as Rohmer's elegantly
psychologized and sublimated version of a classic French farce.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the story but the telling that makes ``Autumn'' such a
rich, emotionally satisfying experience. As the five main
characters reveal their fantasies and fears, each emerges as an
astoundingly complex and fully rounded human being.
</P>
<P>
   The film's plot, like that of other Rohmer films, is
mathematically schematic. Even before the equation has been
balanced, except for a twist here and there, you know where the
story is going to go. But the characters' depth, humanity and
likability make the expected payoff feel earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Autumn'' has its labored moments. Especially when the talk
turns to grapes and late vintages, it is pressing an obvious
metaphor a bit too aggressively. But the movie evokes such a
sensuous atmosphere _ bird song, wind and light and shadow that
delineate the season and time of day with an astonishing precision
_ that you are all but transported into Magali's fields, where this
year's grapes promise to yield an especially fine vintage.  &QL;

THE BETA BAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE BETA BAND (Astralwerks). Where Kid Rock reconfigures rap for
the testosterone-addled hard-rock crowd, the Beta Band remakes rap
for fans of cerebral low-fidelity indie-rock. Full of samples, drum
machines, beatboxing and gentle Scottish-accented rapping in
addition to standard rock-band instrumentation and all kinds of
noisemakers, this first full-length album by the Beta Band often
sounds like a recording-studio party where instruments are seen
more as toys. Rhythms are often punctuated by whistles, bells,
cheers, trotting horses and sounds not unlike a cuckoo clock, while
as many as four different genres of music are pressed back to back
within a single song. But the talent of the Beta Band is that, like
any good jam band, the chaos occasionally crystallizes into beauty,
in this case very gentle, introspective pop songs like ``It's Not
Too Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the group's previous EP's are more cohesive, this album
is more fun, with imitations of everyone from Elvis Presley to
Bonnie Tyler to the Beastie Boys. Like the music of another
Scottish group, Belle and Sebastian, the charm in each recording by
the Beta Band is that it pulls the curtain slightly further back on
a private world that is always worth eavesdropping on but may never
be entirely comprehensible to an outsider.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To a surprising degree, daddies are the drivers
getting children onto the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   While race and income play an enormous role in determining
whether a child has access to the Internet, having a father in the
home appears to be a key factor in computer literacy, according to
a study released Thursday by the U.S. Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department's ``Falling Through the Net'' survey shows huge
numbers of Americans are buying or seeking out computers to use the
Internet for sending messages via e-mail, searching for job
information, learning new skills and more.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Internet's popularity is growing in every corner
of the country, access remains very uneven. Money, education and
location are major factors in determining who uses the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study found that a family living in an urban
area with annual income exceeding $75,000 a year is 20 times more
likely to have Internet access than a rural, low-income family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, education and income are only part of the picture. The
government study found that among families earning $15,000 to
$35,000, more than 32 percent of whites owned computers, but only
19 percent of blacks did. ``Even when holding income constant,
there is still a yawning divide among different races and
origins,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at the statistics suggests that even more than
race, family structure determines whether children get access to
the Internet, either through a computer at home or through one at a
library, school or community center.
</P>
<P>
   A white child growing up in a home with two parents is nearly
twice as likely to have access to the Internet as a white child in
a single-parent household, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The gap was even greater for African-American children. A child
in a black family is almost four times as likely to have Internet
access as a child in a single-parent black household.
</P>
<P>
   Among single-parent households, those headed by fathers used
computers far more than those headed by women. For example, the
government found that in urban households headed by a man with
children, 21.5 percent used the Internet. But among female-headed
urban households, only 15 percent used the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The government report did not speculate on why women appear to
be more reluctant to use the Internet than men. But David Eisner, a
spokesman for America Online Inc., said part of the reason may be
that single mothers have too many responsibilities to find the time
to learn about computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands to reason that it is less convenient for a
one-parent household to take all the steps necessary to get a
computer and a subscription to an online service and monitor the
kids,'' Eisner said. ``If computers were simpler, a lot more people
would be on line.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The families most likely to own a computer are of Asian ethnic
origin, with 55 percent having one in the home. About 47 percent of
whites own computers, but only 23.2 percent of blacks do. About
25.5 percent of Hispanic families own computers.
</P>
<P>
   _ A white child in a low-income two-parent family is three times
more likely to have Internet access as a child in a comparable
black family, and four times more likely than a Hispanic child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Regardless of income, people living in rural areas are lagging
in Internet access. At the lowest income levels, those living in
urban areas are more than twice as likely to have Internet access,
compared with those earning similar amounts in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the third in a series by the government since 1995,
did not suggest specific policies to boost Internet use except to
recommend more online access at community centers, such as schools,
libraries and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference held to release the study,
representatives of Ameritech Corp. and the National Urban League
also announced they will spend $350,000 to build five new Internet
community centers in Aurora, Ill., Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis
and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 3Com Corp. said it plans to offer $1 million in

   WASHINGTON _ To a surprising degree, daddies are the drivers
getting children onto the information superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   While race and income play an enormous role in determining
whether a child has access to the Internet, having a father in the
home appears to be a key factor in computer literacy, according to
a study released Thursday by the U.S. Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   The department's ``Falling Through the Net'' survey shows huge
numbers of Americans are buying or seeking out computers to use the
Internet for sending messages via e-mail, searching for job
information, learning new skills and more.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Internet's popularity is growing in every corner
of the country, access remains very uneven. Money, education and
location are major factors in determining who uses the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the study found that a family living in an urban
area with annual income exceeding $75,000 a year is 20 times more
likely to have Internet access than a rural, low-income family.
</P>
<P>
   Still, education and income are only part of the picture. The
government study found that among families earning $15,000 to
$35,000, more than 32 percent of whites owned computers, but only
19 percent of blacks did. ``Even when holding income constant,
there is still a yawning divide among different races and
origins,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A closer look at the statistics suggests that even more than
race, family structure determines whether children get access to
the Internet, either through a computer at home or through one at a
library, school or community center.
</P>
<P>
   A white child growing up in a home with two parents is nearly
twice as likely to have access to the Internet as a white child in
a single-parent household, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The gap was even greater for African-American children. A child
in a black family is almost four times as likely to have Internet
access as a child in a single-parent black household.
</P>
<P>
   Among single-parent households, those headed by fathers used
computers far more than those headed by women. For example, the
government found that in urban households headed by a man with
children, 21.5 percent used the Internet. But among female-headed
urban households, only 15 percent used the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The government report did not speculate on why women appear to
be more reluctant to use the Internet than men. But David Eisner, a
spokesman for America Online Inc., said part of the reason may be
that single mothers have too many responsibilities to find the time
to learn about computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stands to reason that it is less convenient for a
one-parent household to take all the steps necessary to get a
computer and a subscription to an online service and monitor the
kids,'' Eisner said. ``If computers were simpler, a lot more people
would be on line.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Other key findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ The families most likely to own a computer are of Asian ethnic
origin, with 55 percent having one in the home. About 47 percent of
whites own computers, but only 23.2 percent of blacks do. About
25.5 percent of Hispanic families own computers.
</P>
<P>
   _ A white child in a low-income two-parent family is three times
more likely to have Internet access as a child in a comparable
black family, and four times more likely than a Hispanic child.
</P>
<P>
   _ Regardless of income, people living in rural areas are lagging
in Internet access. At the lowest income levels, those living in
urban areas are more than twice as likely to have Internet access,
compared with those earning similar amounts in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the third in a series by the government since 1995,
did not suggest specific policies to boost Internet use except to
recommend more online access at community centers, such as schools,
libraries and other facilities.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference held to release the study,
representatives of Ameritech Corp. and the National Urban League
also announced they will spend $350,000 to build five new Internet
community centers in Aurora, Ill., Cleveland, Detroit, Indianapolis
and Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 3Com Corp. said it plans to offer $1 million in
donated equipment and training to 10 cities to help teach students
to be computer network engineers.

AT THE MOVIES: PROPS TAKE OFF IN INTERNET SALES

   HOLLYWOOD _ Movie memorabilia often takes on a life of its own.
Fans of old films will pay huge sums for items like the ruby
slippers Judy Garland wore as Dorothy in ``The Wizard of Oz'' or
wait in long lines to view gowns worn in classic movies or even the
cars that stars once drove.
</P>
<P>
   But New Line Cinema has discovered, to its surprise and delight,
that in today's speeded-up world, moviegoers no longer wait a
generation to covet props from films. They want them now and are
willing to pay big bucks to get them.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, New Line announced that it was opening a Web site
(auction.newline.com), in conjunction with America Online, through
which it would auction props from some of its more successful
movies, from the current rage, ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me,'' starring Mike Myers, to ``Boogie Nights'' and ``Dumb and
Dumber.'' The venture was regarded as much as anything as just
another form of promotion, to generate awareness of the company and
its films.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just hoped it would create a little excitement,'' said Jim
Rosenthal, the company's executive vice president for business
development.
</P>
<P>
   But the response has taken the company by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea where it would go when we started this,''
Rosenthal said. ``But after the first day the response was such I
said, `We have to put more stuff out there.' I have staff going
through the warehouse now.''
</P>
<P>
   The red, white and blue Corvette (a 1965 model) driven by
Felicity Shagwell in the latest ``Austin Powers'' film was bid up
to $106,999. The silver outfit worn in the movie by Mini Me has
been bid up to $3,600. Up next is his baby baby grand piano. Here's
one for real film buffs: the glass beaker, shaped like a teapot,
that held a stool sample has been bid to more than $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point we're responding to consumer demand,'' Rosenthal
said. ``The truth is I had no idea how much this stuff was worth.''
</P>
<P>
   The major Hollywood studios all have warehouses jammed with
props, costumes and sets from their movies. Most of these items
gather dust, get reused and maybe, just maybe, find a buyer down
the road. What is striking about New Line's unexpected success
selling some of its recent props is that the most popular items
come from slightly daffy comedies that appealed largely to a
younger and very loyal audience.
</P>
<P>
   The company will be selling some fuzzy boots worn by Jim Carrey
in ``Dumb and Dumber,'' the roller skates worn by a main character
in ``Boogie Nights,'' as well as one of the western outfits worn by
another character, Buck. A dress worn by Alicia Silverstone in
``Blast From the Past'' is due up soon, as well as the television
repair kit used by Don Knott's character in ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be items used in ``Wag the Dog,'' ``Blade,''
``Rush Hour'' and ``Spawn.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think movies have become such a part of popular culture
that people crave these things,'' Rosenthal said. ``The Internet
has changed all the rules and brought so many people to the
auctions.''
</P>
<P>
   mafia.com? Yup
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bonanno has led what he describes as a generally good life,
notwithstanding the 11 years he spent behind bars for conspiracy,
wire fraud and things like that. His father is the famous mob boss,
Joseph Bonanno, and he has acknowledged that he, too, became a
``made'' member of the Sicilian Mafia before moving on to other
pursuits, which have ranged from writing the book ``Bound by
Honor'' to movies.
</P>
<P>
   He has produced the forthcoming Showtime film ``Bonanno: A
Godfather's Story,'' largely about his father. But, hey, it's the
'90s, and so in addition to the confessional film, Bonanno is
developing a Web site that he said would be called mafia.com. It is
to be devoted to describing the mob as he would like it to be seen,
honor bound and businesslike.
</P>
<P>
   The Showtime film is a two-part mini-series that will run
starting July 25. It stars Martin Landau, Edward James Olmos and
Patti LuPone, among others, and was directed by Michel Poulette.
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno, 66, perhaps the only movie producer to have declared
himself a mafioso to produce a movie, says this is a tale of
self-justification; his mob, he says, is the good mob.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to set aside the misconceptions,'' Bonanno said.
``People just don't understand the life style. The statement I want
to make is there's another side to the story. Movies like `Casino'
or `Goodfellas,' using a baseball bat or making an appointment to
kill somebody, it's not a true picture.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Sure, there were acts of violence. But for every
one, there were 10,000 peaceful accommodations.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonanno said the old Mafia essentially collapsed in the early
1960s. It is that old Mafia that he defends as trustworthy, at
least to its friends. Today, he added, the mob hews to none of the
old principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not defending the life style of what is known as the Mafia
today,'' he said. ``I am defending a tradition of what is right and
what is wrong. I am defending, pardon the expression, family
values. But what happened to the rest of the country happened to
us, too.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his movie, the government spins out of control, too. For
instance, he claims that John F. Kennedy was elected president with
the Mafia's explicit help, and he adds that he believes Kennedy was
murdered by a mobster, not by Lee Harvey Oswald.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Showtime film is completed, Bonanno said, he
expects to focus on producing other kinds of movies. He said he was
considering a romantic comedy and, his dream, a western. The
transition to this new world of filmmaking, he added, has been
easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life I've been in the people business,'' Bonanno said.
``This is no different.''
</P>
<P>
   Young Fogies
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has embraced youth culture in recent years with a zest
rarely seen before. Movies are increasingly aimed at young
audiences (read: audiences that see movies over and over, helping
the box office) and they are often made by young filmmakers with
sensibilities somewhere between MTV and ``Natural Born Killers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a generation of people in their 20s has been brought up
making movies that essentially take little seriously, are often
intensely violent or take remorseless violence as a fundamental
element of movies, embrace scatological humor and love the dark
thrills of life on the lam.
</P>
<P>
   Marni Banack, a 26-year-old Canadian, says she is not a fan of
that school. She has directed a small film, produced by J.B. Sugar,
that is noteworthy, if for nothing else, as an old-fashioned bit of
storytelling with an O. Henry twist. In other words, it is about
plot and character. And this year it won a student Academy Award in
the narrative category.
</P>
<P>
   The film, ``John,'' which is 21 minutes long, is quiet and
understated, focusing on an evening in the life of John, a
soft-spoken gentleman who works as a bathroom attendant at an
Italian restaurant. The camera almost never leaves the men's room.
Not only is there no violence; there's no sex either.
</P>
<P>
   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offers, in
addition to its grand Oscars, awards to aspiring student filmmakers
every year. Ms. Banack took the gold medal with Sugar several weeks
ago for their drama.
</P>
<P>
   In the past the award has been won by John Lasseter, Robert
Zemeckis and Spike Lee. Ms. Banack and Sugar recently graduated
from the American Film Institute's master's program and have wasted
no time throwing themselves into the fray.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar, with his own production company and a cellular phone,
said he already had two feature film projects in the works. Ms.
Banack was reached in Vancouver, where she has just completed
directing an episode in the Disney Channel drama ``So Weird,'' a
fairly traditional television suspense story except that much of it
involves the Internet. Sugar's father, Larry, is the show's
executive producer, which Ms. Banack admitted helped her land the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Banack said she saw almost every movie made these days and
was a fan of many styles, but she said she was tired of gratuitous
violence and dark moodiness as a replacement for character
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence, guns, drugs, blood, all of those things are typical
of student productions,'' Ms. Banack said. ``My interest absolutely
doesn't lie in those kind of action stories. Those things can just
be gimmicks.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``When people hear you're a young filmmaker, they
immediately think, like, edgy. I don't think I'm edgy right now. I
think I'm an old soul a little bit. But I think people like to see
stories well told, you know?''

ANTIQUES: JOLLY POTS IN HOT COLORS ARE BACK

<P>
   After the return of hippie chic, will Bizarre wares be next?
</P>
<P>
   Next Friday, Phillips auction house in London will conduct its
first sale devoted to the works of Clarice Cliff, the innovative
British potter (1899-1972) who invented Bizarre wares.
</P>
<P>
   Mick Jagger helped put Cliff back on the radar screen two
decades ago when he bought a gaily colored ``Age of Jazz''
centerpiece she designed. Young people started paying attention to
her exuberant, oddly shaped pots painted in brilliant red, orange,
turquoise and pink designs. Many were geometric, others flowery or
scenic.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, such collectors as Anna Wintour and the Missonis
started scooping up hand-painted biscuit barrels, chargers and
teapots with the uninhibited designs. Demand soared, then slowed
until the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Now Cliff's works are back in the public eye, probably because
it looks so wild and modern you half expect to see one in ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' And for the uninitiated, there
are suddenly several new opportunities to see the designer's work.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Web site (www.claricecliff.co.uk.); an international
Clarice Cliff Collectors Club and a new book, ``Clarice Cliff: The
Art of Bizarre, a Definitive Centenary Celebration'' (Trafalgar
Square Publishing) by Leonard Griffin, the president of the club.
</P>
<P>
   The Susan P. Meisel gallery has 35 works on view through July 23
at 135 Prince Street in Soho. This summer the Wedgwood Museum has
an exhibition of 600 works by Cliff in Stoke-on-Trent,
Staffordshire; the show runs through Sept. 5. Christie's in South
Kensington has already held two Cliff sales this year. The last
one, on May 5, was 82 percent sold and made $593,224. A Bizarre
centerpiece, a pair of dancing figures from Cliff's ``Age of Jazz''
series, sold for $18,080.
</P>
<P>
   The recent sale was so successful that Christie's is having
another one on Nov. 10 in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is such a broad base of Clarice Cliff collectors _ they
are spread across the U.K., the U.S., Australia and South America _
that it makes for a solid, safe market,'' said Michael Jeffery, the
specialist at Christie's. ``It doesn't fluctuate much. It just gets
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   What's all the fuss about?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fashion,'' said David Hare of Gardiner Houlgate, an
auction house in Bath, England, that will conduct an auction of
Cliff wares on Tuesday. ``Pieces from the early jazzy period are
very popular now.'' The auction house's Web site is
www.thesaurus.co.uk/gardiner-houlgate/aucdates.htm.
</P>
<P>
   But part of the current interest may simply be in Cliff herself.
``It's a story of how a poor paintress rose up to run a company,''
Jeffery said.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff was born into a large working-class family in
Stoke-on-Trent, a part of England known as the Potteries. According
to ``Clarice Cliff: The Bizarre Affair'' by Leonard Griffin and
Louis and Susan Meisel (Abrams, 1988), she showed an independent
streak at an early age. She began making clay pots on her own
initiative at age 10, when she visited an aunt at a factory nearby.
She left school at age 13 and became an apprentice at an
earthenware manufacturing firm where she learned how to paint
freehand on pots. She studied painting at night.
</P>
<P>
   In 1916 she applied for a job in the decorating department of a
large factory, A.J. Wilkinson. She got the job, and one of the
directors, who later became her husband, recognized her native
talent and encouraged her.
</P>
<P>
   Highly motivated, she spent her lunch breaks walking around the
factory and learning about the kilns and glazing techniques. By
1920 she was assigned to a separate studio to help the company's
two top male designers.
</P>
<P>
   By 1924 she was allowed to produce some of her own designs and
sign them ``Clarice C'' alongside the Wilkinson mark.
</P>
<P>
   She volunteered to paint the thousands of pieces of undecorated
wares in outdated shapes that the Wilkinson company inherited when
it acquired the Newport Pottery. They were in storage, and she
thought she could make them salable. The salesmen were doubtful,
but the pieces sold well. They were revolutionary in color and
design.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later she was producing her own brash designs in
brilliant ``hot'' colors. She had a group of apprentices whom she
taught to paint with unorthodox, rough brush strokes. She called
the line Bizarre and started to give public demonstrations in
London department stores. The work caught on.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was producing at a time in England when nothing as bright,
personal and vivid was available,'' Jeffery said.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff added flowers to her repertory. She borrowed children's
stick-figure drawings for children's china. She did bucolic outdoor
scenes.
</P>
<P>
   As sales increased, she applied the Bizarre patterns to vases,
teapots, candlesticks and bowls. Because they were all
hand-painted, the wares had a hand-made look.
</P>
<P>
   She studied articles in the French magazines on Desny, the Paris
design firm. She created her own Deco shapes, from conical sugar
sifters to angular, Cubistic vases.
</P>
<P>
   The wares were stamped ``Bizarre by Clarice Cliff.'' Many were
best sellers during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new shapes and bold colors captured the public's attention
when they first came out,'' said Johanna Freidwall, Phillips'
pottery specialist in London. ``They were unlike anything that
people had seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Now art director of the factory, Cliff seemed to have caught the
mood of the late Jazz Age; her customers included celebrities from
the stage, screen and radio.
</P>
<P>
   Cliff worked as manager and artist until the outbreak of World
War II, trying to maintain the momentum of her earlier success. But
she found it increasingly difficult. ``She was jolly but
impractical,'' said Muir Hewett, owner of Art Deco Originals in
Halifax, England. ``After the war, the work fell off. I think she
lost interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Cliff died in 1972 after years of failing health, oblivious to
the budding new interest in her work.
</P>
<P>
   Today, people collect Cliff wares by date, style, shape or
pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly by pattern or shape,'' Jeffery said. ``The English
prefer smaller items like the conical sugar sifters, so they can
display a lot of them together, to show the different patterns.
Americans tend to like the larger pots, and they sell for a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   One note of caution: Wedgwood has done authorized reproductions,
which are clearly marked, but other companies have made copies. Be
on the alert if a Clarice Cliff piece is too cheap _ a good piece
may cost $500. There is even a Web site to help with
that:www.claricecliff.com/fakes/.

SHORT MOVIE REVIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend. (Star) denotes a
highlyu recommended film. Ratings and running times are in
parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``AFTER LIFE,'' starring Arata, Taketoshi Naito and Erika
Oda. Directed by Hirokazu Kore-eda (not rated, 118 minutes). Much
of this transcendentally compassionate, gently humorous Japanese
film is set in a drab office building where courteous caseworkers
welcome the week's new clients. The place turns out not to be a
social service agency but a metaphysical way station where the
newcomers are people of all ages and types who have just died and
have three days to select one memory to take with them into
eternity. Before they depart, those memories will be filmed. As
they tell their stories and make their choices, the movie becomes a
profound meditation on life's meaning and value and the
relationship of movies, memories and dreams (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME,'' starring Mike Myers,
Heather Graham and Elizabeth Hurley. Directed by Jay Roach (PG-13,
95 minutes). There may come a time when even Austin Powers tires of
the words ``Oh, behave!'' but it isn't here yet. Although the
sequel with the fab title is several love beads short of its
predecessor and more than a few scenes play like outtakes, this is
still a crafty, intermittently hilarious comedy. Myers' neo-Sellers
multiple-personality act is fine even when the material is less so,
and this sequel makes the most of Dr. Evil, his most inspired
creation. A scatological Scotsman, the film's walking id and
bathroom joke, is more of an acquired taste. Costumes and pop
references are still a hoot, as is the adorably benighted Austin.
Ms. Graham makes terrific eye candy but doesn't share Ms. Hurley's
quick-witted air of being in on the joke (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``BIG DADDY,'' starring Adam Sandler, Cole and Dylan Sprouse,
Joey Lauren Adams, Jon Stewart and Leslie Mann. Directed by Dennis
Dugan (PG-13, 95 minutes). It's awfully early in the career of Adam
Sandler to find him sharing the screen with a scene-stealing
6-year-old (actually the Sprouse twins). Besides, the cute kid in
Sandler's movies is usually the star himself. But he's in a
position to do whatever he likes, even if it's a flimsy sentimental
comedy with more product plugs and fewer laughs than might have
been hoped for. Having greatly expanded his following with the
romantic comedy and '80s kitsch of ``The Wedding Singer,'' not to
mention the inspired rustic lunacy of ``The Waterboy,'' he falls
back on much less inventive material this time. And the barrage of
brand-name junk food is enough to make skin break out in the
audience (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER,'' starring John Travolta, Madeleine
Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy Hutton and James Woods. Directed by
Simon West (R, 118 minutes). Murder on a military base was once
enough of a pretext for a detective thriller, but nowadays it takes
more. The prevailing sleaze quotient calls for kinks, and this
galling adaptation of a Nelson DeMille best seller is happy to
oblige. So the title character, a pretty young officer whom the
film thinks has no place in the military, is the victim of a lurid
crime. Travolta and Ms. Stowe affably investigate whodunit, though
the unraveling of the crime is laughably arbitrary. The real point
of their ponderous investigation is that the victim asked for what
she got (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``AN IDEAL HUSBAND,'' starring Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver,
Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore and Jeremy Northam. Written and
directed by Oliver Parker (PG-13, 97 minutes). The best thing about
Parker's likable but diluted screen adaptation of Oscar Wilde's
1895 comedy of politics and Victorian morality is Everett's
portrayal of Wilde's elegantly epigrammatic alter ego Lord Arthur
Goring. In underplaying this seemingly incorrigible (but actually
wise, witty and caring) rake, Everett makes him all the more
charming. Northam and Ms. Blanchett are well cast as a politician
and his priggish wife, but Ms. Moore and Ms. Driver miss hitting
the right notes in a screenplay that streamlines Wilde into a
quasi-contemporary style, keeping some but not all of the
playwright's scintillating bons mots. The settings are so lavish
they're almost edible (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``LIMBO,'' starring Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and David
Strathairn. Written, directed and edited by John Sayles (R, 126
minutes). Part survivalist drama, part satirical portrait of
contemporary Alaska, Sayles' powerful new film is almost as vast as
the great outdoors it contemplates. Ms. Mastrantonio, as a
well-traveled folk-rock singer working Alaskan lounges, and
Strathairn, as the brooding local fisherman with whom she becomes
involved, make one of the most compelling adult couples to be seen
in an American film in quite some time. When they find themselves
castaways along with her teen-age daughter on a remote Alaskan
island, the movie becomes both a suspense thriller and a sorrowful
meditation on survivalism, civilization and the ties that bind.
Though marred by an abrupt ending and glaring literary devices,
``Limbo'' is eminently worthwhile (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE LOVERS ON THE BRIDGE,'' starring Juliette Binoche and
Denis Lavant. Directed by Leos Carax (not rated, 125 minutes). A
1992 one-of-a-kind cult film, famed for an amazing set that
recreates Paris' Pont Neuf and part of the Seine, and for the
stubborn determination of its director to see his film through. A
beautiful half-blind artist (played enchantingly by a scrappy young
Ms. Binoche) and an indigent alcoholic fire-eater are the title
characters, and that alone is enough to make this romance an
acquired taste. But there's no denying the visual loveliness of its
most rapturous moments or the power of its daring (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``NOTTING HILL,'' starring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.
Directed by Roger Michell (PG-13, 105 minutes). The most romantic
notion here may be that a Hollywood star as famous as Ms. Roberts
might be out, unassisted, browsing for a book. But it's enough to
bring her together with Grant's bashful bookseller and let two
extraordinarily charming actors play out an intelligent flirtation.
As written by Richard Curtis with frequent wit and welcome echoes
of his ``Four Weddings and a Funeral,'' this is a bright, winsome
romantic comedy that's as teasing as the characters themselves,
inviting the audience to ponder the movie star's burdens of being
world famous and desperately attractive (Maslin).
</P>
<P>

nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``THE RED VIOLIN,'' starring Samuel L. Jackson, Jason Flemying,
Greta Scacchi and Don McKellar. Directed by Francois Girard (not
rated, 130 minutes). ``The Red Violin'' follows the colorful
300-plus-year journey of a priceless violin from its construction
in an Italian workshop in 1681 to a contemporary auction in
Montreal. As it makes its way from Vienna to England to China, the
instrument becomes the inspiration for some richly photographed
historical tableaux. If the movie's narrative energy is undermined
by a plodding screenplay and wooden acting, the music, composed by
John Corigliano and played by Joshua Bell and the London
Philharmonia Orchestra, is sublime (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT,'' with the voices
of Trey Parker, Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman. Directed by Parker
(R, 88 minutes). The movie spinoff from the outrageous Comedy
Central cartoon series following the adventures of some
potty-mouthed third-grade boys in the Colorado town of South Park
is extremely funny and jubilantly obscene, with several sewers'
worth of bathroom humor. It is also a smart, pointed satire that
demolishes the hypocrisy of a conservative culture that allows
almost unlimited violence and gore in movies and on television but
goes ballistic at the prospect of children being exposed to dirty
language and sexual explicitness. When a group of tykes sneak into
a Canadian movie filled with obscenities and come home spewing
smut, their parents raise such a ruckus that the United States
declares war on Canada. Armageddon looms when the Devil, who has
been having a troubled affair with the recently deceased Saddam
Hussein, decides to put in an appearance. Contributing to the
madness are 15 clever songs spoofing everything from Rodgers and
Hammerstein to ``Les Miserables'' (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SUMMER OF SAM,'' starring John Leguizamo, Adrien Brody
and Mira Sorvino. Directed by Spike Lee (R, 145 minutes). This raw,
enthralling evocation of a Bronx neighborhood gone mad in 1977
plunges its audience headlong into a pre-AIDS libidinous frenzy. It
also summons an atmosphere of macho posturing and mounting
prejudice reminiscent of ``Do the Right Thing'' a decade ago,
though the locals this time are white Italian-Americans. The
killing spree of David Berkowitz is used as a catalyst, joining
disco, punk, drugs, a heat wave and the Yankees to summon the
crazed spirit of that time. The characters are thin, but a fine
cast brings them to life. Leguizamo (in high ``Saturday Night
Fever'' style) and Brody (with hair in spikes) are outstanding as
the film's two most visible signs of the times (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``STAR WARS: EPISODE I _ THE PHANTOM MENACE,'' starring
Liam Neeson, Ewan McGregor, Natalie Portman and Jake Lloyd.
Directed by George Lucas (PG-13, 132 minutes). Stripped of hype and
breathless expectations, Lucas' first installment offers a happy
surprise: it's up to snuff. It sustains the gee-whiz spirit of the
series and offers a swashbuckling extra-galactic getaway, creating
illusions that are even more plausible than the kitchen-raiding
raptors of ``Jurassic Park.'' While the human stars here are indeed
reduced to playing action figures, they are upstaged by amazing
backdrops and hordes of crazily lifelike space beings as the Lewis
Carroll in Lucas is given free rein. The ``Star Wars'' franchise
was funnier and scrappier when it was new. But it simply wasn't
capable of this (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``TARZAN,'' with the voices of Tony Goldwyn, Minnie
Driver and Nigel Hawthorne. Directed by Kevin Lima and Chris Buck
(G, 88 minutes). No need to wonder how this animated Tarzan movie
could improve on the 47 others that preceded it. Disney animation
turns the hero into a supple, long-haired hunk, lets the apes talk
to him and whooshes through lush jungle settings with exultant
agility. This ``Tarzan'' is sprightly and likable in ways that are
hard to resist, with lively vocal performances, excitingly kinetic
animation and Phil Collins singing tunefully in the background.
Parents will stay awake, and children will be charmed (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``WILD WILD WEST,'' starring Will Smith, Kevin Kline and Salma
Hayek. Directed by Barry Sonnenfeld (PG, 107 minutes). Another big,
lavish movie with no there there. This post-Civil War James Bondish
contraption-happy sci-fi film is hard to categorize, a quality not
to be confused with originality. Directed by Sonnenfeld without the
deadpan-alien sensibility that worked for ``Men in Black,'' this
stylistic grab bag is similarly kinky but a lot more chaotic,
however heroically Smith, as a newly hunky and debonair action
hero, tries to save the day. Good-looking but dopey, with an
emphasis on toylike but vaguely ghoulish special effects. A movie
with that much potential kiddie appeal didn't have to start in a
bordello, either (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE WINSLOW BOY,'' starring Nigel Hawthorne, Rebecca
Pidgeon and Jeremy Northam. Written and directed by David Mamet (G,
110 minutes). Terence Rattigan's play about the 1910 schoolboy's
trial that created a furor in England has been artfully pared down
to its essentials in this stately and deliberate adaptation. Played
with unusually effective restraint by a fine, meticulous cast, it
works as a precisely calibrated war of nerves in which the family
of a cadet accused of theft is quietly staggered by the
consequences of that accusation. Benoit Delhomme's cinematography
is beautifully lucid and painterly. Ms. Pidgeon's defiantly arch
acting style sets the film's tone and gives her suffragist
character a sharp edge (Maslin).  &QL;

NASCAR WANTS TO INTEREST MINORITIES IN RACING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICK ZIER   
 THE LEDGER, LAKELAND, FLA.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In part because of its origins in the deep South and in part
because it is still often stereotyped as a sport of good ol' boys,
stock car racing has had little appeal to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, with NASCAR spread across the country and beginning
to infiltrate more urban areas, stock car racing attracts little
interest in the black community.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say it hasn't made inroads.
</P>
<P>
   Brian France, NASCAR's senior vice president and part of the
France family that rules the sport, attended a recent conference
sponsored by Rev. Jesse Jackson's Rainbow Coalition in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went just to let them know we're interested in promoting
diversity,'' France said. ``We'd like to see more minorities
involved with racing.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference came at about the same time former Olympic star
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, her husband Bob Kersee and Kurt Roehrig, who
presently has a team in NASCAR's truck series, announced they were
getting together with the object of forming a Winston Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   At the present time, there are no black sponsors, car owners,
drivers or crew chiefs in stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   The only black team that has achieved any success in the sport
was a family operation headed by Wendell Scott, who drove regularly
from 1961 through 1971. In 1964, Scott won what was then the
equivalent of a Winston Cup race in Jacksonville, Fla., and for
four straight seasons, 1966-69, he finished in the top 10 in points
with his best a fifth in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   But as NASCAR moved away from the small, independent operations
into today's technical, high-priced teams, there has been no
minority participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know when we'll see a black driver in the Daytona 500,
but we need to find ways to make it easier for minorities to get
into the sport,'' France said.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, France said, NASCAR will form a diversity council to
assist minorities in getting resumes to the right people, and will
also try to interest minority firms, such as BET, a black
television network, in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a marketing standpoint, you always want your audience to
be getting younger and bigger,'' France said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we plan to do is institute an intern program for
minorities in NASCAR with all our offices involved,'' France said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be more difficult from a competitive standpoint. Before
any blacks are competing in the Daytona 500, they will have to get
into short-track racing and work their way up.
</P>
<P>
   For that to succeed, NASCAR needs to interest minority youth in
the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about just throwing money at it; a lot of guys have
done that and never gone fast,'' France said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a program in Philadelphia where they have an
inner-city racing league with go-carts to attract kids,'' he said.
``We would have an interest in seeing more of that.''

<P>
   Larry McReynolds has a decision to make, only it isn't really
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds, the crew chief for Mike Skinner, has been trying to
start his own team for two years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he failed to find a sponsor and he is rapidly reaching
the point of no return for 1999 as well.
</P>
<P>
   At last weekend's Daytona's Pepsi 400, McReynolds said that if
he didn't have a sponsor in place by the end of this week, he would
not go forward with his plans.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, McReynolds set June 15 as a drop dead date for
starting his team. Then he extended the deadline to July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even my wife, who has not been vocal about anything we've
done, she told me I couldn't move the deadline any more,''
McReynolds said. ``She said it wasn't fair, and she was right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the racing side, I've got to have an answer real quick,''
McReynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   He needs an answer, he said, because he owes answers to Skinner
and car owner Richard Childress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what I'll do if it doesn't work out,'' McReynolds
said. ``It's something Richard Childress and I will have to sit
down and talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds, one of the most successful and respected crew
chiefs, left a long association with Robert Yates to become Dale
Earnhardt's crew chief in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he prepared the car in which Earnhardt won his first
Daytona 500. After that Childress, who owns the cars driven by
Earnhardt and Skinner, decided the team would have better chemistry
if McReynolds took over Skinner's car. So after 13 races in 1998,
McReynolds became Skinner's crew chief, a position he still holds.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds' goal, though, has been to be a car owner, and he has
been pursuing that with his partner, businessman John Dangler. If
they can find a sponsor, Dangler will oversee the operation while
McReynolds concentrates on the car as crew chief.
</P>
<P>
   If McReynolds sticks to his latest deadline, though, it appears
likely that he will be unable to form his own team.
</P>
<P>
   Established operations are now getting ready for the 2000
Daytona 500. If McReynolds, who will be starting from scratch,
doesn't get going soon, he won't be able to get competitive cars
built in time.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds said he had been talking with two potential sponsors.
One was believed to be BellSouth, which sponsors the car driven by
Joe Nemechek, and the other was Tide, which recently ended a
nine-year association with Ricky Rudd.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth apparently backed off because it did not want to be
involved with sponsoring two cars, and the buyout price to
terminate its contract with Felix Sabates, who owns Nemechek's car,
was too high.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, Tide switched to Cal Wells, who owns a CART
team (open wheel racing) and is moving into Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's over with. That's done,'' McReynolds said. ``We've got
one more company we're working close with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meetings have gone well, but it isn't done yet, and I've
learned not to judge it until they either say yes or no,''
McReynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   McReynolds would not identify the company he is still
negotiating with, other than to say it is presently in Winston Cup
as an associate car sponsor. It is believed McReynolds is talking
with Burger King.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The peony is a hardy flower. Its theatrical
counterpart has survived 400 years in China and now a trip across
the Pacific. It has been thwarted by bureaucrats at home, shortened
and modernized abroad. Now, as ``The Peony Pavilion,'' it faces
another test: maximization. Placed at the center of Lincoln Center
Festival '99, Tang Xianzu's wandering epic of love, death and the
supernatural is testing the endurance of both its players and its
audience: 6 episodes, 20 hours, the cycle to be repeated three
times this month.
</P>
<P>
   The production, originally by the Shanghai Kunju Opera, was to
have been in New York precisely a year ago, but Chinese officials
in a late-hour fit of moralizing (though other reasons may have
been in play) found this ``Peony Pavilion'' unfit for export. The
director, Chen Shi-Zeng, was encouraged to try again. Sets,
costumes and props already belonged to Lincoln Center and its
co-producer in France, Festival Paris d'Automne. The leading lady,
Qian Yi, and a key musician, Zhou Ming, made their way to the
United States. New singers and instrumentalists for this populous
and complicated event were recruited both in and out of China, and
all parties decided to try again. The restart began on Wednesday
with ``Episode I: The Interrupted Dream'' at the La Guardia Concert
Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the outcome, a great adventure is at hand;
interpreting a Ming Dynasty entertainment intended for the affluent
16th-century Chinese home for the delectation of a Manhattan
audience strains simile and metaphor to their limits. We are given
translations in the form of surtitles and plenty to read about
history and style. But we _ even the Westerner who speaks Chinese _
are necessarily at a distance.
</P>

   Literary Chinese speaks in layer upon layer of allusion,
references learned as much by osmosis as by study. Think of sports:
the European will understand the rules of baseball and the American
those of soccer. Less easy to come by is the culture and history
that suffuse these rules. Yet if we approach ``The Peony Pavilion''
with humility and are ready to take much on faith, we shall be
happy. Some of its pleasures are unambiguous: the stunningly
beautiful costumes, the dancelike gesture of the players, the
extraordinary sense of decorum. The swooping vowels and slushy
consonants of Chinese speech are a music in themselves, and the
music itself _ simple pentatonic language accompanied in equally
simple unison _ is delivered in the thin, sharp whining tones of a
very different style of singing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Chinese dress, decor, music and poetry, this
production is as much a Western invention as a re-creation of old
China. The tools of the early-music movement and the principles of
authenticity are brought to bear, even though the Chinese
themselves have little idea of what those first performances were
like. There is no history of ``The Peony Pavilion'' having been
done complete.
</P>
<P>
   Completeness is an idea more indigenous to European and American
musicology and current notions of textual integrity. Performing
tradition in China has come down orally over the centuries, and we
all know how stories change with new tellings.
</P>
<P>
   The music, we know, was adapted from existing compositions. The
story is unclouded: a beautiful girl who pines away for lack of
love, a student's posthumous love for her, and finally a happy
ending rising up from the grave.
</P>
<P>
   We are also aware of the great impact of ``The Peony Pavilion''
on those who read and saw it later. The emotional traumas and
occasional suicides surrounding this work are similar to the
emotional stir that swept Europe in the wake of Goethe's ``Sorrows
of Young Werther,'' a faraway literary sensation 200 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Huang Hai Wei's set is luxurious and literal, wrapping itself
around the proscenium end of this small ampitheaterlike space. The
pavilion roof is at the center, the 10 musicians in a box at stage
left, and a working pond is to the front, stocked with ducks,
goldfish and waterlilies and hung on its edges with bird cages
(also operative). Dressing areas to the rear are left exposed, and
occasionally at stage right players sit for makeup and costume
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to represent, if only obliquely, the freewheeling
atmosphere of a Chinese opera theater. Audience members on
Wednesday were encouraged to emulate their Chinese counterparts by
coming and going freely during this uninterrupted three-hour-plus
evening. Some did, gingerly; most didn't, sitting sedately with
their hands folded. Hardly authentic behavior given the ruckus of
the real thing: no milling, sunflower-seed spitting and private
conversation. If a Chinese theatergoer laughs or cries, it is not
necessarily about anything happening onstage.
</P>
<P>
   The fascinating byproduct of this venture is the eery no man's
land it occupies between East and West, a territory shared by both
performers and audience. We are intrigued, to give one example, by
the stagecraft, but from a distance. As an engine of emotion, it
does not stir us from the gut.
</P>
<P>
   All theater everywhere is artificial by nature. It is the degree
of abstraction that is so different here: beards that are
splendidly fake, men playing women, or the young playing the old.
The grace and composure, the emotional reticence, of the body that
greet passionate situations and the ritual and highly virtuosic use
of eye movement as an acting device are worlds away from
Stanislavsky or the Actors Studio.
</P>
<P>
   Western ideas of humor and drama creep into this production.
Maybe the discreet slapstick between the Tutor (Shan Jing) and
Spring Fragrance (Jia Yong Hong) is one of the touches that set off
those grumpy Shanghai bureaucrats. If there is a bridge between two
worlds here, it is Qian Yi as the heroine, Du Liniang. She is a
graceful charmer, and if there is one sequence in the final scene
that easily passes over the gulf between cultures, it comes in the
dream sequence with her lover, Liu Mengmei (Wen Yu Hang). The body
is discreet, but the eyes speak ambiguously of both innocence and
knowingness. It is a directly touching moment.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Peony Pavilion'' is a rare opportunity and something of
an endurance test. It worked hard to get to New York, and its loyal
followers will work equally hard through its six episodes. Even
piecemeal, it should be sampled.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about history or authenticity. History, in the eyes
of some, is what we know at this moment, the past being an
illusion. ``The Peony Pavilion'' is both ancient and modern, but
maybe it is simply right now.

   GREENVILLE, S.C. _ In high school, Brooke Richards was voted the
girl most likely to appear on the cover of Vogue magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Vogue exactly, but it's close,'' Richards said about
her July cover of Playboy magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old model from nearby Walhalla is clad in a gold
bikini on the July issue and is featured in a section called ``The
Girls of Hawaiian Tropic.'' The 10-page spread was shot in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting, it's an accomplishment to me,'' Richards said
at a recent magazine signing under a tent outside the Liquid
Highway, a drive-through coffee shop in Greenville. ``Some people
may not see it that way, but it is to me.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Richards has appeared nude for
Playboy. She was on the cover of Playboy's May 1998 ``Sexy Girls
Next Door'' issue and in Playboy's Girlfriends and Playboy's Book
of Lingerie in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the girl next door is spending July at Playboy founder Hugh
Hefner's mansion in Los Angeles working on her centerfold, which
comes out later this year or early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We go to a lot of parties, we hang out around the pool,'' she
said. ``A lot of limousines drive up. And we get to meet a lot of
celebrities. But being a centerfold is a lot of long days. It's
also strenuous work.''
</P>
<P>
   Response from men for her past pictorials in Playboy helped land
her on the July cover, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't sit around and think that all these men want me,'' she
said. ``It never really crosses my mind. Playboy is a collector's
item. Plus I know what I look like in the mirror when I get up. I
don't deceive myself and think I'm a big star.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't tell that to the men who came out to meet her on a
recent Friday afternoon. Many were a little tongue-tied to say
hello to a Playboy cover model in the flesh. And most kept asking,
``Are you really from Walhalla?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up there, I just moved there,'' she had to keep
repeating.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included firefighters, police officers, telephone
workers, landscapers and women getting copies signed for
boyfriends, fathers and bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Richards, who has a flirtatious sense of humor, wrote playful
messages to many of her fans.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the autographs included notes that read, ``Last night
was memorable,'' or to some firefighters, ``Thanks for the hot
time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not like the normal person you meet in Walhalla,'' said
20-year-old Joey Crowe, who had his magazine signed. ``I never
would have believed she lived in my town.''
</P>
<P>
   The magazine features her in a yellow bikini, in a blue thong
and completely naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is pretty easy to look at,'' said autograph-seeker Bubba
Britton, 25, of Greenville. ``She is handling all the attention
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-8-inch blonde beauty said she would love to parlay
that attention into an acting career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to move to Los Angeles or San Diego but I am waiting
for just the right time,'' she said. ``I missed an audition for the
lead role in `Baywatch' and I missed an audition for `Sheena
Goddess of the Jungle.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, who said she has a steady male companion, wasn't
uncomfortable undressing in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   The former tomboy said she had skinny-dipped a couple of times
as a teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little nervous at first but Playboy makes you feel
comfortable,'' she said. ``There are five to 10 people on the set
including a makeup artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, the youngest of 14 children, said some of her siblings
weren't crazy about the idea of their baby sister posing nude in a
national men's magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my sisters are really against it because they are very
religious,'' she said. ``I think being religious is great, but
being naked is just not something I think is wrong. I grew up as a
Southern Baptist. I'm not saying what I am doing is right, but I am
comfortable with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards had dreamed of becoming a model since she was 4 years
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always told that I was never going to make it,'' she
said. ``But negativity makes you want to achieve it even more.''

`GENGHIS BLUES': CAPTURING LISTENERS IN GENGHIS KHAN COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, Paul Pena, a blind San Francisco-based blues
musician of Cape Verdean descent, was listening to his shortwave
radio when he was riveted by some eerie vocal sounds on a program
broadcast from Radio Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   What captured his ear turned out to be ``throat singing,'' a
technique by which the human voice produces multiple sounds,
typically a low-pitched warbling drone (much like the sound of the
didjeridoo, an Australian aboriginal trumpet made out of hollowed
wood) accompanied by higher whistling overtones.
</P>
<P>
   The style is one of several art forms developed in Tuva, a
Central Asian republic of nearly 400,000 people, about the size of
North Dakota, on a plateau wedged between northwestern Mongolia and
southern Siberia. It is the home of descendants of Genghis Khan.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10 years, Pena worked to develop similar vocal
sounds, which he incorporated into his blues music. And in 1993,
when he learned that a group of Tuvan throat singers were touring
the United States for the first time, he attended their concert in
San Francisco and afterward introduced himself to the musicians and
sang some of their traditional songs to them. The rich gravelly
style he had developed prompted the Tuvans to nickname Pena
``Earthquake,'' and they invited him to travel to their country to
participate in its triennial throat singing contest in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Roko Belic's good-hearted, wonderfully revealing film ``Genghis
Blues'' is the record of that arduous but triumphant journey, which
Pena made with a small film crew and some friends. At the contest,
Pena, accompanying himself on the guitar, so delighted the Tuvan
audience with his performance in what is called the kargyraa style
of throat singing that he was chosen the audience's favorite. It's
easy to see why. The music Pena made was very different from the
hovering, ethereal chantlike sound of traditional Tuvan throat
singing. Muscular, earthy and aggressive, it melds American blues
music and Asian chant into a rugged Asian-American fusion.
</P>
<P>
   As ``Genghis Blues'' shows, the journey from San Francisco to
Central Asia was fraught with difficulties. Pena, who is clinically
depressed as well as blind, periodically found himself disoriented,
and the trip almost had to be cut short when his antidepressant
medication ran out. One member of the group also had a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The climate in Tuva ranges from extreme heat to cold, and life
there is rustic, with an economy still largely based on nomadic
animal herding. The film shows a sheep slaughtering ceremony, and
the serving of delicacies like the fat from a lamb's rump and a
vodka distilled from milk. But the Tuvans, most of whom practice a
mixture of Tibetan Buddhism and animist shamanism, radiate a
beatific joy. Pena's host and guide around the country was its
leading throat singer, Kongar-ol Ondar, who is said to be the
country's Elvis Presley, John F. Kennedy and Michael Jackson rolled
into one. He radiates a gracious, smiling exuberance that appears
completely unforced.
</P>
<P>
   Without being mushy about it, ``Genghis Blues'' reminds us that
music is a universal language that can go a long way toward
bridging cultural and linguistic gaps. It also reminds us that in
some ways modern telecommunications and transportation have turned
the world into a global village, enabling musical roots 10,000
miles apart to intertwine.

IN AN ITALIAN VILLAGE, A SEARCH FOR ANCESTORS DIGS UP MORE THAN
HERITAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The photo of the bright-eyed schoolgirl was a little crinkled
and brown, not much bigger than my thumbnail. She didn't look like
anyone I knew.
</P>
<P>
   But three little words squeezed onto the back offered promise of
an impossible coincidence, a pot of genealogical gold at the end of
a long and uncertain journey to the remote Italian town where my
great-grandparents were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questa e Lisa,'' it read in neatly written script. ``This is
Lisa.''
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather's sister is named Lisa. She was born 90 years ago
in Boston to Modestino and Clorinda Vozzella, who came to America
at the turn of the century from the southern Italian town of
Montemiletto. Lisa has never been to Montemiletto or, indeed, to
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet here was a clerk in Montemiletto's town hall, a stranger
who'd helped me look up family birth and marriage records, telling
me we were related and offering what she said was a photograph of
my great-aunt.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't know for sure whether the picture really was of my
relative until much later that day. But the possibility alone was
enough to convince me that trekking to this tiny town was the best
travel idea I'd ever had.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look that way from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Montemiletto is so small that even the Italian Tourist Bureau
couldn't find it on a map. My husband, Jeff, and I set out from
Rome knowing only that it was near the town of Avellino and that we
had a reservation at Montemiletto's one and only hotel. The closest
the train could take us was Salerno, about 30 miles south of
Naples.
</P>
<P>
   The view from the Salerno station was postwar bleak: a
collection of worn, charmless apartment buildings. The guy at the
train information booth had never heard of Montemiletto. We boarded
a bus and wondered what we were getting ourselves into.
</P>
<P>
   The gritty, industrial scenes we passed were hardly reassuring,
but the view turned increasingly rural as the bus began to climb
2,000 feet to our destination.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, we were delighted to find ourselves in a medieval
mountain town, complete with castle, quaint crumbling houses and
5,000 residents unaccustomed to foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of our $35-a-night pensione, Francesca and Luigi,
greeted us with excitement. We were their only guests.
</P>
<P>
   It was quiet that evening as we walked the cobblestone streets,
ignoring a light rain and the fatigue from our five-hour journey.
The few people out appeared to stare. We dined at the only
restaurant we saw, enjoying a local version of fusilli, loose coils
nearly as long as our forks, baked in a clay bowl with tomato sauce
and mozzarella.
</P>
<P>
   We awoke the next morning to find the sleepy central square
transformed into a bustling marketplace. Vendors hawked fruit and
vegetables, meats and cheese, shoes and housewares _ even live
ducks.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone we met, starting with the guy who sold us pistachios,
heard the spiel that my husband, who speaks Italian, had helped me
memorize: ``Mia bisnonna e mio bisnonno sono da Montemiletto'' (My
great-grandparents are from Montemiletto). I couldn't manage past
tense, even with Jeff's help, so I'd tack on ``cento anni fa'' (100
years ago). It got the message across.
</P>
<P>
   They would ask the name, and I'd say Vozzella and Nuzzolo, my
great-grandmother's maiden name. Nuzzolo they knew. Vozzella drew a
blank.
</P>
<P>
   We spent hours admiring piles of fennel and vats of green
olives, scanning the crowd for folks who resembled my relatives. We
didn't see any striking look-alikes, but we did see plenty of
generous schnozes and petite frames that would blend in at any
Vozzella family gathering.
</P>
<P>
   We finally tore ourselves away to head for the town hall, in a
former Dominican monastery on the main square. Two clerks, a man
and a woman, offered to help us look through the old record books.
The woman, Bruna Brogna, seized on Clorinda's maiden name. Her
husband had Nuzzolos in his family. She phoned him, quickly hung up
and announced that we were related.
</P>
<P>
   That lightning strike was followed by hours of fruitless
searching through yellowed volumes. Finally, the other clerk
discovered the problem. We'd been looking for Clorinda Nuzzolo. She
was, in fact, Angelamaria Anastasia Clorinda Nuzzolo, born
September 1871 to a shoemaker and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   We never turned up a record of Modestino's birth, but we found
one of his marriage to Clorinda on March 5, 1899. Both were 27
years old. He was a blacksmith, as was his father.
</P>
<P>
   Our digging done, the clerks told us to come back in a few hours
and they'd have the records photocopied for us. Bruna offered
something even more precious when we returned: the tiny picture of
Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   The photo had been passed down through her husband's family with
other old pictures. Bruna thought the girl was Clorinda's daughter.
That would mean my grandfather's sister, my great-aunt Bette, who
went by Lisa until her Boston schoolteachers told her that was her
``Italian name.'' Her real name, they told her, was Elizabeth,
which she later shortened to Bette.
</P>
<P>
   The coincidence was almost too great to believe. But there was
no time to absorb the news, to study the likeness of the schoolgirl
in sausage curls for any resemblance to my elderly aunt. The clerks
hustled us off to meet the mayor, who presented us with a ceramic
plaque bearing the town seal.
</P>
<P>
   Bruna invited us to meet her husband and children that evening.
At her home, built in the 1500s and topped by a red tile roof, she
served a dinner of pizza, asparagus frittata, homemade sopressata
salami and ``vino artigianale'' _ delicious, locally produced wine
that came in bottles without labels.
</P>
<P>
   The warm family reception made for a beautiful evening. Bruna's
husband, Paolo de Angelis, topped it off by laying to rest any
doubt that the Lisa in the photo was, indeed, my great-aunt, Bette
White.
</P>
<P>
   He said the girl in the picture used to write to her cousin,
Arcangela Nuzzolo. They kept up their correspondence into
adulthood. Paolo, Arcangela's nephew, had seen a letter from Lisa
about 15 years ago, when the unmarried Arcangela lived with his
family.
</P>
<P>
   Arcangela was dead now and Paolo didn't have the letter. He
couldn't remember the town or state where it had originated. But
one detail stuck in his mind a decade and a half later: Lisa's
married name wasn't Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bianca? Bianca?'' Jeff asked, translating the name in his
excitement.
</P>
<P>
   Paolo picked up a pen and wrote it down: ``White.''
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving for Italy, I'd asked my Aunt Bette about anyone
she used to write in Montemiletto. Too many years had passed. My
aunt had just lost her husband, and her health was failing; she was
in no shape to recall names or dig up an address for me.
</P>
<P>
   But she was sharp enough to recognize herself in the photo once
we returned home, full of stories of a wonderful place her parents
called home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's me,'' she marveled. ``That's my picture.''

USING HOT GROUPS TO GET MOST OUT OF UNTRADITIONAL WORKERS IS KEY TO
SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small is getting really, really big.
</P>
<P>
   Small means fast, flexible, innovative, creative. It can move
with the customer's wants and the market's desires, ahead of the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   But what do you do if you're big? How does a giant corporation,
or even a business with a couple of hundred employees, move with
the speed of lightning and the creativity of DaVinci?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be identifying and nurturing what may already be
there: untraditional types who usually don't ``fit'' in the
corporate structure. Once scorned by management as ne'er-do-wells,
these people often have what it takes to compete in a fast-paced
business environment.
</P>
<P>
   One author described such people as ``intrapreneurs,'' but they
can't move mountains alone. They need a group _ a hot group.
</P>
<P>
   Ideas on finding and nurturing such groups is behind ``Hot
Groups: Seeding Them, Feeding Them, and Using Them to Ignite Your
Organization'' (Oxford University Press, 299 pages, $25). Jean
Lipman-Blumen and Harold J. Leavitt are the authors, and management
guru Tom Peters did the foreword.
</P>
<P>
   Peters once again shows his amazing sense of clarity in a muddy
business world when he discusses the value Wall Street places on
personnel-driven companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a traditional industrial company _ circa 1975 _ the ratio
of stock market value (in dollars) to hard assets might run about
one-to-one,'' Peters writes. ``Near the end of 1998, the equivalent
ratio at Microsoft was 212-to-one. Yikes!''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft might be an extreme example, but it's not unique.
America Online has a stock market value about 1 1/2 times greater
than that of General Motors, Peters writes.
</P>
<P>
   He adds that this book is unique in business literature, and
that the authors are dead-on in discussing this business
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hot Groups are passionate, task-obsessed,'' Peters writes.
``They are the meat and the potatoes of what an organization needs
in order to fling itself productively at this shifting, wild,
woolly economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipman-Blumen and Leavitt present a thorough and detailed
discussion of hot groups, a new term but not a new concept. The
authors suggest that hot groups have been around as long as
humanity, citing such examples as the Impressionists who reinvented
art in Paris during the 19th century, the Bauhaus group in Germany
that changed architecture and the physicists who demonstrated the
possibility of nuclear fission.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' group at Microsoft is the natural example of how hot
groups work in the business world, the authors contend. As Gates is
quoted about his early days, before Microsoft:
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't even obey a 24-hour clock. We'd come in and program
for a couple days straight ... when it was time to eat, we'd get in
our cars and kind of race over to the restaurant and sit and talk
about what we were doing. Sometimes I'd get (so) excited about
things, I'd forget to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Lipman-Blumen and Leavitt show us that hot groups live
``volatile, temporary, impassioned'' lives and struggle in big
organizations. Hot groups tend to work alone and create enemies,
and are often viewed as expensive or idiotic. At the same time,
parent organizations tend to overcontrol hot groups, making them
fill out forms, dress within the company code and keep regular
working hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet, the synergies that can follow from such a Mutt and Jeff
marriage are so enormous, so awesome, that they easily eclipse the
difficulties,'' the authors write.
</P>
<P>
   To manage hot groups, Lipman-Blumen and Leavitt suggest finding
a project or subject that is specific and has ``soul.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, find qualified people who are excited by the
idea,'' they write. ``Give them lots of room, provide the best
markers of progress you can find, protect them, help them up when
they are down, and get the rest of the organization to appreciate
them. Then, give them the space they need to get the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors have a timely premise and identify a group that may
be down the hall just waiting for a chance to light a fire under
your organization.

MORE VISAS FOR SKILLED FOREIGN WORKERS TO BE DEBATED IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 11)   (FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rekindling a debate that could spread to the
presidential race, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, plans to introduce
legislation this week that would expand the number of skilled
foreign workers allowed to get jobs in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's proposal has drawn cheers from the high-tech industry
and boos from labor unions. Both groups are pivotal to the
presidential hopes of Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Each has courted high-tech leaders, hoping to gain their
blessings as the candidate who understands the modern economy and
to reap millions of dollars in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore also must avoid angering one of his core constituencies
_ organized labor, which views any foreign-workers increase as a
sellout of American workers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore has not stated his position on Gramm's measure. Nor
has President Clinton, who supported an increase last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Alejandro Cabrera says, ``While we recognize the
need for these workers, we feel the country needs to invest in our
workers at home to ensure that the high-tech industry's future is
secure.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush, speaking to computer industry leaders in Palo
Alto, Calif., earlier this month, favored boosting the number of
immigrants under the visa category known as H1-B, although he did
not say how many more should be allowed in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The limit on H1-B visas should be raised, Mr. President and
Mr. Vice President,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress established the visa program in 1990 so that high-tech
companies would be able to quickly bring in foreign workers with
special skills. Lawmakers placed the program under the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and set the number of H1-B visas at
65,000.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, the 65,000-worker quota was not met. But as the
economy boomed and high-tech companies expanded, computer firms,
saying they didn't have enough skilled workers, began to recruit
overseas more intensively. As a result, in the 1998 fiscal year,
which ran from Oct. 1, 1997, to Sept. 30, 1998, the H1-B quota was
met before Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after heavy lobbying by high-tech leaders, the
Clinton administration, which had initially opposed increasing the
number of H1-Bs, and Congress agreed to expand the program.
</P>
<P>
   The new law lifted the 65,000-cap on H1-Bs, allowing 115,000
such visas a year in fiscal 1999 and 2000 and 107,500 in 2001. The
cap would revert to 65,000 in fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the quota increase, the fiscal 1999 cap was met last
month. As a result, high-tech firms will have to wait three months
_ until Oct. 1 _ before they can again apply for H1-B visas.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's proposal, which most Democrats are expected to oppose,
would raise the cap to 200,000 and make that number permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These workers are needed to ensure the growth of America's
most important industries,'' Gramm says. ``High-tech, highly
skilled people create jobs. They don't take jobs away from
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   H1-B visa holders are largely employed in the computer and
health-care industries. They are allowed to stay in the United
States up to six years and often remain in the country permanently
by applying for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking in a worker under the H1-B program is really a last
resort used by companies when there simply isn't an American who
has the special skills needed to work on a project,'' says John
Palafoutas, spokesman for the American Electronics Association, a
Washington-based lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   He says the loss of H1-Bs until October would force many firms
to put projects on hold, which could allow foreign competitors to
get their products to market first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often a few weeks, much less a few months, means the
difference between being first and being second, and in the
high-tech industry being first usually means winning,'' Palafoutas
said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the META Group, a computer consulting firm in
Stamford, Conn., released a study finding a shortage of 400,000
electrical engineers and computer programmers in the United States.
In addition, the Commerce Department estimated last year that the
information technology industry will need an additional 1.3 million
skilled workers over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the H1-B program agree that a shortage of highly
skilled workers exists _ although some say the number is 100,000,
not 400,000. But they say the gap can be filled by retraining
American engineers and computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, these companies are looking for cheap labor
oversees so that they don't have to spend money on educating older
U.S. workers,'' says Paul Kostek, president of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a Washington-based union with
330,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Kostek says that bringing in foreign workers makes the shortage
worse in the long run because they hold down wages in the computer
engineering field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allowed wages to rise quickly instead of bringing in
cheap foreign labor, you'd see (American) people flooding into
computer science programs at universities around the country,'' he
argues.
</P>
<P>
   But Palafoutas says that ``a lot of these H1-Bs are PhDs who
have been working in one specific area for six or seven years; so
it's not something a company can just teach someone else in six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor groups insist that the H1-B program has been widely
abused. Far from having exceptional skills, most computer workers
brought in under the visas are average programmers, they contend.
Labor groups say that because the H1-Bs are beholden to the company
that sponsors them, they often are overworked and underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, visa holders can work only for the firm that
applied for their H1-B. In addition, they must rely on their
sponsor firms to process the paperwork needed to secure a green
card, or work permit for immigrants, which eventually can lead to
permanent citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, these people are indentured servants, who serve out
six-year terms,'' Kostek says.

<P>
   As Mexico City sinks beneath a wave of crime, the provinces
smolder and drug lords send corruption creeping through the
establishment, Mexico's rulers seem more interested in fighting one
another than their common enemies.
</P>
<P>
   For the country to survive as a democracy, this will have to
change _ and soon.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's presidential election of 2000, amid rising civic
sophistication and popular discontent, could oust the long-dominant
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) for the first time in 70
years. This bespeaks progress in Mexico's ongoing democratization,
but it will strain the country's fragile new institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, drug lords increase their power while
revolutionaries, nostalgic for a Marxist past, struggle to
establish their own. And the ghost of Luis Donaldo Colosio, a PRI
presidential candidate assassinated in 1994, still haunts the
landscape with the specter of political violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico totters, pulled in one direction by the inertia of its
authoritarian past and in another by the wobbly momentum of a
democratic future that is barely 11 years in the making.
</P>
<P>
   True, a democratic free-market revolution is in process and
NAFTA annually generates $174 billion in two-way trade. But
economic reforms have been only partially consolidated and so
remain susceptible to swings in the political pendulum. Backlash
often follows revolution and it is no easy task to liberalize the
oldest single-party regime in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As the elections near, it remains unclear whether Mexico's
political players will abide by democratic rules of the game.
Mexico has spent billions of dollars creating technologically
sophisticated and credible electoral institutions, revamping voter
ID cards and registration lists, and establishing the nonpartisan,
autonomous Federal Electoral Institute. But the cultural values
needed to underpin democratic governance _ tolerance, compromise
and civic participation _ remain weak. Thus although Mexico has
gained democratic pluralism it may lose governability in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico suffered through most of the 19th century at the mercy of
men on horseback. Today, as PRI dominance atrophies, the popular
allure of the ``caudillo,'' or strongman, has returned. In Chiapas,
for example, Zapatista guerrillas are held in sway by their
charismatic poet-leader, Subcomandante Marcos (the ``nom de
guerre'' of Rafael Sebastian Guillen Vicente).
</P>
<P>
   Even within mainstream politics, personality seems more
important than ideology. Thus the center-left Democratic
Revolutionary Party (PRD) remains captive to the popular mayor of
Mexico City, the leftist icon Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. Meanwhile, the
center-right National Action Party's (PAN) collegial traditions
have been overwhelmed by the ideological eclecticism, campaign
vigor and sheer force of personality of presidential aspirant
Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   When President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado named Carlos Salinas
de Gortari as his successor in 1987, a generation of old-school
politicians steeped in PRI revolutionary lore suddenly found
themselves confronted by young, free-market ``tecnicos,'' who
banished them from the banquet table of high political office and
government graft. Cardenas formed the dissident Democratic
Revolutionary Party as a refuge for exiled populists.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican democracy, then, emerged in an atmosphere of frustrated
ambition, personal rancor and family feuds _ not auspicious
circumstances for compromise. And these sentiments prevail today;
personal and ideological invective remain the rule. Mexican
politicians view winning and losing not as part of the to and fro
of electoral fortunes but as an apocalyptic confrontation between
good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   Mysterious kidnappings, semi-orchestrated demonstrations and
insurrections designed to influence politics abound. The habit of
demonizing adversaries impedes democratic compromise. Few signs
suggest that reconciliation will be possible any time soon. Thus
the proposition that more democracy leads directly to more
stability has yet to be proven in Mexico, where more democracy has
brought renewed political infighting, assassinations and guerrilla
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of political violence has become very real. The 1994
assassination of Colosio during the campaign ended 70 years of
peaceful presidential successions. The post-Colosio landscape is
populated with angry apparatchiks, ruthless drug traffickers,
scheming palace politicians and messianic guerrillas who have
sprung up like poisonous mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Every major Mexican political party has already had at least one
low-level brush with the insidious influence of drug money. The
corruption of candidates and their campaigns would permit drug
traffickers to carry out their competition for market share via the
electoral process. Overlay cartel competition on electoral
politics, and the potential for bloody conflict grows
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Should any presidential candidate be suspected of having ties to
drug traffickers, the impact on relations with the United States
would be devastating. The discovery of presidential corruption
would set American protectionists clamoring to use NAFTA's pull-out
clause. The U.S. Senate would rush to decertify Mexico. Calls for
military intervention and sealing the border could follow.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has precious few levers to pull should Mexico
fall into the hands of traffickers. Economic sanctions would do as
much harm as good, undoing NAFTA commitments, threatening U.S.
foreign investment and wrecking economic reforms. Nor is Mexico, a
huge country of almost 100 million people, a good candidate for a
Haitian- or Panamanian-style invasion to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a decertification vote in the midst of the
presidential campaign would fill the air with anti-American
rhetoric. Cardenas, who called for suspending oil sales to the
United States during the Persian Gulf War, would likely insist on
expelling American Drug Enforcement Agency agents working in
Mexico. Most mainstream Mexican politicians, eager to preserve
their nationalistic credentials, would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The recent presidential victory in Venezuela of Hugo Chavez
Frias, a former army officer and coup leader, shows how Latin
American democracy does not always produce democratic results.
Indeed, poll data suggests that Mexicans may value order and strong
government more than open democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican military has a long tradition of submission to
civilian rule, but should political parties exhaust the patience of
the nation with their petty disputes and should the moral authority
and power of the Mexican presidency erode even further, Chavez-like
figures might eventually emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Mexico has oscillated between long periods of
authoritarian rule and deadly bouts of social strife. The scars
remain, and the social and geographic fault lines run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics claim that families in extreme poverty
diminished from 31.1 percent of the population in 1989 to 21.9
percent in 1997, but the absolute number of poor remains high, at
an estimated 26 million _ over a quarter of the population. In
states such as Chiapas and Guerrero, the rates of severe poverty
are even higher, and as a consequence these regions suffer from
more extreme varieties of social protest.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative military intelligence estimates suggest that while
the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) comprises a core of
approximately 500 armed troops with another 2,500 active militants,
the movement has more than 10,000 sympathizers. Thus Chiapas
remains at risk from guerrilla violence and paramilitary activity.
</P>
<P>
   The EZLN has divided small communities along religious (Catholic
Zapatistas vs. Protestant non-Zapatistas) and political lines (PRD
Zapatistas vs. PRI non-Zapatistas). In contested areas, both rebel
and pro-government forces have been guilty of forced expulsions and
sacking the homes of adversaries. Zapatista takeovers of small
villages, turning them into ``autonomous municipalities,'' led to
pro- government atrocities such as the December 23, 1997, massacre
in Acteal, in which 45 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   One Mexican government source has estimated that the ratio of
aid money to criminal money (from drug trafficking, kidnapping and
robbery) flowing into EZLN coffers shifted from 4:1 in 1994 to 3:2
in 1998, and could reverse to 2:3 by 2001. There is no evidence yet
that the EZLN has been completely seduced by drug money (as have
Colombia's guerrillas), but the insurgents are being tempted by
criminalization.
</P>
<P>
   Especially worrisome is the kind of kidnapping campaign a
smaller radical group, the EPR (Popular Revolutionary Army), waged
against prominent Mexicans in 1994. Since then, Mexico has been hit
with a kidnapping epidemic that has struck the families of
governors, soccer heroes and music stars.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this plague is the work of common criminals or part of a
destabilization campaign mounted by political terrorists remains
unclear. For now, groups such as the EPR appear to operate
primarily in small cells with limited rural support in the states
of Guerrero and Oaxaca _ but if social unrest grows, they may ally
themselves with the radical urban poor. A troubled presidential
succession in 2000 would present the rebels with many opportunities
for mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in addition to political and drug-related violence,
Mexico's major cities are being overwhelmed by crime. With 1,450
abductions in 1995, Mexico ranks second in total kidnappings in
Latin America, after Colombia (with 3,600).
</P>
<P>
   In a diagnosis by Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa,
of the 1.5 million crimes reported in 1997, only 150,000 arrest
warrants were issued and only 85,000 executed. He estimates that
another 1.5 million crimes were never even reported because of
citizens' lack of trust in the police. The poorly paid police are
believed to be thoroughly corrupt and the perpetrators of many
serious crimes. But efforts to purge contaminated police forces
have backfired, turning unemployed cops into trained street
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to the fire, Mexico is inundated with illegal arms.
Guerrillas and drug lords are thought to possess plastique
explosives, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, M-16 and AR-15
assault rifles, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47s, Claymore antipersonnel
mines and armor-piercing ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 election will bring Mexico to trial by fire. The
sobering worst-case scenarios are by no means inevitable. Mexico's
nightmares are possible, not inevitable, futures that could become
real should the country fail to act or do so in the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   But they must be taken very seriously. Together they show just
how perilous are Mexico's opening, its transition to a free market
and its ongoing democratic revolution.

charismatic poet-leader, Subcomandante Marcos (the ``nom de
guerre'' of Rafael Sebastian Guillen Vicente).
</P>
<P>
   Even within mainstream politics, personality seems more
important than ideology. Thus the center-left Democratic
Revolutionary Party (PRD) remains captive to the popular mayor of
Mexico City, the leftist icon Cuauhtemoc Cardenas. Meanwhile, the
center-right National Action Party's (PAN) collegial traditions
have been overwhelmed by the ideological eclecticism, campaign
vigor and sheer force of personality of presidential aspirant
Vicente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   When President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado named Carlos Salinas
de Gortari as his successor in 1987, a generation of old-school
politicians steeped in PRI revolutionary lore suddenly found
themselves confronted by young, free-market ``tecnicos,'' who
banished them from the banquet table of high political office and
government graft. Cardenas formed the dissident Democratic
Revolutionary Party as a refuge for exiled populists.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican democracy, then, emerged in an atmosphere of frustrated
ambition, personal rancor and family feuds _ not auspicious
circumstances for compromise. And these sentiments prevail today;
personal and ideological invective remain the rule. Mexican
politicians view winning and losing not as part of the to and fro
of electoral fortunes but as an apocalyptic confrontation between
good and evil.
</P>
<P>
   Mysterious kidnappings, semi-orchestrated demonstrations and
insurrections designed to influence politics abound. The habit of
demonizing adversaries impedes democratic compromise. Few signs
suggest that reconciliation will be possible any time soon. Thus
the proposition that more democracy leads directly to more
stability has yet to be proven in Mexico, where more democracy has
brought renewed political infighting, assassinations and guerrilla
violence.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of political violence has become very real. The 1994
assassination of Colosio during the campaign ended 70 years of
peaceful presidential successions. The post-Colosio landscape is
populated with angry apparatchiks, ruthless drug traffickers,
scheming palace politicians and messianic guerrillas who have
sprung up like poisonous mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Every major Mexican political party has already had at least one
low-level brush with the insidious influence of drug money. The
corruption of candidates and their campaigns would permit drug
traffickers to carry out their competition for market share via the
electoral process. Overlay cartel competition on electoral
politics, and the potential for bloody conflict grows
exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   Should any presidential candidate be suspected of having ties to
drug traffickers, the impact on relations with the United States
would be devastating. The discovery of presidential corruption
would set American protectionists clamoring to use NAFTA's pull-out
clause. The U.S. Senate would rush to decertify Mexico. Calls for
military intervention and sealing the border could follow.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has precious few levers to pull should Mexico
fall into the hands of traffickers. Economic sanctions would do as
much harm as good, undoing NAFTA commitments, threatening U.S.
foreign investment and wrecking economic reforms. Nor is Mexico, a
huge country of almost 100 million people, a good candidate for a
Haitian- or Panamanian-style invasion to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a decertification vote in the midst of the
presidential campaign would fill the air with anti-American
rhetoric. Cardenas, who called for suspending oil sales to the
United States during the Persian Gulf War, would likely insist on
expelling American Drug Enforcement Agency agents working in
Mexico. Most mainstream Mexican politicians, eager to preserve
their nationalistic credentials, would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   The recent presidential victory in Venezuela of Hugo Chavez
Frias, a former army officer and coup leader, shows how Latin
American democracy does not always produce democratic results.
Indeed, poll data suggests that Mexicans may value order and strong
government more than open democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican military has a long tradition of submission to
civilian rule, but should political parties exhaust the patience of
the nation with their petty disputes and should the moral authority
and power of the Mexican presidency erode even further, Chavez-like
figures might eventually emerge.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, Mexico has oscillated between long periods of
authoritarian rule and deadly bouts of social strife. The scars
remain, and the social and geographic fault lines run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Government statistics claim that families in extreme poverty
diminished from 31.1 percent of the population in 1989 to 21.9
percent in 1997, but the absolute number of poor remains high, at
an estimated 26 million _ over a quarter of the population. In
states such as Chiapas and Guerrero, the rates of severe poverty
are even higher, and as a consequence these regions suffer from
more extreme varieties of social protest.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative military intelligence estimates suggest that while
the Zapatista National Liberation Army (EZLN) comprises a core of
approximately 500 armed troops with another 2,500 active militants,
the movement has more than 10,000 sympathizers. Thus Chiapas
remains at risk from guerrilla violence and paramilitary activity.
</P>
<P>
   The EZLN has divided small communities along religious (Catholic
Zapatistas vs. Protestant non-Zapatistas) and political lines (PRD
Zapatistas vs. PRI non-Zapatistas). In contested areas, both rebel
and pro-government forces have been guilty of forced expulsions and
sacking the homes of adversaries. Zapatista takeovers of small
villages, turning them into ``autonomous municipalities,'' led to
pro- government atrocities such as the December 23, 1997, massacre
in Acteal, in which 45 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
   One Mexican government source has estimated that the ratio of
aid money to criminal money (from drug trafficking, kidnapping and
robbery) flowing into EZLN coffers shifted from 4:1 in 1994 to 3:2
in 1998, and could reverse to 2:3 by 2001. There is no evidence yet
that the EZLN has been completely seduced by drug money (as have
Colombia's guerrillas), but the insurgents are being tempted by
criminalization.
</P>
<P>
   Especially worrisome is the kind of kidnapping campaign a
smaller radical group, the EPR (Popular Revolutionary Army), waged
against prominent Mexicans in 1994. Since then, Mexico has been hit
with a kidnapping epidemic that has struck the families of
governors, soccer heroes and music stars.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this plague is the work of common criminals or part of a
destabilization campaign mounted by political terrorists remains
unclear. For now, groups such as the EPR appear to operate
primarily in small cells with limited rural support in the states
of Guerrero and Oaxaca _ but if social unrest grows, they may ally
themselves with the radical urban poor. A troubled presidential
succession in 2000 would present the rebels with many opportunities
for mischief.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in addition to political and drug-related violence,
Mexico's major cities are being overwhelmed by crime. With 1,450
abductions in 1995, Mexico ranks second in total kidnappings in
Latin America, after Colombia (with 3,600).
</P>
<P>
   In a diagnosis by Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa,
of the 1.5 million crimes reported in 1997, only 150,000 arrest
warrants were issued and only 85,000 executed. He estimates that
another 1.5 million crimes were never even reported because of
citizens' lack of trust in the police. The poorly paid police are
believed to be thoroughly corrupt and the perpetrators of many
serious crimes. But efforts to purge contaminated police forces
have backfired, turning unemployed cops into trained street
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Adding fuel to the fire, Mexico is inundated with illegal arms.
Guerrillas and drug lords are thought to possess plastique
explosives, rocket-propelled grenade launchers, M-16 and AR-15
assault rifles, Uzi submachine guns, AK-47s, Claymore antipersonnel
mines and armor-piercing ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 election will bring Mexico to trial by fire. The
sobering worst-case scenarios are by no means inevitable. Mexico's
nightmares are possible, not inevitable, futures that could become
real should the country fail to act or do so in the wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   But they must be taken very seriously. Together they show just
how perilous are Mexico's opening, its transition to a free market
and its ongoing democratic revolution.

 MORE VISAS FOR SKILLED FOREIGN WORKERS TO BE DEBATED IN SENATE 
</HEADLINE>
 (For release Sunday, July 11)  -HNS   (FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rekindling a debate that could spread to the
presidential race, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, plans to introduce
legislation this week that would expand the number of skilled
foreign workers allowed to get jobs in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's proposal has drawn cheers from the high-tech industry
and boos from labor unions. Both groups are pivotal to the
presidential hopes of Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Each has courted high-tech leaders, hoping to gain their
blessings as the candidate who understands the modern economy and
to reap millions of dollars in campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore also must avoid angering one of his core constituencies
_ organized labor, which views any foreign-workers increase as a
sellout of American workers.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Gore has not stated his position on Gramm's measure. Nor
has President Clinton, who supported an increase last year.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Alejandro Cabrera says, ``While we recognize the
need for these workers, we feel the country needs to invest in our
workers at home to ensure that the high-tech industry's future is
secure.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bush, speaking to computer industry leaders in Palo
Alto, Calif., earlier this month, favored boosting the number of
immigrants under the visa category known as H1-B, although he did
not say how many more should be allowed in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The limit on H1-B visas should be raised, Mr. President and
Mr. Vice President,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress established the visa program in 1990 so that high-tech
companies would be able to quickly bring in foreign workers with
special skills. Lawmakers placed the program under the Immigration
and Naturalization Service and set the number of H1-B visas at
65,000.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, the 65,000-worker quota was not met. But as the
economy boomed and high-tech companies expanded, computer firms,
saying they didn't have enough skilled workers, began to recruit
overseas more intensively. As a result, in the 1998 fiscal year,
which ran from Oct. 1, 1997, to Sept. 30, 1998, the H1-B quota was
met before Sept. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after heavy lobbying by high-tech leaders, the
Clinton administration, which had initially opposed increasing the
number of H1-Bs, and Congress agreed to expand the program.
</P>
<P>
   The new law lifted the 65,000-cap on H1-Bs, allowing 115,000
such visas a year in fiscal 1999 and 2000 and 107,500 in 2001. The
cap would revert to 65,000 in fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the quota increase, the fiscal 1999 cap was met last
month. As a result, high-tech firms will have to wait three months
_ until Oct. 1 _ before they can again apply for H1-B visas.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm's proposal, which most Democrats are expected to oppose,
would raise the cap to 200,000 and make that number permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These workers are needed to ensure the growth of America's
most important industries,'' Gramm says. ``High-tech, highly
skilled people create jobs. They don't take jobs away from
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   H1-B visa holders are largely employed in the computer and
health-care industries. They are allowed to stay in the United
States up to six years and often remain in the country permanently
by applying for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taking in a worker under the H1-B program is really a last
resort used by companies when there simply isn't an American who
has the special skills needed to work on a project,'' says John
Palafoutas, spokesman for the American Electronics Association, a
Washington-based lobbying group.
</P>
<P>
   He says the loss of H1-Bs until October would force many firms
to put projects on hold, which could allow foreign competitors to
get their products to market first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often a few weeks, much less a few months, means the
difference between being first and being second, and in the
high-tech industry being first usually means winning,'' Palafoutas
said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the META Group, a computer consulting firm in
Stamford, Conn., released a study finding a shortage of 400,000
electrical engineers and computer programmers in the United States.
In addition, the Commerce Department estimated last year that the
information technology industry will need an additional 1.3 million
skilled workers over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the H1-B program agree that a shortage of highly
skilled workers exists _ although some say the number is 100,000,
not 400,000. But they say the gap can be filled by retraining
American engineers and computer programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, these companies are looking for cheap labor
oversees so that they don't have to spend money on educating older
U.S. workers,'' says Paul Kostek, president of the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a Washington-based union with
330,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   Kostek says that bringing in foreign workers makes the shortage
worse in the long run because they hold down wages in the computer
engineering field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we allowed wages to rise quickly instead of bringing in
cheap foreign labor, you'd see (American) people flooding into
computer science programs at universities around the country,'' he
argues.
</P>
<P>
   But Palafoutas says that ``a lot of these H1-Bs are PhDs who
have been working in one specific area for six or seven years; so
it's not something a company can just teach someone else in six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor groups insist that the H1-B program has been widely
abused. Far from having exceptional skills, most computer workers
brought in under the visas are average programmers, they contend.
Labor groups say that because the H1-Bs are beholden to the company
that sponsors them, they often are overworked and underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, visa holders can work only for the firm that
applied for their H1-B. In addition, they must rely on their
sponsor firms to process the paperwork needed to secure a green
card, or work permit for immigrants, which eventually can lead to
permanent citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, these people are indentured servants, who serve out
six-year terms,'' Kostek says.

LAWMAKER WATERS DOWN DOMESTIC PARTNERS BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Delivering a blow to liberals in the state
Legislature, Gov. Gray Davis urged a lawmaker to water down a major
piece of domestic partnership legislation and limit health care
benefits to state workers in same-sex relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor, who promised during his campaign to
sign a new domestic partnership law, doesn't want to require health
maintenance organizations to provide the benefit plans to private
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the state should serve as a moral exemplar,'' Davis
said Wednesday. ``We should do what we think is right, not mandate
the private sector to follow our lead. There are obviously
exceptions to every rule, but that's the line I draw.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' decision was a blow to liberal Democrats in the
Legislature who expected more support after 16 years of Republican
governors. Former Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed every domestic
partnership bill that reached his desk.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of the governor, Assemblywoman Carole Migden,
D-San Francisco, gutted her domestic partnership bill Wednesday and
replaced it with a measure allowing state agencies to provide the
benefits to workers. There are about 250,000 state workers in
California.
</P>
<P>
   With limited debate Wednesday, the measure passed the Senate
Judiciary Committee. Davis said he would sign the measure as now
written, but Migden has to get the support of the full Senate and
the Assembly again before it reaches the governor's desk. The
deadline is early September.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in Migden's bill wipes out a requirement for
health maintenance organizations and other health plans to offer
domestic partnership benefits to companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many major health plans, such as Kaiser Permanente, already
offer domestic partnership benefits, and many large companies, such
as Nike, Eastman Kodak, Disney and Chevron, provide those benefits
to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   About 570 companies, 141 colleges and universities, and 87 local
governments offer domestic partnership benefits to employees,
according to the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   But Migden's bill had been designed to help smaller companies
looking to provide domestic partnership benefits. Many of those
companies can't buy the benefits for their employees because they
aren't big enough to pressure HMOs into complying or giving them
good rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pieces that will come out of this bill are very
good steps, but they are not comprehensive,'' said Rebecca Isaacs,
political director for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
``More and more places are offering domestic partnership benefits,
and it would be good to have the HMOs on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Isaacs objected to another change requested by Davis. The bill
now defines domestic partnerships as between same-sex couples. The
original bill would have included heterosexual umarried partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would have been better to have it broader, so you
don't get into the situation of having other groups feeling
dscriminated against,'' Isaacs said.
</P>
<P>
   Migden said she wanted more from the bill, but succumbed to the
governor's wishes in order to get something passed this year.
Earlier in the year, Migden had announced Davis was ready to sign
the tougher version of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But ``at that point we had not discussed details of the
measure,'' Migden said. ``And while engaging in those discussion,
we were informed that this is the version he feels he can
support.''
</P>
<P>
   Migden's bill now looks identical to a measure moving through
the Legislature to provide domestic partnerships to state
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The other bill was written by Assemblyman Wally Knox, D-Los
Angeles, who is facing a tough election battle next year in a
heavily gay state Senate district.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' announcement that he would sign Migden's bill means
Migden would get the glory for passing a domestic partnership bill.
Knox said he would continue with his measure, but was clearly livid
Migden took his bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a longstanding tradition in the Legislature that
legislators respect each other's authorship of measures,'' Knox
said. ``Without some restraint in this area, what's to stop
outright piracy of each other's bill on a daily basis? If someone
asked me to steal another Assembly member's bill, I'd tell them
no.''

`AMAZING' ALS PATIENTS AID RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (ART ADV: PHOTO HAS BEEN MOVED TO NYTNS CLIENTS)  
 (ADV: WITH SIDEBARS ALS-2 AND ALS-3)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The hard part about having a fatal disease in 1999 is
that the promises of miracle cures, genetic antidotes and
biococktails twinkle all around like lights of distant rescue ships
_ too far off to be of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very maddening,'' said Kevin Spicer, afflicted with Lou
Gehrig's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish those breakthroughs would be available right now,
before the disease takes over more of my body.'' Lacking the muscle
control to speak, the Tucson man communicates these thoughts
through his computer e-mail system.
</P>
<P>
   Spicer's disease, named for the baseball legend who died of it
in 1941, is scientifically known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,
or ALS.
</P>
<P>
   ALS gradually destroys the motor nerves, causing muscles to
atrophy, leading to paralysis. Arizona's 250 to 300 victims of Lou
Gehrig's disease know that three to five more years of life is the
most they can expect after diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Though the disease has no cure, many of its victims do not sit
and wait. An estimated 20 percent of Arizonans with ALS, including
Spicer, are enrolled in research projects.
</P>
<P>
   They explore, looking for something that works, something that
will extend their time and give them a fighting chance. And even
those who have given up on their own chances often want to do
something that will help others, turning their personal tragedies
into something of value to medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the best ALS antidote is a drug called Riluzole. But
it lengthens life by only three to five months.
</P>
<P>
   So nationally, a flood of medical experiments is now probing
ALS, giving sufferers an opportunity to be involved in the search
for answers.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, at least four major studies are under way at Mayo
Clinic Scottsdale and at the University of Arizona. Barrow
Neurological Institute in Phoenix also is nationally known for its
research on ALS, though it doesn't have a study under way
presently.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is easy about ALS; it's even difficult to diagnose.
Doctors usually identify it only by observing how the person walks
or speaks, and by eliminating all other possible diseases. The one
left is ALS.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a way to spot the disease earlier is a priority research
project at UA. Dr. Valerie Cwik is using magnetic resonance imaging
technology to track the chemical indications of neuron loss in the
brain, a research path she hopes will lead to earlier diagnosis and
to better tracking of the disease's course.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Bosch of the Mayo Clinic Scottsdale, meanwhile, is
experimenting with implanted pumps that deliver a potent drug
directly into the cerebrospinal fluid canal. He is hoping that it
will increase survival time. The medication slowed the progress of
the disease in laboratory rats, but a later human trial was not
successful. Better delivery of the drug, through use of the pump,
might make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch is also testing new pills that might slow the progression
of the disease and increase survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biology of ALS is better understood now, and we are
finding ways to slow down the disease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In all the ongoing Arizona research projects, doctors comment
that ALS patients volunteer readily and are unusually brave, almost
cheerful, in the face of their fate. It may help that ALS is
usually not physically painful.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the experience of being alive seems more clear and
interesting when the end of life comes suddenly into view. One of
Bosch's late patients told him that this was the luckiest time of
her life because it made her appreciate every moment.
</P>
<P>
   To make that experience last as long as possible, some ALS
patients are willing to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   George Pittman, 61, of Tucson, recently brought his wife, Sally,
and his 11-year-old grandson with him to his appointment at the
Mayo Clinic. His implanted medicine pump was due for a checkup and
refill. He reported some sleeplessness and tingling sensations
throughout his body _ potential side effects of the medication.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch asked him if he wanted to reduce the dosage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gosh, no!'' said Pittman emphatically, adding that he could
live with the side effects if the drug gave him any chance of a
longer life. He looked at his wife and grandchild. Not long ago he
was playing golf in the top of health.
</P>
<P>
   It all started in January 1998, when he fell a few times while
jogging. There was no apparent reason for it. After a seemingly
endless battery of tests with no answers from his Tucson doctor, he
came to Mayo and was given the bad news by Bosch.
</P>
<P>
   His implanted pump, the size of a computer mouse, contains, he
hopes, a new drug considered by the Mayo Clinic to be a big
improvement. There is a one-third chance that Pittman is part of
the study's control group and his pump contains only a waterlike
substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an amazing group of patients,'' said Cwik. ``There is a
saying among ALS doctors that they have the nicest patients in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is not easy doctoring. ALS doctors at Mayo, Barrow and UA
have learned how to deal with the difficulty of telling people they
are going to die, then watching them lose body functions over just
a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cried a lot with patients and families,'' Cwik said.
</P>
<P>
   Roxanne McLaughlin, research coordinator for the Mayo ALS
studies, agrees that it is tough duty: ``When I think I can't do
this anymore, I look at the letters, poems and cards I keep above
my desk from patients and families we have helped.''
</P>
<P>
   The bestselling book ``Tuesdays with Morrie'' is about the
wisdom of a thoughtful ALS patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get life lessons five or six times a day like those in that
book,'' McLaughlin said. ``So many of the patients are so
accommodating. I wonder if I would be that generous if someone was
always asking for blocks of my time and my remaining time was so
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease may be toughest on patients who would like to
participate in the Scottsdale and Tucson experiments but do not
qualify, are too sick or live too far away.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Beck lives 4{ hours from Phoenix in Ganado on the Navajo
Reservation _ too far for him to travel. His family is relying on
traditional Native American healing ceremonies to ease his
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Though his decline continues _ he has lost his voice and most of
his movement _ they believe the ceremonies give him a psychological
boost and the hope that a cure might be found for him.
</P>
<P>
   A few ALS patients, including two Valley residents, have turned
to Jack Kevorkian to end their suffering. But most say they would
not consider that.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a rule, my patients want to live _ sometimes desperately,''
Cwik said.
</P>
<P>
   The national ALS Association neither condones nor disapproves of
assisted suicide for patients, unusual for a mainstream medical
group.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizonans who went to Kevorkian were Nicholas Loving, 27, in
1995, and Shahla Semino, 46. Semino was one of Bosch's patients,
and the first of his patients to take her life that way. He had no
indication that she was going to do it, except that, on her last
appointment, she hugged him and said goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   He later watched a farewell video she left behind, and, with her
family, accepted her decision. ``I don't want to reach the point
when I would not be able to wipe away my own tears,'' she said in
the video.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he shakes his head, saying, ``She had at least two years
to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that those two years can be expensive, sometimes costing
as much as $200,000, Bosch has written letters to Congress urging
changes in Social Security disability and Medicare coverage rules.
The way the law is now written, many ALS patients die before the
eligibility requirements for treatment and benefits are fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   For those who want to hang on for as long as they can, there
are, in fact, glimmers of hope on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   New promising gene research, for instance, may lead to a cure.
</P>
<P>
   Bosch has been involved in eight studies since 1993, seven
involving experimental drugs. Another test is being planned for
later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Next on Cwik's agenda is a study using a drug that may control
emotions that sometimes are magnified by ALS _ laughing and crying
can be uncontrollable in some patients. Maybe there is a clue
there, she hopes.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, she will measure the effect of exercise on ALS
patients. ``You lose the nerves going to the muscle. We don't know
if more exercise is good, indifferent or damaging.''
</P>
<P>
   ALS patient George Pittman has volunteered to help her find out.
</P>
<P>
   He was recently in an exercise video that ALS patients who also
participate will see. He jokes that he is the Jane Fonda of ALS
exercise tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I volunteer for everything they have,'' he said. ``Bring them
all on. This at least gives you hope.'' &QL;

RORIE'S LAST DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (ART ADV: PHOTOS HAVE BEEN MOVED TO NYTNS CLIENTS)  
 (ADV: WITH ALS-1 AND ALS-3)  
 By WENDY L. MARSHALL  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - My sister, Rorie Susan Buchanan, died in the middle of
the afternoon on Oct. 14, 1997, of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS) _ also known as Lou Gehrig's disease _ a fatal neurological
disorder that causes a progressive degeneration of the motor cells
in the spinal cord and brain.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to function normally, the motor neurons in the brain stop
sending the impulses required for muscles to work, so they atrophy,
especially those in the arms and legs, and those that involve
speech, swallowing and breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Lying motionless in a hospital bed in her living room in Three
Rivers, Mich., morphine tricking her brain into thinking her body
was not in distress, Rorie had been semiconscious for at least a
day. Her husband, children, mother, son- and daughter-in-law, and
close friends stayed with her until she finally closed her eyes,
smiled a little smile and died.
</P>
<P>
   Months before, when she could still get enough air into her
lungs to force it past her larynx and speak, she had confided that
she was afraid that when her lungs failed, death would be like
drowning. That was her nightmare. After all she'd been through, she
just wanted to die peacefully, life leaving her gracefully like a
dancer gliding across a ballroom floor. That image gave her
comfort. She loved to dance.
</P>
<P>
   When Rorie was 12 and I was 11, the P.E. teacher at Coronado
Elementary School in West Covina, Calif., made us forgo the usual
outside activities and dance. Every Friday, with the boys lined up
on one side of the cafeteria and the girls on the other, she would
turn on the record player, go down the roll sheet of fifth- and
sixth-graders, assign partners, and make us assume the proper
stance for the box step. For the next 30 minutes, she would shout
out the cadence and the movements we were supposed to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't look at your feet to see if you are doing it right,''
she would yell as she walked around the room making adjustments to
adolescent bodies. ``Just dance.''
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Rorie was a klutz. She was tall and gangly, and
couldn't seem to get arms and legs organized into one cohesive
unit. She could, and did, break her arm while fixing her hair in
the bathroom _ she slipped and hit the sink. She hacked a gaping
hole in her shin while demonstrating the finer points of using a
hand ax to eager young Camp Fire Girls at a summer day camp. Still,
she loved to dance, and, frankly, over the course of our growing
up, she achieved some grace on the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-five years later, it was that grace her family would look
for.
</P>
<P>
   In the exact opposite of that P.E. instructor's admonitions, her
children wanted desperately to watch Rorie's feet _ every step,
every shuffled inch _ so that they might learn. They hoped that, in
the dance, there would be a great lesson, a great message. They
wanted her to teach them about life so they could live after her
death.
</P>
<P>
   But Rorie was used to being in charge of her life, in charge of
her home, and her fiercely independent spirit made this new dance
difficult. &QL; 
(begin ital) 3/23/97: I want her to seep into my skin, to tell me
everything now, so I will always have her with me. But our
relationship isn't like that. She made it perfectly clear from the
beginning that this was her disease and she would handle it her
way. Decisions would be made by her and Dad. End of discussion. We
kids were not included, but we all wanted something to do,
something to focus on. Doesn't she understand? Doesn't she see that
we still need her as a mom? No one will ever take her place. I feel
a hole already. (end ital) (Oldest daughter's journal)
</P>
<P>
   Rorie's three kids were only in their late teens and early 20s.
They watched her feet every day and measured what life was left
when her steps faltered. They struggled with an intensity of
emotions they'd never experienced before because, despite all
evidence to the contrary, the world had shifted.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)
</P>
<P>
   4/1/97: I remember when my mother sat me down and told me what
was wrong with her. I don't remember the next few minutes . . . All
I could think of was, yeah, right. This isn't funny . . . as I went
about the next few months . . . I decided to pretend I didn't care
. . . I thought if I didn't have to think about it, it wasn't true.
Boy, was I wrong. (end ital) (Youngest daughter's journal)
</P>
<P>
   I was lucky, in a way: I lived more than two thousand miles
away. I didn't have to watch her lose every shred of modesty,
privacy and dignity. My mother's sadness was palpable whenever I
talked to her. She was breaking the cardinal rule of parenting: She
was going to outlive her child.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)
</P>
<P>
   4/23/97: Awakened this morning by a call from Rorie. She wanted
me to do something for her and I couldn't understand her. I was so
frustrated and so angry that it reduced me to tears. It's so hard
to see her go through this. I want to do SOMETHING, anything to
help her and I can't do one thing to make it go away. (end ital)
(Mother's journal)
</P>
<P>
   Rorie's children were asked to do things for their mother that
children are not normally asked to do. They had to bathe, dress,
feed and tend to toilet care. They had to shave her legs, put on
her makeup, brush her teeth and her hair. They were at the dinner
table the first time she choked on her food. It frightened
everyone. Her husband raised her right arm over her head and
pounded on her back like he used to do when the kids were small.
The rest of us jumped up and away from the table, not knowing what
to do and not knowing what to say after the episode was over.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)
</P>
<P>
   7/3/97: How do you look your sister in the eye and joke about
something as small as a kernel of rice taking away what little
breath she has? I saw the fear in her eyes and she saw it in mine.
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   No one knows what causes ALS, but it usually strikes adults
between the ages of 40 and 70. Unfortunately, there have been
plenty of people who have died in their 20s and 30s, as in Gehrig's
case. Once thought rare, between two and seven of every 100,000
people in the United States are diagnosed with ALS. According to
the National Institutes of Health, more than 5,000 new cases are
identified every year _ about 14 cases a day. The ALS Association
now estimates that some 300,000 men and women who are alive and
apparently well today will eventually die of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrig, first baseman for the New York Yankees, was called the
``Iron Man'' because he set a major league baseball record of
playing in 2,130 consecutive games. His last game in the streak was
on April 30, 1939, after which he told Yankees manager Joe McCarthy
to take him out of the lineup. By doing so, Gehrig ended the streak
that he had begun June 1, 1925. He was in a slump and felt that he
was hurting the team. ALS took him out of the game he loved.
</P>
<P>
   It took Rorie out of her game too.
</P>
<P>
   It was Feb. 20, 1995, when Rorie was essentially taken out of
the lineup. She was certainly never an athlete. She could barely
bounce a ball. She was a daughter, sister, wife, mother,
grandmother, secretary, bookkeeper, hostess of the annual Christmas
house circuit in her little town, a member of the bell choir at her
church, a neighbor, a friend.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)
</P>
<P>
   7/5/97: My sister has a disease named after a New York Yankee.
Unbelievable. She doesn't even like baseball. Football is her
passion. She's a hardcore Denver Broncos fan. What about a second
opinion? A third if she has to. Screw the insurance company. How
did she get this? Will I get this? Will anybody else in the family
get this? Tell me you have breast cancer. I know what that is. I
would know what to do, what questions to ask and where to go to ask
them. There would be chemo. You might lose your breasts, your hair,
your appetite, your sense of taste and smell, but you'd have a
chance. You'd crawl through hell, but at least you'd have a chance.
There's no chance with this. None.
</P>
<P>
   (end ital) Jean-Martin Charcot, a French neurologist, first
identified ALS in 1869. Although they vary with each individual,
early symptoms include frequently dropping things, tripping,
slurred speech, muscle cramps and twitches, abnormal fatigue of the
arms and/or legs and uncontrollable periods of laughing or crying.
The symptoms usually manifest themselves first in the hands or the
feet, making routine daily chores difficult. As the weakening and
paralysis spread to the muscles of the trunk, ALS eventually
affects swallowing, chewing and breathing.
</P>
<P>
   The sick irony of ALS is that although it ravages the body, the
disease leaves the mind and the senses intact. Patients can feel an
ant crawling across their arm. They just can't lift their arm and
shoo it away.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)
</P>
<P>
   8/14/97: It would be easier if she wasn't aware of everything I
do and say, and the way I do it and say it. She was the one who
told me that you could say anything you want to a baby as long as
you say it with a smile. My grandmother tells me to be gentle. How?
I don't feel gentle. I don't know what I feel. Anger? Fear? All of
that! Everybody has shared more of my mother's life than I have.
She'll never see me graduate from college or get married. She won't
see my children. All she sees is the anger because right now,
that's all I have. Lou Gehrig died too long ago. Why the hell
hasn't somebody more recently famous gotten this disease? Then
there would be somebody and all his friends thumping their chests
and screaming, ``Don't let him die. We have to find a cure.'' Well,
I'm thumping, and I'm screaming. ``Don't let my mom die.'' Is
anybody listening? (end ital) (Youngest daughter's journal)
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-eight years have passed since Gehrig died, and doctors
still don't know what causes ALS. There is still no one conclusive
test, so it becomes a long process of elimination _ determining
what a patient doesn't have _ in order to tell them what they do.
There is still no treatment or cure. There is no federally funded
research, no poster child, no telethon, no voice.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, researchers identified a defective gene on Chromosome
21 as the potential cause of an inherited form of the disease,
familial ALS. But only a small percentage of the cases diagnosed in
the United States are considered to be hereditary. Typically, cases
are classified as sporadic ALS, which is the form of the disease
that Rorie had. Earlier research at Johns Hopkins University
Hospital proposed that glutamate, an amino acid responsible for
carrying messages between brain cells, may be involved. After it
has done its work in the brain, the glutamate is supposed to be
reabsorbed by a special protein called a transporter. ALS
researchers suspect that a defective transporter, unable to absorb
enough glutamate, destroys the motor neurons in the brain. Still,
more research is needed to test the validity of the Johns Hopkins
theory and to see whether drugs can be developed to address the
glutamate-absorption problem.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)
</P>
<P>
   9/7/97: So now my sister has a bad gene? She didn't know it.
None of us did. You couldn't miss the obvious manifestations of her
gene pool _ a head full of thick, auburn hair, dark-brown eyes and
delicate ivory skin splattered with thousands of tiny freckles. I
guess the bad gene was there too, or so the researchers say,
lurking inside her 5-foot, 11{-inch frame on Chromosome 21.
Unfortunately, that little speck on Rorie's DNA spiral was a fatal
flaw. Makes you wonder how any of us survive. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Looking at Rorie's feet was her family's foundation. As long as
she was still leading the dance, they only had to follow. The
thought of guiding her across the floor was terrifying. They knew
it was coming. We all did. But no one wanted that role. Her family
members yelled at each other out of frustration and exhaustion.
They said things, hoping the anger would keep the ALS at bay and
keep Rorie on her feet. They wanted her to dance and to be alive,
to be conscious once more of her chest expanding with a lungful of
air.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)
</P>
<P>
   12/25/97: I miss her. I miss her. I miss her. Every day. All the
time. I hear a song . . . it hurts. Everything somehow ties in to
the pain of her leaving. I don't feel her here anymore, and no one
told me how lonely that would leave me. I keep waiting to feel her
here with me. I want it to be over neatly, and I never want to
forget her. Now there's a paradox. There isn't a beginning to the
feelings and emotions, and there isn't an end. I fight for an
answer. I fight the hurt. Right now, I'm losing. I want a hug from
my mom. Mom knows what to do and to say to let me cry. Mom knows
how to make me feel better. (end ital) (Son's journal)
</P>
<P>
   I was at work when Rorie died, but before I got home to get the
telephone call from my mother, I received an e-mail message from a
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Dear Gang: I had a very fleeting image this
afternoon of a smiling Rorie on her way. I could have sworn she was
dancing. (end ital) &QL;

   UNDATED - Now, after all the people have left, all the thank-you
cards have been signed, all the friends have expressed their
sympathy, and the ashes are at home awaiting the journey to Hawaii,
I can sit down and tell our story. Maybe it will be of help to
someone.
</P>
<P>
   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: What a name for a diagnosis that
dooms the patient to death. No cure, no real government research
support, no FDA support of drugs that can ease the burden, no
insurance company understanding of the need for coverage, and no
real time frame other than an average life expectancy of three to
five years after diagnosis. Some patients have gone longer, but
most last less. If it's not diagnosed early _ and there are still a
lot of doctors who don't know what to look for _ it can be too late
by the time a diagnosis is made for anything to help.
</P>
<P>
   ALS gets the young, the old, man, woman, priest, secretary,
rich, poor, wife, husband, brother, sister. Less than 5 percent of
the cases are inherited. It affects walking, talking, eating,
breathing. Wheelchairs, canes, ramps, hospice, home health care,
beds, special diets, support groups, church, work, community. All
become a part of your day. &QL; 
OUR JOURNEY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Rorie and I were in San Francisco. I was on business, and, with a
long weekend, we decided to take some time for us. We had noticed
that she had started to slur her speech _ not always, just
occasionally. Someone had commented that after one glass of wine,
she was smashed. That's what led her to believe what the family had
been trying to tell her for months. Something was not right. She
also was having trouble with her right foot. Two episodes of
tripping and falling. (The foot doctor said all she needed was some
corrective surgery and all would be healed. What a dork!)
</P>
<P>
   A small thyroid problem was discovered, and she began medication
to treat it. That helped somewhat, but the slurring and foot drop
were not getting better. An MRI was next. What else could be
causing this? Brain tumor? Cancer? All of the really ugly (or so we
thought) diseases. But nothing showed up on the MRI. Now what? The
doctor suggested we consult a neurologist.
</P>
<P>
   We were scared _ not terrified, but anxious about what might be
causing this. Our attitude was that we'd just get another opinion
if we didn't like the first one. Besides, we had plans and dreams.
Rorie was going back to school to finish her degree; I was going to
work until she had a job, and then retire and become a flight
instructor. Great plans. ``Man plans and God laughs.'' &QL; 
QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Begin ital) When did you first notice the speech problem? When
did you first have problems with your foot? Have you noticed muscle
twitches? Let's do an exam, and then we can talk.
</P>
<P>
   I have noticed what we call fasciculation _ muscle tremors. I
would like to do one more test, an EMG, where we will be inserting
a needle into different parts of your muscles and measuring the
impulses or motor neuron signals to be absolutely sure of what I
think, but I am pretty sure of your diagnosis: ALS. Have you ever
heard of it?
</P>
<P>
   (End ital)
</P>
<P>
   Silent shock! ALS. We were very familiar with it. A friend had
died recently after battling ALS. Now we were devastated. Not MS,
not a tumor, not something ``simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis was confirmed by the EMG and a neurologist who
specializes in neuromuscular diseases. No mistake. We tell him
thank you. We have to come back in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ALS. We caught our breath. We cried. We hugged. We went home.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet in the house. Tears. Talking without really talking. Both
of us trying to work it out. OK, we can work with this. ALS, we can
do this. We're OK. No we're not.
</P>
<P>
   What to do. Whom to talk to. Let's get as much information as
possible before we have to go back to the doctor. Call the National
ALS Association. Don't tell the family until we're sure. Hold out
hope that maybe, just maybe, the tests will show something else. We
could live with MS.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, the kids are asking, ``How's Mom? What did you
find out?'' Info has come from the various sources. It doesn't
really say anything other than we're in for the ride of our lives
and to send away for even more info.
</P>
<P>
   All the test results are back, and the diagnosis is confirmed
again. ALS. Maybe we should try the Ford Clinic. Cleveland? Mayo?
Houston?
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) But are you 100 percent certain?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. (end ital) &QL; 
THE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One daughter away at school. Son here. Other daughter in Ann
Arbor with her newborn son _ our first grandchild. He's struggling
to make it after surgery to repair his heart. Another whole story.
</P>
<P>
   We have to tell them straight. Tell them all at the same time.
Varied reactions. All sad, but all hoping that there will be hope,
help, a new drug. Let's get busy gathering data. This is our new
project, educating us so we can help Rorie. Daughter leaves college
and moves home.
</P>
<P>
   Rorie's sisters are in the hunt, too. Everyone is trying to help
us find a miracle out there. New drugs reported in various rags and
relayed by friends and family, but none have been approved. You
have to get in the lottery for a chance to get them. The first few
times we're rejected but told our request will go into the next
pot. It's expensive.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) How long until we hit the insurance cap? (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Another project. Now we have to decipher insurance coverage and
definitions. The beginning of the hard questions. Who will take
over the information gathering? Who will put their life on hold?
Close friends _ actually family by default since ours live so far
away _ circle the wagons. Nancy, Rorie's best friend and surrogate
sister, says she'll be there no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ALS, family and friends. The first requires the other two.
Without them, nothing can get done. This is not a disease that can
be handled alone. You find out what a friend is. You find out just
how very much you can't do by yourself. &QL; 
THE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK. We need to plan. Go over wills and get a durable power of
attorney for health care. What's our financial position? Let's not
panic. We still have some time. Continue to work until it's too
hard to get into the job. Stick with the vacation plans. Let's talk
about remodeling the house. A bedroom and bath on the first floor.
Maybe another car that's easier to get in and out of.
</P>
<P>
   Initial panic, then a resigned atmosphere that we need to stop
worrying and live as much as possible. A few months pass.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I'm not dying from ALS. I choose to live with it.
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   She's braver than I give her credit. There's no real
breakthrough in the medications. The FDA doesn't consider this a
serious enough affliction to warrant a lot of time. Congress
doesn't fund ALS research. The doctors and researchers who are
fighting for a cure are almost alone. New drugs, new hope but no
cure. (Later, there will be a bill before Congress funding ALS and
neuromuscular disease research and putting pressure on the FDA to
get off its butt and let ALS patients have Myotropin, a drug that
has proven to add a few months to their lives. Initially, the FDA
couldn't be bothered.)
</P>
<P>
   We went to Hawaii. A few years earlier than expected, but it was
now or never. Our community, our friends pooled their
frequent-flier miles and hotel coupons so we could go. It was a
second-honeymoon dream to get there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Rorie really can't enjoy the beach. She's not steady enough to
stand and let the waves roll over her feet and ankles. The sand is
too hard for her to walk on, so we sit and watch others enjoy it.
It's a little difficult getting into the pool, but this is where
she wants to be. The legs work underwater. We take a helicopter
tour and an airplane ride _ open cockpit. She's afraid of flying in
anything smaller than an airbus. She flew with me a few times in a
single-engine Cessna but never really liked it. Now she's giving me
an open-cockpit biplane ride and not a word of complaint.
</P>
<P>
   It's peaceful here. She's happy. Maybe we'll just stay until . .
.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) No, let's go home. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Hand in hand. Slow, deliberate. Dragging the foot.
</P>
<P>
   January: (begin ital) Let's go to the mountains. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Great time. Bought a cane. It helps with the walking. She loves
the mountains. Spent a lot of time in the Colorado Rockies when she
was younger. &QL; 
ANOTHER PLATEAU
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALS is a disease of plateaus. Always down, never up. The job has
to go. It's getting too hard to get into the car and drive. Almost
tripped in the lobby. The kids are worried. People who overhear her
talk wonder if she's had a stroke or if she's been drinking. The
kids press for medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Shouldn't we have it?
</P>
<P>
   No, not yet. Give her dignity a little while longer. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   We go to the support group in Ann Arbor. Hopefully, we can find
one closer, but our grandson is still in the intensive-care nursery
and it gives Rorie a chance to see him and to hold him. The support
group is depressing. One man without the use of his legs, though
perfectly able to talk and eat. Another with a respirator since he
caught pneumonia, but still very active. Some old, many young. And
still no hope.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Will I be like that?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Let's move. A house with everything on the same floor. Abandon
the big house. She loves to entertain, but it's not much fun
anymore. It's become too hard to do all the preparations and then
watch people look at you like you're disabled or shout as though
you were deaf. Without the muscle control of the diaphragm, she
can't generate enough air to speak above a whisper. Speech therapy
is next. Later, perhaps oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) No respirators. No heroic measures. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   A do-not-resuscitate order in the living will.
</P>
<P>
   Time again for her family reunion. This time, it's on board a
cruise ship out of Los Angeles. It's a long way away, it's
expensive, but we go. She wants to see the family. She spent a lot
of time with her cousins growing up. We'll take the wheelchair. It
gets us on early and in line first. Big family gathering and a good
way to get away from home and doctors. Cousins strain to understand
her when she talks. They sit with her, push her wheelchair in port.
Push her around the dance floor in the disco. They know they
probably won't see her again. Tears. Hugs. Tough goodbyes. We
decide to stay longer in California and visit the cabin at Lake
Arrowhead where we spent our first honeymoon. We take the kids.
Lots of good memories. Lots of sad ones now.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time she asks, (begin ital) Why did I have to get
this damn disease? (end ital)  &QL; 
HOSPICE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The family is finally starting to realize the end is drawing close.
Time to take more time to smell the roses. The newest plateau is a
hard one: We need to start thinking about some help. Up in the
morning to help with the bath and dressing and toilet care. Home at
noon. Home early from work. She doesn't want strangers helping her
do such private things. Spend a lot of time doing maintenance
things late at night _ laundry, cleaning, paying bills.
</P>
<P>
   A new word enters the vocabulary: caregiver. A new job, only
more intense. Husband, lover, friend for almost 30 years. Now this.
For better or for worse. Strong statement. How many can live it?
</P>
<P>
   A decision has been made to ``talk'' about hospice. She's not
ready, but we need them. Angels enter the house: Hospice workers
give 110 percent and ask for nothing in return. $100 per day.
Limited days for now. More later.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company says it won't pay for hospice. OK, let's
drag them into the 20th century. We can put Rorie in the hospital
for $1,000 per day, or they can approve hospice. Another battle. An
OK, very grudgingly, with a $20,000 cap. (This becomes another
battle later when the cap is exceeded.)
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) So, who cares? Sign 'em up. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   There's a retirement fund that can pay if needed. After this,
who's going to work another 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   Hospice comes three days a week, a few hours a day. Rorie
finally gets used to the angel _ Mary _ who is going to be her
friend, nurse, bather, dresser, listener. Mary becomes part of our
family. The family grows ever larger with great friends who
volunteer time, meals, errands or to just hang around for company.
Our church family gets its marching orders from Nancy. Judy,
Rorie's other surrogate sister, starts a weekly lunch visit _ food,
dishes, talk, listen. Judy and Nancy are a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   We decide to take a weekend away with Nancy and husband Steve.
Up north in wine country. We used to do this all the time, but now
it's more important. Good time, even with having to lug the
wheelchair up a steep staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas. Rorie's favorite season. She always goes overboard
decorating. The girls try to do it the way their mother would.
</P>
<P>
   Hospice is now fully involved, and Nancy, a home-health-care
nurse by trade, announces she's adding Mondays, her normal day off,
to fill the gaps in Rorie's care. Our oldest daughter, whose son is
still critically ill and requires in-home nursing care, takes
Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Our son moves to Florida to go back to school. His mother tells
him to go and get on with his life. Don't put it on hold because of
her. She will miss him, and it pains her to see him go. She worries
when he and his wife drive non-stop for two days each time they
come home to see for themselves how she is doing. &QL; 
ANOTHER PLATEAU
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Equipment: chair, bath aids, suction machine, hospital bed. Over
the next few months, it all ends up in the house. A motorized
recliner is needed for comfort and ease of moving her. Another
fight with the insurance company. The doctor has ordered it, but
the insurance company doesn't think it's needed. So what? Insurance
workers should be given a six-month case of a disease that they
have to live with to get a taste of how their industry treats
people.
</P>
<P>
   Rorie spends most of her day in her recliner. Her legs ache, and
she needs me to adjust her position several times each night. More
time in the chair and a start at considering the hospital bed. The
regular bed is getting too hard to work with. She's exhausted. We
all are.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I don't want to give up sleeping beside you. It's
the last of so many things lost. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The hospital bed stays in the garage for a while longer, and she
sleeps in the recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Eating is becoming a drawn-out affair. Even though swallowing is
becoming difficult, she eats what everyone else eats. No feeding
tube. Meals take on a new light. Eventually, it takes more than an
hour to feed her. Meals start early and end late. Thank God for the
people who drop a meal by. A lot of chicken. Sometimes something
special and different. Grateful for it all.
</P>
<P>
   We're all tired. Nerves are frayed. We're spending about 14
hours a day as caregivers. Demands are high. For better or for
worse, in sickness and in health. If this schedule continues, we'll
need to consider alternatives. Respite care, a nursing home. But
she wants to stay home. I want her to stay, but I can't give much
more.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I'm tired. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the start of a hernia from lifting her in and out of bed,
in and out of her chair, in and out of the shower, the commode. I'm
not sleeping. Hospice is concerned. Her care is taking a lot out of
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance cap is met. Another fight for a (begin ital)
reasonable (end ital) amount of coverage. If we don't win this one,
I'll quit and take my retirement to pay for care. It's three weeks
before the company can make a decision. I hope none of them ever
need this kind of care, or do I? They need to live this to
understand. Cap is increased from $20,000 to $35,000. We're at
$28,000, and hospice is billing about $1,800 a month. Do the math.
Maybe a nursing home for a while, just to get a respite. Hospice
can get us in for about $125 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Another plateau: This time it's big.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I want to see my mom. I want to see my son. I'm
tired of fighting, and I want to rest. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   More candid talks late at night about us, the last 30 years, the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally in the hospital bed. She knows, we all do.
</P>
<P>
   It's done. A few days of being there. A few days of not.
Sometimes she's awake, sometimes coherent. The drugs help. We have
to keep increasing the dosages to help with the breathing and the
peace of mind. It's not going to be pretty. The kids are all here.
Her mom is here. Say goodbye now. Don't wait.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Promise to take care of everyone. Promise. (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   30 years gone.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to go back to Hawaii, ashes spread with orchids on the
sea. &QL; 
IT'S OVER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, we did all this. Over three years. Some days went fast. Some
went very slow. It was physically very demanding the last few
months. Mentally, you think you are prepared, but you're not. I
can't believe how ingrained our routine had become. Days after the
funeral, my youngest daughter and I were both up in the middle of
the night ready to move her, stretch her legs, help her get
comfortable. But she wasn't there. The hospital bed, everything was
folded up and in the garage waiting to be taken away. Katie and I
stood there in the dim light of the hallway and realized there was
nothing for us to do. Rorie didn't need our help anymore.
</P>
<P>
   People say they don't know how we coped for so long. We're a
family, and we did exactly what was required to make Rorie
comfortable for as long as possible. Toward the end, we were tired,
sick and worn out beyond comprehension, but we did what we had to
and blocked out the outside world for a while.
</P>
<P>
   We did the best we could.  &QL;

 &HT;    LOAN DEFAULTS THREATEN 14 COLLEGES' AID, REPORT SAYS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Soaring default rates on student loans threaten the
existence of 14 historically black colleges and universities, a
government-sponsored corporation reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae,
said the schools had default rates of 25 percent or more during the
last three fiscal years. Under a 1998 law, these schools could be
declared ineligible to provide need-based federal financial aid for
their students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these 14 institutions would close if they could not
participate in federal financial aid programs,'' warned the report.
</P>
<P>
   The schools must submit default management plans to the U.S.
Department of Education and have three years to improve their
default rates.
</P>
<P>
   While the overall default rate on student loans at all four-year
colleges and universities is about 6 percent, the problems of
student debt extend far beyond these 14 historically black
institutions, emphasized Albert L. Lord, Sallie Mae's vice chairman
and CEO. ``This issue is rather color-blind, frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Department of Education lists 45 schools _ mostly
community colleges and for-profit trade schools _ that face
immediate expulsion from the federal aid programs because of their
high default rates.
</P>
<P>
   The Sallie Mae study focuses on why so many students at these
particular historically black colleges don't repay their loans and
recommends ways to reduce the default rate.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 14 endangered colleges, 13 are located in the South. All
largely educate students from families with low incomes. More than
half of their undergraduates came from families with annual incomes
of below $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the report found that poor students are the
least likely to repay their loans. It found that 53 percent of the
students who defaulted came from homes with annual incomes of
$10,000 or less, while another 22 percent had family incomes of
between $10,000 and $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that the troubled institutions lacked the
technology needed to track student data. Many lost track of
students who transferred to other colleges, for instance, and could
not inform them on ways to defer payment rather than to default.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 historically black colleges and universities involved in
the Sallie Mae report were Allen University in Columbia, S.C.;
Arkansas Baptist College in Little Rock, Ark.; Barber-Scotia
College in Concord, N.C.; Central State University in Wilberforce,
Ohio; Huston-Tillotson in Austin; Jarvis Christian College in
Hawkins, Texas; Lane College in Jackson, Tenn.; Mary Holmes College
in West Point, Miss.; Miles College in Birmingham, Ala.; Paul Quinn
College in Dallas; Southwestern Christian College in Terrell,
Texas; Texas College in Tyler; Texas Southern University in
Houston, and Wiley College in Marshall, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommends that the schools develop a default
management team that includes the school's president and other
campus leaders. Because the defaults are related to retention rates
and other issues, the problems go beyond the financial aid office
and must be addressed by faculty and other administrators, said
Kenneth Redd, the Sallie Mae researcher who wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping students in school reduces the default rate, the report
indicates, so it advocates ``more mentoring, academic advising,
peer counseling and tutoring'' to prevent dropping out.
</P>
<P>
   Alumni even figure into the equation, said Redd. The schools
with default problems have meager endowments and, thus, less money
of their own to provide to needy students.
</P>
<P>
   The report also urges more counseling on debt management and
consumer finance for students.

 `FOUNTAIN OF THE BAKCHISARAI': KIROV REVIVES A '30s CURIOUSITY  
 (bl)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The kind of weight and urgency that helped make ``The
Fountain of the Bakchisarai'' so thrillingly exotic on film in 1953
are no longer a part of dance.
</P>
<P>
   To see the work today _ as presented by the Kirov Ballet in a
staging by Sergei Radlov of the 1934 original by Rostislav Zakharov
_ is to see not less, perhaps, but something very different. If the
ballet were a tapestry, it would look more like the work of Matisse
than the rich hangings designed by Valentina Khodasevich for this
production, given the even musical flow of the dancing and the
somewhat abstracted acting.
</P>
<P>
   Altynai Asylmuratova came closest to a blend of the two
generations in a New York role debut as Zarema, the jilted, loving,
favorite wife of the Tatar leader Girei, on Wednesday night at the
Metropolitan Opera House. Ms. Asylmuratova's slender, arching body
radiated pathos. Her face was a mask of tragedy so believable _ and
so hauntingly like portraits of Anna Pavlova in the 1920s _ that
Ms. Asylmuratova's curtain-call smiles were startling.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica Part was appropriately youthful as Maria, the Polish
princess with whom Girei falls in love. But her bouncy,
girl-next-door portrayal, well-danced as it was, gave no hint of
the sadness that was to come in her somewhat more believable third
act, when Maria, alone in a foreign country, is stabbed to death by
Zarema. Ilya Kuznetsov was elegant in his slower moments but rather
bland as Vatslav, Maria's fiance. Vasili Sherbakov was superb as
Girei's wild high-flying lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Ponomarev repeated his stirring performance as Girei,
his stretched arms, expansive chest and heel-bound strides
suggesting the wide wind-torn prairies of an alien land and culture
in an intriguingly modern-looking stylization. The lead cast was
completed by Elena Chmil, Alexandra Iosifidi and Petr Stasiunas.
Boris Gruzin conducted Boris Asafiev's shapeless score. (Bring back
Minkus, one balletomane muttered.)
</P>
<P>
   ''The Fountain of the Bakchisarai'' will be performed Saturday
afternoon at the Metropolitan.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Fran Drescher Tries New Cure
</P>
<P>
   Add the Nanny to the list of television types taking to the New
York stage.
</P>
<P>
   Details are still being worked out, but it looks likely that
come this fall, Fran Drescher will star in ``Sweet Deliverance,'' a
new comedy by Eric Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The play, which is expected to begin rehearsals in November with
a Broadway opening scheduled for December, will have a staged
reading on Monday at an undisclosed, Off-Broadway theater.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Drescher, best known as the sexily obstreperous caretaker in
the CBS comedy ``The Nanny,'' will play Cora, a hospital intern who
transforms herself into an ``amalgam of Dr. Kevorkian and Martha
Stewart,'' the show's producer, Alexander H. Cohen, said. As that
description implies, the show's subject matter includes euthanasia,
a topic that may not scream comedy but that Cohen believes will be
in safe hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Fran is the most gifted comedienne since Mary Tyler
Moore or Elaine May,'' said Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Rich, Ms. Drescher's manager, said the play would be the
actress' first professional stage appearance in New York. Ms. Rich
said Ms. Drescher appeared in ``The Rug Merchants of Chaos,'' a
play by Ronald Ribman, at the Pasadena Playhouse in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had six years of a series, and this is kind of an
interesting turn in the road,'' Ms. Rich said.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ms. Drescher's limited theatrical credits, one theater
professional said she may be a powerful draw at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fran Drescher is an extraordinarily potent attraction for
theater parties,'' said Ronald Lee, president of Group Sales Box
Office, a ticket sales service. ``She has legions of fans that
connect to her New York brand of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   No director has been signed to the project, but Cohen said he
has discussed the play with David Warren, who most recently
received good reviews for his direction of Richard Greenberg's
``Hurrah at Last,'' at the Gramercy Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Great Minds ...
</P>
<P>
   Let the parties begin.
</P>
<P>
   Confirmation came this week that both the Joseph Papp Public
Theater and the Manhattan Theater Club will produce versions of
``The Wild Party'' next spring, and that they may play
concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   The first contestant up will be at the theater club, where
previews will begin in late January for a February opening of the
composer Andrew Lippa's version of ``Wild Party,'' based on the
lengthy jazz-era poem by Joseph Moncure March. Gabriel Barre
directs; Mark Dendy will handle the choreography.
</P>
<P>
   The Public's version, also based on the March poem, was written
by George C. Wolfe and Michael John LaChuisa and will begin
rehearsals on Jan. 11, 2000. No opening date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The Public's production has been rumored to be headed for a
Broadway theater, a suggestion given extra credence this week when
talent agents received word that performers would be paid under a
Broadway contract with Actors Equity, rather than the lower Off
Broadway rates usually paid at the Public.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Fineman, a spokeswoman for the Public, said she could not
confirm a Broadway booking but said the show was part of the
Public's 1999-2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Change for Elaine May
</P>
<P>
   Nobody could fault the 1998-99 Broadway season for lacking
serious drama. But with the exception of a few dark cacklers like
``The Lonesome West,'' it was woefully short on laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine May hopes to change that. The veteran comedian and
screenwriter has a new play in the pipeline, and her producer is
looking to make it her first play on Broadway. The play, ``Taller
Than a Dwarf,'' concerns a man and woman in a faltering
relationship. Alan Arkin, who partnered with Ms. May on last year's
``Power Plays,'' will direct. Tony Walton will design the sets.
</P>
<P>
   The producer, Julian Schlossberg, said he was aiming for a
spring 2000 opening in a mid-size Broadway theater. ``Elaine has
appeared on Broadway but never written for it,'' Schlossberg said.
``It should be a gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Was That Celsius?
</P>
<P>
   If any more evidence were needed of her British roots, Ruthie
Henshall says she enjoyed this week's weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a novelty,'' Ms. Henshall said, of New York's recent
ovenlike climate. ``We don't get summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henshall knows a thing or two about heat. For the last
month, she has been raising the temperature of the musical
``Chicago,'' playing the sexy shooter Velma Kelly. The role, her
Broadway debut, is a new one for Ms. Henshall, even if the show
isn't; in 1997, she starred as Velma's foil, Roxie Hart, in the
London production of ``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   Why the switch? ``I'd had enough of Roxie,'' Ms. Henshall said,
``But to do Velma? It was just too tempting.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Henshall, 30, said she has had remarkable luck since landing
her first acting job at 18 in a British touring company of ``A
Chorus Line.'' Since then, she's appeared frequently on the West
End, where she won an Olivier Award for ``She Loves Me,'' in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Her knack for good choices included passing on the ill-fated
spring revue, ``The Gershwins' Fascinating Rhythm,'' in favor of
another run in ``Chicago.'' Immediately after her run as Velma, Ms.
Henshall will join the cast of ``Putting It Together,'' a Stephen
Sondheim revue, set to open in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in trusting my instincts,'' she said, with a smile.
``And things keep materializing for me.''

 &HT;    Coming of age on the `Edge'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's not much cutting-edge about ``Edge of Seventeen,''
another gay-teen saga of coming out/coming of age. Still, there's
much here to like _ from its refreshingly unforced tone to its
really appealing young lead, newcomer Chris Stafford, who,
depending on the angle, resembles either a young Jim Carrey or a
young Tom Cruise.
</P>
<P>
   It's the summer of '84 in Sandusky, Ohio. Young Eric (Stafford),
a music-loving high school junior with Manhattan dreams, has taken
a summer job dishing up Tater Logs at the local theme-park
restaurant. His quasi-sorta girlfriend, Maggie (Tina Holmes), works
there, too. So does Rod (Andersen Gabrych), a bottle-blond Ohio
State student who, when asked if he has a girlfriend, says without
hesitation, ``Yeah. His name is Danny.'' By summer's end, Rod has
seduced Eric, who stops dressing like a Sandusky senior and starts
secretly frequenting the town's gay bar, the Fruit and Nut Club.
</P>
<P>
   What works best about ``Edge of Seventeen'' is the way Eric
slowly but surely edges into a new identity. Not just a new sense
of sexual orientation, but a new sense of himself as a whole.
Further, this isn't just another
insecure-but-likable-gay-falls-for-tantalizingly-insensitive-hunk
story. Rather, the film explores an impressive range of emotional
issues _ from Maggie's conflicted feelings as she realizes
something's not quite ``right'' about her relationship with Eric to
the reaction of Eric's mom (Stephanie McVay), who's spunky,
supportive, sympathetic and yet pure Sandusky when it comes to even
thinking that her son might be gay.
</P>
<P>
   The movie, a crowd favorite last year at the Los Angeles Gay and
Lesbian Film Festival, tends to run out of steam by the last 20
minutes. But it never runs out of ideas. Or intriguing emotional
situations. Plus, it has the courage to leave some things
unresolved. When Eric confesses to Angie (Lea DeLaria), the raucous
yet goodhearted lesbian who runs the Fruit and Nut Club, that he
thought things would be easier after he came out, their initial
reaction is laughter. It's followed by a knowing moment of awkward,
eyes-averted silence that tacitly acknowledges that in 1984 _ or
1999 _ being gay isn't always easy, no matter which side of the
closet you're on.
</P>

   ``Edge of Seventeen''

 &HT;    `Fanatic' addicted to cultural confusion
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hanif Kureishi, the sardonic Brit writer responsible for ``My
Beautiful Laundrette'' and ``Sammy and Rosie Get Laid'' in the
'80s, ends the '90s with another look at English culture clash.
He's gone from angry young man to miffed middle-ager, and the
transition isn't convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Son the Fanatic'' centers on Parvez (Om Puri), a Pakistani
immigrant who drives a taxi through the puddly streets of an
industrial British town. He hasn't struck it rich like old pal
Fizzy (Harish Patel), but he's a big booster of Western values.
He's thrilled when his teenage son, Farid (Akbar Kurtha), gets
engaged to the Anglo daughter of the local police chief. So when
Farid abruptly calls off the nuptials and starts selling off the
contents of his bedroom, Parvez assumes there's only one answer:
His son must be on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. He's addicted to something else _ religion, specifically,
Islam. When Farid coerces his dad into allowing a Muslim leader
into their home, Parvez finds himself crowded out. So he spends
more time with Bettina (Rachel Griffiths), a prostitute he
chauffeurs late into the night.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Kureishi fills the movie with stark conflicts _ the
women-excluding puritanism of Islam, contrasting with the
lecherous, boozy debauches of a visiting German businessman
(Stellan Skarsgard, representing the worst of Western excess). The
film heads toward a climactic street fight (similar to the one in
``Laundrette''), which pits the young Muslim radicals against the
local hookers, placing Parvez smack in the middle of a battle
between Farid and Bettina. The symmetry is all too convenient. More
damaging is the developing romance between Parvez and the
prostitute. It's tender, but scarcely plausible, and Griffiths is
stuck trying to make sense of hooker-with-a-heart-of-gold cliches,
British style.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Son
</P>
<P>
   the Fanatic''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Om Puri, Rachel Griffiths. Rated R for sexuality,
language and a scene of drug use. At the Tara. 1 hour, 32 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A culture-clash drama marred by heavy-handed
plotting.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray, Bob Longino and Jill
Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa's Elephant Kingdom'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   It has some eye-poppingly large pachyderms, but it isn't as
visually astounding as ``Everest.'' Still, this IMAX film has its
share of lovely images, including time-lapse shots of the sun
setting on the dusty horizon and a massive storm whirling across
the plain. (SM) 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' R (sexuality, sexual dialogue, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   drinking)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs,
</P>
<P>
   Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, pre-adult, R-rated high school sexcapade with
dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter between students
that's broadcast over the Internet. There's also the grossest joke
involving a beer you're likely ever to see on film. It rarely comes
close to matching the free-spirited hilarity of the embarrassingly
funny ``There's Something About Mary.'' (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tim Robbins,
</P>
<P>
   Joan Cusack and Jeff Bridges.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's marred by patches of obviousness, ``Arlington Road''
arrives in theaters with a sharp sense of timing. It's a variation
of Alfred Hitchcock's chilling 1943 film ``Shadow of a Doubt,''
hot-wired to a national nervous system that's already jolted by
heavily armed teenage commandos and Midwestern spree shooters. (SM)
1 hour, 57 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mike Myers
</P>
<P>
   and Heather Graham.
</P>
<P>
   As the world's fave dentally impaired British superspy, Mike
Myers goes back to the '60s to save his mojo from Dr. Evil and a
giant slob in a kilt (Myers and Myers, respectively). Shaggy but
still shagadelic, this worthy sequel also stars Heather Graham as a
curvy CIA operative, Seth Green as Dr. Evil's brooding son Scott
and Jerry Springer (don't ask). (SM)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Daddy'' PG-13 (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Adam Sandler
</P>
<P>
   and Joey Lauren Adams.
</P>
<P>
   It's Adam Sandler's latest money-maker. ``Big Daddy'' ties
together elements from his successful date movie ``The Wedding
Singer'' (boyish innocence and charm to woo the women in the
audience) and his even more successful yukfest ``The Waterboy''
(scatological scatting just for the boys). Throw in an itty-bitty
kid for Sandler to pal around with and you've got the makings of a
mack-daddy movie. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Blue'' R (profanity and teen alcohol abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Sexton III,
</P>
<P>
   Kate Hudson and Christina Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of those movies in which the lack of anything
interesting happening is presented as a badge of Gen-Y integrity
and coolness. Written and directed by Morgan J. Freeman
(``Hurricane Streets''), the movie introduces us to tiny Baxter,
Calif., a little hunk of nowhere driven primarily by teenage angst.
While the movie isn't intolerable, little really happens. (SM) 1
hour, 26 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Edge of Seventeen'' Not rated but there are sexual
</P>
<P>
   situations, profanity and adult themes.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   Not much cutting edge here, but this teen saga about coming out
and coming of age in 1984 small-town Ohio has a refreshingly
unforced tone and an appealing young lead (Chris Stafford, who,
depending on the angle, recalls either a young Jim Carrey or a
young Tom Cruise). What works best here is the way Stafford doesn't
just discover a new sense of sexual orientation but a new sense of
himself as a whole. (ERG) 1 hour, 40 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Election'' R (profanity, sexuality and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew Broderick
</P>
<P>
   and Reese Witherspoon.
</P>
<P>
   In this cruelly funny satire, high school teacher Matthew
Broderick schemes to thwart perky student Reese Witherspoon in her
bid for the student government presidency. The second feature from
``Citizen Ruth'' director Alexander Payne may sound like a bouncy
comedy. But it's really a
</P>
<P>
   bittersweet ode to the everyday lies people tell themselves to
justify their actions. (SM) 1 hour, 44 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' (SM) 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The General's Daughter'' R (profanity, violence, rape,
</P>
<P>
   sadomasochism)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta,
</P>
<P>
   Madeleine Stowe and James Woods.
</P>
<P>
   As a warrant officer investigating the mysterious slaying of a
female captain, John Travolta bolts on screen, barking his lines
and spitting his machismo all over the place. He's got to.
Somebody's got to turn this mess into a movie. Shot in Savannah and
disguised as an A-grade film, ``General's Daughter'' is a slick,
over-directed, overwritten and ultimately underwhelming whodunit
B-grade thriller. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 55 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Real'' R (profanity, adult sexual issues)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Silverstone
</P>
<P>
   and Brad Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   Needs to get over itself. This gay-themed film about two British
male teens and their coming-out conflicts might have been of some
interest 15 years ago. Now, it's so obvious that the only ones
who'll be interested are gay 15-year-olds. As is, ``Get Real''
bravely goes where too many films have gone before. (ERG) 1 hour,
48 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``An Ideal Husband'' PG-13 (brief nudity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rupert Everett,
</P>
<P>
   Cate Blanchett,
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Northam and Julianne Moore.
</P>
<P>
   A less-than-ideal adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play. In 1895
London, a respected politician's public and private lives are
threatened by a blackmailer who knows a secret from his past. The
fine cast is stymied by director Oliver Parker's literal-minded
approach. What remains is a well-acted, very well-appointed period
piece that becomes more stifling and less engaging as it goes
along. (ERG) 1 hour, 37 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Instinct'' R (intense violent behavior)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Anthony Hopkins
</P>
<P>
   and Cuba Gooding Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Resist your instinct to see it. Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins
plays an anthropologist locked up in a psychiatric prison
surrounded by ``colorful'' inmates. It seems that, after living for
months with gorillas in the African wilds, he went berserk and
killed two natives. Why? It's up to a psychiatry student (Oscar
winner Cuba Gooding Jr.) to pick his mind. It's twaddle. (SM) 2
hours, 4 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Life'' R (language, sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Eddie Murphy
</P>
<P>
   and Martin Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murphy and Martin Lawrence bicker for more than 60 years
in this sometimes hilarious and racially poignant prison comedy.
How they landed in a Mississippi correctional facility with life
sentences isn't nearly as important as the knack these talented
performers have for taking turns at
</P>
<P>
   generating laughs out of a throwaway script. (Bob Longino). 1
hour, 49 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Limbo'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Strathairn
</P>
<P>
   and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio.
</P>
<P>
   Independent filmmaker John Sayles is at his most
independent-minded in this intriguing and inherently honorable
movie whose parts don't add up to a satisfying whole. It's as if he
set out to make one film _ a tender, middle-aged romance told
against the backdrop of encroaching tourism in Alaska _ and then
got interested in something totally different: an unsettling
metaphysical survival tale. (ERG) 2 hours, 6 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Matrix'' R (sci-fi violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Keanu Reeves,
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Fishburne
</P>
<P>
   and Carrie-Anne Moss.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout sci-fi flick. Writer-directors Andy and Larry
Wachowski bring their sharp storytelling and visual showmanship to
an adventure
</P>
<P>
   starring Keanu Reeves that should please comic book fanatics and
mainstream moviegoers. Balancing intelligence with stunning special
effects and action, it's a movie that earns its explosions, high
kicks and cascades of spent bullets. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mummy'' PG-13 (pervasive adventure violence
</P>
<P>
   and partial nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Brendan Fraser
</P>
<P>
   and Rachel Weisz.
</P>
<P>
   Mummy, make it stop! Please! Just because a movie has desert
scenery, a hunky action hero (Brendan Fraser), hissable bad guys
and supernatural hoodoo doesn't make it an Indiana Jones flick.
You'll miss Steven Spielberg's masterful touch watching ``The
Mummy,'' a petrified mixture of retro adventure, clumsy slapstick
and minimal chills. (SM)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 2 hours, 4 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Son the Fanatic'' R (sexuality, profanity and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Om Puri
</P>
<P>
   and Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   In screenwriter Hanif Kureishi's culture-clash drama, a
Pakistani immigrant (Om Puri) falls for a hooker (Rachel Griffiths)
in ways that pit Eastern and Western values against each other. An
interesting setup marred by coincidence and cliche, including
another depiction of the hooker with a heart of gold. (SM) 1 hour,
32 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' PG-13 (profanity and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Hugh Grant
</P>
<P>
   and Julia Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Boy gets movie star, boy loses movie star, etc. Hugh Grant plays
a decent London bookseller and Julia Roberts a version of herself
(worldwide movie star) in this romantic comedy. The latest from the
writer of ``Four Weddings and a Funeral'' is old-fashioned hokum,
short on surprise but very long on charm. (SM) At metro theaters. 2
hours, 4 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Red Violin'' Not rated, but contains
</P>
<P>
   nudity and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Girard's centuries-spanning saga follows the fortunes
and misfortunes of those who come in contact with the so-called Red
Violin, carved in 1681 by an Italian master. Holding the different
stories together is a present-day auction during which violin
expert Samuel L. Jackson struggles to unravel the instrument's
tragic secret. (ERG) 2 hours, 10 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger,
</P>
<P>
   Longer &AMP; Uncut'' R (profanity, gross-out humor, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of Trey Parker,
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stone and Mary Kay Bergman.
</P>
<P>
   It offers what you expect: crude animation, cruder humor. It's
probably the most offensive (and also funniest) bit of celluloid to
ever make moviegoers shell out $7. But in its timely, sly,
self-referential way, the movie is more than that. It's a witty
cultural artifact that captures the here and now of American media
obsessions, circa 1999. It should be put inside a time capsule.
(SM) 1 hour, 21 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Star Wars: Episode I
</P>
<P>
   _ The Phantom Menace'' PG (sci-fi action/violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liam Neeson,
</P>
<P>
   Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman.
</P>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' new movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``Menace'' is
a
</P>
<P>
   remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas left out
the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also left out
memorable characters. He left out the fun. (SM) 2 hours, 11
minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer of Sam'' R (profanity, sex, violence, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Leguizamo,
</P>
<P>
   Mira Sorvino and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   This ``Summer'' is definitely long, but it's not so hot. Psycho
David Berkowitz's killing spree in New York's summer of '77 is just
one of many stories director Spike Lee tries to tell. Also in the
mix are Reggie Jackson's World Series and rising tensions among
some Italian-American homeboys in the Bronx for whom it would
already be a long, hot summer without the added stress of a killer
among them. (ERG) 2 hours, 22 minutes. C

<P>
   Animated film with voices
</P>
<P>
   by Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver,
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close and Nigel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's animated ``Tarzan'' really swings. This long-haired
dude confidently surfs through Africa's immense rain forest. He
glides barefoot on never-ending, moss-covered tree limbs like the
coolest Rollerblader you've ever seen. His feet never fail him. His
movie doesn't either. Both a little scary and a lot funny, kids
will no doubt lap up this movie. (Bob Longino)

   ``Tea With Mussolini'' PG
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joan Plowright, Maggie Smith and Cher.
</P>
<P>
   Known in 1930s Florence as ``the scorpioni,'' thanks to their
collective sting, a band of British and American expatriate women
become surrogate mothers of a young boy named Luca. Based on his
autobiography, director Franco Zeffirelli's film is an uneven but
enjoyable tale of a boy growing up in Black Shirt Italy, entrusted
to a handful of Auntie Mames. (SM)

   The IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a fictional
story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a budding teenage
paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her dino-hunting dad
(Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be a dinosaur egg
into his lab, Ally accidentally cracks it and is thrust back in
time 65 million years, when the big beasts roamed the Earth. (ERG)

   Like ``The Avengers'' last summer, this tale of 1800s agent

leaders to newborn cubs exploring and adjusting to the wild again.

 &HT;    Say bye-bye to dignity in sophomoric, sex-obsessed high school
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no dignity at the movies these days.
</P>
<P>
   Not with what Mike Myers' big, ugly Scotsman leaves for Austin
Powers to drink. Not with what those poorly drawn 'toonsters sing
over and over in the big-screen ``South Park.'' And certainly not
with any of the high school juvenilities tossed about in ``American
Pie,'' the latest gargantuan gross-out movie made for an audience
that probably shouldn't see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' is about four high school seniors. Not girls.
Girls at that age are always smarter than boys. It's about dumb
guys, a quartet of virgins so desperate for sex they make a
dumb-guy pact to finally score big by prom night.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and there's a pie in the plot, too. An apple pie. Freshly
baked by a good-hearted mom and left on the kitchen counter for her
dumb, desperate-for-sex senior son, Jim (Jason Biggs).
</P>
<P>
   Many young adult and younger moviegoers out there already have
heard through the preview grapevine what happens to that pie. It
isn't pretty.
</P>
<P>
   But it is kind of grotesquely funny. Which is also an accurate
statement about several of the jokes in ``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a raunchy, throwaway, pre-adult, R-rated sexcapade with
dirty dialogue and more than one risque encounter between Jim and a
foreign female student that's broadcast over the Internet. There's
also the grossest joke involving a beer you're ever likely to see
on film.
</P>
<P>
   Many early preview audiences _ and there have been many
pre-screenings to generate talk about the movie _ have laughed
themselves silly.
</P>
<P>
   But little in ``American Pie'' really deserves honest laughs.
The movie rarely comes close to matching the free-spirited hilarity
of the embarrassingly funny ``There's Something About Mary,''
``Pie's'' obvious inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary'' moved at a breakneck pace, and many of its grossest
moments were mere flashes onscreen. Audiences could think, ``No,
they're not going to show that, are they? They wouldn't dare.''
Then, voila. For an instant.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Pie,'' directing brothers Chris and Paul Weitz have chosen
to linger over their stinkiest stuff. As we watch our four doofus
heroes march toward their expected moments of physical bliss, the
movie becomes not just a comedy with rank moments, but a fully
formed rank comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the four guys has a tale that, every now and then,
rises above it all. ``Pie's'' jock, Oz (Chris Klein, the brainless
jock of ``Election''), starts to fall for chorus member Heather
(Mena Suvari). He's joined the choir in a bid to meet girls, and
their flowering romance evokes some genuine charm.
</P>
<P>
   But charm isn't really what ``Pie'' is about. It's about losing
your virginity _ and any dignity you ever thought you had. That it
does very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Biggs, Alyson Hannigan and Chris Klein. Rated R
for strong sexuality, crude sexual dialogue, language and drinking
(all involving teens). At metro theaters. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Gross-out is in. This is one of the grossest.

 &HT;    A taut trip on a chilling `Road'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The squeaky-clean suburbs of Washington darken into something
strange, almost hallucinatory, as a bloodied young boy stumbles
down a tidy street in the opening moments of ``Arlington Road.''
</P>
<P>
   In director Mark Pellington's paranoia thriller, the boy is
Brady (Mason Gamble), son of Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins
and Joan Cusack). They've just moved next door to Michael Faraday
(Jeff Bridges) and his son Grant (Spencer Treat Clark). These
newcomers seem like an impossibly wholesome bunch, almost a
throwback to the '50s ideal of lemonade stands and tag football in
the back yard. They're so perfect there's something off about them.
</P>
<P>
   At least that's what Michael starts to believe. A professor of
domestic terrorism, he's well-informed about our country's history
of bloody personal vendettas. In the classroom, he links Timothy
McVeigh and the Unabomber back to John Wilkes Booth, and even the
leaders of the Revolutionary War. He also has a personal interest
in the subject, since his wife, an FBI agent, died in a bloody
shootout with what appeared to be a survivalist group.
</P>
<P>
   So when Oliver vaguely describes his line of work as
``structural engineer,'' quickly hides the blueprints he's poring
over and turns out to have gone by another name in his youth,
Michael becomes convinced that the Langs are up to some deadly
secret business. His suspicions are amplified by parental jealousy.
While Grant remains aloof and distant toward his actual dad, he
finds in Oliver a safe father-figure he can talk to, someone
untainted by the shared tragedy of the death of Grant's mom.
</P>
<P>
   So is Michael onto something? Or is he having a meltdown,
letting his personal and professional lives intertwine? The movie
keeps us guessing, though it can't totally sustain its suspense. In
its second half, it becomes too moody and baroque for its own good,
relying on monster-movie shots of Robbins and Cusack to reflect
Bridges' anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Hope Davis as Michael's long-suffering girlfriend is largely
wasted in a one-note role. And Bridges has to sweat through one
freak-out scene too many. Pellington overuses the gimmick of
characters surprised by someone walking up unexpectedly behind
them, among other hokey screen cliches. Even so, Ehren Kruger's
script manages to stay a few steps ahead of us, luring us toward a
climax that's bound to be one of the most talked-about endings of
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The film's key strength is the savvy casting of baby-faced
Robbins and expert comedian Cusack. They're the sort of actors who
can switch from cozy to creepy in a heartbeat. Though it's marred
by patches of obviousness, ``Arlington Road'' arrives in theaters
with a sharp sense of timing. It's a variation of Alfred
Hitchcock's chilling 1943 film ``Shadow of a Doubt,'' hot-wired to
a national nervous system that's already jolted by heavily armed
teenage commandos and Midwestern spree shooters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arlington Road''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jeff Bridges,Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack. Rated R for
violence and some language.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 57 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A smart, unsettling paranoia thriller.

 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nighttime sky glows with summer lightning, and
the listless residents of the estate wilt in the suffocating heat.
Yet a discernible nip chills the air of the Gate Theater Dublin's
new production of ``Uncle Vanya.'' It is an emotional cold front
that lowers the temperature of Chekhov's stifling household and
leaves its members as distanced from one another as solitary
figures in a winter whiteout.
</P>
<P>
   This frosty ``Vanya,'' with a fresh translation by Ireland's
eminent playwright Brian Friel, is not destined to be a crowd
pleaser. The passions simmer so faintly, you can hardly tell when
its pilot light is on. Not even Vanya's violent stalking of
Serebryakov, the pompous professor who has ostensibly ruined
Vanya's life, has much urgency to it.
</P>
<P>
   The defining face in this portrait belongs neither to Niall
Buggy's disintegrating Vanya, nor to Donna Dent's valiant Sonya.
Susannah Harker's Yelena, the ice princess and object of Vanya's
and Astrov's affections, is the clarifying presence here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harker's performance is emblematic of the stinginess of the
Gate's production, which opened on Wednesday night as part of
Lincoln Center Festival '99. You can give yourself over to the
beauty onstage, but it doesn't offer much in return. With the
assistance of a chromatic text by Friel, whose work has often been
compared to Chekhov's, and an unobtrusively elegant set by David
Gaucher, the director, Ben Barnes, has the appropriate
accouterments. You wait in vain all evening, though, for him to do
something wonderful with them.
</P>
<P>
   At the right moments a delicate touch is the most consoling
gesture in the world. Too much delicacy onstage, and you want to
slap the hand away.
</P>
<P>
   Russian theater ensembles have an instinctively adverse reaction
to treatments of Chekhov's works as if they were made of porcelain;
these days companies like the Sovremennik and the Moscow Art
Theater employ a go-for-broke ethic with the words of their
greatest playwright, italicizing the characters' tragic romances
and existential crises. Barnes and his Anglo-Irish troupe take a
more measured approach, which has its satisfactions. The outlines
of suppressed aches _ Sonya's for Astrov; Vanya's for the life he
didn't live _ are finely etched.
</P>
<P>
   And the simple directness of Friel's translation often
invigorates the discourse. Yelena's retort to Vanya's profession of
love, usually rendered as something like, ``There's nothing I can
say to you,'' is translated here as, ``I feel nothing for you.''
The desolate effect on Vanya is abundantly clear and makes Vanya's
gun-toting pursuit of the focus of all his disappointments _
Yelena's husband, Serebryakov _ seem almost reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   Buggy, who made a splash in New York a decade ago as the
childlike Casimir in Friel's ``Aristocrats'' for the Manhattan
Theater Club, is again the main attraction. His Vanya is a sad
little afterthought of a man who might be recruited to sing
``Cellophane'' in a Slavic road company of ``Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   In a houseful of unhappiness, of embittered, spineless or
self-deluded souls, Vanya is the most fragile, and Buggy's
breakdown in the third act of this four-act play provides it with
its most affecting moments. You can sense his Vanya cracking up by
degree, and then watch him crumble completely in his confrontation
with Serebryakov (T.P. McKenna) when he coldly announces his plan
to sell the failing estate out from under Vanya and his niece
Sonya.
</P>
<P>
   But Vanya is often the only truly passionate being on the stage
of the La Guardia Drama Theater, where the production runs through
next Sunday. ``Bored, bored, bored'' is the characters' mantra, and
all too frequently Barnes and his cast give in to a burdening sense
of ennui. The actors' pauses between lines, one presumes, are
intended to give depth to the household's searing silences.
Instead, they merely add to the theatrical airlessness and to the
feeling that the director approached this project with a little too
much reverence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harker's Yelena, the petulant trophy wife who flirts
guiltlessly with Astrov even as she destroys the hopes of Vanya and
Sonya, is a case in point. Serene and shapely, she is all steely
hauteur. The performance is statuesque and virtually frozen. No
sparks are set off between Ms. Harker and John Kavanagh, whose
brilliant Joxer was a memorable part of the Gate's production of
``Juno and the Paycock'' that visited Broadway briefly during the
summer of 1988. But he is a bit remote as the dissipated heartthrob
Astrov, ``Dr. Vodka'' in Friel's terrific labeling.
</P>
<P>
   Most productions of ``Vanya'' present Sonya as plain, lovelorn
and devastatingly sad. Ms. Dent's performance is along those
classical lines; in one instance in which the silence works
beautifully, Barnes places Sonya in a doorway at the play's end as
the sound of hooves of the horses carrying her beloved Astrov fade
away.
</P>
<P>
   The other performances range from stodgy to serviceable,
although Eamon Morrissey exceeds expectations in the usually
peripheral role of Telegin, which Friel has built up considerably
for comic effect.
</P>
<P>
   What one pines for here, however, is a little more comedy. And
for that matter, a little more drama.

`DEFYING GRAVITY': WINNING A POPULARITY CONTEST BUT LOSING HIS
SOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Timeliness is the principal virtue of ``Defying Gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year after the brutal murder of a gay college
student touched the conscience of the nation, this modest,
well-meaning debut film pivots on a vicious assault on a homosexual
college student.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Defying Gravity,'' while illuminating the fraternity house
culture that is the breeding ground of this particular outburst of
hatred, is chiefly concerned with the angst of John Griffith
(Daniel Chilson), one of the fraternity brothers, and with
imparting lessons of self-understanding, decency and tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   For all its praiseworthy intentions, ``Defying Gravity,''
written and directed by John Keitel, plods along, never catching
dramatic fire, sometimes suffering from amateurish acting and often
relying on its intrusive and treacly music to impart mood and
rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Griff, as he is known, has been having an affair with Pete
Bradley (Don Handfield), while still pretending to the fraternity,
to girls on campus, to his best friend, Todd Bentley (Niklaus
Lange), and even to himself that he is heterosexual.
</P>
<P>
   Pete, who used to live in the fraternity house, is angry with
Griff, because he is keeping their affair a secret, refuses to
spend the night and cannot be counted upon for dates and a
long-term future like that the loving Todd plans with his
girlfriend, Heather (Lesley Tesh).
</P>
<P>
   So Griff and Pete agree one night to meet to talk things out.
The meeting place is a gay coffee house, where Griff feels
uncomfortable. Pete and Griff leave and argue. Just after they
part, Pete is attacked.
</P>
<P>
   The assault forces Griff literally and figuratively to look at
himself in the mirror, to understand that there are others
struggling with the same problem, like Denetra Washington (Linna
Carter), a black classmate, and with Todd's help, to come to grips
with who he is and how he feels about Pete.
</P>
<P>
   Good intentions don't necessarily make good drama.

   UNDATED _ Deja vu is the feeling you're likely to get from
``Twice Upon a Yesterday,'' at least if you've seen any of the
other films in this minigenre. In ``Twice,'' a boozing slacker
actor named Victor (Douglas Henshall) gets a second chance after
screwing up with his girlfriend. This happens not because of the
generosity of her heart, but because he meets a couple of quixotic
characters who allow him to turn back time and _ well, if he had to
do it all over again, he'd do it differently, right? Isn't that
always the way? By ROBERT PHILPOT. Story has moved in ``e''

Once scorned by management as ne'er-do-wells, these people often
have what it takes to compete in a fast-paced business environment.
One author described these people as ``intrapreneurs,'' but in

ENDING OF `ARLINGTON ROAD' ISN'T ENOUGH TO SAVE THE MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This almost never happens. ``Arlington Road'' is a clumsy and
incompetent thriller for nine-tenths of its running time but has an
ending that is so clever and goes so wildly against expectations
that it almost exonerates the film.
</P>
<P>
   Mind you, the operative word here is ``almost'' _ because, as
daring as it is, it's not enough to ultimately save this turkey of
a movie. But if you do happen to find yourself in this thing, and
you're thinking of leaving before it's over, think again.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is about a George Washington University history
professor (Jeff Bridges) who teaches a class in political terrorism
and is having a hard time getting over the death of his wife _ an
FBI agent who was killed in a botched, Ruby Ridge-like operation.
</P>
<P>
   One day, he begins to suspect that something is not quite right
with his likable next-door neighbor (Tim Robbins), and it isn't too
long before he concludes that the guy is a big-time terrorist who
masterminded a massive, Oklahoma City-like bombing of a St. Louis
federal building.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if it seems overly coincidental to have Ruby Ridge,
Oklahoma City and an academic expert in terrorism in one premise,
be warned that this is only the beginning of a string of amazing
coincidences that motivates every scene in the film.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the script _ by first-timer Ehren Kruger _ also has a
definite lunatic edge to it. It's seriously out to convince us that
domestic terrorist acts like the Oklahoma City bombing are not the
work of small groups of disaffected weirdos, but an organized
conspiracy of ``millions.''
</P>
<P>
   And this paranoia is accentuated by director Mark Pellington
(``Going All the Way''), who has a way of painting his scenes with
the broadest imaginable strokes, and encourages all his actors to
overact _ especially Bridges, who runs around the movie like Jack
Nicholson in ``The Shining.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the only real saving grace of the movie is its end,
which nicely shakes us of our cinematically induced catatonia for a
few moments, and demonstrates what a pleasure it can be when a
formuliac Hollywood dares to break its formula.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington Road. Directed by Mark Pellington. Written by Ehren
Kruger. Cast: Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis,
Robert Gossett. Screen Gems/Columbia. 117 minutes. Rated R for
violence.

`THE DINNER GAME': GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER (TO BE THE
ENTREE) 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: production notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By JANET MASLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Francis Veber's giddy, lightweight odd-couple comedies are
guilty pleasures. Enough French moviegoers know that to have made
``The Dinner Game'' the second-biggest hit in France last year,
after ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the beguiling silliness of his best French farces,
like ``Les Comperes'' before it became ``Father's Day,'' few have
traveled well. Bad things happen to Veber's fluffy conceits when
they cross the Atlantic, as evidenced by a sorry string of remakes
like ``Jungle 2 Jungle,'' ``Pure Luck'' and ``The Toy.'' ``La Cage
Aux Folles,'' which he wrote with Edouard Molinaro, is still the
best-known illustration of this filmmaker's light, remake-ready
touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put a cat and a dog in the same bag and they end up
friends, I like that very much,'' Veber recently told The Los
Angeles Times. Now ``The Dinner Game'' finds him trying that tactic
yet again, this time with a wicked twist.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that a smug, wealthy publisher named Pierre Brochant,
played by Thierry Lhermitte as the apotheosis of aging yuppiedom,
regularly joins a group of his friends in a contest to see who can
bring the biggest fool to dinner. ``The Dinner Game,'' Veber's
brightest comedy in a long while, plays off that nasty joke.
</P>
<P>
   Handsome, blue-eyed and imperious, Brochant doesn't even bother
to procure his own talent. But when he hears second-hand about an
unkempt clownish bore who makes architectural models out of
matchsticks and takes them very seriously indeed, he decides that
Francois Pignon (Jacques Villeret) must be the perfect date.
Feeling even more contemptuous after he meets this hopeless
bungler, Brochant would undoubtedly like to get the dinner over
with and lose Pignon. What Veber likes better (and the audience
will surely agree) is having the fun of watching Pignon wreck
Brochant's complacent life.
</P>
<P>
   With a setup like this, we know immediately where the film is
going. First of all, it's going to Hollywood (where Dreamworks will
remake it, Veber hopes, as a vehicle for Robin Williams). Second,
it's going to turn the tables on Brochant and show him what being
an idiot really means. It's a good thing that Veber's films are
less about speechifying in the final reel than about the very funny
and diabolical bumbling it takes to get there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game,'' which Veber wrote and directed, is one of
his better-constructed comedies of errors. It gets going as Pignon
arrives at Brochant's apartment on the appointed night, only to
find that the irritable publisher has injured his back and can't
attend the mean-spirited dinner party after all. (Good thing: it's
not an event through which many viewers would like to squirm.) This
would eradicate any relationship between the two men if Pignon were
willing to go away. But he's not. He stays around to do helpful
things, like mixing up Brochant's wife with his girlfriend and
referring to the latter as ``the nympho with the dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a class by himself,'' Brochant and his friends agree,
once they begin marveling at Pignon's handiwork. It turns out that
no task is too simple for Pignon to bungle, no instructions too
straightforward for him to misconstrue. All the film needs is the
abrupt departure of Brochant's angry wife, and Pignon has more than
enough to work with, as he ``helps'' to track her down and find out
if she has a lover.
</P>
<P>
   The story reaches its peak as Pignon invites a hard-nosed tax
inspector to visit Brochant's apartment, which is filled with
undeclared artworks that have to be hidden in a hurry. Brochant is
even forced to poison a bottle of expensive wine with vinegar so
that the tax man will think him a man of modest tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinner Game,'' which features a particularly wry
performance from Francis Huster as the suspicious inspector, is
staged modestly in high-sitcom style, with a spareness not liable
to be found in its Hollywood version; it began as a theatrical
comedy by Veber and still has the feel of a one-set play. It
depends on the actors instead of the scenery to set its tone.
</P>
<P>
   While L'Hermitte's hauteur makes him the perfect fall guy,
Villeret clowns blithely without sentimentalizing his character. He
won a Cesar as best actor for what will remain his role, regardless
of which American actor eventually plays it.

LOOKING FOR DIGNITY AT TABLE 4
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Thursday, July 15)  
(mk) 
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea that work is superior to welfare because it provides
self-esteem and dignity can be difficult to appreciate when your
boss discourages bathroom breaks. Or you're not allowed to talk to
your co-workers unless it's about refilling the ketchup bottles.
</P>
<P>
   This is some of what writer Barbara Ehrenreich learned when she
went undercover as an unskilled worker in Florida to get a
firsthand look at the world of the working poor, the only one open
to most former welfare recipients.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago the writer and lecturer, whose books take a biting
and informed look at the status quo in America, passed herself off
as a divorced homemaker with brief experience as a housekeeper. She
ended up working two full-time waitress jobs, with time only for a
shower in between. She quit after a month when she still wasn't
making enough to keep her $500-a-month spot in a trailer park.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenreich's story, ``Nickel and Dimed,'' published in Harper's
Magazine in January, introduced readers to some of the real people
who work at a Florida chain restaurant attached to an economy
motel.
</P>
<P>
   She's gratified, though a little surprised, that it got more
attention than any magazine piece she's ever written. ``It wasn't
intended to be an anthropological or sociological study,'' she
says. ``I just wanted to see if I could survive.''
</P>
<P>
   She also felt frustration because she doesn't think she broke
any big story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to say, `You already know this, people. You've seen
this arithmetic before.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The arithmetic is you take the cost of prevailing rents against
entry-level wages, or in her case $2.43 an hour plus tips, and
there's little left for gas, food, waitress uniforms, laundry and
for a welfare parent, child expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Her co-workers, many of whom worked two jobs, put as much as
they could into housing but had to live in shared rooms, with
relatives, the occasional motel room. One woman who lived in an old
truck was delighted when her boss let her park overnight in the
motel parking lot. Ehrenreich's comment: ``With benefits like that,
how could anyone think of leaving?''
</P>
<P>
   There was no time or money for extras and for those with two
jobs, little time for family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struck,'' she says, ``by the distance from the mass
media and their lives. They didn't even talk about movies. There
also wasn't much talk of TV, because you have to have time to watch
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehrenreich, who grew up in a blue-collar family and was married
to a union organizer, said the camaraderie of the workers, covering
for each other so one could run to the bathroom or grab a
cigarette, rang true to her experience. Their approach to the
meanest chore surprised her. ``I was astonished all the time by
their work ethic, almost enthusiasm.'' She described her co-workers
as ``far too smart and funny and caring for the work they do and
the wages they're paid.'' And she really wishes they'd form a
union.
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest complaint, she said, was management's basic
attitude that employees can't be trusted. ``We were always being
scolded.''
</P>
<P>
   Coming from her world, that was a shock. ``I'm a free-lance
writer. How privileged is that? No one tells me what to do.'' But
for the first time in her life since junior high she said she felt
that she wasn't trusted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shaken the first day when another employee warned me to
be careful of what I had in my purse because they (the managers)
would search it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could be fired for anything. There was no freedom of
speech. No freedom of assembly.'' One place had a rule against
gossip, which meant that you couldn't talk to another worker unless
it was about the job. Employees were not allowed to patronize the
adjacent bar and couldn't eat in their own restaurant after their
shift.
</P>
<P>
   The writer made a few conclusions from her experience _ one,
that low-wage work may not be a solution to poverty or even
homelessness _ and is now looking into lack of privacy issues on
the job, not only in entry-level work but the workplace in general.
</P>
<P>
   She believes there's a growing lack of civil rights in the
workplace. ``In some places it's becoming almost totalitarian.''
</P>
<P>
   How much one magazine story can make a difference is hard to
judge, but she can claim one small victory. One of the restaurant's
owners contacted her and said he was appalled by what she'd
reported, including the lack of soap and toilet paper in the
employees' bathroom. He promised to make those bathroom
improvements.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say anything about raises.

MCLACHLAN HOPES LILLITH FAIR HAS BEEN AN INSPIRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Savor the memories.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Lilith Fair will be the last. At least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we had a plan,'' says singer-songwriter and
Lilith Fair founder Sarah McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Let's try it for three years and see how it goes
and then reassess things.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And when we started organizing this year's festival, we just
thought, `Remember what we said in the beginning?' So it feels good
to stop now and end on a high note. And keep things fresh and fun
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilith Fair made its debut in the summer of 1997 as ``a
celebration of women in music.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after Lollapalooza and other multi-act touring
festivals, Lilith Fair was dominated by women artists and fueled by
issues of concern to their fans, including breast cancer, human
rights, and rape, abuse and incest. This year's tour features
Mosaic, a traveling art project that allows festivalgoers a chance
to create their own art for display on a virtual online gallery and
help raise money for community art centers.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a mini-tour of Australia in December, McLachlan and
her crew aren't planning any more Lilith Fair tours in the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to close the door on it,'' McLachlan said by
phone from her home in Vancouver, B.C. ``I think we all sort of
feel like we're just going to go away from it for a while and
perhaps bring it back in five years, maybe not.''
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan is happy with what she has accomplished so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel that we've helped to change the music industry a
little bit, expecially in its attitudes toward women,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McLachlan hopes the touring festival has been an inspiration to
concertgoers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's really beneficial to young women who come to the
shows to see the musicians as positive role models and doing
something they love and being successful at it. It just gives
people more options.''
</P>
<P>
   The 40-date North American tour opened Thursday at Thunderbird
Stadium in Vancouver, B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of artists are included on this year's lineup. Hole and
the Pretenders are even doing a few select venues, but not The
Gorge in Washington, where the tour stops this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snagging Hole for a couple of shows is definitely going to add
a different bit of spice to the whole thing,'' McLachlan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks, included on many dates, will miss the local
Lilith shows because they are doing a mini-tour with Tim McGraw.
The timing is almost comical. Dixie Chicks and McGraw arrive at The
Gorge on Sunday _ the day Lilith Fair packs up and leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Featured both days at the Lilith main stage at The Gorge are
McLachlan, Sheryl Crow, Liz Phair, Mya, Luscious Jackson and Sandra
Bernhard. The second stage includes Beth Orton, Bijou Phillips and
Sixpence None the Richer, which is enjoying a winning season with
its hit song, ``Kiss Me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Village Stage features Nikol Kollars on Friday and Eden AKA
and Loni Rose on Saturday. (Rose's song ``I Never Thought You Would
Come'' will be featured in a love scene in Universal Pictures'
comedy ``American Pie.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about everybody. But I'm really happy that Sheryl
(Crow) is doing the whole tour because she's a friend of mine and
we get to hang out for the whole summer,'' McLachlan said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Lilith Fair booths will offer all sorts of merchandise, but
nothing so irresistable as McLachlan's new cookbook, ``Plenty,''
co-authored with her talented on-the-road chef, Jaime Laurita.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept bugging him for his recipes for years,'' McLachlan
said. ``I'd say, `Gimme the damn recipe.' And he'd say, `Oh, yeah,
sure, sure.' But he never would.'
</P>
<P>
   She finally suggested they team up on a cookbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally, selfishly motivated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The cookbook is now in print (the price is under $20 U.S.),
offering some of McLachlan's favorite recipes as well as anecdotes
about life on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I put my name on it, I wanted it to be more than just a
cookbook,'' she said. ``I wanted it to have an extra edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides her new cookbook, McLachlan has a new live album,
``Mirrorball.'' The album includes beautifully sung versions of
such favorite songs as ``Building a Mystery,'' ``I Will Remember
You,'' ``Possession,'' ``Sweet Surrender'' and ``Fumbling Towards
Ecstasy.''
</P>
<P>
   Backing her are keyboardist Vince Jones, bassist Brian Minato,
guitarist Sean Ashby, guitarist David Sinclair, vocalist Camille
Henderson and drummer-percussionist Ashwin Sood, McLachlan's
husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I wanted to document where we were as a band,''
McLachlan said. ``I felt we had become very good performers. And I
also wanted to give the fans something during the down time, as I
wasn't going to have a new studio album for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next studio album will come when it comes.''
</P>

 &HT;    GOP UNVEILS ONLINE TV
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican National Committee on Thursday
launched what might be called GOP-TV, a Internet-based broadcast
outlet with a global reach that requires no federal license.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just video, it's history,'' RNC Chairman Jim
Nicholson gushed about the party's new video streaming technology.
``Not even the self-styled father of the Internet, Al Gore, had a
hand in this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' initial online offering was a caustic put-down
of the vice president, the leading candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Philadelphia at the RNC's annual summer meeting,
Nicholson said the video technology will let Republicans air news
conferences and special political events live over the Internet
during the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also envisioned, he said, is the ability to provide party
activists with ``two-way real-time feedback over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   This is but one tool, he said, in a budding ``e.GOP Project''
that he described as ``a comprehensive cutting-edge commitment by
the Republican Party to harness the Web's power for its
communications, organizing and fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson pledged that in the presidential campaign after this
one, Republicans will be raising at least 25 percent of the
small-donor contributions through e-mail solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2004 elections, he said, all 50 GOP state parties and
their affiliated groups will be wired for special intranet
programming. He also envisioned building a ``national community of
100,000 on-line activists.'' By that time, he said, the Republicans
will be able to append e-mail address to as many as 30 million
names in their database of 150 million registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's Democratic counterpart, Joe Andrew, wasn't much
impressed. A technology maven in his own right, Andrews said the
Democratic National Committee is developing a cutting-edge plan of
its own to leverage the Internet for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNC technology plan ensures that in every state, in every
district, in every election, Democrats can run campaigns that are
both high-tech and high-touch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These campaigns, he added, ``will fuse the innovation of Silicon
Valley with the intimacy of Main Street'' and ``combine the sizzle
of Hollywood with the steak of the union hall.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Republican ``revolutionary video technology''
seemingly delivers, as advertised, TV-quality, full-motion,
full-screen video broadcasting with stereo sound on the Internet.
It can be seen via the committee's Web site (http://www.rnc.org.)
</P>
<P>
   But would-be viewers must first download a proprietary module
produced exclusively for the Republicans by Pixelon Corp. of San
Juan Capistrano, Calif. It required nearly 40 minutes Thursday
afternoon to download a ``buffer'' of an anti-Gore film on a
mid-speed Pentium machine running the Windows NT operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Once acquired, however, ``The World According to Gore'' ran
without a technical flaw. And it could be queued up repeatedly
without any further downloading delays.
</P>
<P>
   The film, among other purported Gore failings, portrays him as
an environmental extremist who would do away with gasoline-powered
cars and a two-faced hypocrite on tobacco issues. The movie also
highlights the close ties between Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A version of the module for Apple Macintosh machines is
scheduled to be available by Aug. 1.

   Forty years ago, for the first time in Soviet history, an
American exhibition opened at a fair in the Moscow park of
Sokolniki. There, my grandfather, Nikita S. Khrushchev, who was at
the time first secretary of the Communist Party's Central Committee
and chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers, had a debate with
Richard Nixon, vice president of the United States and head of the
U.S. delegation.
</P>
<P>
   One of the exhibits on display was a ``typical American home for
a typical American family.'' The most heated part of the debate
took place in the model kitchen. So it went down in diplomatic
history as the ``kitchen'' debate.
</P>
<P>
   During the exchange, Khrushchev predicted that Nixon's
grandchildren would live in a socialist America, to which Nixon
retorted that, no, the grandchildren of the Soviet Union's No. 1
Communist would live in a capitalist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Khrushchev, a staunch Communist, proved to be wrong. His
grandchildren indeed now live in Russia, but under a system that
can hardly be called socialist. Meanwhile, his son, my father,
Sergei N. Khrushchev, 63, after eight years of working in the
United States, became a U.S. citizen a few days ago.
</P>
<P>
   This would seem a fitting postscript to that debate. I should be
putting a period here. Yet I can't. What I've come up against in
recent days shows that for many people in Russia, the Cold War has
never become a thing of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In my role as a researcher for Moscow News, I am often in
contact with agencies and bureaus for photographs, archival
information and so forth. Although Father lives in America, we are
frequently in touch. Just recently he asked me to contact a man he
knew who used to be prominent in the Soviet leadership _ at one
time, a member of the Central Committee. I phoned him and
introduced myself.
</P>
<P>
   And here is what I heard in response: ``Khrushchev's eldest son,
Leonid, surrendered to the Nazis; they used him to conduct
anti-Soviet agitation on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to object: ``No, there are no documents to that effect
in any archives, Russian or German.''
</P>
<P>
   But not letting me cut in on his monologue, he continued to
enlighten me about my relatives. ``At the end of the war,'' he
said, ``Sudoplatov's (a Stalin-era spy chief) agents snatched
Leonid from Nazi captivity and put him on trial, and he was
sentenced to be shot for collaborating with the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Again my interlocutor would not listen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was time to learn about the former Soviet leader. It
seems that Grandfather was once summoned by Stalin, and crawled
before him on his knees, crying, but the ``father of the peoples''
was adamant in his criticism. This was apparently why Khrushchev
Sr. came to hate Stalin, and plot to take revenge for being so
humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the old hard-liner ended up talking about my father.
``I am not surprised,'' he told me, ``that yet another Khrushchev
degenerate has betrayed our Motherland and sold himself out to the
Americans.'' He added that I, personally, would have to answer for
this under the ``criminal code'' of the land.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment I didn't understand. Then it dawned on me: He was
actually referring to the notorious Article 58 of the Stalin-era
Criminal Code, all of whose paragraphs provided for capital
punishment. One of them referred to ``members of the family of a
traitor to Motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, in the view of that staunch Leninist, I am now a member of
a traitor's family; however, as yet, I have not been executed and
continue to work. What I am quickly learning, though, is that this
man is not alone in his view of me. My father's new status has
irked other people besides him.
</P>
<P>
   Quite by surprise, I was told at a Russian design bureau, once a
highly classified project, where I chose to turn for assistance in
tracking down a picture of a big space rocket that was not destined
to be produced in quantity, that they ``did not maintain any
relations with foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   But I live in Moscow, I told them, and never changed my
citizenship, whereas, indeed, this very year they were visited by
delegations from the United States, France, Japan and other
countries. That cut no ice.
</P>
<P>
   I was told this: ``Should the FSB (Federal Security Service)
give a positive response IN WRITING to your application IN WRITING
to its director, then we might be able to help you. If not, you
will never get to see this photograph.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, I phoned an archive where I had had some
documents duplicated for my father. Its employees had never turned
down my requests before. But this time was different. They said:
``The head of the administrative department would like to talk to
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The head of department, a relatively young man, told me in a
voice of steel: ``In view of the change in the status of your
father, the cost of this order will be 40 times as much. It is also
desirable that payment be made in hard currency.''
</P>
<P>
   This is of course no longer a Cold War. But neither is it peace
as it should be.

 &HT;    GOP UNVEILS ONLINE TV
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican National Committee on Thursday
launched what might be called GOP-TV, a Internet-based broadcast
outlet with a global reach that requires no federal license.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just video, it's history,'' RNC Chairman Jim
Nicholson gushed about the party's new video streaming technology.
``Not even the self-styled father of the Internet, Al Gore, had a
hand in this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' initial online offering was a caustic put-down
of the vice president, the leading candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Philadelphia at the RNC's annual summer meeting,
Nicholson said the video technology will let Republicans air news
conferences and special political events live over the Internet
during the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Also envisioned, he said, is the ability to provide party
activists with ``two-way real-time feedback over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   This is but one tool, he said, in a budding ``e.GOP Project''
that he described as ``a comprehensive cutting-edge commitment by
the Republican Party to harness the Web's power for its
communications, organizing and fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson pledged that in the presidential campaign after this
one, Republicans will be raising at least 25 percent of the
small-donor contributions through e-mail solicitations.
</P>
<P>
   For the 2004 elections, he said, all 50 GOP state parties and
their affiliated groups will be wired for special intranet
programming. He also envisioned building a ``national community of
100,000 on-line activists.'' By that time, he said, the Republicans
will be able to append e-mail address to as many as 30 million
names in their database of 150 million registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's Democratic counterpart, Joe Andrew, wasn't much
impressed. A technology maven in his own right, Andrews said the
Democratic National Committee is developing a cutting-edge plan of
its own to leverage the Internet for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNC technology plan ensures that in every state, in every
district, in every election, Democrats can run campaigns that are
both high-tech and high-touch,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These campaigns, he added, ``will fuse the innovation of Silicon
Valley with the intimacy of Main Street'' and ``combine the sizzle
of Hollywood with the steak of the union hall.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Republican ``revolutionary video technology''
seemingly delivers, as advertised, TV-quality, full-motion,
full-screen video broadcasting with stereo sound on the Internet.
It can be seen via the committee's Web site (http://www.rnc.org.)
</P>
<P>
   But would-be viewers must first download a proprietary module
produced exclusively for the Republicans by Pixelon Corp. of San
Juan Capistrano, Calif. It required nearly 40 minutes Thursday
afternoon to download a ``buffer'' of an anti-Gore film on a
mid-speed Pentium machine running the Windows NT operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Once acquired, however, ``The World According to Gore'' ran
without a technical flaw. And it could be queued up repeatedly
without any further downloading delays.
</P>
<P>
   The film, among other purported Gore failings, portrays him as
an environmental extremist who would do away with gasoline-powered
cars and a two-faced hypocrite on tobacco issues. The movie also
highlights the close ties between Gore and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A version of the module for Apple Macintosh machines is
scheduled to be available by Aug. 1.

TRACING FAME'S TRAJECTORY FROM QUEEN VICTORIA TO KATO KAELIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1954, Photoplay, the doyen of fan magazines _ it
had been around since 1911 publishing feel-good stories written by
publicity agents _ printed an article about the early love lives of
Jeff Chandler and Susan Hayward, who were childhood friends. The
article was flattering, but Chandler, the magazine said, thought it
invaded his privacy. So Photoplay polled its readers. The question
(accompanied by another full-page glossy of Chandler, beaming) was:
Is it proper to write about a star's private life?
</P>
<P>
   Quaint, no? We have traveled so far from that moment in the
evolution of fame that the poll seems to belong to another
civilization. By the mid-50s, with the rise of gossip sheets like
Confidential, the American public was already demanding a price for
fame. The line between public achievement and private pathology was
eroding.
</P>
<P>
   Now there isn't even the expectation of public achievement as a
requirement for fame, just the capacity to be humiliated publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fame After Photography,'' a breezily entertaining show
organized by Carole Kismaric and Marvin Heiferman at the Museum of
Modern Art through Oct. 5, includes that long-forgotten June 1954
issue of Photoplay along with hundreds of other pictures that
illustrate our passage from William Faulkner's notion of fame (``to
be, as a private individual, abolished and voided from history,
leaving it markless, no refuse save the printed books'') to the
society of O.J. Simpson, People magazine and ``The Jerry Springer
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical Modern exhibition this is not. Several galleries of
the museum are crammed with 19th-century daguerreotypes, cartes de
visite, publicity stills, newsreels, movie trailers, old tabloid
newspapers, modern supermarket glossies, Wheaties boxes and
excerpts from television programs and advertisements, including
Pepsi commercials, the Johnny Carson show and ``Life Styles of the
Rich and Famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Since this is the Modern, there is a small section devoted to
art about fame, which includes an early Cindy Sherman film still,
for example, but it's a footnote to the main event. The subject is
celebrity as a phenomenon redefined by photography, which is a
different and more alarming matter.
</P>
<P>
   I don't mean that the show is alarming because we dislike and
disdain what's in it. I mean the reverse: it's irresistible. We
meet people like Peggy Hopkins Joyce, the Lady of the Orchids, as
she was called. In 1931, Vanity Fair, then the grandest of highbrow
celebrity magazines, published one of Edward Steichen's glamorous
portraits of her as a soft-focus siren gazing down her pointed
nose; the picture accompanied an article describing her as a
dabbler in film and a woman with many sables, former husbands and
dimples.
</P>
<P>
   We meet other equally ridiculous characters from the last
century and a half whose celebrity, fleeting and otherwise,
coincided with the rise of photography and the media that succeeded
it, namely film, television and the Internet. The exhibition's
argument, not original but cleverly presented, is that change in
pictorial technology since the middle of the 19th century has
altered the nature of fame.
</P>
<P>
   So the proliferation of hand-held cameras let photographers
catch people off guard and paved the way for paparazzi. Halftone
printing, by which daily tabloids could publish pictures alongside
text, increased the public's appetite for news-maker snapshots,
which created a need for fresh photographs and new faces each day _
which in turn fostered the publicity agent industry.
</P>
<P>
   When television brought celebrities into people's living rooms
in the '50s, it added the illusion of intimacy to the situation.
One of the television clips in the exhibition shows Jack Paar
chatting with Fidel Castro, the two of them sitting side by side
talking about their children as if at a cocktail party. It's an
example, par excellence, of television's transformation of a
historically significant figure, a famous person in the old sense
of fame, into a modern celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   After all, to be famous, that is, to be a celebrity,
increasingly meant to pretend that you were like everyone else, a
fiction that gradually caused the entire population of the country
to believe it could (should) be famous. Programs like Paar's and
``Person to Person'' hastened what we could call the banalization
of fame, its normalization. This has culminated in the use of the
Internet, on which any narcissist can transmit his or her image
around the globe and, with luck, become famous just for doing so.
It used to be that a minimum requirement for fame was another
person interested enough in you to print your picture or point a
camera in your direction. No longer.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, who is Jeff Chandler anyway? Raise your hand if
you've ever seen him in ``The Jayhawkers'' or ``Return to Peyton
Place.'' Once famous as a romantic lead, he has gone the way of the
Hula-Hoop. My point isn't simply that fame is ephemeral but that it
once was a matter of posterity, something that counted above all
after you were dead. Today celebrities just hope to sustain their
fame through the week by providing the public with a constant flow
of novel revelations; otherwise they drop off the radar screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as their now gets summed up, we move immediately on to
another person,'' Andy Warhol said, ``and another now.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This is the crucial matter: fame stripped of its everlasting
value, its promise of a life after death, at least for one's
reputation, has lost its spiritual underpinning. Historically
speaking, it used to be a spiritual matter, and it retains certain
aspects of its spiritual character while no longer necessarily
attaching itself to the ultimate spiritual goal, eternal existence.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the vocabulary of fame still borrows from religion:
charisma, idol. We still collect and revere pictures of the famous
as if they were icons, whether they're baseball cards or rock star
posters. And what is an endorsement, in the end, but the
sanctioning of something by the sanctified, the famous person's
lending his or her aura to a product? One of the memorable sights
in the show is an old magazine advertisement in which Eleanor
Roosevelt endorses a mattress (in another Steichen photograph). If
the underlying issue were not aura, what difference would it make
that a basketball player staked his reputation on the quality of a
hamburger or that a First Lady liked a particular bed? Why should
their word on these things have any special value to us?
</P>
<P>
   Then there is St. Augustine's paradox, which confronts every
famous person today. Augustine said that to be purged of the sin of
pride, a person must also purge the pride that comes from being
humble, ``the desire,'' as Leo Braudy once put it in ``The Frenzy
of Renown: Fame and Its History,'' ``that an audience witness (and
applaud) your contempt for fame.'' The trick, of course, is to deny
the appeal of fame while seeking it out: the politician who claims
to want to spend more time with his family, the actor who complains
about the loss of privacy and seeks to lead the quiet life. Or the
spectacle of Joan Crawford in an apron pretending to slice a
turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Fame in the ephemeral sense of celebrity certainly existed in
the past. But the point of the exhibition is that photography
brought with it a whole new range of social effects. Before
photography, most people obviously didn't even know what their
public figures looked like. The mid-19th-century craze for cartes
de visite, which at the time were postcard-size photographs of the
famous, reflected the enormous desire to put faces to names. So did
the proliferation of illustrated magazines. From the end of the
last century, we find a magazine called Success, which posed Edison
in his workshop, as if casually reading; success was being
signified not only by a man's accomplishments but also by the mere
reproduction of his face on the magazine's cover, a process that
rapidly became self-generating.
</P>
<P>
   Famous people had to adapt to the new medium. The standard
example is Lincoln, the homely hayseed, who with a little
retouching became a handsome statesman through Mathew Brady's lens.
But soon everyone, not just public figures, learned how to pose.
Then came moving pictures. It's sweet to look at some of the early
newsreels, in which no one seems quite sure how to act in front of
a movie camera, the paradox being that everyone looks unnatural
when in truth they are really too much themselves. They haven't yet
assimilated the theatrics of appearing natural on film.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't really need this exhibition to tell us that fame
eventually came to attach itself to those who learned the tricks of
the camera best, people whose celebrity derived from the fact that
they looked good in photographs and on film, but we see many lively
examples of it here. Billy Wilder's great remark about Marilyn
Monroe was, ``The first day a photographer took a picture of her,
she was a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   As Monroe demonstrated, image, having become a source of fame in
itself, also became a marketable commodity.
</P>
<P>
   True, to a degree this had been the case from the beginning of
photography; a century ago, P.T. Barnum sold pictures of his
performers and paid them royalties. But today we think we know who
Cindy Crawford and Kate Moss are just because we've seen their
photographs. They're famous for being photographed. No wonder
people now expect that getting their pictures in the paper or their
faces on television means they're automatically famous.
</P>
<P>
   The show's unspoken question is whether something that has
become so commonplace is still meaningful, beyond its value as a
commodity. Fame analysis is a growth industry: countless magazines
and television programs have arisen during the last decade to
dissect the sources of fame, the ways in which fame is produced and
spun. The hosts of these programs, who are sometimes more famous
than their subjects just for being on television, talk about the
barometer of fame as if it were the blue chip index, which in a
sense it has become.
</P>
<P>
   We must return in the end to the issue of spiritual value
because you might say that without it, fame has been reduced to a
plunging stock. The exhibition charts a trajectory from the world
of Queen Victoria to that of Kato Kaelin. Now that everyone is
famous for 15 minutes, is anyone really famous any longer?

TIM DUNCAN: FRONT AND CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.C.)  (mk) 
 By DICK SCANLON   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ No one seems less impressed with Tim Duncan than
Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs' young star had his own way of celebrating an NBA
championship while San Antonio partied and the rest of the world
marveled at his ability and consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been sleeping since it happened,'' Duncan said after
joining the USA Basketball men's senior national team for a week of
practice Tuesday. ``I had a week off before I came here, so I've
been kind of resting. I haven't done anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yah, I've been on a high pretty much the whole week.''
</P>
<P>
   That last part comes off as something Duncan feels he is
supposed to say. In two professional seasons, he has done about all
a basketball player can do. You would expect him to act and sound
ecstatic, but he doesn't. Maybe he can't. Duncan is a 7-footer who
goes through life without expression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in my house, in my bed, haven't seen much of
anybody,'' he said. ``Just trying to keep to myself for a little
while, trying to mellow down.''
</P>
<P>
   If he mellows down much more, he may play next season asleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Tim,'' laughs Orlando Magic forward Matt Harpring, an
old friend of Duncan. ``He just won a championship, but we talk
together and he's like: `Who cares?' That's just the way he is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have an ego. He's just an average guy who goes with
the flow. If he didn't play basketball he'd be just like everyone
else. He doesn't even dress like an NBA player. I mean, you would
never know.''
</P>
<P>
   But we do know. At age 23, Duncan is at the peak of the
basketball world. He was first-team all-NBA in both of his seasons,
first-team all-defense this season. He was MVP of the Spurs'
five-game NBA finals victory over the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is the answer to two standard argument-starters: ``With
which player would you most like to start a franchise?'' and
``Which player would give you the best chance of winning a
championship next season?''
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA of 1999, there is no argument: Duncan and Duncan. He
was the NBA's sixth-leading scorer (21.7), fifth-leading rebounder
(11.4) and seventh-leading shot blocker (2.52) even though he
didn't play center. Playing alongside David Robinson, Duncan is
technically a power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never considered myself a center,'' he said. ``It's a
title that's been given to me, but I like playing where I play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? I don't know. I just don't like the name `center,' I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond what Duncan has accomplished as a player, what NBA people
most appreciate is the way he does it. Without expression. Without
dunkin' his way onto ESPN SportsCenter. Without flashy jewelry or
trashy talk.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan grew up in the Virgin Islands and didn't take up
basketball seriously until he was in the ninth grade. He didn't
think about playing in the NBA until well into his college career
at Wake Forest, where he earned a degree in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went four years to college. Most kids who are drafted early
haven't done that,'' said USA senior national team coach Larry
Brown. ``And don't forget, Tim went to a team that has won 50 games
every year David Robinson has been healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But also, Tim Duncan is unique. I don't know how many guys
come into our league with that type of ability and personality.
He's unbelievable. He has no ego. He just wants to enjoy playing,
enjoy the people he's around and do the best he can, and that's
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   He has had some breaks. Coming to San Antonio and playing with
Robinson was a big one. And this season everything fell into place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great. It's been a dream come true,'' he said
without expression, an ice pack taped to his left knee and a cell
phone in his right hand. ``It's been a short season, but a lot
happened. There were a couple of times in there where we really
turned things around, like the time we came back on Houston from
being down 18. But so far I haven't really had a chance to sit down
and enjoy what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   Harpring is trying to help him do that. He has known Duncan
since Duncan showed him around Wake Forest on his recruiting visit
five years ago. Harpring has been showing Duncan around Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the same Tim,'' Harpring shrugged. ``He's into videogames
and he collects knives. And he loves to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if he wanted to go golfing this week and he said:
`No, I don't golf.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But he might, just to go out and have some fun.''

`ITALIAN FEVER:' APPREHENSION AND MISAPPREHENSION IN ITALY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly as long as lines of tourists at the art shrines of
Florence and Rome is the procession of fictional Britons and
Americans queuing up to tangle with Italy and the Italians. Henry
James, E.M. Forster, Barry Unsworth and Penelope Fitzgerald are
just a few of the writers who have dispatched their protagonists to
get their hearts, brains and cultural assumptions upended.
</P>
<P>
   This season's upending, if not on the level of those just
mentioned, is wittily administered in ``Italian Fever'' by the
American novelist Valerie Martin. Administered, that is, like a
stiffish but ultimately improving summer-school course. The
student-victim is a young New York woman of lively brain, sluggish
self-esteem, an impressive capacity for seeing things crooked, and
enough pluck and appetite eventually to see them straight.
</P>
<P>
   D. van Kamp (invariably referred to as D.V.), a trashy
best-selling expatriate writer, has been found dead near his home
in Tuscany. His agent sends Lucy Stark, D.V.'s long-suffering
freelance editor, to tidy up his affairs and arrange a funeral.
Cool, practical and relied upon to possess a level head, Lucy
proceeds to lose hers.
</P>
<P>
   The overwrought, half-finished manuscript left by D.V. has
something to do with it. So does the dazzle of Italy's light,
beauty and sensual appeal. So do the layered difficulties the
country presents to foreigners who go beyond tourist routines and
try to accomplish practical matters. So do the oddities and
inscrutable intentions of the Cini family, D.V.'s aristocratic
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, Lucy's feverish, occasionally hallucinatory
few weeks center on her wild fling with Massimo, a charming (of
course) and married (also of course) Italian. Wild on her part,
that is (again of course), and on his, a matter mainly of deftly
managed pleasure (still of course).
</P>
<P>
   Those four ``of courses'' are what you might call the warp of
Ms. Martin's novel. She has written an entertainment, one that
follows a well-worn path of New World vs. Old: the romance between
the naif and the sophisticate, the comedy of cultural
misapprehension, the contrast between the European as historical
iceberg (seven-eighths of him the underwater past) and the American
as skating rink (all surface ice, and just frozen yesterday).
</P>
<P>
   Threaded through this warp, though, is a weft of pure comedy,
ironic perception and a glitter of phrase. In the throes of his
masterfully arousing love-making, for example, Massimo reminds Lucy
``of a man who has purchased an expensive and complicated new
automobile; he wanted to maintain it perfectly in order to run it
hard and fast.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a surface suspense in ``Italian Journey.'' It has to do
with the paranoid rantings in D.V.'s posthumous manuscript, a
hysteria that communicates itself to Lucy in her first few days
alone in D.V.'s house. Aggravated by a nightlong agony of
indigestion (garishly evoked) after a rich meal, it leads her to
encounter the writer's ghost and experience a brief breakdown.
These semi-Gothic passages _ ghost or hallucination reappear quite
unnecessarily at the end _ do not accomplish much.
</P>
<P>
   The real suspense is that of character. It is not that Massimo _
and his counterpart, the apparently effete and arrogant Antonio
Cini, scion of the aristocratic family next door _ actually move or
change or reveal themselves in any significant way. It is that
Lucy's misapprehensions, painfully righted only to give way to new
ones, beautifully provide a sense of change and revelation.
Sometimes you see things through a glass darkly that you could
never see face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Lucy's first glimpse of Massimo is at the Rome airport, where he
meets her on behalf of D.V.'s Italian publisher. Big, elegant as a
peacock who has been up all night grooming, he stands at the
barrier holding the tiniest of signs (part of the anti-package
prejudice of the traditional Italian male) and not looking at the
arriving passengers. Instead he is examining a possible spot on his
impeccable suit.
</P>
<P>
   Driving her to the village where D.V. lived and is to be buried,
and helping her make the complicated burial arrangements, he is
inexplicably, to her, cold and helpful by turns. It is only after
her collapse that he becomes attentive, then tender, then
passionate. The passion continues through her stay in the village,
and then through a few days in Rome, where she begins to perceive
the balancing of time and attention he manages among her, his
business affairs and his evenings at home.
</P>
<P>
   As Massimo's mystery fades _ though Ms. Martin's portrayal,
within the conventions of such a character, is delightful to the
end and finally a touch unexpected _ the character of Antonio Cini
begins to blossom. Just how would be unfair to say, since to the
extent that ``Fever'' is a mystery, it is one of persons, not plot.
But the last scenes between Antonio and Lucy are astonishing. They
bring her chain of mistakes and illusions to an ingenious close.
They make this entertainment something more; it is all surfaces,
true, but they are onion surfaces, and their successive peeling
constitutes a heart.
</P>
<P>
   At times Lucy seems an unsatisfactory character. She is all
apprehension and misapprehension: the personage as seeing or
unseeing eye; the one to whom things happen and who, after they
happen, good or bad, declares ``Oh'' or ``Ouch'' respectively. She
seems, in other words, to be an instrument through which we are
able to measure and test the author's Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Although thin, or at least not fully fleshed out, she is
interesting in a different way. It is her mind that counts. Even
wrong, it is a graceful and discriminating mind. When at the end
she reaches an understanding of what has been happening, the
experience is intellectual as well as emotional.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, when not caught up in her own swirl, she reflects
upon what she sees; there is a provocative passage, for example,
where she contemplates Bernini's sculpture of Apollo and Daphne and
compares, startlingly, this artist's ruthlessness toward his
subject with what she has undergone with Massimo.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment apart, Ms. Martin has written a novel of ideas. If
Lucy comes out OK _ improved, even _ it is her brain that has
achieved it. That and a wonderful appetite. There are a half-dozen
excellent meals in ``Fever'' and, indigestion aside, she does
justice to them all. The flesh made spirit.

   Colombia is worse off in many ways than it was a decade ago. The
country's violent forces _ left-wing insurgents and right-wing
militias _ have never been better armed and financed or held more
territory. Colombia's drug economy, with its pernicious effects, is
as pervasive as ever. And the government is running out of options.
</P>
<P>
   By now, the only major Latin American country that did not have
to renegotiate its foreign debt in the 1980s has sunk into a deep,
unrelieved recession, exacerbated by the earthquake that devastated
its coffee-growing region in January.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1988, following the abduction of a prominent politician,
former Colombian President Misael Pastrana Borrero remarked, ``Last
year I said we were on the verge of the abyss. Today, I think we
are in it.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Pastrana's son Andres _ who has himself led Colombia
since August 1998 _ has reason to be even more pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes the current crises from the many Colombia has
weathered in the past is the inability of the country's leaders to
respond effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the new peace talks announced on May 3, the guerrillas'
willingness to engage in serious negotiations remains in doubt. And
ordinary Colombians _ the vast majority of whom are committed to
peace _ have grown more divided than ever. Mistrust lies at every
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's deterioration has made its neighbors apprehensive and
spread serious concern as far as the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While Central America's guerrillas have demobilized and Peru's
rebels have been crippled, in Colombia two of the hemisphere's
oldest insurgencies are militarily and financially stronger than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Colombia's principal guerrilla organizations _ the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National
Liberation Army (ELN) _ have combined revenues of about $900
million a year. About $500 million of that is derived from taxes on
coca producers and the rest comes from kidnapping and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   It would be a mistake, however, to see the guerrilla groups as
common criminals or drug mafias (although some of the FARC's fronts
seem to closely fit that mold). Their criminal activities help
sustain a political agenda. Nor are they rigid ideologues,
resistant to reason. The rebels should instead be viewed as
fundamentally pragmatic actors, out to advance political, economic
and strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be said for Colombia's many criminal gangs. Colombia
has a long history of illegal economic activities; emeralds, for
example, were once the subject of a huge illegal traffic. And for
at least two decades now Colombia has been one of the main engines
driving the international drug trade (an engine fueled largely by
U.S. demand).
</P>
<P>
   Though reliable data are hard to come by, drug proceeds amount
to an estimated 25 percent to 35 percent of the country's total
exports. Meanwhile, with the effective elimination of the Medellin
and Cali cartels over the past several years, the drug industry has
become more fractured, making it harder to control.
</P>
<P>
   Today narcotics have penetrated nearly all spheres of Colombian
society, politics and economics. The cumulative effects of drug
trafficking and the spreading insurgencies _ coupled with a
rampantly corrupt political system that has long excluded large
sectors of the citizenry _ have exacerbated the country's immense
institutional problems.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians have long been aware of their many problems and have
sought to address them in various ways. Meanwhile, Colombia has
somehow managed to hold election after election despite its many
crises. The region's oldest insurgencies coexist with South
America's longest stretch of civilian, constitutional rule.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, Colombian administrations have launched a variety
of peace efforts, also with mixed results. Colombians have paid a
tremendous price _ in financial, institutional and most tragically,
human terms _ to fight drugs and curb their consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But the most disturbing symptom of the failure of Colombia's
institutions has been the exponential growth of the paramilitary
forces, now estimated to number 4,000 to 5,000 combatants. These
militias, frustrated by the country's demoralized and debilitated
security forces, seek to counter insurgent advances. They have
grown more sophisticated over the years since the army and
landowners first organized them as self-defense units in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Like the insurgents, the paramilitaries are now spread out and
are often fueled by the drug economy. In some cases they have
developed right-wing political identities and agendas and have
shown a keen interest in Colombia's political game.
</P>
<P>
   The existence and nature of the militias' links to the army are
hotly contested. Direct connections between the two have been
established in some cases. More often, state agents have merely
looked the other way when paramilitary units have committed
atrocities. Chiefly as a result of growing international pressure,
there have been a number of recent attempts to break such ties. In
April, Pastrana dismissed two generals with reported paramilitary
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence, the drug economy and an acute institutional
crisis have contributed to the most dire human-rights situation in
the hemisphere. Roughly 10 Colombians are killed every day in
political violence. All the country's armed factions commit gross
abuses. But both credible human-rights groups and the State
Department blame the paramilitaries for the lion's share _ three-
quarters of all of Colombia's political killings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to Human Rights Watch, Colombia has the fourth-largest
internally displaced population in the world. The poor are also the
principal victims of Colombia's pervasive social and criminal
violence, which accounts for some 85 percent of the country's
30,000 annual homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC's murder of three American human-rights workers in
Venezuelan territory in March underlined the brutality of
Colombia's civil war and its mounting regional repercussions. For
most of this century, the two countries have enjoyed close and
friendly relations, in part because of Colombia's exemplary
economic management and its adherence to civilian, constitutional
government since the early 1960s. For many years, Washington held
Colombia up as a model of good governance and a close partner in
President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress aid program.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombia's entanglement with the drug trade in the mid-1980s
changed all of that. Since then, U.S. Colombia policy has been
nearly indistinguishable from U.S. antinarcotics policy. About 80
percent of the world's cocaine is produced in Colombia, along with
roughly three-quarters of the heroin seized by authorities on the
east coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that U.S. Colombia policy tends to be
single-minded, inflexible and driven by the desire to look tough on
drugs. As a result, it is often counterproductive. Any option that
might conceivably soften antidrug efforts is deemed unacceptable by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with the United States reached a low point during the
1994-'98 presidency of Ernesto Samper, who was credibly accused of
having accepted some $6 million from the Cali drug cartel in his
1994 campaign. Samper's U.S. visa was revoked and, in 1996 and
1997, the United States fully decertified Colombia for failing to
cooperate in the fight against drugs. Decertification demoralized
and alienated Colombians and undermined their government's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the election of Pastrana last June has
substantially improved the relationship. This was reflected by the
recertification of Colombia in March 1999 and Congress' approval in
October 1998 of some $289 million in counternarcotics assistance
(tripling the amount previously provided).
</P>
<P>
   The increased aid includes about $40 million for an air-mobile
army battalion to help in the antidrug effort. This marks a
significant development. U.S. aid to the Colombian army had been
suspended in 1996 because of its troubling human-rights record.
(The money went to the national police instead.) Today, support is
still restricted and should be carefully monitored in accordance
with U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   But the Defense, State and Justice departments, the Office of
National Drug Control Policy and key congressional representatives
_ are all competing to shape policy. Skeptics in the U.S. Congress
have taken sharp public aim at the meetings between State
Department officials and FARC representatives, especially in light
of what they regard as the insurgents' stubborn behavior and
unreasonable demands (and the FARC's designation as a ``terrorist''
group). And members of Congress have been critical of Pastrana's
meetings with Fidel Castro to explore a Cuban role in brokering a
settlement with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Most Colombians long for peace but are divided over how to
pursue it. Only if Pastrana can shape a national consensus _ and
inspire his people to remain a part of it _ will he finally help
the country out of the abyss his father anticipated more than a
decade ago.

fundamentally pragmatic actors, out to advance political, economic
and strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
   This cannot be said for Colombia's many criminal gangs. Colombia
has a long history of illegal economic activities; emeralds, for
example, were once the subject of a huge illegal traffic. And for
at least two decades now Colombia has been one of the main engines
driving the international drug trade (an engine fueled largely by
U.S. demand).
</P>
<P>
   Though reliable data are hard to come by, drug proceeds amount
to an estimated 25 percent to 35 percent of the country's total
exports. Meanwhile, with the effective elimination of the Medellin
and Cali cartels over the past several years, the drug industry has
become more fractured, making it harder to control.
</P>
<P>
   Today narcotics have penetrated nearly all spheres of Colombian
society, politics and economics. The cumulative effects of drug
trafficking and the spreading insurgencies _ coupled with a
rampantly corrupt political system that has long excluded large
sectors of the citizenry _ have exacerbated the country's immense
institutional problems.
</P>
<P>
   Colombians have long been aware of their many problems and have
sought to address them in various ways. Meanwhile, Colombia has
somehow managed to hold election after election despite its many
crises. The region's oldest insurgencies coexist with South
America's longest stretch of civilian, constitutional rule.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, Colombian administrations have launched a variety
of peace efforts, also with mixed results. Colombians have paid a
tremendous price _ in financial, institutional and most tragically,
human terms _ to fight drugs and curb their consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But the most disturbing symptom of the failure of Colombia's
institutions has been the exponential growth of the paramilitary
forces, now estimated to number 4,000 to 5,000 combatants. These
militias, frustrated by the country's demoralized and debilitated
security forces, seek to counter insurgent advances. They have
grown more sophisticated over the years since the army and
landowners first organized them as self-defense units in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Like the insurgents, the paramilitaries are now spread out and
are often fueled by the drug economy. In some cases they have
developed right-wing political identities and agendas and have
shown a keen interest in Colombia's political game.
</P>
<P>
   The existence and nature of the militias' links to the army are
hotly contested. Direct connections between the two have been
established in some cases. More often, state agents have merely
looked the other way when paramilitary units have committed
atrocities. Chiefly as a result of growing international pressure,
there have been a number of recent attempts to break such ties. In
April, Pastrana dismissed two generals with reported paramilitary
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence, the drug economy and an acute institutional
crisis have contributed to the most dire human-rights situation in
the hemisphere. Roughly 10 Colombians are killed every day in
political violence. All the country's armed factions commit gross
abuses. But both credible human-rights groups and the State
Department blame the paramilitaries for the lion's share _ three-
quarters of all of Colombia's political killings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to Human Rights Watch, Colombia has the fourth-largest
internally displaced population in the world. The poor are also the
principal victims of Colombia's pervasive social and criminal
violence, which accounts for some 85 percent of the country's
30,000 annual homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The FARC's murder of three American human-rights workers in
Venezuelan territory in March underlined the brutality of
Colombia's civil war and its mounting regional repercussions. For
most of this century, the two countries have enjoyed close and
friendly relations, in part because of Colombia's exemplary
economic management and its adherence to civilian, constitutional
government since the early 1960s. For many years, Washington held
Colombia up as a model of good governance and a close partner in
President John F. Kennedy's Alliance for Progress aid program.
</P>
<P>
   But Colombia's entanglement with the drug trade in the mid-1980s
changed all of that. Since then, U.S. Colombia policy has been
nearly indistinguishable from U.S. antinarcotics policy. About 80
percent of the world's cocaine is produced in Colombia, along with
roughly three-quarters of the heroin seized by authorities on the
east coast of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, however, is that U.S. Colombia policy tends to be
single-minded, inflexible and driven by the desire to look tough on
drugs. As a result, it is often counterproductive. Any option that
might conceivably soften antidrug efforts is deemed unacceptable by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Relations with the United States reached a low point during the
1994-'98 presidency of Ernesto Samper, who was credibly accused of
having accepted some $6 million from the Cali drug cartel in his
1994 campaign. Samper's U.S. visa was revoked and, in 1996 and
1997, the United States fully decertified Colombia for failing to
cooperate in the fight against drugs. Decertification demoralized
and alienated Colombians and undermined their government's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the election of Pastrana last June has
substantially improved the relationship. This was reflected by the
recertification of Colombia in March 1999 and Congress' approval in
October 1998 of some $289 million in counternarcotics assistance
(tripling the amount previously provided).
</P>
<P>
   The increased aid includes about $40 million for an air-mobile
army battalion to help in the antidrug effort. This marks a
significant development. U.S. aid to the Colombian army had been
suspended in 1996 because of its troubling human-rights record.
(The money went to the national police instead.) Today, support is
still restricted and should be carefully monitored in accordance
with U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   But the Defense, State and Justice departments, the Office of
National Drug Control Policy and key congressional representatives
_ are all competing to shape policy. Skeptics in the U.S. Congress
have taken sharp public aim at the meetings between State
Department officials and FARC representatives, especially in light
of what they regard as the insurgents' stubborn behavior and
unreasonable demands (and the FARC's designation as a ``terrorist''
group). And members of Congress have been critical of Pastrana's
meetings with Fidel Castro to explore a Cuban role in brokering a
settlement with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Most Colombians long for peace but are divided over how to
pursue it. Only if Pastrana can shape a national consensus _ and
inspire his people to remain a part of it _ will he finally help
the country out of the abyss his father anticipated more than a
decade ago.

   MICHELIN _ Anderson County and Stephens County, Ga., are the
finalists for a $400 million Michelin tire plant that could employ
up to 350 people, the Anderson Independent-Mail reported. Officials
in both counties say Michelin is leaning heavily toward Anderson
County because of the work force and because South Carolina
recently passed a law giving tax breaks to tire-manufacturing
companies, the newspaper reported Thursday. The French-based tire
giant is not expected to make a final decision until September.
Several cities and counties were in the running originally, but the
competition has narrowed to the two counties apart 45 miles apart,
said Rep. Cordell Maddox Jr., D-Anderson, who has worked with
Michelin and Anderson County officials. (Kempner, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   NDC-MEDSCAPE _ Atlanta-based National Data Corp., a health

Medscape Inc., an online provider of medical information for health

additional $10 million in other considerations. CBS, which is
buying a 35 percent stake in Medscape, will work with the company
to create a new health care site aimed at consumers. Currently the
site is geared toward medical professionals, providing articles
from medical journals, news on conferences and other information
for doctors, nurses and other members of the health care
profession. In exchange, CBS gets $150 million worth of promotion
over the next seven years. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   TEXAS-POLLUTION _ The state's environmental commission last week
approved new rules to reduce sulfur in gasoline as a way of
reducing pollution, but it won't take effect until 2004 to give
refiners time to alter equipment. Austin and San Antonio had asked
the commission to speed up compliance, to as soon as 2001, as a way
of cleaning up their air -- and helping to avoid tipping into
non-compliance with federal clean air rules. (Hight, Austin
American-Statesman).

`MOVIE STARS' SNEAKS ONTO THE WB SUMMER SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's a list of the celebrities mentioned, but not seen, in the
first two episodes of ``Movie Stars'': Robin Williams, Tina Turner,
Jack Nicholson, Michael Douglas, Jennifer Lopez, Drew Barrymore,
Joe Pesci, Mel Gibson, Dweezil Zappa, Roseanne, Harvey Keitel,
Michael Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Take a breath. There's more.
</P>
<P>
   Calista Flockhart, Christina Ricci, Marilyn Manson, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, John Travolta,
Patrick Swayze, Robert Downey Jr., Courtney Love, Barbara Walters,
Sean Penn, Minnie Driver and Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking I ran all those names because I have nothing
nice to say about ``Movie Stars,'' you'd be correctamundo. Despite
The WB's assurance that ``Movie Stars'' might be back as a
midseason replacement next winter, this is one of those series that
networks like to burn off in the summertime when few people are
watching.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest clue is that only eight episodes were made. The next
biggest clue is that one episode will air on Sunday and another on
Monday, so in four weeks the entire ``Movie Stars'' oeuvre will be
out there for historians to ponder. After that, it'll be ``Movie
Stars'' reruns until it's time for the new fall shows.
</P>
<P>
   The premise of ``Movie Stars'' is that movie stars have a home
life. It just happens to be in Malibu and includes more
name-dropping than an Oscars telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Hamlin and Jennifer Grant play husband-and-wife celebs.
Their success makes a nice home for three kids named Apache,
Moonglow and Lori (his daughter from a previous marriage), plus her
wisecracking mother and his freeloading brother. The real-life
brothers of Travolta, Stallone and Swayze also appear regularly to
pick up a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   The hilarity that ensues is reminiscent of a bad comedy from the
'70s, which means that sometimes the acting is funnier than the
lines. As the Bruce Willis type, Hamlin is amusing, but for all the
wrong reasons. He's supposed to be a charming, flesh-and-blood guy
playing a one-note actor, but there's no difference between the
character, Reese Hardin, and the character he plays in the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Grant, the daughter of Carey Grant ant DyanCannon, is a
little more accessible as Jacey Wyatt, a star more devoted to her
craft than is Reese. But, as a parody of Hollywood, ``Movie Stars''
never gets under the skin. Like so much of Tinseltown, it's pretty
to look at, but ultimately artificial and superficial.
</P>
<P>
   Movie Stars. Half-hour comedy series about the home life of two
film stars. Starring Harry Hamlin, Jennifer Grant, Marnette
Patterson, Mark Benninghofen, Anne Haney, Zack Hopkins and Rachel
David. Premieres Sunday on The WB. Parental guideline rating:
TV-PG.

   Grade: C-

ART NOTES: HOW MUCH FOR THE DEGAS?; THE ART OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LONDON _ Since it is considered taboo to ask the price of a work
of art hanging on the walls of a museum, it was daring for Sarah
Hyde, a curator at the Courtauld Institute of Art's gallery in
London, to organize an entire exhibition based on the value of art
in its permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Curators think prices are something we should stay away from,
that once a work of art is in a museum it's protected from the art
market,'' Ms. Hyde said. ``But that's wrong. A lot of work art
historians do has an effect on the art market. Just because
something isn't for sale doesn't mean it isn't important.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, ``The Value of Art,'' which runs through Aug. 30,
consists of 15 pairs of unlabeled works from the Courtauld's
collection. Ms. Hyde said she purposely included a wide range of
objects, everything from Impressionist and Old Master paintings to
drawings, prints, silver and porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   Each pair of works is accompanied by a simple question: Which is
more valuable?
</P>
<P>
   Adjacent wall texts explain what the work is, including its
provenance and the range of factors that went into determining the
values.
</P>
<P>
   Considerations like condition, an artist's reputation,
workmanship and medium are carefully explained. Next to each pair
of works is a sliding panel that reveals the estimated auction
values of the works, as determined by experts at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Why should two silver George II coffeepots, both made in 1732
and both engraved with coats of arms, be worth different amounts?
One has an estimate of $8,000 to $9,600, while the other would be
expected to fetch $12,800 to $16,000. On the lower-priced coffeepot
the engraving is so worn that the surface is nearly smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been cleaned too much over the centuries,'' Ms. Hyde
said. ``The more valuable one is in far better condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Why do two images of the same woman, both by Matisse, made two
years apart, have drastically different values?
</P>
<P>
   One is a lithograph from 1925 that is said to be worth $32,000
to $40,000, while a 1923 signed drawing carries an estimate of
$144,000 to $192,000.
</P>
<P>
   The lithograph is an edition of 50, while the drawing is unique,
Ms. Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
   That pricing art is often a more complex process than it seems
is underscored by two works in the show by Degas, for whom a record
price was set when a pastel and gouache work was auctioned last
week at Sotheby's. (That work, ``Dancer in Repose,'' went for $27.9
million.) In the exhibition is an oil painting, ``Two Dancers
Onstage'' (1877), which Sotheby's estimated could bring $32 million
to $48 million. Next to it is a pastel, ``After the Bath, Woman
Drying Herself'' (1889), which the auction house believes would
fetch only $3,200 to $4,800.
</P>
<P>
   ``The painting is highly finished, was signed by the artist and
sold by him within months of its completion, whereas the pastel was
not sold by Degas, is not signed and therefore might be
unfinished,'' Ms. Hyde said. ``Drawings also are often regarded as
preparations for finished works and are generally worth less than
oil paintings.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sotheby's estimate for ``After the Bath'' is drastically
lower than the $8 million to $11.2 million estimate it had given
``Dancer in Repose'' before it brought $27.9 million here last
week. This raises the question of how accurate auction house
estimates are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't actually talked to Sotheby's about the price,'' Ms.
Hyde said. ``It was an astounding amount for a work on paper, and I
wonder if it would cause them to revise their estimates for these
Degases.''
</P>
<P>
   But Melanie Clore, deputy chairwoman of Sotheby's in Europe and
head of its Impressionist and modern art department, said the
auction house would not revise its estimates. The estimates put on
the two Degas works in the exhibition, she said, are in line with
the prices achieved last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancer in Repose,'' although done in pastel and gouache, is in
many respects closer to the Courtauld's ``Two Dancers Onstage,''
which Sotheby's estimated at $32 million to $48 million, Ms. Clore
said. ``Even though one is an oil painting and the other a pastel
and gouache, `Dancer in Repose' is unlike most of the artist's
pastels in that it is very painterly,'' she explained. ``It's an
exceptional work, which is one of the reasons it made such an
extraordinary price.''
</P>
<P>
   The Art of History
</P>
<P>
   Although the Tate Gallery of Modern Art doesn't open until the
spring of 2000, its curators are already staging events to get the
local neighborhood of Bankside involved with the new institution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to showing films by artists on the facade of the
renovated power station, which is across the Thames from St. Paul's
Cathedral, they have invited the American artist Mark Dion to lead
an archaeological dig of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Dion, whose work often includes discovered treasures shown as
life-size curiosity cabinets, has put together a team of 10 local
volunteers to search in the Thames at Millbank, the site of the
original Tate Gallery, and the Thames at Bankside, to see what they
can discover.
</P>
<P>
   Each site has a rich history. Millbank was home to an
18th-century prison; as early as the 16th century, Bankside housed
theaters, brothels and bear- and bull-baiting pits.
</P>
<P>
   The public is allowed to watch the digs, and the finds will be
examined and classified by the artist in tents on the lawn of the
Tate Gallery at Millbank from July 19 to Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   They will be exhibited inside the museum from Oct. 26 through
Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Test digs have already unearthed an 18th-century thimble,
early-19th-century clay pots and a medieval shoe,'' said Frances
Morris, a curator at the Tate Gallery of Modern Art. ``This is the
first collaboration we have had between the two museums. Until the
Tate Gallery of Modern Art is finished, we are a museum without
walls.''

U.S. GOALIE STAYS COOL IN THE HOT SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One of the first things that strikes you about
Briana Scurry is her patience.
</P>
<P>
   Following her dominating performance in the United States' 2-0
win over Brazil in the Women's World Cup semifinal at Stanford
Stadium last Sunday, Scurry stood in the still-hot sun outside the
locker room and answered questions for the best part of an hour.
</P>
<P>
   As the session went on and on, the questions took on a numbing
familiarity, but she never lost her smile _ or her cool.
</P>
<P>
   That cool has been evident throughout the World Cup, along with
Scurry's skill, which, until the last few weeks, has never been
fully recognized.
</P>
<P>
   When she joined the team out of college in 1994, U.S. coach Tony
DiCicco predicted she would emerge as the best female goalkeeper in
the world. And, a few days ago, DiCicco said he thinks she has now
reached that point.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence in this World Cup of such sterling keepers
as China's Gao Hong _ whom the U.S. team will face in the Cup final
Saturday at the Rose Bowl _ Sweden's Ulrika Karlsson and Norway's
Bente Nordby, it would be tough to argue with DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   In five matches, Scurry has given up just two goals (not
counting Brandi Chastain's own goal against Germany). And when it
mattered most, in the semifinal against a previously high-scoring
Brazilian team, she was impenetrable, making six saves, at least
half of them spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   That performance brought to mind what Scurry said before she
stepped into the U.S. net for the first time five years ago: ``It
has always been a dream of mine to be the best at something. And
this opportunity to play with the best team in the world ... you
bet I'm going to grab it with both hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until now, however, the 27-year-old Scurry has been more
symbol than star.
</P>
<P>
   She is the only black player to start for the U.S. team (and one
of only two on the squad along with backup goalkeeper Saskia
Webber).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fact,'' Scurry said. ``I'm the one you see, and it is a
responsibility. I'm not so naive to think it isn't. I realize
people look at me and the question is going to come up, but it's
something I embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of African-Americans playing soccer, so it's
something I take seriously. I would love to see a lot more
African-Americans get into the sport, and I hope when they see me
playing, they'll say, `You know, I should try soccer. She's
playing.'''
</P>
<P>
   She might not be playing, however, if her family had not moved
from inner-city Minneapolis to the almost-all-white suburb of
nearby Anoka when she was 5, and Scurry gave up her first athletic
love _ football _ for soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we moved was my parents wanted me to get a better
education,'' she said. ``In actuality, I don't think I would have
had nearly the opportunities to play multiple sports (basketball,
softball, track and soccer) in high school if we hadn't moved. It
opened up more opportunities, and it molded me.''
</P>
<P>
   After being named National Goalkeeper of the Year for 1993, she
joined the national team and, going into the World Cup, she had set
a U.S. record with 49 career shutouts and an 0.56 goals-against
average in 90 international appearances.
</P>
<P>
   She was always relaxed and focused, but at 5-feet-8-inches and
135 pounds, she was also a bit light, at the beginning, for the
big-time grind.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were pushing me around,'' she said. ``So I hit the
weight room and gained 15 pounds going into the 1996 Olympics. It
helped immensely.''
</P>
<P>
   You might say so. In five Olympic matches, she gave up only five
goals as the U.S. won a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   And she's continued to improve.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said, ``She is incredibly important to us. The two
things I look for in a goalkeeper most of all _ and I think Bri is
strong in both of these _ are athleticism, because it's the hardest
thing to teach, and mental skills. There's times we play that I
think things are getting pretty hectic back there, and everyone's
on the verge of panic except for Bri. She seems to get calmer.''
</P>
<P>
   So it appears established, then, that Scurry is unflappable,
regardless of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   There was that time after the '96 Olympics, though.
</P>
<P>
   In a candid moment during an early-morning magazine interview,
Scurry promised that if the United States won a gold medal, she
would run through the streets of Athens, Ga., naked.
</P>
<P>
   That celebration, not recorded for posterity, hasn't come back
to haunt her.
</P>
<P>
   But she said, ``I have no predictions for this World Cup. I just
want to win _ and keep my clothes on.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Very humid air streamed northward into the deserts of southern
California and Arizona from the warm Gulf of California. Meanwhile,
18,000 feet above the ground, steering winds slacked to speeds as
slow as 5 mph. As a result, thunderstorms that erupted moved
slowly, setting the stage for protracted heavy rain and flash
flooding. Friday, the same pattern will persist, with slow-moving
thunderstorms dousing the deserts. Storms will move westward into
the mountains of southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the tropical moisture invading the Southwest will surge
into parts of Colorado, northwest Texas, Oklahoma and Missouri
ahead of a cool front pushing slowly south over the Plains. As a
result, clusters of heavy showers and thunderstorms, some capable
of producing more than 2 inches of rain will develop. Severe
weather is also possible.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, showers and thunderstorms, some with heavy rain,
damaging winds and large hail, will erupt ahead of the northern
flank of the cool front across the Ohio Valley and into the Great
Lakes region. Storms may consolidate into a line and forge across
the Northeast on Saturday evening into the night. Early in the day,
a cluster of showers and storms will sweep across New York into New
England as a warm front, marking the leading edge of returning
humid air, presses north across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated heavy thunderstorms will flare in Florida in concert
with sea-breeze fronts moving inland, while another cluster of
storms fires in the central Gulf Coast states. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Balancing Act
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms lashed the Virgin Islands on Thursday as a
disturbance moved westward across the Atlantic. While weather
systems outside the tropics generally travel from west to east, the
steering winds for tropical systems blow from east to west.
Hypothetically, if winds blew from the west everywhere on Earth,
they would, by producing an increased eastward drag on the Earth's
surface, cause the Earth's rate of rotation to increase. In
reality, winds from the east over the tropics balance the drag of
winds from the west over higher latitudes, keeping the Earth's
rotation constant. &QL;

 &HT;    Strong crew powers Confederate `Hunley'
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hunley was a Confederate submarine named for its inventor,
Capt. Horace Hunley. Capt. Hunley died while testing an earlier
version of his submersible, which sank to the bottom of Charleston
Bay and stayed there, along with its crew.
</P>
<P>
   In his honor, the Confederates named the infernal weapon after
him and sent out another batch of men in it, men who knew full well
what had happened to the inventor.
</P>
<P>
   All of this hangs over the new movie ``The Hunley'' like
inevitable doom, like the Spanish moss that festoons the trees of
Charleston, S.C., where our story is set.
</P>
<P>
   It's 1864, and the South is in trouble all over, and nowhere
more than in Charleston, where a blockade of Union ships off the
coast fires shells into downtown at will. The only way to sink any
of the ships is for the Hunley to sneak out and attach a land mine
to it; torpedoes that can be fired won't be invented till much
later.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteering for this ill-fated job is Lt. Dixon, who appears
not to have a first name, but has sweaty charisma to spare as
played by Armand Assante. He also has a quite believable Southern
accent, although he's so
</P>
<P>
   prone to mumbling you may ratchet up the volume to catch his
swallowed dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's more than willing, Dixon is also under pressure
from Gen. Beauregard (a rheumy-eyed Donald Sutherland) to end the
shelling. Neither man thinks there's a chance the South can
actually win, and there's no talk about the honor of the South;
they're in it to the bitter end because they're soldiers, and
that's enough.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon's crew of six volunteers, with no shortage of macho
sweatiness among themselves, not only have to set out on a mission
of likely death, but have to work like dogs to get there. The
Hunley is so primitive it's hand-powered, and the crew's main job
is to sit in a cramped metal hold and turn a huge crank to get the
vessel moving. When they're not cranking and diving under the
water, they're drinking, fighting and bonding on shore. As is
usually the case with these movies, the claustrophobic underwater
sequences are far more dramatic than the sometimes cliched shore
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Although it flounders a bit at times, by the time the Hunley
makes its fateful run, this TNT movie has full steam.

   The summer reading season coincides with the summer driving
season. Here, just in time for perusal at poolside or in a
beach-bound traffic jam, is a look at some new books with
automotive themes:
</P>
<P>
   BEETLE BOOKS: When Adolf Hitler was imprisoned in 1923, he spent
his time writing ``Mein Kampf'' and reading a biography of Henry
Ford, which helped to inspire the future dictator's vision of a
``people's car.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, with the Fuehrer dead and Germany occupied
by the Allies, the British were in charge of a zone that included
Wolfsburg, home of the fledgling Volkswagen factory and the
manifestation of Hitler's automotive dreams. In 1947, VW produced
only 8,978 cars (which had been designed by the legendary Ferdinand
Porsche, who went on to build some of the world's best-known sports
cars). The next year, the British offered to turn the plant over to
Henry Ford, but he rejected it. His advisers had told him it was
``not worth a damn.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitler's brainchild, of course, became the best-selling car
ever, with more than 20 million sold worldwide; it broke the 15
million record of Ford's Model T in 1972. Called the Type 1 in
Germany, the VW was dubbed the Beetle or the Bug in America.
</P>
<P>
   Such historical tidbits are the best parts of ``Beetlemania,''
by Kate McLeod (Smithmark, $12.98), and ``The Volkswagen Bug
Book,'' by Dan Ouelette (Angel City Press, $30), two coffee-table
books full of pictures of the car that became an icon.
</P>
<P>
   The books cover much of the same territory, although ``The
Volkswagen Bug Book'' is more text-heavy and comprehensive. The
pictures, especially those in Ouelette's book, illustrate the
dichotomy of the Volkswagen image. Colorful, warm and fuzzy photos
of Bugs in America, some with exotic paint and others with happy
dogs hanging out open windows, are presented along with stark,
grainy, black-and-white images of the car in the Third Reich. ``The
Volkswagen Bug Book'' almost naturally falls open to a shot of a
smiling Hitler, a swastika on his sleeve, inspecting an early
model.
</P>
<P>
   There are some interesting minor differences between the two
books. Ms. McLeod writes that the British offered to sell the VW
plant to Henry Ford; Ouelette says that they wanted to give it to
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Both books trace the Volkswagen Beetle from its Nazi-era roots
to its demise in the United States in the late '70s, when it
succumbed because of a tired design, aggressive Japanese
competition and ever-tighter safety and pollution rules. The
original, essentially unchanged since the 1940s, continues to be
produced in Mexico, still with its rear-mounted, air-cooled engine.
</P>
<P>
   The books also cover the ``rebirth'' last year of the
not-quite-dead car as the New Beetle, which shares little with its
predecessor except the general shape that makes it instantly
recognizable. The New Beetle is an all-new model that uses the VW
Golf's front-mounted engine and platform. It has received good
reviews and high scores in safety tests and has sold briskly, while
also unleashing waves of nostalgia for the old Bug.
</P>
<P>
   The authors write that one of the secrets of the original's
success was the company's willingness to abandon conventional
wisdom. Instead of changing models every year, Heinz Nordoff, who
was put in charge of VW following Henry Ford's rejection, kept
refining the same car, making it better and better, while other
carmakers were obsessed with bringing out ever-more-flashy new
models every year.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom was also rejected by VW's U.S. advertising
agency, the old Doyle Dane Bernback. Ads were simple and clever;
they poked fun at the car's unusual looks and urged potential
buyers to ``think small.'' In 1953, 2,173 Beetles were sold in
America; by 1968, that number rose to an all-time high of 569,292.
</P>
<P>
   For the New Beetle, Arnold Communications of Boston is also
producing advertisements that make you smile. ``If you sold your
soul in the '80s,'' one says, ``here's your chance to buy it
back.''
</P>
<P>
   An unexpected result of the Beetle phenomenon is that a car
intended for the average person ended up crossing all class lines.
The same is true for Beetle redux; the new car has been snapped up
by celebrities, commoners and college students.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, the original Beetle really did float. Events staged by
the Waterbugs of America Racing Association required participants
to drive their cars into the water and negotiate a course of about
a mile. There were even unsuccessful attempts to cross the English
Channel in floating VWs.
</P>
<P>
   One more tidbit: Ms. McLeod reports that 103 college students
set an unofficial record by packing into a Beetle and driving it 15
feet. She does not report the exact date of this feat or the car's
condition afterward.
</P>
<P>
   If your interest in the Beetle is more practical than
historical, you might prefer the 18th edition and 30th anniversary
issue of ``How to Keep Your Volkswagen Alive,'' by John Muir (John
Muir Publications, $25). This folksy guide to keeping older models
running became a hippie handbook that has sold more than 2.3
million copies since it was first published in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The book, whose subtitle is ``A Manual of Step by Step
Procedures for the Compleat Idiot,'' is not just a detailed how-to
book on fixing a car. It is a chronicle of one man's love affair
with VWs _ it could have been called ``Zen and the Art of
Volkswagen Maintenance.'' Muir writes about how one must do
mechanical work on a VW with love or the result will be failure. He
even suggests talking to the cars. A drawing of the VW ``control
system'' is a diagram of the human brain.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be misled. This is an extremely practical book that
really will help you keep an old Beetle or Microbus on the road.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other noteworthy, recently published books on
automotive matters:
</P>
<P>
   BUYING USED: A new guide to buying a used car, ``Lemon-Aid Used
Cars 1999,'' by Phil Edmonston (Stoddart Publishing, $17.95), is
one of the most valuable of its kind because it includes
information on secret warranties and confidential service bulletins
that most owners aren't aware of and most automakers want to keep
that way.
</P>
<P>
   These often result from lawsuits or government intervention that
may not be widely publicized. For instance, few Honda owners are
likely to be aware that under a settlement with the Environmental
Protection Agency, the company extended its emissions warranty to
14 years or 150,000 miles for 1995-97 Civics and 1996-97 Accords,
Preludes and Odysseys. This means that if you own one of these
vehicles, you are entitled to a full engine check and
emission-related repairs at 50,000 to 75,000 miles, and free
tune-ups at 75,000 and 150,000 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lemon-Aid'' also has information on prices and defects for two
decades of used cars, and advice on getting your money back if you
buy a lemon. The book's layout and organization are daunting, but
the information is worth the trouble it takes to find it.
</P>
<P>
   BUYING NEW: Once again, the ``Dummies'' series increases your
smarts with ``Buying a Car for Dummies'' by Deanna Sclar (IDG
Books, $16.99), one of the best all-round guides available to
buying or leasing a car. Little icons on almost every page serve as
flags for helpful tips, warnings or things to remember; for
example, there is specific advice on how to get a better deal by
using an auto broker or a buying service.
</P>
<P>
   BERLITZ FOR BREAKDOWNS: ``Car Smarts,'' by Mary Jackson (John
Muir Publications, $17.95) is a lighthearted, easy to understand
guide for dealing with mechanics and speaking their language. It
could be very useful, especially for those mystified by a car's
innards. The drawings and diagrams are clear; technical terms are
nicely explained, and the writing is free of jargon.
</P>
<P>
   TAURUS WATCH: Mary Walton had unrestricted access to Ford
executives, designers and engineers as they set out to redesign the
popular Taurus. In her very readable book, ``Car: A Drama of the
American Workplace'' (W.W. Norton, paperback version, $17), she
tells you more than you may want to know about the 1996 model. But
her account is particularly interesting now that the market has
passed judgment on that car _ not entirely favorably _ and Ford is
bringing out a 2000 Taurus that eliminates or tones down a number
of the distinctive features of the 1996-99 models. Despite the
minutiae, a reader will come away with an appreciation of the
complexities of building a car.

STRIDE RITE CHIEF RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After barely seven months on the job, Stride Rite Corp.'s
chairman and chief executive, James A. Eskridge, abruptly resigned
Thursday following an apparent clash over strategy with the
Lexington-based footwear company's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Myles J. Slosberg, the 62-year-old grandson of the man who in
1919 founded the company that would later be known for Keds, has
been appointed as interim chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Slosberg said he would lead a search team that will seek a
permanent successor to Eskridge, a former executive at Mattel Inc.
and General Mills Inc. who moved from California to assume the top
job at Stride Rite late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's completely a shock,'' said Steven A. Richter, an analyst
for Tucker Anthony Cleary Gull, who added of Eskridge's departure,
``Clearly, there was some disagreement over the direction of the
company. Clearly, there was a clash.''
</P>
<P>
   Stride Rite shares fell on the news despite the company's strong
performance in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, Stride Rite shares fell 1 7/8 to
close at 8 11/16 on trading that was more than 10 times heavier
than the three-month daily average.
</P>
<P>
   Eskridge is well regarded on Wall Street, and so was his plan to
aggressively pursue acquisitions for Stride Rite, said Midwest
Research analyst Jeff Stinson.
</P>
<P>
   To assist Slosberg, Stride Rite promoted Diane M. Sullivan to
president and chief operating officer and also brought back Joanna
M. Jacobson to serve as vice chairman. Two weeks ago, Stride Rite
announced Jacobson was leaving as president of its Keds division to
spend more time with her family.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, who had been president of another Stride Rite
division, might be ``a very logical successor'' to Eskridge ``down
the road,'' analyst Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   But Slosberg declined to comment on the timetable of his search
and its likely list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's got her hands full right now,'' he said of Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to pin down the precise nature of the rift between
Eskridge and the Stride Rite board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke to the company, and they would not delineate any
further about the parting of the ways,'' said Steven Marotta, an
analyst with Wasserstein Perella Securities.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Eskridge said, ``While I disagree with the board
about the direction of change in the company, as a shareholder, I
wish Stride Rite only the best in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Slosberg of Eskridge, ``There really wasn't a good fit
between him and our vision of the company.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has been a hostage to fashion cycles. When its
brands are in vogue, the company thrives. When canvas shoes fell
out of favor earlier in the decade, Keds slumped and so did Stride
Rite.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Stride Rite hired Robert Siegel from the Docker's
division of Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. to help engineer a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Looking to be less dependent on Keds, the company entered
licensing agreements to make various shoe lines under the Tommy
Hilfiger and the Nine West brand names.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999's second quarter that ended May 28, sales were up 16
percent to $166.3 million. If a one-time gain from the second
quarter of 1998 was excluded, net income rose 37 percent to $9.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, sales of Keds were up 9 percent. Sales for
Sperry Top-Sider, another Stride Rite brand, were up 13 percent,
and sales for the Tommy Hilfiger lines ``more than doubled,'' said
Stride Rite, which reported 1998 sales of $539.4 million. Last
year, Siegel retired, and Eskridge was tapped to replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Slosberg, a long-time company director who held many key jobs at
Stride Rite before leaving to pursue a legal career, noted that the
groundwork for Stride Rite's comeback strategy was laid before
Eskridge joined the company. With the long lead times needed to
plan shoe lines, Eskridge's presence was not a factor in Stride
Rite's second-quarter results, Slosberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not be concerned that Stride Rite's performance
was his performance,'' Slosberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst don't foresee a slowdown in that performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turnaround continues,'' Richter said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting Stride Rite's strong portfolio of brands, its solid
balance sheet, and its team of seasoned executives, Marotta said,
``This is a strong company.''

<P>
   Keeping time with the nation's rocking economy, retailers posted
another month of robust sales gains in June.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in stores opened at least a year, a key industry
measurement, rose 6.5 percent last month, according to the Goldman
Sachs retail composite index. Since January, the index has risen at
the torrid pace of on average 6.47 a month. ``This is the strongest
year since we started keeping track of the data'' in 1988, said
Margaret Mager, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   With both unemployment and inflation low, Americans were eager
to open their pocketbooks and spend. ``Certainly one of the key
drivers of this is that consumer confidence is at the highest we
have seen in 30 years,'' said Angie Selden, a partner in Arthur
Andersen's global retail practice.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong economy was not the only reason for the strong
performance. Many retailers have been improving their merchandise,
especially in clothing and housewares.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a great fashion cycle,'' said Maura Hunter Byrne, an
analyst at Solomon Smith Barney. She credited retailers with
creating excitement by changing lengths and styling in common
apparel items, noting this year's must-have summer items like
three-quarter length sleeved T-shirts and mid-calf length capri
pants.
</P>
<P>
   The strong sales numbers are expected to translate into good
earnings. Jeff Feiner, managing director at Lehman Brothers, said,
``Because this was not a month with a lot of markdowns, profits
were strong.'' He increased his earnings estimates for seven large
retailers including Costco Companies Inc., Federated Department
Stores and Tiffany and Co.
</P>
<P>
   As customers rushed to suit up for the hot weather in clingy
tanks and sportswear with surfer motifs, they particularly shopped
at specialty apparel stores. Limited Inc., which includes Lane
Bryant, Express and Victoria's Secret, had a gain of 11 percent at
stores opened for a year as all its divisions showed strong
increases. Ann Taylor sustained its comeback with a 7.7 percent
rise. Eddie Bauer had an increase of 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Discount stores similarly benefited from an unusually steamy
June, as consumers purchased air-conditioners and patio furniture.
Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest merchant, had an increase of
6.5 percent over June of last year. Kmart Corp. rebounded from last
month's anemic sales gain to post a strong increase of 9.2 percent.
Shopko Stores Inc. and Ames Department Stores Inc., a regional
discount chain, each reported increases just north of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even the department stores, which have trailed the performance
of the discounters in recent years, had a fine showing. Dayton
Hudson was up 6.9 percent, Kohl's rose 15 percent, and May
Department Stores and Federated Department Stores each had a
whopping 8.4 percent rise. ``In every merchandise category in every
part country there have been strengths that exceeded the plan,''
said Carol Sanger, spokeswoman for Federated, sounding pleasantly
surprised herself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the mostly glowing numbers, a few merchants stood out
for their poor performance. Sales at the long-struggling J.C.
Penney Co. fell 2.3 percent from last June. In a press release, the
retailer, based in Plano, Tex., blamed ``softer than expected
Father's Day sales and the elimination of a major sales event.''
Penney's, the nation's fifth-largest department store chain, has
been battling disappointing sales results for two years now.
</P>
<P>
   Gap Inc. reported a powerful 13 percent sales gain, with the
growth coming entirely from its two hot divisions. Gap's tony
Banana Republic division had a sales increase of 17 to 19 percent
over June of last year, and Old Navy, showing no sign that its
slightly gimmicky concept was wearing thin with consumers, posted
growth of nearly 37 percent over May of last year.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gap stores, which generate a little less than half of
the chain's $9 billion in revenues, had flat sales for the second
consecutive month, as did Gap Kids. Warren Hashagen, the company's
chief financial officer, said Gap Kids was ``working its way
through some fashion missteps.'' He added that both chains had
revamped fashion items for the fall and ``are positioned well for
the back-to-school season.''
</P>
<P>
   Stock analysts cut Gap slack anyway since the flat numbers came
on top of a stellar performance last year for the casual apparel
giant. Last Spring, Gap introduced an ad campaign showing
attractive models boogieing in its khakis, and sales shot up in the
double digits.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts also remain optimistic that retailers were in a strong
position for the rest of the year, including the all-important
back-to-school and holiday seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the strong numbers, retailers are watching inventories
tightly,'' Feiner said. ``They are not over-ordering for
Christmas.''

COLLEGE REPUBLICANS LOOK AT THE CANDIDATES

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the pantheon of American presidential politics,
college students rank far below high-tech and Hollywood moguls as
sources of campaign cash. But they offer candidates other things:
their votes and their zeal.
</P>
<P>
   So with a modicum of self-importance 500 members of the College
Republican National Committee arrived here Thursday for a two-day
meeting, ready to be wooed by the GOP's crowded presidential field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ones who stand on the corner in the rain in Iowa, or
in the snow in New Hampshire,'' said Joe Singara, the group's
second vice-chairman from Burlington, Vt. ``Maybe we don't have the
checkbooks, but if you don't have college students stuffing
envelopes or going door-to-door, you're in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   One candidate, publishing magnate Malcolm S. ``Steve'' Forbes,
told them that ``America today is truly at a crossroads'' before
launching into his standard campaign speech advocating lower taxes,
school vouchers and Social Security individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Another candidate, Alan Keyes, a radio talk-show host and a
former assistant secretary of state in the Reagan administration,
was also scheduled to speak Thursday. On tap Friday are former
American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole, Rep. John Kasich,
R-Ohio, conservative activist Gary Bauer, and Sen. Bob Smith,
R-N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Among those absent from the speakers' roster are conservative
commentator Pat Buchanan, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and _ most
conspicuously _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the GOP frontrunner.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Brohimer, chairman of the college Republicans, shrugged off
Bush's absence. ``He's got a tough road out there,'' Brohimer said.
But he added that he is sure Bush and the others understand the
importance of young voters, particularly young GOP voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the future of this country. and candidates understand
the importance of youth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 500 students attending this year's meeting number 200 more
than those who attended the 107-year-old group's last session in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the young Republicans will announce results of a straw
poll showing which presidential candidate they favor.
</P>
<P>
   David Castleman, a Dartmouth College student, said he supports
Bush. ``He's willing to focus not just on the stereotypical
cigar-chomping Republicans,'' Castleman said. ``I think he's a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Gladden of Indiana University said he likes McCain. ``I
think he's a little more of a maverick on issues like tobacco and
campaign finance,'' he said. ``He doesn't always do the expedient
thing, and he's a war hero who's given a lot to his country.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Saeger, a student at Valparaiso University in Indiana,
said she favors Dole. ``She's a great role model,'' Saeger said.
``She'd be a great leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The students' meeting is being held at the old Watergate Hotel,
now called Swissotel Washington-the Watergate. It was the scene of
the famous 1972 burglary that set in motion events that brought
down a Republican president, Richard Nixon, in 1974.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WELLINGTON, South Africa _ Magrieta Manus and her husband,
Bastiaan, have lived and worked on the same vineyard here for more
than 40 years, making do with their nine children in two
dilapidated rooms set on such a steep hill that their rocky,
slanted dirt floor is usually damp from the rain.
</P>
<P>
   They work in the fields for less than $18 a week and, until two
years ago, when the farm changed hands, they were given free wine,
too, under a system started centuries ago as a way of addicting
laborers to alcohol and keeping them working for virtually nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Manus received a full bottle a day. Mrs. Manus about half that.
On the weekends, they bought their own, usually drinking until they
passed out.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, things are a bit tougher in their household, because
they have no free alcohol. On Fridays, Mrs. Manus is so eager for
her wine that she buys a 60-cent bottle to drink right there at the
liquor store down the road. Then she makes her way home with a
five-liter container that has cost her one-fifth of her week's
salary. In the summer months, when she has no work as a seasonal
laborer, the money comes from her husband's salary and makes an
even bigger hole in the family's meager budget.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping workers drunk with free alcohol, a system called the dop
_ the Afrikaans word for a tot _ has been illegal for decades and
is now publicly repudiated by the $1.7 billion wine industry here,
which is very conscious of its image and of past mistakes. Some
surveys suggest 20 percent of the farms in Western Cape Province
still use the system. Others say the extent is even less.
</P>
<P>
   But experts say the end of the old system is ushering in a new
set of hardships, and new research shows an alarming rate of fetal
alcohol syndrome in workers' children.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are buying the liquor themselves, running up debts and
leaving less money in the household for food, clothing and school
fees. Often, too, because they have little ability to travel, they
pay more for the alcohol than they should. And rather than drinking
on the farms with their wives, many men go to illegal bars, called
shebeens, where knife fights are frequent and prostitutes hover.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just stop it and expect everything to be all
right,'' said Dr. Dennis L. Viljoen, who heads the human genetics
department at the University of the Witwatersrand and has been
studying the effects of alcohol on workers for years. ``When you
talk to the workers these days, a lot of the women say they were
better off under the dop system. The men were at home then. They
didn't go off and spend all the money and get in fights.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the damage that the dop system did is only now
beginning to be measured. In Wellington, a region of fertile
fields, stately farmhouses and run-down workers' quarters, a group
of researchers from the University of Cape Town Foundation for
Alcohol Related Research has conducted a survey to examine
virtually all the children entering the first grade in the local
public schools. The researchers found that the rates of fetal
alcohol syndrome might be the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The study showed that 11 percent of farm workers' children were
affected, including Mrs. Manus' youngest boy, Jacob. By comparison,
the rate in the United States is 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Viljoen said that even among groups with high levels of
alcoholism like American Indians, the rate is 2 percent. Moreover,
the researchers said they believed that the study probably
undercounted incidences, because in many cases children failed to
thrive and died before reaching school.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Manus, a tiny women of 58 with a deeply lined face and few
teeth, said that she knew that alcohol could damage her child when
she was pregnant, but that she had never tried to stop drinking
because she did not think that she could.
</P>
<P>
   On a visit, her home _ cavelike because broken window panes have
been replaced with cardboard scraps _ was as tidy as possible.
Inviting guests to a musty sofa that had shreds of fabric over its
foam rubber padding, she apologized for how cold the house was. It
was perpetually dank, she said. Pointing at the blackened rafters,
she said she often took coals from the stove and placed them on the
floor in the middle of the room to try to keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Manus said when she realized what alcohol had done to her
son _ she is not sure how old he is _ she tried to warn her
pregnant daughter, who also lives on the hill. But without result.
</P>
<P>
   ``It did not make any difference,'' Mrs. Manus said. ``I told
her what a hard time Jacob was having. But she did not stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside her room, the daughter, Magrieta Kruger, 27, was washing
laundry in plastic buckets, cradling her fussy daughter in one arm.
She proudly showed off the baby, Jasmine. But a university
researcher, Julie Croxford, said the infant, who had a tiny head,
had also clearly been damaged by alcohol abuse. At nine months, the
child weighed 7{ pounds, the figure for an average newborn.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny head is just one symptom of fetal alcohol syndrome.
Mental retardation, abnormal facial features, problems with the
central nervous system and behavioral difficulties are other signs.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say they believe that a mother's binge drinking in
early pregnancy is the most damaging to the child. But many factors
can contribute to the damage, including the mother's overall health
and nutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting alcohol abuse among the farm workers here is not easy,
experts say, because the drinking has become an integral part of
the culture. Most workers in the region are ``coloreds,'' the
descendants of blacks, whites, Malay slaves imported in the 17th
century and the Khoi-khoi and San peoples, who were here before
blacks or whites arrived. Like other nonwhites under apartheid,
they were severely restricted over where they could live, travel
and go to school.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of the drinking and the degradation of apartheid
has been devastating, researchers say. The drinking was not only a
form of recreation in a bleak existence, but also a form of
resistance; the farmers were excluded from their drunken world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in some ways a form of rebellion,'' Ms. Croxford said.
``It's a very complicated thing.''

   The drinking is so severe that stories abound of malnourished
children being given wine because there is nothing else in the
house. One child, for whom the researchers are trying to find a
school, was found as an infant on the side of the road with a baby
bottle full of wine. Her mother was later hit by a car and killed
as she wandered into the road in a drunken stupor.
</P>
<P>
   The baby, Monica, is now 9. But she has a head the size of a
toddler and an IQ that will never allow her to read or write.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do see drunken kids,'' Ms. Croxford said. ``If they are
hungry and there is nothing else, the parents give them wine.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey published last year in The South African Medical
Journal found that in Stellenbosch, an area that produces some of
South Africa's best and most profitable wines, child malnutrition
was the leading health problem.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, South Africa's wine country is a place of sharp
contrasts, with picturesque villages and white church steeples for
tourists to admire and, buried deep at the ends of dirt roads, the
miserable housing usually provided to workers. One survey of farm
workers' conditions in 1996 Africa found that 34 percent had no
running water and 27 percent did not have any kind of toilet
facilities. Fewer than 50 percent had electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say conditions have not really improved since the first
all-race elections in 1994. Although a few farmers have come up
with innovative schemes to use government subsidies to help the
workers own the land that they farm, those have been the exception.
In fact, some experts say, new labor and worker's rights bills have
actually made things worse for many. To curb costs, farmers are
using more and more part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   Many small towns, including Wellington, have growing squatter
camps, in many cases made up of out-of-work farm laborers. In
Wellington, about every 10th shack in the squatter camp is a
shebeen.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have most farmers been interested in dealing with the
alcohol abuse on their properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something that farmers have taken particularly
seriously,'' said Nicki Taylor, a researcher at the Center for
Rural Legal Studies, a workers' advocacy group. ``Farmers have been
faced with the problem for so many years that they do not see it as
a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmers' associations are extremely touchy on the subject of the
dop, which has always been concentrated in the Western Cape, where
most of the wine is made. But it has been used on all kinds of
farms. In fact, experts say it is far more likely to be found on
fruit or vegetable farms, because the wine industry is highly
sensitive about its image.
</P>
<P>
   The giant wine growers' cooperative, known by its local acronym
of KWV, declined to talk about the subject, referring questions to
an industry-supported research group called the Industry
Association for Responsible Alcohol Use. The head of the
organization, Dr. Chan Makan, said no members of the cooperative
used the dop any more. He agreed that the changes had brought new
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a dangerous thing to say,'' Makan said. ``But in some
ways things are worse now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Cape Agricultural Union also declined to talk about
the subject, except to say that it had a policy against the system.
``We made that statement very clear and I don't think I can add to
that,'' said Johan Bothma, manager of general affairs for the
group.
</P>
<P>
   But some farmers are more open about the difficulties they have
had.
</P>
<P>
   Schalk Visser ended the dop on his farm in Stellenbosch in 1983.
Some workers simply quit. Others ran up huge tabs at shebeens. To
make sure that they had food, Visser started a credit system for
them at a food store on his farm. A generation later, he said, 40
percent of the workers drink. But when the subject comes up with
other farmers, he added, many still believe that the dop system is
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that ending it doesn't work,'' Visser said. ``They
say the workers just get in trouble at the shebeens. But for me,
that at least is the worker's choice. At least, my conscience is
clean that I didn't help a mother and father go down the drain.''

<P>
   OSHIMA, Japan _ It is just past dawn as Yasushi Yamashita guides
his white fishing boat through the waves, finds his buoy and then
grunts as he hauls his nets to the surface in hopes of a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Yamashita's rugged face radiates pleasure as he finds the
surprise _ a rich harvest of hundreds of squirming fish about 18
inches long _ and begins throwing the fish into the hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a good haul, wasn't it?'' he said, exultantly. ``This
is as good as it would have been a decade ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Then his face dropped a bit, and he added, ``Of course, back
then the price was twice what it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Yamashita, a stocky 50-year-old fisherman as weather-beaten as
the little island of Oshima where he lives in the Goto chain of
southern Japan, is a fading breed.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is still by far the world's leading consumer of fish, and
for decades if not centuries it was also the top fishing nation.
But in 1989 its fish catch was surpassed by China, and since then
by Peru and Chile as well.
</P>
<P>
   So while Japan is one of the few places in the world where it is
possible to have a rapturous conversation about the taste of
pufferfish, or fugu, this is no longer a nation with many
fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   Most Japanese sushi today comes from foreign nets, and Japan's
catch has dropped in half since 1985, with the number of fishermen
dropping almost as rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is likely to quicken, for nearly half of Japan's
290,000 remaining fishermen are in their 60s or 70s. Many families
have been in the business for countless generations, but now for
the first time there is no one to take over the boats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little sad that fishing will end in my generation,''
Yamashita said as he piloted his boat back to the dock at Oshima.
``But I think my eldest son will have a better life if he gets out
of fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not the only country facing problems with its fishing
fleet. The United States and other fishery nations have also faced
difficulties, partly because of overfishing, and after quadrupling
between 1950 and 1988, the world's ocean fisheries production has
leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen in Japan face special challenges because they were
used to exceptionally high prices, but fish imports have increased
nearly 10-fold since 1970 and have brought Japanese prices down to
international levels. Moreover, Japan's distribution system is so
unwieldy and expensive that it costs more to transport fish to the
markets in Tokyo from here in southern Japan than from China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see what's ahead for fishing, and as a parent I've no
regret that my sons aren't doing this,'' said Takemitsu Takashima,
a leather-skinned 58-year-old man who has been a fisherman since he
was 16. ``The catch is so small that it's just as well that it ends
with my generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Takashima was drinking beer over dinner _ rather too much beer,
it seemed _ with another old fishing buddy, Yoshinobu Yamashita,
70. The more the alcohol flowed, the more enthusiastically they
reminisced about the old days of fishing in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I began as a fisherman, we didn't have motorboats,''
Yamashita recalled. ``We just rowed our boats out onto the ocean
and then used a sail.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be dangerous,'' he added. ``So many of my classmates
died fishing out there in the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   These fishing villages along Japan's endless coast are full of
the lore of ancient glory and catastrophe. People here in Oshima
still talk about the nearby island that in one day lost all of its
men, when a storm capsized their boats as they were fishing
together.
</P>
<P>
   Whaling in Japan has mostly ended, but the old-timers still talk
about how the villagers would surround a whale and harpoon it and
feed the island for a year _ or, even more thrilling, would first
capture it in a net before killing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people now can't imagine what it was like,'' Yamashita
said, reaching again for his glass. ``Even for me, it feels as if
it was a different world.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 205,000 Japanese households _ one-half of 1 percent of the
total _ are now engaged in fishing, and even they get most of their
income from other sources. Some run sports fishing charter boats or
even operate sightseeing boats for whale-watchers from the cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just fewer and fewer fish out there,'' said Tanisaku
Makiyama, a 44-year-old fisherman. ``Many of the young fishermen
are still single, unable to find a wife, because their incomes are
so low.''
</P>
<P>
   Makiyama looked out at the ocean and sighed. ``I think the
fishing era is over for Japan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The one part of the fishing industry that is doing reasonably
well is fish-farming, of everything from shrimp to yellowtail,
although even there the competition is tough.
</P>
<P>
   Japan also has the remnant of a deep-sea fishing fleet, but its
deep-sea catch is just one-quarter of what it was in 1970. Even on
Japanese deep-sea boats, the crews these days are often
non-Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, I went fishing as far as Alaska and
Indonesia, and we did pretty well for ourselves,'' said Iwao
Yamashita, a 51-year-old fisherman. (Oshima is thick with
Yamashitas, all members of an extended clan.) ``But then the
captains realized that they could save money by hiring
Indonesians.''
</P>
<P>
   His son, Daiki, a 14-year-old junior high school student, was
nibbling on squid sashimi and listening to his father. So what does
he plan to do in life? ``I don't know what I want to be,'' he
answered. ``But I don't want to be a fisherman.''

FIRST LADY DIFFERS FROM WHITE HOUSE ON ISSUE OF JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton signaled
an independent course in her bid for the U.S. Senate Thursday,
going beyond White House policy on Israel and vowing more ambitious
steps to fix the nation's ailing health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton met with health care specialists here and, later,
with senior citizens in Utica, N.Y., on the second day of her
on-the-ground exploration of a campaign to succeed retiring Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In a high profile break with her husband's policies, the first
lady deviated from administration pronouncements and said she
considers Jerusalem ``the eternal and indivisible capital of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, who have resisted congressional
pressure to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, have
never publicly adopted Israel's contention that Jerusalem is the
``eternal and indivisible'' capital of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The president contends that the status of Jerusalem should be
decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians that
also would settle disputes over borders, refugees and Jewish
settlements on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign released her July 2 letter to Mandell L.
Ganchrow, head of the Orthodox Union that represents about 750
orthodox Jewish synagogues across the United States. In the letter,
she vowed to ``be an active, committed advocate for a strong and
secure Israel able to live in peace with its neighbors, with the
United States Embassy located in its capital, Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Creation of a Palestinian homeland _ endorsed by Mrs. Clinton
last year _ remains an ``issue that should be decided as part of
the final status negotiations by the parties,'' said Howard
Wolfson, Clinton's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 1.6 million _ 9.1 percent of the state's
total _ Jews are a key ingredient to political victory in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton played to her expertise on health care policies by
meeting with New Yorkers invited to Bassett Healthcare, a regional
network of physicians, clinics and a 180-bed hospital that serves
an eight-county rural area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may recall that I've had some thoughts about health care
and health care reform in the past,'' Mrs. Clinton wryly told an
audience of more than 50 health care specialists. She added: ``But
I now come from the school of smaller steps,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady led the Clinton administration's development of a
comprehensive blueprint to overhaul the nation's public and private
health care system in 1993. But her plan was so controversial that
neither the House or Senate _ then controlled by Democrats _
brought it up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The setback contributed to the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994
for the first time in 40 years _ creating a politically divided
government that has stymied many other administration initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to John Clow, a university professor, describe
his battle with insurance companies to cover eight years of cancer
treatments for his late wife, Clinton said that greater government
action is needed to free patients and doctors from having to fight
for insurance reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton criticized legislation sought by the White House to
strengthen the hand of patients and physicians in their dealings
with health maintenance organizations and private insurance firms.
The proposal is ``a diversion,'' Clinton said, because it will
leave ``more people arguing over what should be done for patients''
rather than freeing physicians to care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate vote on the measure is scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she favored the measure because ``there is no
alternative,'' but added: ``It is not the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for more aggressive efforts to drive down
the market price of drugs. The issue is greater than the remedies
offered by a White House proposal to provide first-ever, voluntary
prescription drug coverage to the nation's 40 million Medicare
beneficiaries, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers must be required to publicly disclose the
actual costs of research and development for new drugs rather than
being allowed to pass on the costs without scrutiny, she declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really find out how much a drug actually costs to
develop _ you have to take the word of the drug manufacturers,''
she said, adding: ``It is something that we're going to have
address.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's positions on health care drew mixed reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Struck, president of Bassett Healthcare, said health
care specialists welcome Mrs. Clinton's commitment to debating
changes in the health care system, even if they don't agree with
the specifics of her proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any resentment anywhere about her
willingness to focus attention on health care,'' Struck said. ``But
the direction that she takes is not always one that everyone agrees
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Sellers, assistant director for medicine and
pediatrics at the complex, said he was leery of Clinton's heavy
emphasis on health care reform rather than concrete steps to
revitalize the economy of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded that if upstate New York were viewed as a
separate state, it would rank 49th in job creation and economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in upstate New York is very concerned about
the upstate economy and would really like to hear from all the
Senate candidates what they could do to help the economy,'' Sellers
said.

FIRST LADY DIFFERS FROM WHITE HOUSE ON ISSUE OF JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton signaled
an independent course in her bid for the U.S. Senate Thursday,
going beyond White House policy on Israel and vowing more ambitious
steps to fix the nation's ailing health care system.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton met with health care specialists here and, later,
with senior citizens in Utica, N.Y., on the second day of her
on-the-ground exploration of a campaign to succeed retiring Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In a high profile break with her husband's policies, the first
lady deviated from administration pronouncements and said she
considers Jerusalem ``the eternal and indivisible capital of
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, who have resisted congressional
pressure to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, have
never publicly adopted Israel's contention that Jerusalem is the
``eternal and indivisible'' capital of the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   The president contends that the status of Jerusalem should be
decided in negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians that
also would settle disputes over borders, refugees and Jewish
settlements on the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign released her July 2 letter to Mandell L.
Ganchrow, head of the Orthodox Union that represents about 750
orthodox Jewish synagogues across the United States. In the letter,
she vowed to ``be an active, committed advocate for a strong and
secure Israel able to live in peace with its neighbors, with the
United States Embassy located in its capital, Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   Creation of a Palestinian homeland _ endorsed by Mrs. Clinton
last year _ remains an ``issue that should be decided as part of
the final status negotiations by the parties,'' said Howard
Wolfson, Clinton's campaign spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 1.6 million _ 9.1 percent of the state's
total _ Jews are a key ingredient to political victory in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton played to her expertise on health care policies by
meeting with New Yorkers invited to Bassett Healthcare, a regional
network of physicians, clinics and a 180-bed hospital that serves
an eight-county rural area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may recall that I've had some thoughts about health care
and health care reform in the past,'' Mrs. Clinton wryly told an
audience of more than 50 health care specialists. She added: ``But
I now come from the school of smaller steps,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady led the Clinton administration's development of a
comprehensive blueprint to overhaul the nation's public and private
health care system in 1993. But her plan was so controversial that
neither the House or Senate _ then controlled by Democrats _
brought it up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The setback contributed to the GOP takeover of Congress in 1994
for the first time in 40 years _ creating a politically divided
government that has stymied many other administration initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to John Clow, a university professor, describe
his battle with insurance companies to cover eight years of cancer
treatments for his late wife, Clinton said that greater government
action is needed to free patients and doctors from having to fight
for insurance reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton criticized legislation sought by the White House to
strengthen the hand of patients and physicians in their dealings
with health maintenance organizations and private insurance firms.
The proposal is ``a diversion,'' Clinton said, because it will
leave ``more people arguing over what should be done for patients''
rather than freeing physicians to care for patients.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate vote on the measure is scheduled for next week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said she favored the measure because ``there is no
alternative,'' but added: ``It is not the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for more aggressive efforts to drive down
the market price of drugs. The issue is greater than the remedies
offered by a White House proposal to provide first-ever, voluntary
prescription drug coverage to the nation's 40 million Medicare
beneficiaries, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug manufacturers must be required to publicly disclose the
actual costs of research and development for new drugs rather than
being allowed to pass on the costs without scrutiny, she declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really find out how much a drug actually costs to
develop _ you have to take the word of the drug manufacturers,''
she said, adding: ``It is something that we're going to have
address.''

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's positions on health care drew mixed reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Struck, president of Bassett Healthcare, said health
care specialists welcome Mrs. Clinton's commitment to debating
changes in the health care system, even if they don't agree with
the specifics of her proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any resentment anywhere about her
willingness to focus attention on health care,'' Struck said. ``But
the direction that she takes is not always one that everyone agrees
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Sellers, assistant director for medicine and
pediatrics at the complex, said he was leery of Clinton's heavy
emphasis on health care reform rather than concrete steps to
revitalize the economy of upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton conceded that if upstate New York were viewed as a
separate state, it would rank 49th in job creation and economic
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody in upstate New York is very concerned about
the upstate economy and would really like to hear from all the
Senate candidates what they could do to help the economy,'' Sellers
said.

REGULATORS CITE VIOLATIONS AT DAY TRADER, SEEK SHUTDOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Texas)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Massachusetts regulators moved to shut down the Boston
office of Houston-based Landmark Securities Corp. Thursday, saying
the firm engaged in some of the most ``egregious'' practices yet
found in the state's campaign against day-trading companies.
</P>
<P>
   In an administrative complaint, the Massachusetts Securities
Division alleged ``numerous violations'' of state securities laws,
including a falsified customer account form, forged customers
signatures and improper loans to Landmark customers that carried
``usurious rates of interest.'' Landmark denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen some of these things before, but it's not been as
brazen as it has been in this case,'' said Secretary of State
William F. Galvin, whose office has taken action against six
day-trading firms in the state since last fall. ``What we're
alleging here is very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Day trading, which gets its name from the practice of holding
stocks for less than a day, has become big business across the
country. Firms like Landmark have sprung up to cater to a growing
number of amateur investors who trade huge blocks of stock in
transactions that often last only seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated traders work in boutiques like Landmark eight hours a
day, five days a week, often performing hundreds of trades a day in
pursuit of profits on miniscule movements in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But regulators, particularly in Massachusetts, have taken a dim
view of the practice, saying it's little better than gambling.
Spurred in part by alarms sounded by Massachusetts regulators, the
federal Securities and Exchange Commission, the National
Association of Securities Dealers and key members of Congress have
warned that day-trading is extremely risky.
</P>
<P>
   Many inexperienced traders hoping to tap a vein of stock-market
riches have instead found themselves buried in debt after months of
nonstop trading. Meanwhile, day-trading firms collect large
commissions on stock transactions whether traders make money or
lose it, regulators say. According to estimates by a consortium of
state agencies, just two in 10 professional day traders make money,
and only a small number of those make large returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a practice that is not for most people, and for all
those reasons we have to make sure the laws are strictly adhered
to,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's complaint, the securities division said Landmark's
Boston office manager, Scott Kurland, approved accounts for
customers who didn't have enough experience or money to be day
trading. In one case, Kurland approved a day-trading account for a
customer with an anual income of just $15,000 and no investing
experience, the complaint alleges.
</P>
<P>
   On a new account form, Kurland misrepresented the customer's
income and net worth ``to create the false impression that day
trading might be suitable'' for the customer, the complaint
alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Through Kurland, the complaint states, Landmark ``routinely
promoted and arranged loans between customers'' so that customers
who ran out of money could continue trading, ``thus generating more
commissions.'' the complaint alleges.
</P>
<P>
   To move money from one customer's account to another, Kurland
forged customers' signatures on transfer authorization forms, used
forms that had been forged by others and used photocopied
signatures he kept on file, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint also states that Kurland participated in an
improper lending scheme in which a Landmark subsidiary borrowed
money from one customer then lent it out to other customers. A
portion of any profits made by the borrowers went to Kurland and
other owners of the Landmark subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Kurland, 24, didn't return phone calls Thursday. But his
attorney, Michael Unger of the Boston firm Rubin and Rudman, said
Landmark's office manager is a victim of overzealous regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another case being pursued by the securities division,
which has decided it is going to go after day-trading firms,''
Unger said. ``My client has a blemish-free record. He's never had
any problems. He's never had a single complaint from a customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts led the nation with the first regulatory action
against a day trading firm last October, shutting down Block
Trading in Boston. The securities division alleged that just one of
a total 68 day traders at Block Trading made money. Block has
denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   Kurland worked for Block Trading at the time regulators closed
it, securities division officials said. He was questioned but not
cited with any wrongdoing in that case.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the securities division has taken action against
local offices of five other national firms _ Bright Trading Inc.
for failing to register with the state, All-Tech Investment Group
for abuses ranging from deceptive marketing to forging customers'
signatures, On-Line Investment Services for deceptive marketing and
churning accounts, and TCI Corp. for making ``outrageous'' claims
of guaranteed income.

ANGER AT GOVERNMENT GROWS AMONG YUGOSLAV ARMY RESERVISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also KOSOVO-RALLIES) 
(mk) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LESKOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Beneath a sign for the Swing Jeans Shop,
a dozen or so Serb policemen in powder blue uniforms stood around
Thursday night, glaring at locals who dared to gather here for the
fourth night running to demand the resignation of President
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   All around the police in the town square, there were hundreds of
Yugoslav army reservists, some in soiled camouflage uniforms and
many drinking beer.
</P>
<P>
   They were home from the lost war in Kosovo, unpaid, jobless and
angry enough about it all to tangle this week with Milosevic's men,
who call all the shots in Leskovac, a city in a part of Serbia
known as the ``Red South.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, about 20,000 people, most of them reservists and
their families, filled this square and astonished much of
Yugoslavia by staging the largest demonstration since the end of
the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, about 2,000 of them rushed the police station and
vandalized the house of a local boss from Milosevic's governing
Socialist Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a drunken military policeman shot a cafe owner in
the town square. And on Thursday night a thousand or so people,
many of them reservists, milled around, shooting dirty looks at
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fear has disappeared,'' said Vlada Djordjevic, 31, an
infantry conscript who served for 65 days in Kosovo, while
listening every night with his friends from Leskovac to American,
British and German short-wave radio broadcasts about the war. ``We
were in the field and we could see that Serb radio was telling us
lies about the war. We believed BBC. And now we are not afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   In what appears to be a growing popular movement to force the
Yugoslav leader from power, the wild card may well prove to be the
Yugoslav army and its reservists. In previous bouts of
demonstrations against Milosevic, the army has either come out in
favor of Milosevic or sat on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But the sudden anti-government activism of reservists in this
most unlikely of cities suggests that the army could prove to be a
muscular ally, if the fractious opposition movement can figure out
how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   The reservists' anger is not confined to this city. Demanding
unpaid wages from the Kosovo war, they have sporadically tied up
roads and blocked bridges across much of central and southern
Serbia in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The principal object of the reservists' frustration here in
Leskovac is Zivojin Stefanovic, the local chairman of the Socialist
Party who runs this down-at-the-heels textile town of 170,000.
Stefanovic declined Thursday to return repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   It was his house that reservists smashed up on Tuesday night,
and it was his resignation that remains a non-negotiable demand of
their demonstrations, which are scheduled to go on until he quits
or is fired.
</P>
<P>
   The reservists are also demanding the release from jail of Ivan
Novkovic, a TV Leskovac technician turned local hero. Stunning
local TV viewers, he sneaked his own videotape on the air last
week. It called for the people of Leskovac to gather in the square
on Monday and demand the ouster of Stefanovic. After a huge crowd
did exactly that, throwing in the demand that Milosevic resign, the
TV technician was arrested and sentenced to 30 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   What infuriated reservists about the local party boss was his
mobilizing zeal for the war in Kosovo. Apparently trying to curry
favor in Belgrade, the Yugoslav capital, Stefanovic organized the
call-up of about 40,000 local men, according to opposition party
leaders and human rights activists.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter joke here is that as a result of Stefanovic's
mobilizing passion, there were just two combatants in the Kosovo
war: NATO versus Leskovac.
</P>
<P>
   When reservists came home from the 11-week conflict in early
June, they learned that the government had not provided their
families with food and household supplies, as the army had
promised.
</P>
<P>
   Nor have they been paid the $50 a month they were promised when
they went off to war. So far they have received about a third of
that amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not the kind of guy who makes trouble, but we need those
wages for electricity bills, for school books for our kids, for
firewood,'' said Bratislav Stamenkovic, 37, a reservist who laid
mines along the Kosovo-Macedonian border during the war.
</P>
<P>
   The reservists said they had also learned that there were going
to be no jobs for veterans and that the local economy was in even
deeper trouble than before they went off to Kosovo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The one thing that they have not been told by local officials is
how many soldiers from Leskovac were killed in the war. The local
Serbian Orthodox Church has an unofficial list of 70 names.
Reservists say they will demonstrate on the streets of this town
until they get an official number from the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``In ten years, all we have is war,'' said Pasan Cosic, 55, who
was slightly drunk and very bitter in the town square Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has started and lost wars in the former Yugoslav
republics of Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia, as well as in the Serb
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Cosic said he had been conscripted by the Milosevic government
to fight in Croatia, where he lost a son and was wounded in the
knee. Equipped with a plastic knee, he said he was later
conscripted to fight in Bosnia and then in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have war, and I am getting poorer,'' repeated Cosic, a
taxi driver who spoke to the crowd Thursday night from an open
microphone that was made available to anybody who had a complaint
against the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have bread, cigarettes, sugar or cooking oil,'' he
said. ``I am asking Milosevic, `How long can you keep this up?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the reservists who gathered here Thursday night said
they were well aware of the atrocities and theft committed by some
Serb fighters in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   They said they personally had not committed crimes against
civilians, a claim that, in general, has been supported by Kosovo
Albanians, who in hundreds of interviews have said that nearly all
the killings of civilians were committed by Serb paramilitary
forces and not by regular army troops.
</P>
<P>
   But the reservists said that everywhere in Kosovo they were
surrounded by Serb men in uniform carrying stolen televisions,
satellite dishes and other electronic equipment. The scene was so
familiar that it generated one of the best jokes of the war, said
Djordjevic, the reservist who spent much of his war listening to
the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Rambo volunteers to fight for the Serbs,'' Djordjevic said.
``In a few days Rambo is back in the states and drunk. Asked why he
quit the war, Rambo answered, `I couldn't carry a gun and a
television set at the same time.'''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing very funny, though, about the Kosovo war,
Djordjevic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, what I care about is finding out who died from
Leskovac,'' he said. ``I don't give a damn about Kosovo.''

SERBS SAY THEY'RE THE VICTIMS NOW, AS NATO STANDS BY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVO POLJE, Yugoslavia _ Almost four months after NATO's bombs
began falling, the tables have turned in Kosovo _ and now it is
Serbs who complain they are being ``ethnically cleansed'' right
under the eyes of international protectors.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs, once the privileged class in Kosovo, are fleeing in fear
_ and, in many cases, being forcibly expelled through threats,
intimidation or arson of their homes _ a tragic mirror image of the
campaign that Serbs mounted against ethnic Albanians over the past
months.
</P>
<P>
   A Serb monitoring organization reports that it receives daily
complaints of Serbs being killed, or their houses being burned.
More commonly, Serbs are being harassed or threatened _ often with
violence _ to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Postwar Kosovo is not a hospitable place for the Obradovic
family and other ethnic Serbs, whose lives and futures were
suddenly upended when the war ended last month.
</P>
<P>
   They sit huddled in fear, afraid to speak their own language,
nervous about walking the streets. They fear for a cousin who
disappeared weeks ago; they think she was kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a fear among us. KFOR (NATO's Kosovo Force
peacekeepers) is supposed to protect us, but they don't,'' said
Gavrilo Obradovic, who believes his cousin was abducted by the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Serbian people, it's dangerous to walk in the street,''
said Dragan Kristic of the Center for Peace and Tolerance, a
Serb-government funded organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is intimidation going on. There are many reports of
harassment, intimidation, looting, burning, abduction and
killings,'' agreed Ron Redmond, a spokesman for the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, which has been coordinating relief
efforts on behalf of refugees from the Kosovo fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The armed international peacekeepers charged with maintaining
order here appear as helpless to protect the Serbs from such crimes
as unarmed international monitors were a year ago, when Albanians
were the victims.
</P>
<P>
   KFOR doesn't even keep close track of incidents reported to them
regarding attacks on Serbs _ even murders, said spokesman Lt.
Commander Louis Garneau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't keep statistics on civilian deaths,'' Garneau said.
``We keep statistics on the ones we have shot,'' which amounts to
six fatalities and four injured people, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prevention means you have to protect every person here,'' said
Maj. Jan Joosten, another KFOR spokesman. ``That is an
impossibility here. It happens nowhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, no one has more than sketchy statistics on attacks and
crimes against Serbs; peackeeping contingents do not typically
break down crimes along ethnic lines. But spokesmen said that since
Serb forces pulled out of Kosovo under the settlement that ended
the bombing, the incidents have been overwhelmingly against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The Serb-run Center, Kristic said, receives, on average,
complaints of five kidnappings, 10-20 forced evictions, and scores
of reports of harassment daily. Reports of murders are less
frequent.
</P>
<P>
   International refugee agency officials say they are deeply
concerned about the voluntary and forced departure of Serbs, but
they can do little about it except urge Serbs to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed and, officials say, desperately underfunded for
coping with the burden of 650,000 Albanian refugees returning to
burned-out homes and barren fields, the UN refugee agency has not
focused on the Serb exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to see one group of refugees coming back, and
another group of refugees leaving,'' said Sadako Ogata, who heads
the UN agency operation here.
</P>
<P>
   But according to government reports in Belgrade and local
evidence in Kosovo, that's exactly what is happening. Serbs say
more than 100,000 Serb civilians _ more than half the Kosovar Serb
population _ have left Kosovo, a count not disputed by UN refugee
officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still very concerned about people leaving. But in many
cases, we understand why they are leaving,'' Redmond said.
``Unfortunately, a lot of people are coming back bent on
vengeance.''
</P>
<P>
   The international community has a political predicament as well.
The KLA and its sympathizers want an independent Kosovo, which the
West has repeatedly insisted it does not support. And the goal of
preserving the territorial integrity of Yugoslavia _ which includes
the Serbian province of Kosovo _ depends on having a multi-ethnic,
non-partitioned state.
</P>
<P>
   Without any ethnic Serbs, the ``multi-ethnic'' status of the
province would be a fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But all of the West's pronouncements of concern do not persuade
two groups of people who just endured a brutal war against each
other that they should live together in harmony.
</P>
<P>
   In one apartment building in the provincial capital of Pristina,
a newly posted sign tells Serb families they must leave.
</P>
<P>
   In one day this week alone, 15 houses were set afire in Prizren,
four in Pristina and five in Stimlje, peacekeeping troops reported.
In the case of Prizren, ``it was a disappointing experience that
the population for the most part was unwilling to help KFOR in its
efforts to extinguish the fires,'' the peace-keepers said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot do anything'' about the burning houses, because ``by
the time we get there, it is too late,'' said Vincente Dalmau,
spokesman for the KFOR base at Pec.
</P>
<P>
   The environment for Serbs is particularly hostile in western
Kosovo, where the worst reported atrocities against ethnic
Albanians occurred. In Pec, the few Serbs left are heard speaking
Albanian in the streets. They are the brave ones; no Serb,
residents here say, is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they try to come back, they will only find murder here,''
said Mantor Kasapolli, 23, an Albanian. ``There would be every day,
5-10 dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a problem for Serbs who come back,'' added
Jeton Bala, 22, in starkly similar terms. ``If they want to come
back, they know they are all dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Kosovo is virtually the same as it was a year ago,
except that the players have changed places. It is now young KLA
members who strut confidently along the streets, while Serbs stay
indoors, at home with their families.
</P>
<P>
   Cafes and restaurants once run and patronized by Serbs are now
populated with laughing, gleeful Albanians _ the Albanian flag is
displayed, letting all know that the establishment has been
commandeered by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs _ who nine years ago benefitted when Albanians were fired
en masse from their jobs when President Slobodan Milosevic revoked
the largely autonomous status of the province _ worry that there
will be no work for them in an Albanian-dominated province.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian students are excited about going to public schools and
colleges, learning in their own language. Serbian students wonder
if there will be places for them in the post-war university, and
whether their former Serb professors will return to teach.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers at the Serb Center for Peace and Tolerance work with
armed KFOR guards protecting them, gathering evidence of crimes
against their people and complaining that no one is listening _
just as Albanians did for nearly a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Even the everyday act of taking a cab is a loaded proposition
here: Serbs say they are afraid to get into an Albanian taxi.
</P>
<P>
   Health care is also political, as it was under Serb
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian doctors who were fired from their jobs in 1990 have
come back in triumph, and Serb doctors have elected not to return
to work, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't tell them to go. We told them to do the work they
were doing,'' but the Serbs left anyway, said Dr. Gazmend Kaqaniku,
an ethnic Albanian opthamologist. ``They didn't say why.''
</P>
<P>
   The Albanian doctors say they wish their Serb colleagues would
return, and add that they will treat any patient, regardless of
ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   The patients are less egalitarian: some of the war-wounded who
were treated _ mistreated, they say _ by Serb doctors during the
war are now being treated by fellow Albanians, a change they say is
dramatically better.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serb doctors cut off my leg; they didn't even try to save
it,'' said Shajip Loshaj, 24, injured as he was fleeing Kosovo in
April. ``Then they beat me in my bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now? I feel like I'm in my own home,'' Loshaj said. ``We were
all waiting for this day.''

NEW LUNG SCAN CATCHES CANCER EARLY AND SAVE LIVES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas, Fla., Britain, Montreal)   (jw) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Death rates from lung cancer could be greatly reduced if smokers
and former smokers were routinely given CT scans of their lungs,
doctors are reporting Friday. The scans use a new technique that is
far more sensitive than conventional chest X-rays and can detect
tumors when they are small enough to be cured.
</P>
<P>
   Now, routine chest X-rays and other screening tests for lung
cancer are not recommended, even for smokers, because the tests
cannot identify tumors early enough to save or even prolong
patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying that we could change survival from 12 or 15
percent to 80 percent,'' said Dr. Claudia Henschke, division chief
of chest imaging at Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan and the
primary author of a study being published in the British journal
Lancet. ``There are 172,000 new cases a year. Think of 12 percent
or 15 percent survival, compared to 80 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The screening techniques studied in the research are already
available, but only at a few medical centers. The researchers said
they had already been approached by smokers and former smokers,
including some of their hospital colleagues, seeking the screening
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important study that has major clinical
implications in the near future,'' said Dr. John Minna, a lung
cancer specialist and the director of the Hamon Center for
Therapeutic Oncology Research at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. ``It dramatically shows the
time has come to reopen lung cancer screening trials in current and
former smokers using the new CT technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Minna, who was not involved in the study, also praised the
authors for including women, who made up 46 percent of the study
subjects. ``Women had been excluded from all previous screening
studies,'' he said. ``This is vital, since 1.6 times more women die
of lung cancer than breast cancer each year in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United
States, killing 160,000 people a year, more than the combined total
of the next three causes, cancers of the colon, breast and
prostate.
</P>
<P>
   Survival rates for lung cancer patients have been dismal because
the disease typically is detected after it has begun to spread. It
causes no symptoms in its early stages, and even tumors picked up
by chest X-rays are generally so advanced that treatment cannot
cure them or even do much to prolong the patient's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 85 percent now are discovered at a late stage,'' Dr.
Henschke said.
</P>
<P>
   Her study, conducted with researchers from New York University
and McGill University in Montreal, included 1,000 people who were
smokers or former smokers, aged 60 or older. None had symptoms of
any illness, though all had smoked cigarettes for at least 10
pack-years, meaning a pack a day for 10 years, or two packs a day
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were given both chest X-rays and CT scans,
using a new technique called helical low-dose CT scanning that
takes only 20 seconds. The CT scans clearly picked up tumors that
the chest X-rays missed: the scans identified 27, and the X-rays
only 7. Of the 27 identified by scans, 23 were stage I, meaning
early tumors that had not spread. But the X-rays identified only
four stage I cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henschke said that not all the tumors were removed
immediately. Some small ones were watched for a few months, and
their growth rates were studied. If the tumors grew, they were
removed. ``These are clearly cancers that would have killed the
patients in two to three years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The patients with stage I disease all had surgery to remove the
tumors and needed no chemotherapy or radiation or any other further
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the stage I patients are alive and well, with no evidence
of recurrence,'' Dr. Henschke said. All four patients with later
stage disease are dead, she added.
</P>

   ``What's really exciting is that when you catch lung cancer
early, in stage I, it's very simple elective surgery,'' she said.
``By doing this test you're saving money. If you screened all the
high-risk people in one year, you'd save $1.5 billion, and that
would more than cover the cost of screening. And you'd be saving a
tremendous number of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen if insurance companies and health
maintenance organizations will pay for the screening.
``Policy-makers and third-party payers will have to be convinced
the technology is effective and cost-effective,'' said Dr. Robert
Smith, director of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Also, researchers said that the scanning technique should be
studied further before it is put into widespread use. One
shortcoming of Dr. Henschke's study, they said, was that it did not
include a control group of patients who did not receive CT scans.
Smith said, ``We need to make it a top research priority.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that demand for it might grow so quickly that
patients would refuse to participate in studies, for fear of being
assigned to a comparison group that did not get scans. ``We'll lose
the ability to evaluate it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henschke said that not all medical centers could perform the
new test yet. In New York, it is available only at Cornell and New
York University. The Mayo Clinic and Moffett Medical Center in
Florida also perform it. But Dr. Henschke said that the other
centers might charge more than Cornell, where it costs $300.
</P>
<P>
   Two study participants who live in Manhattan said they thought
the test had probably saved their lives. George Feinberg, who is
64, said he had smoked heavily for about 17 years but had not had a
cigarette in about 30 years when he signed up for the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought they'd find anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the scan revealed a small tumor, and Feinberg had half of
his right lung removed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cancer wasn't going to go away,'' he said. ``It was only
going to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Botter, also 64, had smoked for about 50 years when she
entered the study. Like Feinberg, she was astounded, and
frightened, to learn that she had a cancerous tumor. She had
surgery about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tumor was so tiny that they said I wouldn't need any more
treatment, and that made me feel very good,'' she said, adding that
she wonders why the scanning is not offered routinely.

<P>
   (UNDATED) Back off, Jar Jar.
</P>
<P>
   Inspector Gadget is coming to town.
</P>
<P>
   Just not all at once.
</P>
<P>
   This year's version of the modern-day seasonal affliction _
summer blockbuster marketing mania _ started with Star Wars' ``The
Phantom Menace,'' but that was just the beginning. The latest
technofest begins next weekend under the Golden Arches.
</P>
<P>
   Get ready to visit early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Like eight times over the next month, collecting eight separate
pieces to assemble into one 15-inch Inspector Gadget.
</P>
<P>
   One toy, eight Happy Meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget,'' in case you've been in a coma and missed
the ubiquitous movie trailers, is a special-effects blowout
starring Matthew Broderick as a bumbling security guard who, thanks
to robotics and the obligatory gorgeous scientist/love interest,
becomes a virtual crime-fighting machine, via various grafted-on
gizmos.
</P>
<P>
   Think Maxwell Smart on steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspector Gadget'' opens July 23. The McDonald's promotion
begins a week earlier and runs through Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the eight pieces functions separately: the siren hat,
which produces a mechanical siren noise when the propeller is
rotated; the lever-activated hand; the arm that squirts water; the
leg with an enclosed pair of pliers ...
</P>
<P>
   The Gadget Man is one handy dude.
</P>
<P>
   No batteries needed, but some assembly required.
</P>
<P>
   Two pieces will be available each week, according to Kevin
Bradbury, a McDonald's spokesman. You'll be able to request which
piece you want, one per Happy Meal, to ensure you get both pieces
available that week. (And yes, you can buy two Happy Meals and get
two different toy parts on one visit.)
</P>
<P>
   The following week, those pieces will be retired and two new
pieces will be available. Bradbury said he didn't know how many
toys were being produced for inclusion in the $1.99 Happy Meals,
but restaurants order enough for the markets, based on what they
believe they need.
</P>
<P>
   He's not predicting a run of Teeny Weeny Beanie Baby
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the multipiece marketing ploy isn't blackmail _
parents are free to buy their kids only part of Inspector Gadget.
</P>
<P>
   Just try explaining that one.

 &HT;    Michelin may choose S. Carolina
 &HT;    By Matt Kempner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An offer of tax incentives and a spot in a new
industrial park may not be enough for a northeast Georgia community
to beat out South Carolina for a new $400-million Michelin tire
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson County in South Carolina appears to be ahead of
neighboring Stephens County in Georgia in the rivalry for the plant
and up to 350 jobs, according to a story in Thursday's Anderson
Independent-Mail.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted unnamed sources as saying pivotal
advantages for Anderson County include additional tax incentives
recently approved by South Carolina legislators, as well as a
workforce that the company prefers. Michelin's North American
headquarters is in Greenville, S.C., and it has more than 9,000
workers and eight plants in that state. It has no manufacturing
operations in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Anderson County Council gave preliminary approval Tuesday to
issuing up to $400 million in industrial revenue bonds for a plant,
which county officials call ``Beta Company.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, company spokesman Jim Morton said that it is ``pure
speculation'' that the company will build a new plant or that it
has a site in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens County Development Authority executive director Lonnie
Edenfield Jr. said, ``It's our standard procedure not to comment on
an active working project.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephens is mostly rural, sitting along Lake Hartwell and
Georgia's border with South Carolina just north of I-85. The county
has 28,000 residents and no zoning to regulate development.
</P>
<P>
   Local officials have pushed to recruit new employers: A year ago
the development authority bought 243 acres for a new industrial
park and took out options on land to increase it to more than 800
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, no new major employers have located in the county
in the past three years, according to Edenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Many rural Georgia communities have complained they are losing
too many jobs prospects to other Southeastern states. They point
out that Georgia tax incentives offered to employers are often far
less lucrative than those provided by nearby states such as Alabama
and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Department of Industry, Trade &AMP; Tourism proposed
beefing up the state's incentive package, but earlier this year
Gov. Roy Barnes put the effort on hold. He said he wanted a more
comprehensive review of the value and the costs of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, local officials say prospective employers are
slipping away. ``The playing field is not equal on the state
level,'' Edenfield said. ``Local communities are not able to make
up the difference.''

<P>
   TOULOUSE, France _ In the giant hangers here where Airbus
Industrie's single-aisle jetliners are assembled, only a handful of
workers can be found, testing systems, attaching the landing gear
or drilling holes to fasten wings to the fuselages.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the busy _ and until recently, chaotic _ assembly
line in Renton, Wash., near Seattle, where Boeing Co., the world's
biggest commercial jet producer, makes its narrow-body jets, the
atmosphere is almost ghostlike. But don't be fooled.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus consortium, which is now Boeing's only competitor,
has never been busier since it was founded 30 years ago as a way to
revive the flagging European aerospace industry.
</P>
<P>
   The eerily quiet Airbus assembly line _ a reflection of
decentralized production and a surprisingly efficient operation _
is one of the many apparent contradictions about the consortium
that have altered expectations about its future prospects and
seriously vexed Boeing. Long derided in Seattle as a European jobs
program, Airbus now produces more revenue per employee than
Boeing's commercial airplane division. Supposedly burdened by an
unwieldy ownership structure that requires consensus between four
partners in four countries, Airbus has proved surprisingly nimble.
It boasts lower production costs than Boeing, though that is
difficult to determine because of the Airbus structure.
</P>
<P>
   These days the plucky irreverence of a perennial No. 2 has given
way to a subtle, but perceptible swagger. But for Airbus, as for
many an adolescent coming of age, the conceit is laced with
insecurity and fear.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, which is emerging from an embarrassing production
foul-up two years ago that cost it billions of dollars, is
committed to lowering its costs so that it can recement its
domination of the global market. At Airbus, the goal is to hang on
to the 50 percent market share it recently achieved. But the
consortium's effort to transform itself into a conventional
corporation _ a move both Airbus executives and industry analysts
see as crucial for competing with Boeing over the long run _ has
stalled, sowing doubts that it will ever happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our competitor is not the Boeing of today,'' Noel Forgeard,
the Airbus chief executive, said. ``It is the Boeing that will be,
that is to say probably a more streamlined, rejuvenated Boeing.
That is what we have to prepare ourselves for.''
</P>
<P>
   Byron Callan, an aerospace analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in New
York, agreed. ``There is a window of opportunity that the Airbus
partners have to keep one step ahead of Boeing,'' he said. ``It
would not be good for Airbus' standing if they squandered this
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Airbus now has models that compete with Boeing in every category
except the giant 747 and has recently snagged such previously
all-Boeing customers as British Airways.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus is owned by Aerospatiale Matra of France and
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace AG of Germany, which each hold 37.9
percent, British Aerospace PLC, which holds 20 percent, and
Construcciones Aeronauticas SA of Spain, which holds the remaining
4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Each partner acts as a subcontractor, supplying different parts
of each airplane: the nose section and cockpit, the center
fuselage, the wings and so on. Whereas Boeing has historically
hired and fired tens of thousands of workers as the demand for its
airplanes rose and fell, European labor laws make it prohibitively
expensive to lay off so many workers. Consequently, the Airbus
partners have relegated more work to suppliers and largely
automated their own manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   The result, contrary to all expectations, is a much more modern
and efficient production system than Boeing's. Large sections of
Airbus airplanes are flown to Toulouse and Hamburg from factories
around Europe by a fleet of giant modified Airbus cargo jets called
Belugas. There, the largely complete components are ``snapped''
together by small crews.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Airbus executives learned of Boeing's plans
to cut its production costs by 25 percent in a bid to underprice
Airbus and gain market share. Word went out to the Airbus partners
that they would need to streamline. While Boeing ultimately failed
to carry out its plan _ in fact, its costs ballooned _ the Airbus
partners succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   British Aerospace, which makes all the Airbus wings, cut
employment more than 44 percent to 6,000 from about 11,000 between
1992 and 1996 but still managed to produce its wings 50 percent
faster at the end of that time than it had at the beginning.
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace, or DASA, which makes fuselages, cut its
costs by about 40 percent in the last three years. The time between
when an airline ordered a single-aisle Airbus A320 and when it was
delivered has collapsed from 18 months four years ago to nine
months today.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent difficulties, Boeing refuses to concede half
the market to Airbus. ``In the foreseeable future, we will still be
producing twice as many airplanes as Airbus,'' Seddik Belyamani,
Boeing's executive vice president in charge of sales and marketing,
said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Forgeard, who took the helm at Airbus last year,
insisted that he was only interested in a 50 percent share because
any more would ``trigger a desperate reaction from Boeing.'' Airbus
would like to maintain its steady march toward building 350
airplanes each year, about half the forecast demand. That way it
can control its costs and maintain a stable level of employment.
</P>
<P>
   The market share wars do not help either manufacturer, Forgeard
said. ``What we are interested in is building profitability.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds like the much-heralded global duopoly many aerospace
analysts became excited about when Boeing bought the McDonnell
Douglas Corp. in 1997. European and American regulators are
investigating Airbus and Boeing for recent rises in their catalog
prices. Forgeard dismissed the notion that there was any collusion
with Boeing and insisted that strong competition would continue
even when the two have roughly equal market share.
</P>
<P>
   But for Airbus to keep pace with Boeing, it must become a bona
fide corporation with a single management in charge of expenses,
finance and customer support, analysts and Airbus executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Under its current structure, the four partners are responsible
for the cost and financing of their various operations. Airbus,
with a staff of just 3,000, is responsible only for design, sales
and marketing and flight testing. It does not even know how much
its airplanes cost to produce because the partners do not reveal
their costs.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard believes that putting all of Airbus under one roof
would bring huge advantages. Pooling the $10 billion worth of raw
materials now purchased annually by the partners would slash costs,
they say. In addition, a corporate Airbus would be able to use its
own assets to help finance sales of its jets instead of having to
rely on the assets of its partners. A single company would be able
to streamline decision-making in key areas like customer support.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But getting the four partners to consider giving up prize
operations has not been easy. In December, talks between the four
partners collapsed when they could not agree on how to value the
assets each contributes to Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Massey, the Airbus financial controller, said that it might
have been easier to transform the consortium five years ago, when
it was smaller. But now, with $15 billion in annual revenue, the
stakes have become too high. ``Ask someone to make a 1 percent
concession to the others and it is $150 million,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the negotiations has been a larger consolidation of
the European aerospace industry that has also involved all the
Airbus partners.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, British Aerospace was in talks to merge with
DASA when it angered the Germans by deciding to buy Britain's
GEC-Marconi instead. Then, last month, DASA announced that it was
merging with Construcciones Aeronautics, or CASA, reducing the four
Airbus partners to three. Also last month, shares of Aerospatiale
Matra, which was formed by the combination of the state-owned
Aerospatiale and Matra Hautes Technologies, another French company,
were floated on the Paris stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Callan of Merrill Lynch said he could no longer be sure that
Airbus would ever unify under a single corporate umbrella. He said
some bilateral agreements, perhaps merging the three remaining
partners into two, might occur instead.
</P>
<P>
   But Forgeard said he was encouraged by the recent deals, which
merged each of the two state-owned Airbus partners _ Aerospatiale
and CASA _ with more market-oriented companies. Aerospatiale, in
particular, has been the partner most resistant to the idea of a
single corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the dawn of a complete transformation of the
corporate culture of Aerospatiale,'' he said. ``That is reason to
be much more optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard should know. Before joining Airbus, he spent 12 years
as an executive at the Lagardere Group, which owned Matra Hautes
Technologies, and is now, after the French government, Aerospatiale
Matra's second-largest shareholder. A graduate of the elite Ecole
Polytechnique, Forgeard, 54, has swung between government service
and private business over the course of his career. He is part of a
new wave of French executives who are committed to increasing
shareholder value.
</P>
<P>
   One of Forgeard's toughest decisions will be whether to commit
Airbus to spend more than $10 billion to develop a new
550-passenger super jumbo jet called the A3XX. Boeing has concluded
that demand for such a jet is too limited to justify the investment
but Airbus is continuing its development work and hopes to decide
next year whether to begin building the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Forgeard said he would not proceed with the A3XX unless he was
persuaded that the project will deliver a 20 percent return on
capital. Nevertheless, he sees the plane as critical to future
competition with Boeing because a quarter of the dollars spent on
new airplanes over the next 20 years will be for jets the size of
the 747 or larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must take a proactive position,'' he said. ``I cannot let
Boeing say there is no demand.''

   NEW YORK _ Oprah Winfrey frequently graces the covers of women's

</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey has teamed up with Hearst Magazines to publish a new
magazine that will seek to capitalize on her enormous popularity
with women. The magazine, which has not been named yet, will hit
newsstands next spring with 850,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion victims, be warned, though. Ms. Winfrey will not be
pontificating on the pros and cons of leopard-print pants and
frosted eye shadow. The magazine, which will have four to six
issues in the first year and then come out monthly, will cover
issues related to spirituality, community, family, relationships
and work, among other topics.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine will also provide an additional outlet for Ms.
Winfrey's popular ``Oprah's Book Club,'' in which she chooses books
on her television show and encourages viewers to read along. The
magazine may include reviews and excerpts of the book and will
provide some format for readers to interact with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``This magazine provides a different way for people to be
informed and inspired,'' Ms. Winfrey said. That is not to say it
will be entirely void of buzz about fashion trends and ``in'' hair
styles.
</P>
<P>
   In general, however, ``this new magazine will reflect her
business and personal life principles and will be another media
outlet for the 33 million women viewers who watch her each week,''
said Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst Magazines, which
publishes Good Housekeeping, Cosmopolitan, Harper's Bazaar and 13
other magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey is essentially licensing her name to Hearst, which
will oversee editorial, publishing and distribution of the
magazine. Terms, which do not preclude her from appearing on the
covers of competing magazines, were not disclosed. Ms, Winfrey will
not be listed on the masthead and will likely only write one
article in each issue.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, ``she is going to have a lot of input about content,
images, visuals and layout,'' said Ellen Levine, the editor in
chief of Good Housekeeping, who has been working closely with Ms.
Winfrey and Ms. Black on the magazine's concept and design.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking the same sort of lift Ms. Winfrey's seal of approval
provides to book publishing, the magazine title ``will involve
Oprah's name one way or another,'' Ms. Black said, and she will
appear on the first cover. But will women toss out Good
Housekeeping in favor of the new Oprah-inspired magazine?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is a direct overlap,'' said Alan Jurmain,
executive vice president and media director at Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS
advertising agency, noting that the publication will appeal to
marketers who already advertise on the talk show. ``I think Oprah's
personality is fairly distinct from the standard Hearst magazine
profile.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is counting on the magazine having wide appeal. But,
``obviously they want to try to attract the better-educated
contingent of the television program, those who follow the Oprah
way of living,'' Jurmain said. ``She's doing a reverse Martha
Stewart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Winfrey's new venture, however, does not mean that the queen
of daytime chat has grown bored with her show, according to her
company, Harpo Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
   Though there has been much speculation about when she will end
the long-running show, ``Oprah is fully committed to `The Oprah
Winfrey Show' through the year 2002,'' a Harpo spokeswoman said.
``At this time, we are not making any announcements regarding
Oprah's continuing beyond the year 2002.''

ON GENDER ISSUES, CHANGE HASN'T COME EASILY FOR TEXAS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c. 1999 Houston Chronicle &HT;    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lisa Sheppard wanted nothing more than to become
the first female Texas Ranger seven years ago but got tagged an
independent-thinking ``woman's libber'' instead.
</P>
<P>
   For so long, the legendary Texas lawmen had been the bastion of
tall, Anglo males who wore Stetsons, rode horses and wielded guns,
big men upholding law and order on the wild frontier. Today there
are women in the ranks, but only two out of 107 Rangers _ Christine
Nix of Waco and Marrie Garcia of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're an open 1990s organization,'' contends Texas Department
of Public Safety spokesman Mike Cox. ``It doesn't make any
difference if an applicant for a job is male or female as long as
they're qualified. We're delighted to have female troopers and
female officers and female Rangers ... and I'm in sure in the
future we'll have even more.''
</P>
<P>
   As a federal appeals court decision handed down Tuesday makes
clear, however, such changes in thinking have not come easily.
</P>
<P>
   Although the appeals court favored a former Texas Ranger chief
accused of derailing the &UR;  &LR; highly qualified Sheppard, the DPS still
faces a related sex discrimination and sexual harassment lawsuit
that could be heard this summer by U.S. District Judge David
Hittner in Houston, lawyers on both sides said this week. In it
Sheppard alleges sex discrimination, while another woman who
briefly was a Texas Ranger claims that she was sexually harassed.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard first abandoned her dream to join the elite force in
1992 when individual Rangers advised the DPS trooper that ``it was
not yet time for a woman to join the Rangers,'' according to a
summary of the case by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the state's Public Safety Commission, which oversees
the DPS, decided the following year that the time for women had
come, it generated ``no small amount of controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard tried again in 1993 to no avail, even though she had
scored among the highest on a written exam of all the applicants.
Upon learning the selection process was rigged, she filed suit
against Maurice Cook, the former captain of the Rangers. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Sheppard said two Ranger officers on the selection committee
said that Cook told them to adjust their scores so that two other
women _ Garcia and Cheryl Steadman _ could be chosen instead.
</P>
<P>
   Cook wanted to reject Sheppard because she was ``too independent
and ... opinionated,'' according to the appeals court. Sheppard
claimed his actions were in retaliation for her political beliefs
and that they violated her right of free speech. She said he wanted
to blackball her because she was a ``woman's libber.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that it was a ``close'' call of judgment, the court
dismissed that suit Tuesday. Because Sheppard ``concedes that she
never verbally expressed'' any feminist beliefs to Cook, wrote
Circuit Judge Carl E. Stewart, the Rangers captain couldn't have
violated her free speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the court had harsh words for Cook.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is overwhelming that Cook acted unreasonably in
deliberately rigging the selection process,'' the court said.
``Cook even willingly admits that he made the offensive statements
at issue. Although we readily note our disdain for Cook's improper
actions, we nevertheless conclude that Sheppard presented
inadequate proof for her claim that she engaged in speech or other
activities entitled to protection under the First Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what effect, if any, the appellate court's opinion might
have on the upcoming discrimination and harassment suit against DPS
and the Rangers remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If an appellate panel just reading papers sees it that
clearly, a jury will obviously see the overwhelming evidence of him
rigging the process because we're going to have live witnesses,''
said Beatrice Mladenka-Fowler, an attorney for Sheppard and
Steadman.
</P>
<P>
   Sheppard was first discouraged, then bypassed and finally hired
as a Ranger in 1994. She turned down the once-coveted assignment,
her lawyer said, believing she would be shunted into
secretarial-style administrative work rather than active field
investigations. Steadman, on the other hand, joined the Rangers but
didn't last long after complaining of unfair treatment and sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was given menial chores to do. She was not allowed to go
out and do Texas Rangers stuff, like investigations,'' said
Mladenka-Fowler, noting the harassment claim was based on an
overnight meeting at which the men told off-color jokes designed to
make Steadman uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I filed the lawsuit in 1995. It was probably a year before
that when I tried to work it out within the department,'' Steadman
said. ``Really I've been waiting since '94 for some end to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Steadman, &UR;  &LR; who works in the vehicle theft division of DPS in
Houston, declined to comment further. Sheppard, &UR;  &LR; a state trooper in
the Corpus Christi area who has since been promoted, was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   While sex discrimination complaints from the past await a final
resolution, DPS spokesmen insist Texas' two female Rangers today
are in the field investigating high-profile cases, such as a
controversial charter school in Waco and a string of Texas murders
along a railway line. Neither of the female Rangers returned phone
calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The department's policy is not to discuss litigation,'' Cox
said. ``We think it's always the highest ground for matters pending
in court to be discussed in the judicial process and not in the
news media.''

   NORTHERN IRELAND: DUBLIN PLEA TO IRA
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland urged the IRA to make a
``clear, unambiguous statement'' that it intends to disarm under
the terms of the Northern Ireland peace accord. This, he said,
could ease the entry of members of the IRA's political wing, Sinn
Fein, into a new Protestant-Catholic cabinet by next Thursday's
deadline for establishment of the new body. The IRA, which has
observed a cease-fire for two years, has repeatedly said it has no

   The Law Lords, England's highest court, ruled that Gen. Augusto
Pinochet would have to pay little of the costs stemming from the
legal actions since his arrest in London last October on a Spanish
request to extradite him to Madrid to face charges of crimes
against humanity. The seven-judge panel did not speak of money
amounts, but its breakdown of the 83-year-old former Chilean
dictator's responsibility for legal fees meant that most of the
estimated $10 million the case has cost so far would be borne by
British taxpayers.

PROTEIN MAY HOLD KEY TO EYE DISEASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Md., Pa.)  (jw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers working on control of the body's blood supply have
found a protein that regulates the blood vessels in the eye. The
discovery may help explain the longstanding puzzle of how the
transparent parts of the eye are usually kept free of blood
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   It could also prove helpful in treating eye diseases like
age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, in which
unwanted blood vessels invade the eye.
</P>
<P>
   The protein is an angiogenesis inhibitor, a substance that
inhibits blood vessel growth. Angiogenesis inhibitors are promising
candidates for attacking tumors by cutting off their blood supply.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the new angiogenesis inhibitor was discovered by Dr.
Noel Bouck of the Northwestern University Medical School in
Chicago, Dr. David Dawson of the University of California at Los
Angeles and other colleagues. They are reporting their finding in
Friday's issue of Science.
</P>
<P>
   The protein, which is made by the retinal pigment epithelium
cells that line the back of the eye, had already been discovered in
another role by Dr. S. Patricia Beccera of the National Eye
Institute. Dr. Beccera named it pigment epithelium-derived factor
or PEDF.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bouck and her colleagues found the protein in a culture of
retinal tumor cells. She was pursuing a theory that the agent known
to suppress tumor growth in these cells might also control an
angiogenesis inhibitor protein. The theory turned out to be wrong,
but she found an angiogenesis inhibitor protein anyway. Further
tests showed it was identical to Dr. Beccera's protein.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bouck said that blood supply in the eye seems to be
controlled by the prevailing balance between a pair of substances,
PEDF, which inhibits new blood vessel growth and a factor called
VEGF (pronounced veg-eff) which is known to stimulate vessel
growth.
</P>
<P>
   When oxygen is low, as is the case in certain eye diseases, the
pigment epithelial cells produce less PEDF, allowing blood vessels
to invade and more oxygen to come in. When oxygen is sufficient,
the cells step up production of PEDF, which suffuses the eye and
banishes blood vessels, Dr. Bouck said.
</P>
<P>
   Invasion of the eye by new blood vessels is a critical cause of
vision loss in many kinds of blindness, particularly two of the
most common, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular
degeneration. Understanding how the healthy eye excludes blood
vessels should in principle help researchers devise treatments for
conditions in which the normal system breaks down.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Campochiaro, professor of ophthalmology and
neuroscience at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, described Dr.
Bouck's finding as ``fascinating'' and said her data suggested that
PEDF was part of the eye's natural mechanism for regulating blood
vessel growth. Although angiogenesis inhibitors known from other
tissues of the body have been found in the eye, they do not seem to
play an important role, he said.
</P>
<P>
   PEDF may have a role in treating eye disease, Campochiaro said,
but maybe not until researchers find a way to insert the gene for
the protein into retinal cells, because proteins are hard to
deliver in pill form.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Berger of the Scheie Eye Institute at the University
of Philadelphia said that the discovery of PEDF had increased
understanding of blood vessel regulation in the eye but that there
was ``a long way to go'' before it might play a role in any
clinical trial.  &QL;

 &HT;    Major appliances plug into 30% of electric bill
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A couple weeks ago we talked about the efficient
use of air conditioners, fans and shade trees to keep your home
comfortably cool at reasonable cost this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Today we'll go over a few other tips associated with summer
comfort and energy efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Appliances
</P>
<P>
   Air conditioning isn't the only thing driving up electrical
bills at this time of the year. For example, children and adults
are outdoors more, prompting more wardrobe changes over the course
of a day, so you may find yourself washing more clothes in summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Information Administration of the U.S. Department of
Energy says major appliances consume 30 percent of the total
electricity in the average home, compared with 26 percent for
heating and cooling. Another 10 percent goes toward heating water.
</P>
<P>
   Making a few minor changes in your household habits, along with
a little preventive maintenance, will reduce energy consumption and
save money, says Dixie Trout, a spokeswoman for Amana Home
Appliances.
</P>
<P>
   Start by increasing the use of an appliance now found in 90
percent of American households _ the microwave oven. Using a
conventional electric oven to bake a potato uses about 18 times as
much power as cooking the same potato in a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   Open the refrigerator door as infrequently as possible, and
don't hold it open for long periods.
</P>
<P>
   Allow leftovers to cool slightly before storing them in the
refrigerator. Plan meals ahead so you'll have time to move foods
from the freezer to the refrigerator for defrosting. It takes
longer, but the defrosting foods help keep the refrigerator
compartment cool.
</P>
<P>
   When storing food in the refrigerator, place it in an airtight
container so the refrigerator doesn't have to work as hard to
control humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Vacuum the coils of your refrigerator about once a quarter, more
often if dust accumulates there quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overload your washing machine, and remember to adjust the
water level to suit the size of the load you are washing. Use
cold-water wash and rinse cycles when you can.
</P>
<P>
   Take advantage of the sun and breeze by drying clothes on a line
outdoors. If you use a clothes dryer, remove clothes promptly, and
don't overload the dryer.
</P>
<P>
   Clean the lint trap before each new dryer load. Check the vent
hose regularly to be sure it isn't clogged. Set the temperature
according to the fabrics you are drying; the dryer doesn't always
have to be set on the highest temperature.
</P>
<P>
   You might use less hot water and less energy if you wash large
loads of dishes in your dishwasher instead of constantly filling
and draining the sink to wash a few dishes at a time by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Skip the drying cycle on the dishwasher. Instead, open the door
of the dishwasher after the wash and rinse cycles so the dishes can
air-dry.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling humidity
</P>
<P>
   How many times have you heard the phrase ``It's not the heat;
it's the humidity''?
</P>
<P>
   Humidity is a measure of the amount of moisture suspended in the
air. When the humidity is high, our natural personal cooling system
_ sweating _ becomes less efficient.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cooling the air, air conditioners reduce
humidity, and that helps us feel more comfortable. But even without
air conditioning, reducing humidity makes your house more pleasant
in summer.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to have a bathroom exhaust fan and to run it for
a while after every shower. The same goes for your range hood _ run
it when cooking to take excess steam out of the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, it's a good idea to use tight-fitting lids when
cooking. Not only do the lids reduce the steam produced, but they
also speed cooking time and reduce the energy used in cooking.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a dehumidifier, remember that it needs regular
attention. When it's been running a while, it collects water and
must be emptied.
</P>
<P>
   Check your foundation and attic vents. They should be set to
allow air circulation above and below your living areas.
</P>
<P>
   Some houses are drier than others, and some people actually have
to run humidifiers during summer months to add moisture to the air.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using a humidifier, follow the manufacturer's
instructions on inspecting and replacing the media pad. You'll
probably need to do at least one replacement over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: Make sure your appliances and household controls
are all set in summer mode.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a furnace-mounted humidifier, it should be turned
off unless you have one of those unusually dry houses that needs
year-round moisturizing.
</P>
<P>
   Check your programmable thermostat. Is it set for the patterns
your family is following now? In general, the system should turn
itself on in the morning before the family wakes up, so the house
is cool for morning activities, and shut itself off to conserve
energy while the family sleeps.
</P>
<P>
   If no one is home during the day, the system should shut off
when the family leaves and turn back on before people come home
from work or other activities.
</P>
<P>
   Some clothes-dryer vents have switches that allow you to set
them to retain some of the warm, moist air indoors during the
winter. Make sure the switch is set to direct all the exhaust
outside during summer.

 &HT;    My, my, this 'American Pie' is lewd, but filled with laughs
 &HT;    By Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Fans of gross-out comedies and simulated
sex with baked goods will be the prime audience for ``American
Pie,'' the latest movie to nudge the bounds of movie humor for a
mass audience.
</P>
<P>
   There is lots of oral sex, masturbation, loss of virginity,
nudity and diarrhea humor, not to mention the brief full frontal
contact with an apple pie that, reportedly, had to be edited to
avoid an NC-17 rating. Despite all of that, ``American Pie'' turns
out to have a gooey center, with gentle instructive messages about
the difference between love and sex, the importance of respect for
women and how initiation into the world of sex really is a
regrettable loss of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, don't be surprised if all moviegoers will be talking
about is the ``hair gel'' in the beer cup, the Internet voyeurism
and that darned pie.
</P>
<P>
   Move over Farrelly brothers, there's a new sibling team in town.
It's director Paul Weitz and producer Chris Weitz, whose
screenwriting credits on ``Antz'' and ``Madeline'' hardly prepare
us for the crude comedy of ``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Humor is a highly subjective matter, but this is a considerably
wittier movie than the wildly popular ``There's Something About
Mary,'' which it so clearly tries to emulate (without that
picture's mean-spiritedness). Say what you will about the Weitzes,
at least they don't abuse any dogs in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' opens with high school senior Jim (forlorn,
frustrated Jason Biggs) squinting at a scrambled porno channel, and
planning a little solo sex. If this goes beyond your taste level _
and it might _ you'll never make it through this movie. When Jim is
interrupted by his flustered parents, his well-meaning father (a
bumbling, very amusing Eugene Levy) begins a running gag's worth of
intrusions into Jim's sexual attempts, eventually catching him
having carnal knowledge of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   Jim is one of four guys who form a pact to do whatever it takes
to lose their virginity before graduation. There's Oz (``Election''
's Chris Klein) who tries to fake sensitivity pursuing a girl in
the jazz choir, Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas of ``Rookie of the
Year'') who is stopped by his inability to say he loves his
longtime girlfriend and egghead Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas of the
little-seen ``Illtown''), who is smart enough to pay for gossip
about his physical endowments to improve his chances for a prom
date.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a ``Porky's'' or almost every other teen sex comedy, the
girls of ``American Pie'' also have raging libidos, but they want
it done right. When Jim is observed on the Internet clumsily trying
to seduce a foreign exchange student, groups of girls enjoy
laughing at him as much as the boys do.
</P>
<P>
   Director Weitz may or may not have ambitions beyond gross-out
comedy, but his ability to sustain the humor in his debut feature
already puts him above many young filmmakers. He also has a nice
touch with actors, drawing solid performances from an ensemble of
relative newcomers. Worth noting among the female cast are Natasha
Lyonne (``Slums of Beverly Hills'') as a senior who manages to stay
above the sexual fray, Mena Suvari as the wary choir quarry and
Alyson Hannigan (Willow on TV's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'') as a
geeky refugee from band camp who defies her prom date's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe gross-out comedies are just a fad that will soon fade, but
``American Pie'' is not the movie that will stop, or even slow, the
phenomenon. Teens everywhere will want to see it, putting further
strain on theaters to try to police the R-rating admission policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMERICAN PIE''
</P>
<P>
   3 stars
</P>
<P>
   Rated R: Language, nudity, sexual situations, pastry abuse
</P>
<P>
   Running time: One hour, 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Another gross-out comedy, but a funny one, about
high schoolers trying to lose their virginity, from a new talented
filmmaking brother team.

 &HT;    `Arlington Road' twists delightfully _ until cliches ruin the
rideBy Hap Erstein
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ One day, some clever entrepreneur will
create a film festival that shows only the first half of movies,
turning off the projector before the stories get out of hand, the
cliches pile up and the action sequences grow outlandish. Then, and
only then, can we enjoy suspense pictures like ``Arlington Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Mark Pellington (``Going All the Way'') and
screenwriter Ehren Kruger seem to be onto something with their
methodically constructed, gripping tale of paranoia in the Northern
Virginia suburbs. But they squander what they've built when the
hazy cloud of doubts gives way to the usual car chases and fights.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary history Professor Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges)
lectures on domestic terrorism and plies conspiracy theories at
George Washington University by day. At night, his suspicious
nature begins spilling over into his peaceful residential
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   What about that new Norman Rockwell-esque couple across the
street, cardiganed Oliver Lang and his sweet, soccer mom wife
Cheryl (the astutely cast Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack), who lie
about their history, receive suspicious mail and are so guarded
about some blueprints? Could they be planning to blow up a
government office building?
</P>
<P>
   In a consciously slow, but effectively tense first hour, widower
Faraday is seen as a caring, protective dad to his 10-year-old son
Grant, telegraphing that the kid will soon be in serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   The death of his FBI agent wife in a Ruby Ridgelike shootout
sets up Faraday's bitterness at the government, making him unstable
enough to have those around him question his suspicions. Is he
coming unhinged? So far, all Faraday suspects is circumstantial and
the movie's tone is deliciously noncommittal and creepy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as if director Pellington flipped a switch, ``Arlington
Road'' shifts into overdrive and subtlety gets traded in for
heavy-handed pyrotechnics. Michael's previously dubious girlfriend
(Hope Davis) stumbles onto a few clues and turns into a regular
Nancy Drew. With only-in-the-movies timing, as soon as she utters
what she knows or whenever Michael stares at his evidence, up pop
Oliver or Cheryl.
</P>
<P>
   Michael starts canceling classes to play sleuth, shuttling
across country to quiz tenuous witnesses, before chasing a van-full
of explosives through downtown Washington with all the skill of a
demolition derby driver. And in a particularly excessive scene, he
crashes a party Oliver is throwing for his right-wing wacko
brigade, garishly photographed as if they were a coven of witches
and warlocks.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Pellington is right and today's mass audience has no
interest in a merely eerie thriller of ideas, preferring action
bombast. Give me Alan Pakula's ``The Parallax View'' (1974), a very
similar movie, but one which has the courage of its own
intelligence. When ``Arlington Road'' forgets the head and goes for
the gut, it loses its edge and settles for being aggravatingly
ordinary. But, ah, that first hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``ARLINGTON ROAD''
</P>
<P>
   2 stars
</P>
<P>
   Rated R: Violence, language
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 1 hour, 55 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Intriguing tale of urban paranoia which gets
squandered in its second half as it turns obvious and ordinary.

IN PLOY, REPUBLICANS SET DEBATE ON DEMOCRATIC PATIENTS' BILL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., S.D., Okla.)   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an odd bit of political jujitsu, Senate
Republican leaders said Thursday that they would use a Democratic
bill as the main vehicle for four days of debate next week on the
rights of patients buffeted by turmoil in the health care industry.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was introduced in January by the Senate Democratic
leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of
Massachusetts, whose proposals are normally anathema to
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican
leader, announced Thursday that Republicans would call up the
Daschle-Kennedy bill as the first order of business when the
four-day debate begins on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic proposal will be ``the underlying bill for the
purpose of next week's health care debate,'' Nickles said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans apparently hope that this tactic will enable them to
spend hours attacking the Democratic bill, rather than defending
their own bill.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, before the debate ends on Thursday, Republicans
said, they intend to replace the Democratic bill with the
Republican version.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the ploy does not indicate that Republicans like the
Democratic bill. Rather, it may suggest the lengths to which
Republicans will go to avoid being on what they fear is the
``wrong'' side of a popular consumer protection issue that
Democrats will exploit in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Ranit Schmelzer, a spokeswoman for Daschle, said, ``The
Republicans don't really want to have an honest debate on the
patients' bill of rights.'' She said the Democrats would still try
to arrange for votes on amendments that would highlight the
differences between the two parties on specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Manley, a spokesman for Kennedy, said, ``The Republican
leadership is desperate to prevent members from taking tough votes
on these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The two bills have the same title, the Patients' Bill of Rights
Act, and appear to have similar objectives, establishing minimum
federal standards for health maintenance organizations and health
insurance companies. But the bills differ in many important
respects, and some Republicans say they worry that their votes
against Democratic proposals could be misconstrued by their
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic bill appears, for example, to provide more
protections for more people, and would make it easier for patients
to sue if they were injured as a result of a health plan's
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the Democratic bill would ultimately increase
the number of uninsured because it would increase the costs of
health insurance by imposing dozens of new federal mandates and
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Nickles asserted that the Democratic bill ``sharply increases
costs, puts lawyers and bureaucrats in the treatment room and
forces millions more Americans out of their health care coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting point for the debate is significant, Nickles said.
``But it's where we end up that really counts,'' he added. ``At the
end of next week, the Senate will have passed a bill that protects
patients and doctors, enhances health care quality and dramatically
increases access to health care coverage for uninsured Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say their bill is more explicit in guaranteeing
patients access to emergency care, medical specialists,
prescription drugs and clinical trials testing experimental
treatments. Democrats also contend that their bill is better for
patients because it gives doctors, rather than health plans, the
authority to decide what services are ``medically necessary'' and
gives patients a greater opportunity to appeal decisions denying
care.
</P>
<P>
   The American Medical Association urged patients to join doctors
in lobbying Congress for strong patient protections. Dr. Nancy W.
Dickey, former president of the association, said doctors should
have the ``final say about what is medically necessary.''

ANALYSIS: IN CENTRAL AFRICA, A CEASE-FIRE AMID WIDESPREAD
DISTRUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw)

<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ If the opponents in Congo's 11-month war
sign their planned cease-fire agreement, they will be trying to
bring closure to the single event that has destabilized all of
Central Africa: the genocide in Rwanda. It won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire plan _ which the heads of six governments and two
rebel movements agreed to Wednesday and which they could sign this
weekend _ calls for the disarmament of the Hutu militia that is
responsible for much of the 1994 genocide that killed a
half-million of Rwanda's Tutsi minority.
</P>
<P>
   Disarming this militia is the most difficult task outlined in
the cease-fire plan. And its failure would make lasting peace
impossible, officials involved in the negotiations concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as Rwanda is concerned, the most interesting aspect of
the agreement is that the countries involved have committed to
disarm and fight the ... genocidal forces, and that was our
objective,'' Rwanda President Pasteur Bizimungu said Thursday at a
news conference in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that all countries involved have pledged to neutralize
them, then we have no other reason to fight,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The militia and other rebel movements have been hiding in Congo
and using the country as a launching pad to attack governments in
neighboring countries. The militia is believed to consist of the
most hard-core opponents of Rwanda's Tutsi government, which has
otherwise repatriated and reintegrated many Hutu soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   It was partly to deal with the militia that the Tutsi-led
government of Rwanda and its close ally, Uganda, plucked Laurent
Kabila out of obscurity and helped him two years ago to topple
Mobutu Sese Seko, under whose dictatorship the Congo, then called
Zaire, had become a huge shell of a nation in the heart of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But after a while Rwanda and Uganda began to believe that Kabila
was unwilling to settle their security concerns, and they backed
another rebellion, this time against him.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters more complicated, Kabila and his allies
eventually drew the battle-hardened militia known as the
Interahamwe to their side to fight the Rwanda-backed rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were recruited by Kabila to fight, to recover their
strength and to launch another campaign against Rwanda,'' said a
diplomat involved in the negotiations, held in Zambia's capital,
Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
   Now, having lost the support of Kabila, the militia either has
to disarm or defend itself. But disarming may not be attractive to
the militia, because many of its members may be ineligible for
amnesty, leaving them little choice but to fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they have nothing to lose,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the cease-fire plan, a joint military commission made up
of the warring parties will begin disarming and putting into effect
other aspects of the agreement, until a peacekeeping force takes
over, either from the Organization of African Unity or the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, while the plan will grant a widespread amnesty, it
excludes those suspected of genocide, a category under which many
Interahamwe will presumably fall.
</P>
<P>
   How to disarm the Interahamwe, whose numbers are estimated to be
from 15,000 to as many as 50,000, is yet to be worked out. And the
process will take place in a country where troops from five
governments are still present, along with fighters from two main
rebel movements and countless smaller factions.
</P>
<P>
   They are full of mistrust. For instance, the secretary general
of one of the main rebel groups, Olivier Kamitatu of the Movement
for the Liberation of the Congo, said in an interview from Lusaka,
``We couldn't put this in the cease-fire agreement, but we have
said that we will consider any attack against us by the Interahamwe
after the cease-fire takes effect to be an attack by Kabila.'' His
group controls much of northern Congo. At the moment, Uganda and
Rwanda are backing the rebel movements, but Zimbabwe, Angola and
Namibia are supporting Kabila's government.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to plan, all foreign forces will have 180
days to leave Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also sets out an ambitious timetable for the government
and various military and political parties inside the Congo to work
toward a national reconciliation. Within 45 days of the signing of
the cease-fire, the Kabila government, the two rebel movements and
the various political opposition parties are to find a location and
a facilitator for a national debate on the future of the Congo.
Then the debate, consisting perhaps of government officials and
rebels meeting for talks, must be held within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila had softened his position on a national debate in recent
months; still, agreeing to it marked a sharp departure from his
original position. When he came to power two years ago, Kabila, a
rebel who had lived in the bush for decades and had few political
skills, shunned the parties that formed Mobutu's political
opposition and lost many opportunities to build a political base.
</P>
<P>
   For many months after the war started last August, Kabila
rejected any negotiations or meetings with the rebel groups,
arguing that they were puppets of Rwanda and Uganda. In recent
months, though, the war and the deteriorating economy caused
Kabila's popularity to plummet in the capital and pushed him to
open the door toward the internal opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire plan also includes a provision stating that all
ethnic groups enjoy equal status in the Congo, an item clearly
intended to protect Congo's Tutsi minority.
</P>
<P>
   Tutsi, who have been in the Congo for generations, have long
been the targets of other eastern Congolese groups that contested
their right to own land or become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these Tutsi took part in the rebellion that overthrew
Mobutu, and belong to the current revolt against Kabila. When
rebels forces almost seized Kinshasa last August, the Kabila
government relied heavily on propaganda against the Tutsi to rally
the population.

AIR FORCE EMBARKS ON EMERGENCY AID FLIGHT TO SOUTH POLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCHORD AFB, Wash. _ A hand-picked crew of 22 aviators and
support personnel scrambled on an emergency flight to the South
Pole Thursday to air-drop medical supplies to a civilian scientist
who has been diagnosed with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   After a 10 a.m. takeoff, the McChord-based C-141 mission,
commanded by Col. John Pray, rendezvoused with an Air Force KC-10
aerial tanker enroute to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii before
making the second leg of the flight to Christchurch, New Zealand,
said Col. Ray Johns, commander of the 62nd Airlift Wing. The
one-way trek from McChord to the South Pole is 9,200 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things with which we're most proud is the
flexibility we have to respond to a national need,'' said Johns,
who commands a fleet of 41 C-141B Starlifter aircraft and about
5,000 military and civilian personnel at the Pierce County air
base.
</P>
<P>
   Barring weather delays, the air-drop mission will take place
Sunday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis began three weeks ago when the scientist, a
47-year-old woman, was diagnosed by a physician at the
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station as having a cancerous lump on one
breast. After a review of her condition by the local physician and
medical experts consulted by the National Science Foundation, the
decision was made to request Air Mobility Command help in
delivering the necessary supplies by parachute air-drop, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Supplies include additional medical diagnostic material, medical
supplies and additional communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   Science foundation officials declined the release the name of
the scientist, citing her right to privacy. Requests to interview
officials at the polar station by telephone or e-mail were declined
because the station has limited communications links to the outside
world, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Johns said the mission team began preparations for the operation
immediately after the science foundation request came to McChord
last Friday, including a practice cargo air-drop flight and a
rehearsal mission in a C-141B flight simulator in which the pilot
used night-vision goggles to improve his ability to locate the drop
zone.
</P>
<P>
   All 15 aircrewmen on the flight have experience in Antarctic
missions, Johns said. McChord in recent years has drawn the bulk of
the Antarctic supply missions but none had been scheduled this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is for the C-141B to fly from Christchurch, New
Zealand, nonstop to the polar station escorted by the KC-10 tanker.
Once overhead, cargo loadmasters in the C-141B will open the two
paratrooper doors at the rear of the aircraft and push out six
cargo bundles that will float to the ground on parachutes. Each
bundle will have about 600 pounds of material, Johns said. The
flight will require several in-flight refuelings from the KC-10
tanker plane.
</P>
<P>
   Time and accuracy over the drop zone will be critical, the wing
commander said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to get to those supplies within five minutes (of
hitting the ground) or they will be damaged and no longer useful,''
Johns said. Liquid medical supplies in particular will freeze
despite thick insulation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are 41 civilian personnel at the polar station, which is
cut off from the outside world between February and October each
year because of the severe weather conditions, particularly
temperatures that average 80 degrees below zero and which can be as
low as 150 degrees below zero at the aircraft flight altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   Only during the warmest four months of the Antarctic summer,
from November until late February, smaller aircraft such as C-130s
using skis mounted on their landing gear can fly the 800-mile trip
from the main U.S. base at McMurdo Sound and safely land on an ice
airstrip at the pole, Johns said.
</P>
<P>
   A science foundation spokeswoman, Mary Hanson agreed there was
no alternative but to ask the Air Force for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never landed an aiplane there in the winter,'' Hanson
said. ``It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Harry Mahar, safety and health officer for the science
foundation's Office of Polar Programs, said the organization will
reimburse the Air Force for the cost of the medical supply mission,
which other officials said would run in the hundreds of thousands
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the present time we're not concerned about the costs,''
Mahar said yesterday. ``We're concerned about the health and
welfare of the individual.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
There has been no urge to pick up the phone to make even the
slightest suggestion. And with the exception of a cameo appearance,
the locks to the Astrodome doors haven't needed to be changed to
keep him out.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball has taken a back seat for Larry Dierker in the last
four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   During one of the busiest parts of the season, there have been
no long road trips for the Astros' third-year manager. He hasn't
thought about strategy _ hitter-pitcher matchups or who is going to
bat cleanup _ and game involvement has been reduced to watching on
television and reading the morning newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't rested during a summer all my life,'' Dierker said
Thursday afternoon. ``I might as well take advantage of it and look
at the positive side.''
</P>
<P>
   When something has been done for more than three decades, the
routine is hard to break. But Dierker, 52, had no choice after he
collapsed in the dugout during the Astros' June 13 game with the
San Diego Padres after being stricken by a grand mal seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, he underwent brain surgery to remove a
life-threatening mass of malformed blood vessels. Eight days later,
he amazingly checked out of the hospital and headed home for rest
and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't been counting down the days until his return, but he
quickly points out his scheduled date to rejoin the Astros is July
15 _ one month and two days after he was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, normalcy has returned to Dierker's life. His
physical condition isn't what it once was, the result of a
doctor-advised limited workout schedule. He isn't allowed to drive.
A scar across the top of his head is an all-too-vivid reminder of
the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Some things, however, haven't changed. He still has an appetite,
and there have been times he has managed to sneak out for a round
of golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``My appetite is the same; I just can't work out hard,'' said
Dierker, who has been spending his time devouring ice cream.
``Maybe I shouldn't be eating as much.''
</P>
<P>
   When he returns to his post, Dierker will find the National
League Central race much closer than it was when he left. He'll
also find wounded players returning and three new All-Stars on his
pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros held a four-game division lead at the time Dierker
was forced to take a leave of absence. Entering Thursday night's
game, the Astros were 10-13 under interim manager Matt Galante.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been easy to watch. I stay in touch, but I'm not
trying to be that involved. I've been trying to stay away,''
Dierker said. ``I'm not trying to be that involved _ why not hit
this guy fifth or pitch this guy in the seventh? They're doing
their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   While the results might not be what is expected from the
two-time defending NL Central champions, Dierker believes the
Astros haven't come close to reaching their peak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I picked a good time to be out,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   A roster once injury-filled is beginning to show signs of
health, with reliever Doug Henry due back next week and third
baseman Ken Caminiti likely to return before the end of the month.
The Astros also could get a big lift with the expected return of
left fielder Moises Alou in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in a good position in regard to the standings
and injuries,'' Dierker said. ``I still think we are going to win
our division. I think we can only get better in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he is especially proud of the Astros' four All-Star
selections _ first baseman Jeff Bagwell and pitchers Jose Lima,
Mike Hampton and Billy Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, a two-time All-Star in his playing days, said he can
appreciate the difficulty in getting three members of one staff
recognized.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tough to do. Probably with the number of teams there
are, you would get one per team at the most. We got three pitchers.
That's pretty good,'' he said. ``I am disappointed (second baseman
Craig) Biggio didn't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week at this time, Dierker will be back in the dugout, back
wearing the uniform that has hung in his honor since he left. And
before the Astros even play a game in the second half, they can
chalk up one of their biggest wins of the season with his return.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he knows he can't stay home forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my wife (Judy) is getting tired of having me around
the house,'' he said.

 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ NASA on Thursday formally targeted late July 19 for
the launch of its $2.7 billion Chandra X-ray observatory from the
Kennedy Space Center in Florida aboard the shuttle Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's five-member crew will be led by veteran astronaut
Eileen Collins, the first woman to command a crew of space
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about this flight,'' said Collins, a
42-year-old Air Force colonel and test pilot. Collins co-piloted
shuttle flights in 1995 and 1997 to Russia's Mir space station.
</P>
<P>
   The observatory mission has been delayed for nearly a year by a
succession of problems with software and circuitry on the large
observatory and most recently by the failure of an identical
propulsion system on a military rocket.
</P>
<P>
   However, following a lengthy review of preparations on Thursday,
NASA shuttle program managers determined each of the difficulties
has been resolved and approved the liftoff.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia is scheduled to blast off at 11:36 p.m., CDT on July
19. The shuttle crew plans to deploy the big observatory within
eight hours of launch.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra was developed to the observe the highest-energy events
in the universe and could help astronomers locate the mysterious
dark matter that may comprise much of the cosmos as well as explain
little-understood activities around supermassive black holes.
</P>
<P>
   Named for the late Indian-born theoretical astrophysicist and
Nobel prize winner Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, the Chandra is a
companion to the Hubble Space Telescope launched in 1990 and the
Compton Gamma Ray Observatory launched in 1991. The last of the
observatories in the series, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility,
is to go up in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Setbacks over the past year for the Chandra flight added $53
million to the mission's hefty price tag, but space agency managers
vowed to correct every difficulty before approving the launch.
</P>
<P>
   The latest difficulty arose after the April 9 launch of an Air
Force Titan 4 rocket with a missile warning satellite. The Titan's
upper stage rocket, which is identical to the Chandra's propulsion
system, failed to separate into its two components, and the
military satellite was lost.
</P>
<P>
   NASA awaited the outcome of a classified Air Force investigation
into the expensive mishap before proceeding with the Chandra
mission.
</P>
<P>
   At 50,162 pounds and 57 feet, the Chandra observatory and its
propulsion system is the largest payload ever flown on a shuttle. A
good deal of the mass, 30,600 pounds, belongs to the propulsion
system.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite's rocketry is essential to boosting the X-ray
observatory to its final destination, an elliptical orbit that will
range between 6,200 miles and 87,000 miles above Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' crew consists of rookie pilot Jeff Ashby, flight
engineer Steve Hawley, mission specialist Catherine ``Cady''
Coleman and French astronaut Michel Tognini.

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ President Clinton wrapped up his four-day tour
of poverty in America on Thursday with a whirlwind visit to a
job-training program at a high school in the heart of the Watts
section of Los Angeles, then challenged corporate executives to
provide more support for preparing disadvantaged students for jobs
in the booming information economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is a big issue here,'' Clinton, referring to his efforts
to encourage investment in poor areas, told the annual meeting of
the American Academy Foundation, a private group led by corporate
chiefs that sponsors vocational training for public high school
students who are at risk of dropping out.

   But education and ``human capital'' are equally important,
Clinton said, and unless the nation is prepared to nurture them,
too, ``even our best efforts to bring new investments to these
distressed communities will be unsuccessful.''
</P>
<P>
   A journey that took Clinton from the hollows of Appalachia to
the Black Hills of South Dakota, from the sweltering Mississippi
Delta to a sweaty tortilla factory in Phoenix, ended at a hotel
ballroom here in the shadow of Disneyland _ and at times, the
endeavor had a surreal air. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, once Clinton's
frequent antagonist and later his spiritual counselor in the
travails of impeachment, accompanied the president all week,
lending his support to Clinton's self-described effort to ``shine
the spotlight on places still unlit by the sunshine of our present
prosperity.'' Clinton thanked him warmly on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was Clinton's most extensive domestic trip in many
months that did not involve political fund-raising among the rich
and famous, and the president seemed energized by the effort,
racing from stop to stop in campaign style, taking in everything
from Memphis barbecue to a floodlit Mt. Rushmore with his customary
appetite, finally sounding a bit tired only on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But he pledged to keep up the theme, announcing plans for
another tour this fall, starting in Newark, N.J., where he will
highlight efforts by the owners of the New Jersey Nets to re-invest
in that long-suffering city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be the end of the journey,'' Clinton said of his
trip. ``It has to be the opening salvo in a battle to build a real
economy in every community.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has on each day of his national tour, Clinton sounded a
flurry of notes Thursday _ warning of the growing gap between the
rich and the poor in access to technology and highlighting private
sector sponsorship of job training _ all in service of a single
theme: that the nation's pockets of poverty offer a great untapped
market that can help keep the economy growing without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you keep it going?'' Clinton asked a roundtable of
students at Southwest Community College in the long-struggling
Watts section of Los Angeles, where the unemployment rate is three
times the national average. ``The easiest way to keep it going is
to go to places where there aren't enough jobs and there aren't
enough consumers and create more of both.''
</P>
<P>
   But having spent three days emphasizing his proposals for $1
billion in new federal tax incentives aimed at encouraging $5
billion in private investment in poor areas _ which he said he
would send to Congress next week _ Clinton turned Thursday to the
other end of the equation: training an adequate work force to fill
the jobs such new businesses would create.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put in place the financial networks,'' Clinton told the
roundtable group. ``We can create a lot of jobs.'' But at a time
when 60 percent of young people in the impoverished areas he has
visited this week are neither in school or at work, Clinton said,
it is clear that ``in the world we're living in, there is a high
premium in an information society, placed on knowledge, skills,
what you know today and what you can continue to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the president chose to highlight the work of the
National Academy Foundation, which sponsors special training
``academies'' _ special schools within schools _ that prepare
students for careers in finance and travel and tourism through a
combination of in-school teaching and on-the-job training. The
program, started in Brooklyn in 1982, already serves 20,000 high
school students in 37 states, and on Thursday, Clinton joined the
foundation's founder, Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup,
to announce $8 million in support from private companies, including
Lucent Technologies and AT&AMP;T, to create a new academy program for
information technology.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to have 10 pilot sites, serving 350 to 400 students,
in operation by September 2000, with 40 to 50 more sites to be
added annually after that. The White House said the need for such
training was clear, citing the Commerce Department's third annual
study, released Thursday, which found a growing gap in access to
telephones, computers and the Internet between Americans at the
highest income and education levels and those at the lowest.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If our country is going to be the leader 50 years from today,
we have to include everybody, and everybody has to participate in
it,'' Weill said. ``Education is what unlocks the key to one's
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced here Thursday by Hazel del Rosario, 22,
who just graduated from the University of Hawaii, and is preparing
for a career in the airline industry. Her family emigrated from the
Philippines when she was a child, and though she initially spoke no
English, she was placed in a bilingual education program and later,
in a special academy of travel and tourism sponsored by the
National Academy Foundation at her high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I entered the program, I didn't know what I wanted to
do,'' Ms. del Rosario said in an interview, wearing a fragrant lei
of white ginger blossoms that she carried in a cooler from Hawaii
on Wednesday. ``We didn't only learn about classroom stuff, we also
learned about real-life situations, and being able to speak to
people in public.''
</P>
<P>
   In Watts, which was scarred by riots in 1965 and 1992, during
Clinton's first campaign for the White House, the president joined
Magic Johnson, the former basketball star who now operates a chain
of inner-city movie theaters, to sound the need for job training in
a neighborhood that was once overwhelmingly black but has been
transformed in recent years by a surge of Hispanic immigration and
fitful efforts at economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   At Alain Leroy Locke High School, named for the nation's first
black Rhodes scholar, Clinton, Johnson and Gov. Gray Davis of
California toured a transportation training program and watched
students use computers to demonstrate the aerodynamic effects of
automotive design.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one does better than this one,'' Clinton said, holding a
yellow plastic car that trailed its competitor positioned in front
of jet stream simulator by Michael Delery, 17, and Jermaine Smith,
18. ``Even I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ruben Garcia, 17, showed the president a sound-engineering
machine that can change the pitch of a human voice, rendering an
off-key singer on pitch, the dedicated amateur saxophonist and
hymn-singer marveled, ``So it's like a high-tech karaoke bar.''

 &HT;    Olympic records dispute in hands of Fulton judge
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The battle over public access to Olympic records went
before a Fulton County judge Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing a full day of arguments, Superior Court Judge
Bensonetta Tipton Lane said she hopes to decide soon whether the
state's Open Records Act applies to the Georgia Amateur Athletics
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation _ formed by Billy Payne in 1987 to bid for the
1996 Centennial Olympic Games _ sued The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution last month to have the bid records declared
private and immune from the state's records law. The newspaper and
Attorney General Thurbert Baker then filed a countersuit to open
the foundation's records. The newspaper's attorney, Peter Canfield,
said the Open Records Act applies because the foundation prepared
the bids for and lobbied on behalf of the city and state, which
were awarded the Games. Atlanta and Fulton County gave $250,000
each during the bid.
</P>
<P>
   The same group of people then staged the Games as the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games, he said. The foundation now has
ACOG's files.
</P>
<P>
   ``Practically every single person's life in Atlanta was
affected'' by the Olympics, said Deputy Attorney General Dennis R.
Dunn. ``This was an overwhelmingly public event.''
</P>
<P>
   Payne last week pledged to make public all the records except
the contents of eight boxes that he says include personal letters
and memos. Payne said, though, that a congressional committee could
have ``unfettered access'' to them.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Bankoff, the foundation's attorney, said the Open Records
Act does not apply to the foundation because it was never
officially delegated any governmental responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The case is ``about the future of public-private
collaborations'' like the one that brought the Games to Atlanta,
Bankoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and former Mayor Andrew Young testified that Payne brought
the idea of pursuing the Games to Young, who wanted to be
supportive but without opening the city to any financial liability.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he does not know what is in the boxes. But some
donors wanted to maintain their privacy, he said, as did people who
provided information about members of the International Olympic
Committee who would vote to choose a host city.
</P>
<P>
   If Lane decides the foundation's records are public, it can
still seek to keep the eight boxes private by claiming one of the
Open Records Act's exemptions. Canfield said Lane then would need
to come up with a process for deciding whether the exemptions
apply.

 &HT;    National Data invests in Web
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ National Data Corp. said Thursday it will invest $20
million in hopes of making Medscape.com the leading health care
site on the Internet, a hotly contested title of late.
</P>
<P>
   National Data's investment will give the Atlanta-based
information and networking company about a 5 percent stake in
Medscape.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement, CBS said it bought a 35 percent
stake in Medscape in return for $150 million of advertising and
on-air promotions that will be carried by CBS properties, including
radio, television, the Internet and billboards. A revamped Web
site, CBS.medscape.com, is expected to be ready by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   In May, New York-based Medscape filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission for an initial public offering of its stock
under the symbol MSCP.
</P>
<P>
   The Medscape deal gives National Data access to Medscape's
registered users as well as the Medscape.com Web site, said Bob
Yellowlees, National Data chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of May, about 1.1 million people had registered at
Medscape.com. Of those, more than 200,000 were physicians, 550,000
worked in other health care professions and 380,000 were registered
as consumers.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of Medscape's registered users visit the site
regularly, said Paul Sheils, Medscape president and chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   National Data has about $450 million in revenue from its health
care information technology. That division's products include the
electronic processing of drug prescriptions, including verifying a
patient's eligibility, determining how much will be reimbursed,
making sure the drug does not conflict with other drugs and sending
the claim to the insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as WebMD, are hoping to make the Internet
the place where such health-care-related transactions are
processed. WebMD, based in Atlanta at Perimeter Center, has had a
high profile lately, signing deals with CNN and Microsoft. WebMD
also filed for a initial public offering, then withdrew the
request. It merged with Healtheon in May and has agreed to acquire
Atlanta-based Medcast.
</P>
<P>
   Launched in April 1996, Medscape was the grandfather of online
health care content sites geared to physicians but is making a move
toward the consumer market, said Stephen D. Savas, an analyst with
Goldman Sachs. The CBS deal with help Medscape become more of a
household name, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies, such as Claims.net, IDX, AccentHealth and
Atlanta-based Third Millennium, are competing to be the site to
handle doctors' ``back office'' business transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But Yellowlees said processing insurance claims is more complex
than just moving a transaction over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians need to be able to make sure patients are eligible
for insurance coverage and that the form in which the claims are
transmitted is legible to the insurance company, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply dumping information on a payer's doorstep does not get
you paid,'' Yellowlees said. ``We are already doing a lot of this;
the Web presence just gives customers another way to access it. We
are doing more than anyone in more segments of health care and more
from an Internet point of view than anyone in that space.''

NEW LUNG SCAN CATCHES CANCER EARLY AND SAVE LIVES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: In 19th graph, fixes spelling and full title of Moffitt
Cancer Center and gives location of it and Mayo Clinic) 
(ATTN: N.Y., Texas, Fla., Britain, Montreal)  (jw) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Death rates from lung cancer could be greatly reduced if smokers
and former smokers were routinely given CT scans of their lungs,
doctors are reporting Friday. The scans use a new technique that is
far more sensitive than conventional chest X-rays and can detect
tumors when they are small enough to be cured.
</P>
<P>
   Now, routine chest X-rays and other screening tests for lung
cancer are not recommended, even for smokers, because the tests
cannot identify tumors early enough to save or even prolong
patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying that we could change survival from 12 or 15
percent to 80 percent,'' said Dr. Claudia Henschke, division chief
of chest imaging at Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan and the
primary author of a study being published in the British journal
Lancet. ``There are 172,000 new cases a year. Think of 12 percent
or 15 percent survival, compared to 80 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The screening techniques studied in the research are already
available, but only at a few medical centers. The researchers said
they had already been approached by smokers and former smokers,
including some of their hospital colleagues, seeking the screening
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very important study that has major clinical
implications in the near future,'' said Dr. John Minna, a lung
cancer specialist and the director of the Hamon Center for
Therapeutic Oncology Research at the University of Texas
Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. ``It dramatically shows the
time has come to reopen lung cancer screening trials in current and
former smokers using the new CT technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Minna, who was not involved in the study, also praised the
authors for including women, who made up 46 percent of the study
subjects. ``Women had been excluded from all previous screening
studies,'' he said. ``This is vital, since 1.6 times more women die
of lung cancer than breast cancer each year in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United
States, killing 160,000 people a year, more than the combined total
of the next three causes, cancers of the colon, breast and
prostate.
</P>
<P>
   Survival rates for lung cancer patients have been dismal because
the disease typically is detected after it has begun to spread. It
causes no symptoms in its early stages, and even tumors picked up
by chest X-rays are generally so advanced that treatment cannot
cure them or even do much to prolong the patient's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost 85 percent now are discovered at a late stage,'' Dr.
Henschke said.
</P>
<P>
   Her study, conducted with researchers from New York University
and McGill University in Montreal, included 1,000 people who were
smokers or former smokers, aged 60 or older. None had symptoms of
any illness, though all had smoked cigarettes for at least 10
pack-years, meaning a pack a day for 10 years, or two packs a day
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   The participants were given both chest X-rays and CT scans,
using a new technique called helical low-dose CT scanning that
takes only 20 seconds. The CT scans clearly picked up tumors that
the chest X-rays missed: the scans identified 27, and the X-rays
only 7. Of the 27 identified by scans, 23 were stage I, meaning
early tumors that had not spread. But the X-rays identified only
four stage I cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henschke said that not all the tumors were removed
immediately. Some small ones were watched for a few months, and
their growth rates were studied. If the tumors grew, they were
removed. ``These are clearly cancers that would have killed the
patients in two to three years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The patients with stage I disease all had surgery to remove the
tumors and needed no chemotherapy or radiation or any other further
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the stage I patients are alive and well, with no evidence
of recurrence,'' Dr. Henschke said. All four patients with later
stage disease are dead, she added.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really exciting is that when you catch lung cancer
early, in stage I, it's very simple elective surgery,'' she said.
``By doing this test you're saving money. If you screened all the
high-risk people in one year, you'd save $1.5 billion, and that
would more than cover the cost of screening. And you'd be saving a
tremendous number of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen if insurance companies and health
maintenance organizations will pay for the screening.
``Policy-makers and third-party payers will have to be convinced
the technology is effective and cost-effective,'' said Dr. Robert
Smith, director of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society.
</P>
<P>
   Also, researchers said that the scanning technique should be
studied further before it is put into widespread use. One
shortcoming of Dr. Henschke's study, they said, was that it did not
include a control group of patients who did not receive CT scans.
Smith said, ``We need to make it a top research priority.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that demand for it might grow so quickly that
patients would refuse to participate in studies, for fear of being
assigned to a comparison group that did not get scans. ``We'll lose
the ability to evaluate it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Henschke said that not all medical centers could perform the
new test yet. In New York, it is available only at Cornell and New
York University. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and H. Lee
Moffitt Cancer Center and Research Institute in Tampa, Fla., also
perform it. But Dr. Henschke said that the other centers might
charge more than Cornell, where it costs $300.
</P>
<P>
   Two study participants who live in Manhattan said they thought
the test had probably saved their lives. George Feinberg, who is
64, said he had smoked heavily for about 17 years but had not had a
cigarette in about 30 years when he signed up for the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought they'd find anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the scan revealed a small tumor, and Feinberg had half of
his right lung removed in 1997.

   ``The cancer wasn't going to go away,'' he said. ``It was only
going to get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlene Botter, also 64, had smoked for about 50 years when she
entered the study. Like Feinberg, she was astounded, and
frightened, to learn that she had a cancerous tumor. She had
surgery about a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tumor was so tiny that they said I wouldn't need any more
treatment, and that made me feel very good,'' she said, adding that
she wonders why the scanning is not offered routinely.

IN A HIGH TECHNOLOGY WORLD, WHAT ROLE FOR CHECKS AND BALANCES? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 11) 
(jt) 
 By STEVE LOHR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The outcome of the government's suit against Microsoft, filed 14
months ago, is still far from certain, and the endgame may be two
or three years away, after appeals that may well reach the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   But one byproduct is already evident: a policy debate over
whether the current system of antitrust enforcement, dating back to
Theodore Roosevelt and the railway barons, is up to the challenge
of policing corporate behavior in a modern, high-technology
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is speed, the stakes are high and the debate is often
highly politicized. In June, Dick Armey, the House majority leader,
issued his statement of principles for government's role in an
economy increasingly powered by silicon, software and the Internet.
Called ``An E-Contract with High-Tech America,'' it warned against
``allowing antitrust law to become an excuse for bureaucratic
interference with innovation and competition.''
</P>
<P>
   In a scarcely veiled reference to the Microsoft case, it
criticized federal agencies that ``use heavy-handed tactics to
target specific companies.'' And it said ``the pace of innovation
is so quick'' that market power _ with which antitrust law concerns
itself _ is often fleeting. Armey's staff says no new antitrust
bill is now planned but calls the E-Contract a ``starting point.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Armey document can be seen as a predictable
gesture from a conservative Republican leader, especially as an
election year looms and Microsoft is becoming a more active
campaign contributor. But you don't have to side with Bill Gates to
see legitimate concerns about whether the government's antitrust
police and the courts can keep up with such fast-moving industries.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department advisory committee of executives, academics
and lawyers raised that issue in a meeting last month. Committee
members said the discussion was not about Microsoft, but rather
about the best antitrust policies in an environment of rapid
technological obsolescence. Among the options pondered were new
guidelines for the Justice Department and the Federal Trade
Commission and ``clearer, cleaner definitions'' of forbidden
behavior in new legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is up-to-date ground rules for powerful companies like
Microsoft and Intel, which settled its own antitrust dispute with
the FTC earlier this year. ``Policy-making has to be streamlined so
it can operate on something closer to Internet time, as these
industries do,'' said David B. Yoffie, a professor at Harvard
Business School and a committee member.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid pace of change in the software industry will not much
affect the verdict on the legality of Microsoft's business
practices. But when cases drag on as Microsoft's has, the speed
issue weighs heavily on the remedies prosecutors seek. No ruling on
Microsoft is expected from the federal district court in Washington
before the end of the year, 18 months after the suit was filed.
Again, you needn't be a Microsoft ally to notice how much has
changed since the case began: Microsoft's main corporate ``victim''
in the case, Netscape Communications, has been acquired by America
Online, and its former chief executive, James L. Barksdale, is now
a venture capitalist and enthusiastic backer of George W. Bush,
who, if elected President, might see antitrust policy somewhat
differently than the Clinton administration has.
</P>
<P>
   The speed issue figures prominently in the chess game of
settlement discussions between Microsoft and the government. Joel
I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, will
say only that the settlement equation is ``time versus risk.'' A
settlement would rein in Microsoft sooner than a verdict would,
Klein said, but the negotiated terms might leave Microsoft enough
leeway to abuse its market power.
</P>
<P>
   By judicial standards, the Microsoft case has moved with
surprising speed: ``a remarkable achievement,'' according to Andrew
I. Gavil, a law professor at Howard University, writing in
Antitrust magazine, an American Bar Association journal. Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson, Gavil said, has used innovative tactics _
from requiring all direct testimony in writing to limiting the
number of witnesses _ to speed the proceedings along and avoid the
``prolonged trench warfare'' that has plagued major cases like the
government's suit against IBM, which was dropped in 1982, after 13
years.
</P>
<P>
   But even the most expeditious courts are too slow in many eyes,
part of the reason so many antitrust cases are settled. ``It may be
fast compared with the IBM case, but it's not fast enough, and
that's a problem,'' said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the
University of California at Berkeley and a former senior Justice
Department official. ``A lot of things do change in 18 months.''

 &HT;    Lopez reports improvement
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ More good news for the Braves from Javy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   He caught for the first time in batting practice on Thursday
afternoon, catching Tom Glavine for 15 minutes in the Braves
bullpen, and said afterward the knee responded well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised,'' Lopez said. ``I thought I'd feel some kind of
pain when I squat down, block pitches, go side-to-side, but I
don't. With this brace, I'm able to do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said he thinks he cleared the last hurdle to being able to
say with confidence he'll be ready to return after the All-Star
break when the Braves play the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is it,'' Lopez said. ``I don't think I have to do
anything else to be ready for a game. ... Now I just need a couple
days to see how it wakes up (reacts).''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez plans to continue catching in the bullpen each day as he
tries to get used to wearing the bulky brace on his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be a little up,'' Lopez said of his position behind
home plate. ``The target is going to be a little high. I don't know
how difficult it will be to block pitches because I'm high already.
I probably won't be as quick as I was.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Braves, who need his bat back in the lineup, can live
with that.
</P>
<P>
   Jones on a roll at the plate
</P>
<P>
   This late offensive surge heading into the All-Star break is
making Chipper Jones' first-half come together nicely. This after
going through a June in which he hit only one homer and struggled
from the left side of the plate. But after Monday's game he hit the
.300 mark for the first time since April 23 and was hitting .304 to
go along with 19 home runs and 52 RBI entering Thursday night's
game.
</P>
<P>
   That includes a seven-game hitting streak in which he hit
10-for-21 (.476). He'd had five home runs in six games after going
21 games without one.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be lost in those numbers is his walk total. In 31 at-bats
in those seven games, Jones drew 10 walks to bring his team-leading
total to 61. That may be the most important number of all because
instead of that weak groundout on the infield, Jones has been
standing at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the difference,'' Jones said. ``Early in the
season I was swinging at bad pitches, getting myself out. I'm being
patient and when they're coming over the plate, I'm not missing
them. It's easier said than done. There are pitches on the corner
of the plate you think you can hit, even six inches outside you
think you can send to left. It's a matter of being able to
recognize the pitches you can do something with as opposed to the
pitches you can't. I'm dictating the at-bats, not letting the
pitcher do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty locked in,'' hitting coach Don Baylor said. ``If
you're looking for a third baseman to go to the All-Star Game (as a
replacement), I know where you can find one.

WELCOME TO THE CLUB, FINALLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., Fla., Va.)   (For release Sun., July 11)  
(jt) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Once upon a time, as the saying went, it was a man's world. But
times and customs change. The transition has not always been
without conflicts, perils and abrasions, but the mail shows that
the change has clearly been for the better.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president for human resources of a major corporation,
Ronald J. Rakowski of Bethel, Conn., was responsible for insuring
that the company complied with employment laws and that the staff
understood its commitment to equal employment opportunity and
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it wasn't always easy,'' he writes.
</P>
<P>
   He cites the time a division sales vice president burst into his
office to demand help in replacing a vital sales executive who had
just quit. ``And Ron, please don't send me any `girls,''' the
executive added. ``I know you think I'm a Neanderthal when it comes
to human resources, but humor me on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Rakowski reminded him of the law and, still steaming, turned the
recruiting assignment over to one of his best human-resources
representatives, who, in keeping with company practice, narrowed
the search to the five best candidates and compiled a report on
each. ``As luck would have it, the rep reported our best candidate
was Christina,'' Rakowski said.
</P>
<P>
   But he knew that if the executive was forced to hire Christina,
he would doubtlessly make her life miserable.
</P>
<P>
   Just before setting up a dinner with the executive to review the
candidates, Rakowski got an idea. He told his aide to change
Christina's name to Christopher in the paperwork and, contrary to
the company's normal practice of introducing the report on the best
candidate last, to move ``Chris'' into the first spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``After coffee and desert, the V.P. leaned back and told me that
we'd made a big mistake,'' Rakowski said. ``He thought `Chris' was
by far the best candidate and was anxious to interview `him.' Then
I told the V.P. what I had done. After a few `expletives deleted,'
he shook his head, chuckled and admitted that he had been had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve months later, `Chris' won the division's Salesman of
the Year Award.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales &UR; man &LR; ? ``Oh, well,'' Rakowski writes. ``Some things you
change and some things you can't.''
</P>
<P>
   As vice president for training and development of a large
financial services corporation, Lynn Brailsford of Teaneck, N.J.,
traveled internationally three or four times a year. But she
observed that her male counterparts would get better treatment,
more perks and larger rooms at hotels. Typically, they received
newly refurbished suites while she got closet-sized quarters.
</P>
<P>
   She decided to act. Her first thought was to have her assistant
book all her flights and rooms for ``Mr.'' But that was likely to
succeed only until she made an appearance. So her aide began to
tell airlines and hotels unequivocally that Ms. Brailsford was a
very important female executive. ``Suddenly there was eye contact
upon check-in,'' she writes. ``My hotel rooms were nicer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final satisfaction came while traveling to London with my
boss. We checked in together, and I alone was handed an envelope
with gold embossed lettering. The envelope, addressed to the `Lady
Executive,' contained a description of all the perks and services
available to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to be outperked, my boss leaned over and asked, `Hey, what
did you get?' I replied, `Oh, nothing more than a list of the perks
you get automatically. The difference is, I had to ask for it!''' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, just hired as executive producer in the news
department of a television station in Orlando, Fla., Bette
BonFleur, now of Charlottesville, Va., was passing the news
director's office when she heard him telling a colleague in another
city about his new hire: ``I just hired an executive producer,'' he
said. ``And it's a girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. BonFleur waited until he was off the phone, then walked in
and told him he sounded as if he were talking about a newborn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got the point, and I'm happy to say he has gone on to be
one of the best supporters of women in the workplace,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could it be because he and his wife actually did have a baby
girl a short time after?
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, I know it was because he was exposed to strong,
outspoken women and was man enough to recognize it and grow with
the times. He and I have laughed about the scene a hundred times
over the years.''

 &HT;    Thumbs up to Ricky Rudd
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Thumbs up to Ricky Rudd, who started on the outside of
the front row in last week's Pepsi 400 at Daytona International
Speedway. Rudd's qualifying effort came only one day after Procter
&AMP; Gamble announced that it wouldn't renew its sponsorship with
Rudd's No. 10 Ford. Rudd, one of the few single-car owners left in
the Winston Cup circuit, handling the embarassing situation with
class and dignity, said he hated to see his nine-year relationship
with Tide come to an end. Rudd then went out and proved with his
qualifying run that Procter &AMP; Gamble might be making a mistake.
Rudd finished a season-best 13th in the race.
</P>
<P>
   THUMBS DOWN
</P>
<P>
   To Cal Wells, the California-based CART owner who plans to make
a move into NASCAR next season. Wells, who owns Precision
Preparation Inc., doesn't have a driver or crew chief yet, but he
already has managed to swipe two of NASCAR's biggest sponsors. And
he lured them away from two of NASCAR's old-timers. In May,
McDonald's said it will sponsor Wells' Busch Grand National team
next year. In 2001, McDonald's is expected to end its longtime
relationship with Bill Elliott and move its Golden Arches to Wells'
Winston Cup car. Last week, Procter &AMP; Gamble said it is negotiating
with Wells to sponsor a Winston Cup team next season. What will
Wells do next? Kick Richard Petty in the stomach?
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S HOT?
</P>
<P>
   M&AMP;M's debuted its new crispy candies paint scheme in last week's
Pepsi 400, and, surprisingly, driver Ernie Irvan didn't crunch his
No. 36 Pontiac. Irvan has taken his share of criticism this year,
but he actually made up some ground in the last month. Since a
35th-place outing at Dover on June 6 dropped him to 31st in points,
Irvan has had three top-10 finishes in the last four races. He
finished ninth at Daytona, after starting 32nd. Irvan was seventh
at Michigan on June 13, then finished eighth at Pocono and 30th at
Sears Point. He has climbed nine spots to No. 22 in points during
that streak, trailing 15th-place Ken Schrader by only 250.
</P>
<P>
   WHO'S NOT?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe professional wrestler Bill Goldberg should stay away from
other sporting events. Two years ago, he gave the University of
Georgia football team a pep talk in Jacksonville, and the Dogs got
waxed by archrival Florida. Last weekend, Goldberg's face was on
the hood of Jerry Nadeau's No. 9 Ford, and Nadeau finished 37th.
There's probably not a Goldberg hex or anything, though. Nadeau was
slumping long before his paint scheme included Goldberg's bald
head. Nadeau hasn't finished higher than 20th in his last eight
starts, and his average finish in the last five was 30th. In the
last four events, he's fallen from 27th to 32nd in points.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   2: The number of Winston Cup points championships won by drivers
of Ford race cars in the modern era (1972-present). They were
Elliott in 1988 and the late Alan Kulwicki in 1992. Jarrett has
positioned himself to become the third with a 177-point lead at the
midway point in the season. ``I think it's surprising,'' Jarrett
said. ``It's surprising that it hasn't happened more with all of
the good Ford teams we've had over the years. Hopefully, that's
something that's gonna change this year.''
</P>
<P>
   TONY THE TIGER
</P>
<P>
   A big reason for Pontiac's resurgence this season is rookie Tony
Stewart. After 17 races, Stewart has four top-five and nine top-10
finishes, ranks sixth in the point standings and has no DNFs. At
the same point in his rookie season in 1993, Jeff Gordon had five
top-five and eight top-10 finishes, as well as five DNFs. Gordon
didn't win in his first Winston Cup season, and neither has
Stewart. ``I don't know _ if it happens it happens, and if it
doesn't it doesn't,'' Stewart said. ``I've got my own goals I set
each week, and that's what I'm focusing on. I hear the same things
you're probably hearing, too, but who knows what is going to
happen? If I knew what the future was, I'd probably be doing
something other than driving race cars, because I'd be making a lot
of money if I could predict what was in my future.

 &HT;    Martin undergoes surgery
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   WINSTON CUP
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup driver Mark Martin, who underwent surgery Wednesday
to repair a broken tibia plateau in his left knee, isn't expected
to miss any time behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, third in points and 234 behind leader Dale Jarrett, was
hurt in an accident during practice at Daytona International
Speedway on July 2. The fracture was identified during an MRI exam
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Chuck Kollmer performed arthroscopic surgery in New Smyrna
Beach, Fla., inserting a screw to hold the tibia in place. Martin,
40, will continue to wear a leg brace, which will allow him to
drive in Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300at New Hampshire International
Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Kollmer assured me that I will be able to drive this
weekend,'' Martin said. ``I'll go back to see him Monday after the
race to evaluate how long I should wear the brace. Once I get this
taken care of I should be much better since my wrist and ribs are
already feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, perhaps NASCAR's most well-conditioned driver, wore a
hard cast on his left wrist in last week's Pepsi 400. He completed
all 160 laps, despite telling his crew early in the race that they
were ``dealing with a one-armed driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch Grand National driver Matt Kenseth, who is expected to
drive a Cup car owned by Martin next year, will be standing by if
Martin needs to come out of his No. 6 Ford on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pulling a fast one
</P>
<P>
   Scott Eggleston, crew chief for Sterling Marlin's No. 40 Chevy,
was not surprised by the $50,000 fine levied by NASCAR for rules
violations found before last week's race. Eggleston also was placed
on probation until Oct. 20.
</P>
<P>
   In pre-race inspection on Saturday, NASCAR officials found an
illegal insert in the intake manifold on Marlin's engine. The
inserts are not allowed on Winston Cup cars at Daytona and
Talladega, where NASCAR requires restrictor plates to slow speeds
on the superspeedways.
</P>
<P>
   Eggleston removed the insert before the Pepsi 400, so Marlin's
12th-place finish stands. The explanation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you try to get some things by,'' Marlin said.
``Everybody tries it. You're going to try something. . . . We'll
just have to take our lumps and go on. They've got `em before, and
they'll catch `em later on. ``You just try to get a little
advantage. Sometimes you get by, and sometimes you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSCH
</P>
<P>
   Krogh remains critical after crash
</P>
<P>
   Busch Grand National driver Jeff Krogh of Kamiah, Idaho, remains
in critical but stable condition at Froedtert Memorial Lutheran
Hospital in Milwaukee after suffering injuries in a wreck during
the final practice before last week's DieHard 250 at the Milwaukee
Mile.
</P>
<P>
   Krogh remains unconscious, but doctors reported no visible signs
of trauma or fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Krogh, 27, crashed his No. 56 Chevy in turn 1 of the one-mile
fairgrounds oval midway through Saturday's practice. It was his
second accident of the day, after he also crashed on the second lap
of his qualifying attempt. Krogh, 33rd in driver points, made the
field using a car owner's provisional. Krogh's parents, Molly and
Bob, and his brother Mark, 24, a third-year Busch driver, were at
the track in West Allis, Wis. His wife, Karla, was flown to
Wisconsin from North Carolina after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   AllCar set to return
</P>
<P>
   AllCar Motorsports, which fields the No. 22 Chevy on the Busch
circuit, remains on target to return at Michigan Speedway in
August.
</P>
<P>
   AllCar, which has former driver Bobby Allison as a consultant,
will test at Michigan the first week of August with at least two,
and perhaps, three cars, owner Dave Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Grissom, the Winston Cup driver who has been assisting the
team the past two months, will drive during the team's test.
</P>
<P>
   ``This break is something we needed to get everything in
order,'' Carroll said. ``It has given us a chance to catch our
breaths and to get our cars and our shop the way it needs to be. We
gaveourselves a pretty tough timetable at the beginning, forming
the team in December and then racing in February. This break is

short-track specialist Jimmy Kitchens opened the season as AllCar's

 &HT;    Sadler's up and running
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ NASCAR driver Elliott Sadler hasn't shown much
consistency in his first season on the Winston Cup circuit, but the
rookie has shown vast improvement in one important area _ avoiding
wrecks.
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, 24, of Emporia, Va., didn't finish his first two races
in the No. 21 Ford of Wood Brothers Racing. In the season-opening
Daytona 500 on Feb. 14, Sadler completed only 132 of 200 laps
before wrecking and finishing 40th. The following week at
Rockingham, N.C., he ran only 361 of 393 laps and finished 38th.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking those two cars back to Virginia in pieces, however,
Sadler has managed to be running at the end of the 15 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pretty hard,'' Sadler said. ``These veterans are
pretty good. Every race track we go to, you've got to go loaded for
bear.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler had two full seasons on the Busch Grand National circuit
before jumping to Winston Cup this year. Last season, he finished
eighth in points, with two victories and 10 top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Tony Stewart, who had nine fewer Busch starts last
year because of his Indy Racing League commitments, was 22nd in
points and didn't win a race.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, Stewart is the biggest surprise in Winston
Cup, with four top-fives and nine top-10s at the midway point of
the season. Sadler is 31st in points and has only one top-10 in 17
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably had the better end of the deal, in all honesty,
compared to the other rookies this season,'' Stewart said. ``I've
stepped into an established team that finished in the top 10 in
points the last two years. I have a teammate (Bobby Labonte) to
reflect off of, and (rookies Buckshot Jones and Sadler) don't have
a teammate to go to during practice and say, `My car feels like
this or that. Does your car do the same thing?'''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler stepped into a struggling team _ the famed Wood Brothers
of Stuart, Va., who have won 96 races since 1960, but none in the
past six seasons. Morgan Sheppard was the last driver to win in a
car owned by the Wood Brothers, in Atlanta in March 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Wood Brothers, who parted ways with driver Michael Waltrip
last year after three seasons, haven't won in their last 200
starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've thrown a lot of new things at the Wood Brothers this
year, with a new crew chief coming in, a new driver and a new
engineer,'' Sadler said. ``We had to go through those learning
stages at the beginning of the year, but we feel like were getting
things settled down now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler's most consistent run this season has come during the
last month. In the last three races, he hasn't finished lower than
22nd. Since a 29th-place finish in the DieHard 500 at Talladega
Superspeedway on April 25, he climbed from 38th to 31st in points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has really come around,'' he said. ``We got ourselves
in a lot of trouble at the beginning of the year, getting in wrecks
and getting in situations we didn't need to be in. The last six
races, we've accumulated a total of points that would be 20th over
that stretch, so we feel like we're making improvements and going
in the right direction. We're learning each and every week, and I'm
feeling more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler faces a tough four-race stretch, beginning with Sunday's
Jiffy Lube 300. In the next four events, he'll have to race at New
Hampshire, Indianapolis and Watkins Glen, N.Y., tracks he hasn't
driven this season. The other stop is Pocono Raceway in Long Pond,
Pa., where he needed a provisional to make the field for the Pocono
500 last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the tracks we've been to are tracks I've never seen
before, and we've struggled a little bit,'' Sadler said. ``But we
knew we were going to struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   In 11 of the last 13 races this year, however, Sadler will
return to tracks for a second time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe then, we'll race a little harder and go a little more in
the right direction and maybe be a little more aggressive on our
setups on the car,'' he said. ``Then I think you're gonna start
seeing us better each and every week. These guys are the best of
the best, but we feel like we're gonna have something for 'em
before this season is over with.

<TEXT>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., expects to withdraw
his appointment Friday of a prominent American Muslim leader to a
congressional counter-terrorism commission after sharp criticism
from Jewish organizations, a spokesman for Gephardt said late
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The appointment of Salam Al-Marayati to the National Commission
on Terrorism in June had been denounced by some Jewish
organizations that accused him of condoning terrorism against
Israel. But other political and religious leaders, many of them
Jewish, who have worked with Al-Marayati had begun speaking out in
his defense, praising him as a responsible moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's spokeswoman, Susan Harvey, said Al-Marayati was told
late Thursday that the nomination was in jeopardy because the
process of gaining a security clearance would take longer than the
six-month life of the counter-terrorism commission itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not withdrawing,'' Al-Marayati said Thursday. ``I think
that if there is a political will, there is a way to expedite these
security clearances and get down to the business of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati, who is 38, says he has lived in the United States
since his family fled political persecution in Iraq when he was 4
years old. As executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs
Council in Los Angeles, Al-Marayati has visited the White House
several times for Muslim holidays and twice to witness the signing
of Middle East peace agreements. He was nominated by Mayor Richard
Riordan of Los Angeles to serve on that city's Human Relations
Commission, which he has done for more than a year. And his wife,
Dr. Laila Al-Marayati, was appointed by the White House to the U.S.
Commission on International Religious Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati's appointment to the National Commission on
Terrorism had been cheered by Muslim-American groups and leaders,
who have long sought a voice in American public policy. These
groups had previously expressed concerns that aggressive new
anti-terrorism efforts could unfairly target Muslim- and
Arab-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The nine other members of the commission, which is charged with
reviewing policies on the prevention and punishment of acts of
terrorism against the United States, include Paul Bremer, former
ambassador for counter-terrorism; R. James Woolsey, former director
of the CIA, and Gen. Wayne Downing, commander in chief for special
operations and director of the Khobar Towers terrorist attack
review.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt's choice of Al-Marayati immediately came under
attack by groups like the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations, which represents 55 member groups,
the Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They point to excerpts of statements made by Al-Marayati, his
organization, his magazine or his co-workers that are critical of
Israel and appear to blame the Israeli government for provoking
Palestinian anger and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Among the quotations cited by the Jewish groups was this from a
March 1997 press release from the Muslim Public Affairs Council:
``Because the Palestinian people have no avenues to redress their
grievances, some of them have been pushed beyond the margins of
society and have adopted violent reactions to express their despair
and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   And this from an editorial in the magazine The Minaret, where
Al-Marayati serves on the editorial board: ``The supporters of
Israel have created a quiet reign of terror in the U.S. People
cannot speak loudly against the apartheid policies of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Gephardt, the Jewish groups accused Al-Marayati of
failing to denounce Hamas and Hezbollah, of criticizing the recent
American bombing raids on Sudan and Afghanistan, of supporting
Saddam Hussein and of failing to support the peace agreements with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is somebody who has been associated with and who has
directly and indirectly defended organizations like Hamas and
Hezbollah,'' said Malcolm Hoenlein, executive director of the
Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations.
``To be frank, this is somebody people do not trust. And in his
presence it will cause people to be hesitant about what they will
say and to be free with information that will be essential to the
committee's work.''
</P>
<P>
   Morton Klein, national president of the Zionist Organization of
America, said: ``Salam Al-Marayati has justified Arab terrorism
against Israel. He's justified future terrorism against America.
He's compared America's behavior to Saddam Hussein's behavior. He's
compared Islamic terrorists to the American soldiers of the
American revolution.''

JOHNSON WILL SHUFFLE UNTIL DODGERS IMPROVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson isn't used to losing, and
when his teams don't win, he refuses to remain idle and hope for
better fortune. His idea is to initiate improvement, which is what
he has been doing.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White was given Thursday off against the Rockies to give
sparkplug Trenidad Hubbard another start. Raul Mondesi and Eric
Karros also rested for a day during the four-game series with the
Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   The trend will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a painful time for all of us,'' Johnson said. ``I'm
not going to sit around. My motto is, `If you're going to get beat,
get beat making a change.' I'll go with the obvious, the regulars,
whatever. But if I keep getting hammered, I'm going to make a
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi is never happy when he's healthy and his name isn't in
the lineup. He arrived for Wednesday's game to find out he was
sitting. His body language told what he thought of it.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, throughout his career, has never liked sitting out a
game. But the Dodgers' futile offense has kept Johnson awake at
nights and flipping through lineup combinations through his days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to get beat, I'll get beat with a different look,
with younger players,'' Johnson said. ``I'll look for something
that might work next year, next week. I'll dream up options. Wait
until you see my lineup tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he wasn't talking about younger players in the
system but rather the Dodgers' bench players. He said he'll
probably start the lefty-hitting Craig Counsell tonight against
Seattle to keep the mix going.
</P>
<P>
   __ Liking the altitude: Karros' second-inning homer was his 14th
career homer at Coors Field, the most by any opposing player. The
Cubs' Sammy Sosa is second with 13. Karros added a ninth-inning
solo shot, his second two-homer game this season. It's the 12th
time he's done it in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great place to hit,'' Karros said. ``Not just for
home runs but to hit because the outfield is so big. The key here
is not to strike out. If you don't do that, you're going to be in
business.''
</P>
<P>
   In 26 games at Coors Field, Karros is hitting .360 with 36 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   __ Brown returns home early: Kevin Brown threw his off-day
bullpen pitches early Thursday and then returned to Los Angeles to
tend to a personal matters for a day. He will be in uniform tonight
and is scheduled to pitch Saturday against the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   __ Balks, walks and chalk: The Rockies are interested in
free-agent first baseman Juan Carlos Diaz, one of the two Cuban
defectors (the other is Josue Perez) declared free agents by the
commissioner's office after complaining the Dodgers illegally
signed them. Both were playing in the Dodgers' minor-league system
but have been inactive for nearly two weeks. Neither player has
signed with another team. . . . Johnson said right-hander Antonio
Osuna (elbow) will make three or four more rehab appearances for
Single-A San Bernardino before being activated after the All-Star
break. . . . Colorado's Larry Walker's solo homer in the first was
the 250th of his career. . . . The first inning, which had a
combined seven runs, seven hits and three walks, took 41 minutes.
When the Dodgers batted around in the inning, it was the first time
they accomplished it since June 19.

ISRAELI CHIEF BEGINS QUEST AS SQUABBLES RISE AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Ehud Barak, Israel's new prime minister, prepared
Thursday to fly off to Egypt on the first leg of an ambitious
mission to make regional peace, he was facing down a Welcome Wagon
of political squabbles on the home front.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a trip Friday to see President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt, Barak confronted opposition to his first domestic political
initiative, grumbling within his own party and a splintering of the
Russian immigrant party, which slightly altered the carefully
equilibrated dynamic of his coalition.
</P>
<P>
   For a volatile democracy like Israel's, such troubles are
nothing extraordinary, but they nonetheless served as a quick
reminder to Barak that political static is the background noise of
many grand projects. His first domestic political initiative, a
bill to expand the number of ministers in his cabinet, is
confronting a raft of opposition, and not only from the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the expected criticism from the conservative
Likud Party, Barak's proposal has been condemned by three key
figures in his One Israel/Labor Party: his new justice minister,
Yossi Beilin; former Prime Minister Shimon Peres, and the new
speaker of the House, Avraham Burg. Newspaper editorials have
railed against it, too.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said that he needs 24 ministers in his cabinet, and
not the 18 allowed by the basic laws of Israel, because of the
demands for representation from his unusually broad coalition of
seven parties. The coalition represents almost two-thirds of the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the expansion see the additional ministries as
an expensive bloating of the government in order to mete out favors
to Barak's new coalition partners. And some _ like Beilin, who said
he would vote against the bill in the cabinet to make his point _
oppose amending the basic laws that represent the building blocks
for an Israeli Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Burg, who in a minor party revolt won the role of speaker over
the hand-picked candidate of Barak, said he would not make it easy
for the legislation to pass quickly through the parliament. It is a
sign of the adversarial role that Burg is likely to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not let anyone carry out hasty legislation, certainly
not in matters pertaining to the basic laws,'' he said. ``This is
the holy of holies in legislation. If they want to change a basic
law, it must be done with reverence, slowly, one step at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Barak, Haim Ramon, a special minister in the prime
minister's office, said that the government faced a difficult
choice between ``undermining a basic law and forming a government
equipped to deal with the hard tasks ahead of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is expected to pass, with smirks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As that debate raged, a power struggle within the principal
Russian immigrants' party has renewed the coalition's closed debate
about who should get what.
</P>
<P>
   Yisrael Baaliya, the party led by Natan Sharansky, lost two of
its six members on Tuesday. The two, Roman Bronfman and Alexander
Tzinker, quit to form their own tiny faction, citing ideological
differences over ``state and religion'' with Sharansky, who is more
right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Bronfman, who said he represented secular Russians, has called
the Russian leader a ``megalomaniac.'' Sharansky accused Bronfman
of ``treason'' and of stealing votes. The split has dealt Sharansky
a serious blow.
</P>
<P>
   It also introduced some disarray into the carefully negotiated
coalition, since Yisrael Baaliya became a very small party
overnight, but still holds considerable power. In addition to the
Interior Ministry, which Sharansky will run, the party was set to
control the Immigration Ministry, with Yuli Edelstein at the helm.
And Edelstein was expected to join the expanded cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, an ultra-Orthodox party that lost the Interior Ministry,
immediately began to complain. One Israel officials said that the
deal to give Edelstein a ministry would likely be broken so as not
to lead to an unraveling of the whole coalition package, which,
negotiated over seven weeks, was calibrated on the basis of the
number of party seats in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Barak faced down some continuing discontent within his
party about the cabinet appointments he made. Many said they
believed his choices for key ministries were uninspired, and that
the cabinet did not represent the change he promised during his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On the larger level, Barak got off to such a quick start on the
peace effort that many Israelis felt excited, as if they were on
the brink of seeing a breakthrough after years of stagnation. But
it quickly seemed clear that the body politic would make sure that
nothing happened without a keen battle of wits, egos and ideologies
as a backdrop.

GIFFORD TO GAIN KINGLY BUNDLE AFTER MERGER WITH FLEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He is the heir apparent, yet he will be compensated as
if he already sits on the throne.
</P>
<P>
   Charles K. Gifford, head of BankBoston Corp., has wrangled a
rich compensation package out of his future employer, Fleet
Financial Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement, which includes lucrative stock options, a hefty
salary, and a ``golden parachute'' if Gifford is fired, reflects
the rich bounty that bank executives now reap when they sell their
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But the package, detailed in a Fleet document filed Thursday
with securities regulators, may also reflect uncertainty over
Gifford's future at the combined Fleet-BankBoston, which could one
day become a takeover target for other banks seeking to expand into
New England.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford's new employment contract spans what banking lawyers and
compensation specialists said was a relatively short three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer the contract, the more protection the executive
has'' at the new company, said a banking lawyer who asked not to be
named. Still, the lawyer said the contract's generous terms were a
sign that Gifford's future at the new bank was secure.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston agreed in March to be acquired by its former rival
Fleet, in a $16 billion deal that will form New England's largest
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford is the number two at the new company, temporarily known
as Fleet Boston Corp., until Murray, 59, retires as chief executive
at the end of 2001. Then Gifford takes the top job. He assumes the
additional title of chairman a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Under his contract, Gifford will earn a salary equal to that of
Fleet's chief executive, Terrence Murray. Last year, Murray earned
a base salary of $992,000 and a $3.4 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford will also get 300,000 shares of restricted stock when
the Fleet-BankBoston merger closes later this year. At Fleet's
closing price Thursday of around $44, the shares would be worth
$13.2 million. Gifford plans to donate 75,000 of those shares,
worth about $3.3 million, to charity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gifford has the right to buy 900,000 stock options
over two years. According to a rule of thumb that says one option
is worth approximately one-third of a share, that lot would be
worth around $13.1 million today.
</P>
<P>
   The shares and options are tied to the new company's future
performance, and Gifford won't be able to exercise them all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Upon retirement, 56-year-old Gifford, who has been at BankBoston
for 32 years, will get $1.25 million a year for life. His wife
would get 75 percent of that sum after his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they're paying him as if he were the CEO,'' said
Alan M. Johnson, managing director of Johnson Associates, a New
York-based executive compensation consulting firm. ``It's an
expensive deal for the shareholders, but it reflects his prominent
position in the new company.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford has also negotiated a lucrative package worth up to $15
million if he is forced out of the new bank. Fleet will amend its
charter to require a 75 percent majority vote by the new company's
22-member board to remove Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   The two banks also shelled out hefty sums to the New York
investment banks that put together their deal.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston's advisers, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, will each get $20 million. Fleet's advisers, Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette and Goldman Sachs, will each get $15 million. The
fees are comparable to payments made in other major bank mergers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of BankBoston's 23,000 employees are also reaping a
miniwindfall from the merger, since a lucrative employee stock
option plan is now coming due.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston have the right to cancel their deal if it
is not completed by March 14, 2000. Both banks expect regulatory
approval for their merger later this year, with a deal formally
sealed in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   New England's two largest banks have also reserved the right to
renegotiate their deal should shareholders not approve it at
company meetings on Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet is swapping 1.1844 Fleet shares for each BankBoston share.
Fleet's offer valued BankBoston at around $53 per share when the
deal was announced _ a 13 percent premium to BankBoston's price of
nearly $47. Since then, BankBoston shares have risen about 11
percent, and now trade at just over $50.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet's proxy confirmed that the new company expects to
eliminate 5,000 positions, or more than 8 percent of its combined
work force. It also reiterated that the combined bank expects
after-tax cost savings of $360 million a year, with 60 percent
achieved in 2000 and 100 percent in 2001.

<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. _ After the first two mathes Thursday,
it was starting to look bad for the eight seeded players in the
USTA men's 45-and-over hardcourt tennis championships.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-seeded Phillip Kadesch and eighth-seeded Larry Belinsky
were eliminated in two of the morning matches at the Westlake
Tennis and Swim Club, but fortunately for the favored, the upsets
stopped there. The remaining six seeds all won their round-of-16
matches to advance to today's quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The top seed, Gene Malin of Woodland Hills, continued his run
through the tournament with a 6-2, 6-3 victory over Kurt Nielsen of
Porterville.
</P>
<P>
   Malin advances to face Pete Kelly of Palm Springs, one of
Thursday's two upset winners, who knocked off Belinsky 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The other unseeded winner, Tom Lightvoet of Costa Mesa, earned a
6-3, 6-4 victory over Kadesch of North Easton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Third-seeded Wesley Jackson of Albuquerque, N.M., had little
trouble in a 6-2, 6-0 victory over Chris Robb.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining four seeds each faced a challenge in the afternoon
matches, but each survived with three-set victories.
</P>
<P>
   Second-seeded Wendell Pierce of Oakland, who had dropped only
two games in his round-of-32 victory on Wednesday, fell behind but
rallied against Skip Walther of Columbia, Mo., to win 3-6, 6-2,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   A little rest wasn't enough help for Andrew Stanley of
Camarillo. On Wednesday, Stanley's opponent and friend, Jurgen
Janson, retired rather than play a third set against Stanley,
saying he wanted to allow his friend to rest for his round-of-16
match against Peter Bronson.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth-seeded Bronson, of Scottsdale, Ariz., defeated Stanley
6-2, 3-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   In the longest match of the day, fourth-seeded Gewan Maharaj of
Tampa, Fla., had the endurance to outlast Tom Jaklitsch of Islip,
N.Y., 7-6 (10-8), 4-6, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-seeded Bob Wright of Temecula got an early scare but
rallied to beat Rich Causey of Atlanta, 3-6, 6-4, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   In today's quarterfinals at 11 a.m., Malin will face Kelly and
Jackson will take on Lightvoet. In the 12:30 p.m. matches, Bronson
takes on Maharaj and Wright faces Pierce.

CLINTON URGES INVESTMENT TO HELP YOUTH LEARN ECONOMIC SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ President Clinton Thursday wrapped up a
cross-country tour of economically distressed areas by calling for
greater investment in disadvantaged youths, saying it was in the
best interest of ``people who live in the ritziest suburb in
America'' for them to have the skills to function in the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   After a four-day trip that took him from the Appalachia hollows
to the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to the Mississippi Delta, the
president visited Watts and South Central Los Angeles. Both are
inner-city neighborhoods of high unemployment where riots have
broken out in the past 30 years and where complaints of economic
isolation have long resonated.
</P>
<P>
   Joined by former basketball star Magic Johnson at Southwest
College in South Central, Clinton said expanding opportunities for
disadvantaged youth was not only integral to the economic
development of poor communities but also a benefit to wealthier
areas because it would help keep the economy going.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest way to keep it going is to go to places where
there aren't enough jobs and there aren't enough consumers and
create more of both...That's all growth completely without
inflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we hire a young person off the street in Watts and
give him or her a better future, we are helping people who live in
the ritziest suburb in America to continue to enjoy a rising stock
market,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the college to about 175 business and union leaders,
and five students clad in black t-shirts that read ``Yo,'' Clinton
added, ``Those of you who follow the business news know that every
time the Federal Reserve meets there's all this tense speculation,
will they raise interest rates or not? Well, what does that mean to
these young people here with their Yo shirts on?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said 60 percent of the young people who live in
distressed areas of the United States are neither in jobs nor in
school. And, according to figures provided by the White House, more
than 10 million youths age 16 to 24 are out of school and have only
a high school diploma or less; four million have less than a high
school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a former Los Angeles Lakers player who has revitalized
South Central Los Angeles and other inner cities with multiplex
movie theaters, said young people want the dignity that holding a
job can bring. ``They are hungry to work, they just want to do it
in their own communities sometimes.'' he said,``That's what I am
trying to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In his trip to Watts, Clinton toured a transportation technology
program at Locke High School, where he watched students using
computers to demonstrate, for example, the affects of aerodynamics
on the performance of a car. More than 90 percent of the students
who complete the program go on to college.
</P>
<P>
   He later traveled to nearby Anaheim for a speech to the National
Academy Foundation, a nonprofit group that provides education and
training for youths to prepare them for careers in finance, travel
and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   To coincide with that appearance, the White House announced a
program to be started by Lucent Technologies and other companies to
prepare public school students for careers in information
technology fields and address the nation's shortage of technology
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Academy of Information Technlogy, the $8 million
program comes on the heels of a recent report by the Commerce
Department's Office of Technology Policy, which projects that from
1996 to 2006, the United States will require more than 1.3 million
new highly skilled information technology workers ranging from
computer scientists and engineers to systems analysts and
programmers.
</P>
<P>
   In the closing speech of his anti-poverty tour, Clinton
reflected back on some of the people he met, and said that he would
send to Congress next week his proposed ``new markets''
legislation. The plan uses tax credits and other incentives to
encourage $15 billion in new investments in economically depressed
rural and urban areas over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said he plans to take another poverty tour next
fall that will start in Newark, N.J., to challenge the owners of
professional sports teams and professional athletes to invest in
their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I want to say to you is this: This tour, this
last four days that we have all spent together, has been a
significant step toward opening America's new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it can't be the end of the journey. It has to be, instead,
the opening salvo of a battle to build a real economy in every
community in this country. The real measure of our success is not
whether CEOs join the president on a trip like this which moved the
nation, but whether the same CEOs and others will return to those
markets and move the lives of the people there.''

IN NEW YORK, POWER SYSTEMS REACHING THEIR LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Md., Mass., Maine, Va., Ore., Calif., Fla.)  (jw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The blackout that stilled upper Manhattan for
nearly a day was a sort of distress call, a warning that as the
demand for electricity sets new records, the power system in the
New York metropolitan area is surging perilously close to its
physical limits, experts in the field cautioned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Power demand is rising faster than the system's ability to
generate and deliver it, driven by a booming economy and the
proliferation of computers, fax machines, air conditioners and the
other amenities of an affluent, wired society. The more power is
pushed through the cables, the greater the likelihood that some of
those cables will fail, a lesson reinforced in dramatic fashion
Tuesday, when demand set records and power went out not just in
Washington Heights and parts of the Lower East Side and Long
Island, but in communities from Maryland to Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But the greater danger posed by the increasing use of
electricity is one that is not directly related to Tuesday's
blackout. The New York metropolitan area, more than any other part
of the country, runs the risk that in the near future it simply
will not be able to import, generate or deliver enough power to
keep up with demand.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Power Pool, a consortium of the state's utilities,
requires that each of its members be able to deliver at least 18
percent more power than customers are using at peak periods, and
pools around the country have similar standards. On Tuesday, for
the first time, Consolidated Edison, serving New York City and
Westchester County, fell to an 18 percent margin. The Long Island
Power Authority had just a 10 percent cushion, and Public Service
Electric &AMP; Gas in New Jersey came within 5 percent of its capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The capacity problem in New York City isn't critical today,
but it could be critical in a couple of years,'' said William
Balet, executive director of the New York Power Pool. ``And Long
Island is in worse shape than New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, utilities from Maine to Virginia cut the voltage
they supplied to customers by 5 percent because their three
regional power pools were approaching their capacity limits.
</P>
<P>
   Public Service shut off air conditioning to 145,000 homes whose
residents had signed up to sacrifice their cool air in case of an
emergency in return for lower rates. The Long Island authority
persuaded local governments to shut down for the day. In both
cases, officials said, those measures were all that prevented
rolling blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are approaching the point where more generation is needed
in New York City to reliably supply demands in the future,'' said
Louis Rana, vice president of Con Edison for system and
transmission operations. Asked if the system had approached a
crisis on Tuesday, he said, ``I would say yes, we were close.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not unique to the Northeast, though it is more
pressing here than in most of the country. In 1996, with demand
straining the capacity to deliver electricity in the Northwest, the
failure of a couple of transmission lines in Oregon shut power to
parts of nine states. And last summer, utilities across the Midwest
lowered everyone's voltage, pleaded with customers to turn off
their appliances, and persuaded some industries to shut down,
because demand was pushing limits, threatening another vast
blackout.
</P>
<P>
   New York City and Long Island have an added problem: The ability
to deliver power from outside the region is severely constrained
simply because the lines to carry it are few. Transmission lines
from other places represent only about one-quarter of the region's
capacity to deliver electricity; the rest is generated locally.
That means that at times of peak demand, if a problem occurred with
the local power plants or the transmission system, the region would
not be able to rely on outside help to avoid blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   A few other population centers, like San Francisco, South
Florida and parts of New England, have similar limitations _ and
contributed to the failure that blacked out most of San Francisco
in December _ but none are as extreme as the New York metropolitan
area's.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison has one of the lowest rates of power failure in the
industry, and by far the lowest of any New York State utility. In
power failures that struck the region in 1996 and 1997 _ one caused
by a failed transmission line, the other by thunderstorms _ only
Con Edison's customers were unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   But as demand continues to rise, ``the risk of events like
Washington Heights, and of even bigger, systemwide failures, just
increases,'' said Ashok Gupta, an economist with the Natural
Resources Defense Council who specializes in energy issues.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kessel, chairman of the Long Island Power Authority,
urged immediate action. ``I think that this heat wave should sober
all of us up to recognize that we have a really big problem, and we
need to plan for the future right now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Con Edison set a demand record of 10,700 megawatts in July
1991, it had a margin of more than 30 percent between that peak and
its overall capacity of 14,000 megawatts. That record stood for six
years, until an 11,013-megawatt day in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In planning for this summer, the utility anticipated peak demand
of 11,650 megawatts. Instead, it hit 11,850 on Tuesday, smashing
the old record by almost 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On Long Island, in a system with a capacity of 5,100 megawatts,
the Power Authority delivered as much as 4,590 on Tuesday, 9
percent above the record set in July 1998. And Public Service in
New Jersey hit a peak demand of 9,794 megawatts on Tuesday, close
to its 10,272-megawatt capacity, and almost 3 percent higher than
the record set in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Energy experts say some combination is needed of four solutions:
construction of new power plants to keep up with demand that is
rising 2 to 3 percent a year nationally; construction of new
transmission lines to bring power into the metropolitan area; more
aggressive energy conservation programs; and the upgrading of the
local lines that deliver electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Power failures have long been a feature of heat waves _ in 1993,
a large segment of Brooklyn went dark, and in 1996 it happened in
Queens _ because the ``feeder cables'' that supply communities
become overheated as more energy is pushed through them and the
ground around them becomes hotter. In many cases, the cables were
installed a generation or two ago, for a less demanding market. It
was an overload and subsequent fire in feeder cables that forced
Con Edison to cut power to Washington Heights on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more you have 10,000-, 11,000-megawatt days, the more
you're going to have problems like this,'' said Larry Shapiro, a
staff attorney for the New York Public Interest Research Group who
follows energy policy.
</P>
<P>
   Con Edison officials say that the company is installing new
cables with greater capacity and better insulation but that it will
take years to replace them all.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kelley, spokesman for Edison International, the parent
company of Southern California Edison, said, ``I think every major
utility in the country, including ours, is upgrading the
transmission and distribution infrastructure and investing a lot of
money to keep up with increasing demand.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a generation, companies are seeking to
build new power plants in New York, to take advantage of new
competition. New York, like several other states, is deregulating
the industry, abolishing the old utility monopolies and allowing
power suppliers to compete for customers. Among the proposals is
one for a plan on a barge moored off Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But completion of any of those plants is years away, and for
now, the projects are tied up in a squabble in Albany among state
lawmakers over how to draft a law on granting permits for new
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Rana, of Con Edison, said the utility was not considering
building new transmission lines to import power from outside the
region. New York, unlike many other cities, generates most of its
power in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Long Island officials are looking into installing a major
transmission line across the bottom of Long Island Sound to bring
in power. Long Island is more isolated from the larger grid than
any other heavily populated part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can deliver 5,100 megawatts, but on a hot day, we can't get
5,100 megawatts to deliver,'' said Kessel, of the power authority.
``We normally buy some power from Con Ed, but on Tuesday, they
couldn't spare it. We nearly had a big, big problem.''

ON GORE CAMPAIGN, TWO ANTAGONISTS MUST NOW COOPERATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: More to be filed by 9:30 p.m. ET) 
mk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bob Squier is more than just another consultant to
Al Gore. He has worked for Gore since the early '80s and is among
his half-dozen closest friends and advisers. Funny and smooth,
squier relaxes the vice president, frequently travels with him and
is typically the last person he sees before a debate or an
important speech.
</P>
<P>
   So it looked like a sure sign of panic last week when the Gore
presidential campaign hired Carter Eskew, Squier's former business
partner and protege, to whom he has not spoken in the seven years
since their bitter and public breakup. Eskew has also had minimal
contact with the vice president in recent years, especially since
he began representing tobacco companies, which Gore crusades
against and blames for the lung cancer that killed his sister.
</P>
<P>
   With the American Lung Association calling for Eskew's firing
before he has even gone to work _ and Republicans openly drooling
over the whole soap opera _ the campaign insists that the move was
simply part of a long-term strategy of building the strongest
possible team, one that would put personal differences aside for
the greater good of moving Al Gore into the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   But separate interviews with Squier and Eskew cast serious doubt
on whether that will be possible. Over a lunch of nearly three
hours at his farm in Virginia, Squier did not even try to put a
happy face on recent events and had almost nothing good to say
about the man many people see as his replacement as the Gore
``message guru.'' (So far, most of the press Gore has received on
the stump could run under the headline ``Stiff Guy Still Stiff.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I had six calls from the campaign this morning about this
lunch, telling me what to say,'' Squier said by way of a greeting.
``I told them I'd say what I want and we'll explain it later.''
When asked how he and Eskew could work together, he sighed deeply
and said, ``I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Public feuding among top aides in a presidential campaign, while
never a good sign, is highly unusual at so early a moment. Though
Gore's nomination once looked inevitable, he has taken a couple of
early hits, one from President Clinton, who publicly urged the
candidate to loosen up. Just two months ago, amid concerns that his
campaign lacked direction, Gore enlisted Tony Coelho, the former
congressman from California, as a top strategist. Now Coelho's
efforts to correct the problems seem only to have compounded the
sense that the campaign is in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore communications team is still not communicating: Gore
did not deliver the news to Squier himself, and almost a week later
has still not spoken to him about it. Eskew and Squier have not
spoken at all. (Why not? ``He called me, but I haven't called him
back,'' Squier said. ``Maybe if I didn't have to speak to The New
York Times. Not that I wouldn't rather talk to you. And you won't
take that as a compliment, I hope.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is asking for trouble bringing in two people who hate
each other,'' said Dick Morris, who has generally been a fan of
Gore and, as chief strategist to the 1996 Clinton campaign, brought
Squier in as an adviser. ``It's like asking the Albanians and the
Serbs to work together on your campaign. I have high regard for
Carter, but I didn't bring him in in '96 because I wasn't about to
start a civil war. He's making all the wrong moves at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Why had he and Eskew fallen out in the first place? ``I've never
said because it would be harmful to Gore if I did. It was deeply
unprofessional behavior'' on Eskew's part, he said. Later, Squier
called back to clarify that the dispute at the time Eskew left
their firm after the '92 election was over money and had nothing to
do with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Eskew, whose own view of the squabble was that Squier had been
deeply hurt by the abrupt way he had left his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grown now, I don't need a family anymore,'' he said. No
more complicated feelings? ``I don't feel it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who believe the hiring was a smart one, reuniting
Gore and a strategist so brilliant that personal considerations
should be disregarded, the timing seemed reactive, coming the day
after the news that both of Gore's leading competitors, Democratic
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and George W. Bush, the
Republican governor of Texas, had raised surprising amounts of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Both Squier, 64, and Eskew, 44, have stellar track records as
consultants and ad makers. Mandy Grundwald, who briefly formed a
company with Eskew after the '92 election, described her former
partner as ``part of the new generation'' who had simply outgrown
his mentor. ``In '92 Bob traveled with Gore. Carter was the
creative genius,'' she said. ``I'm just surprised they were smart
enough to ask him'' to join the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Squier's many friends said the suggestion that he was past
his prime as a strategist was unfair. One of them added, ``This is
not a problem that can be solved with ads.''
</P>
<P>
   And Eskew's sudden return to Gore's inner circle made even some
allies question the vice president's personal loyalty, so
frequently cited as Gore defended the president throughout the
Lewinsky scandal. Squier defended the vice president, but said he
had gotten so many condolence calls it was ``a little like
attending your own funeral.''

RODHAM CLINTON SAYS JERUSALEM SHOULD BE ISRAELI CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UTICA, N.Y. - In a move that could boost her chances to be
elected Senator from New York, Hillary Rodham Clinton has told a
leading group of American Orthodox Jews that she favors making
Jerusalem ``the eternal and indivisible capital'' of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Her sentiment, which goes against official US policy, could do
much to reverse the negative attitude that many Jews have toward
the First Lady for a statement she made several years ago in
support of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's press spokesman, Howard Wolfson, who was
traveling with her on a campaign tour of upstate New York, waved
away the idea that she issued the statement about Jerusalem for
political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's her longstanding position,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that 50 percent of New York's Jews would vote for
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Mrs. Clinton's likely Republican opponent,
if the election for Senate were held today _ with just 36 percent
supporting Mrs. Clinton. Giuliani has long held strong pro-Israel
views.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts think Mrs. Clinton, or any Democrat, must
attract a much larger share of support from Jews in order to win a
statewide election. Alfonse D'Amato, a former three-term Republican
Senator, won a number of squeakers by picking up 40 percent of the
Jewish vote. He lost last year, to Congressman Charles Schumer, in
part because he won only 20 percent of the Jewish vote.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton _ who expressed her view in a letter dated last
Friday to Mandell Ganchrow, president of the Union of Orthodox
Jewish Congregations of America, which represents 1,000 synagogues
nationwide _ did note a major caveat in her advocacy of moving the
capital to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' she wrote, ``the timing of such a move must be
sensitive to Israel's interest in achieving a secure peace with its
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian Authority, which also claims Jerusalem as its
spiritual capital, is opposed to the move.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's letter was first published in The Forward, a
Jewish newspaper. Ganchrow Thursday told the Associated Press,
which obtained a copy of the letter, that he would like to explore
the issue further with Clinton. ``I think it is important she
understands the significance of the issue'' and added that he would
like to meet with her ``to gauge her emotional attachment'' to the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton made a similar promise about Jerusalem in his
1992 race for the White House, but never followed through after he
was elected. He has since adopted the State Department view that
the issue should be settled in negotiations between Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department spokesman Thursday declined comment on Mrs.
Clinton's letter, other than to note that she was offering only her
personal views.
</P>
<P>
   An Arab-American leader, James Zogby of the Arab American
Institute, called it unhelpful pandering to New York's Jewish
community. ``It's wrong, it is unhelpful and frankly it is
meaningless, because this kind of pandering frequently is done,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those in the Jewish community pressuring politicians to take
such positions are damaging the search for peace and damaging
American interests and American leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thursday _ on the second day of her ``listening
tour'' across upstate New York _ Mrs. Clinton seemed to draw mostly
on her ``policy-wonk'' talents, and, judging from the results, it
may be just the right move.
</P>
<P>
   She did her share of plunging into crowds of well-wishers,
shaking hands and holding babies, and had lunch in the town of
Clinton. (``I loved the idea of being in Clinton, N.Y.,'' she said
afterward, with a smile.)
</P>
<P>
   But the bulk of the day was spent in what seemed more like
seminars than typical campaign whistle-stops. In the morning, she
talked _ and listened _ for 90 minutes with doctors and nurses at a
health-care center in Cooperstown. In the afternoon, she discussed
Social Security and family issues at a senior-citizens' center in
Utica.
</P>
<P>
   A key element of the campaign strategy _ at least this stage of
it _ seems to be to meet with specific groups and talk about their
specific issues, at great length, in awesome detail, with confident
authority, but also ask them for their ideas and views.
</P>
<P>
   The idea seems to be that, if she does this in enough towns,
with enough groups, for enough time, the most powerful complaint
against her _ that she's a ``carpetbagger'' who has never lived or
worked in New York and, therefore, knows nothing about the state's
problems _ will be wiped away.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy may already be working. After her talk at the East
Side Senior Center in this medium-sized city, Ann Fusco, who
described herself as a registered Republican, said, ``Before, I was
sure I wouldn't vote for her. I thought what the heck's she doing
here? She's not even from New York. But now, I don't think it makes
a difference where she's from.''
</P>
<P>
   At Bassett Health Care in Cooperstown, a doctor, Andrew Rausch,
expressed the sort of doubts that her campaign is trying to
overcome. ``I don't know how much she knows about upstate New
York,'' he said, but then added, ``I don't know how much Rudy
Giuliani knows about upstate New York, either.''
</P>
<P>
   In another attempt to shake off the ``carpetbagger'' charge,
Mrs. Clinton told reporters, ``I am committed to serving a full
term in the Senate'' if she is elected in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   This statement, made in reply to a question, was obviously meant
to rebut suspicions that she might use the Senate seat as a
stepping-stone to running for President in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Giuliani has explicitly declined to make any such pledge,
saying it would be dishonest to make such predictions about the
future. He similarly decline to pledge to serve out his full term
as mayor during his reelection campaign two years ago _ and,
indeed, if he wins the Senate race, he would have to step down from
that office a year before his term runs out.
</P>
<P>
   During her question-answer period with reporters, Mrs. Clinton
declined to take two questions about Giuliani, one dealing with
their differences, the other dealing with how well she thinks he
has done as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be plenty of times in the campaign to go into
that,'' she said, ``and I look forward to that opportunity when it
arises.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Mrs. Clinton nor Giuliani has officially entered the
race _ Mrs. Clinton calls her tour this week the first step of
``exploring'' whether she will be a candidate _ but polls show it
would be a very tight contest. Mrs. Clinton is way ahead in the
predominantly Democratic New York City. Giuliani is way ahead in
the more Republican suburbs and upstate regions.

WELL-KNOWN AND WORN-OUT, MIA HAMM IS STILL STAR OF WORLD CUP SHOW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ It is safe to say that no one from the cast
of ``On the Waterfront'' had ever watched the women's national
soccer team practice until Karl Malden showed up Thursday, along
with about 2,000 members of The Sopranos, those adolescent warblers
who were in full-throated Mia mania.
</P>
<P>
   The players needed a police escort in and out of practice at
Pomona College, lest they be trampled by the Nickelodeon mob and
dragged into endless discussions about the corner-kick abilities of
Soccer Barbie. A trio of cops even escorted reporters from one end
of the field to the other, a sign either that the Women's World Cup
has begun to take itself too seriously or the crime rate in
Southern California is suddenly less threatening than Mayberry RFD.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the shrieking chorus, most people had come to see
Mia Hamm and to get her to sign her name to anything from a soccer
ball to a second mortgage. As much as she continues to protest,
``This World Cup is not about me,'' the more it becomes apparent
that, yes, it is about her.
</P>
<P>
   She is the name and face that everyone knows. It is her jersey
that the little girls wear. It is her lack of scoring in the last
three games that has everyone wondering whether the Americans are
capable of beating the surging Chinese on Saturday in the World Cup
final before 90,000 fans at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried,'' said Coach Tony DiCicco. ``I expect her to
be a big-time scoring threat in the final. I hope she gets a
couple.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Hamm was named as one of five Americans to the
all-tournament team. While that was a debatable selection, it's not
as if she has played poorly. But, clearly, she has not been able to
maintain the dominance of her first two matches, when she delivered
a goal and assist against both Denmark and Nigeria and fully
deserved to be called the world's greatest player.
</P>
<P>
   She continues to run hard, to track back on defense, to offer a
wicked serve on corner kicks, to threaten on free kicks and to
attract defenders, which in turn unleashes her free-range
teammates. It was a furious sprint by Hamm that caused Brazil to
drag her down in the penalty area in the semifinals, which led to a
penalty kick by Michelle Akers and the security of a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's had an impact on every game,'' said assistant coach
Lauren Gregg. ``She's been one of our most consistent players the
whole tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   True, but as the leading international scorer in the history of
the game with 111 goals, it is her primary job to put the ball into
the net. For three matches, while China's Sun Wen has been ringing
up the scoreboard as if it were a gas pump, Hamm has gone silent.
Against Brazil, Hamm seemed hesitant to challenge defenders one on
one. In the past, it was a sign that she was lacking confidence,
something that she has said needs to be remade every day, like a
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Her confidence is not bothering her, DiCicco said. It's her
legs. After four games in 11 days, he said that Hamm had become
tired, and has been using this week to refill her tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take a look at the men's World Cup,'' DiCicco said. ``They
play two games in 11 days, maybe a third. We played four and flew
cross-country. With all the travel, I think the front-runners lost
their legs. If they don't have their legs, it's hard for them to go
at players. I don't think Mia's confidence is hurt. I think she's
ready to step into this final.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco would also like more frequent and accurate passes from
his midfielders to Hamm, so she can run onto balls with her
passing-gear speed, instead of having to dig passes out of the
corners as if she were playing hockey instead of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do a better job of giving our frontrunners quality
balls,'' DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth remembering, however, that it may not be necessary
for Hamm to score for the Americans to beat China. This team has
the resourcefulness to obtain goals from numerous sources. DiCicco
said Thursday that he may start Shannon MacMillan for Cindy Parlow,
using her speed to kick-start the American attack. When the
Americans defeated China, 2-1, in April in Hershey, Pa., Hamm did
not score but she set up both goals with brilliant passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've done some really good things in this
tournament,'' Hamm said. ``Offensively, people say I haven't been
as consistent. But I thought the German game was one of my better
defensive games. I'm OK with the way things are going. I need to
stay positive and keep motivated for Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the only day she has been available to the media this
week. The lasting image of Hamm at this World Cup is of someone
constantly in her face. A defender. A reporter with a microphone or
notepad. An autograph seeker. Wherever she appears, she is
immediately surrounded, as if she has been caught bringing
contraband through customs.
</P>
<P>
   She has never been comfortable in the spotlight _ ``I think she
feels it takes away from her concentration,'' said Donna de Varona,
the chairwoman of the World Cup organizing committee _ and this
week Hamm has retreated even further. Perhaps it will re-energize
her. Perhaps she will do what Michelle Kwan did at the 1998 Winter
Olympics, become tentative and reluctant. She cannot afford to hold
anything back, Hamm said, for there is no game beyond Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play the World Cup in your country, it's quite
hard,'' said Jarl Torske, the assistant Norwegian coach. ``I've
thought about the immense pressure that girl must feel. The media
focus is that she has only scored two goals. But she has been a
vital part of the team with tremendous free kicks and vital runs. I
can't say I feel sorry for her, because she is a tough athlete, but
I feel with her.'' &QL;

EXITING FOREIGN AID CHIEF WARNS OF AFFLUENT AMERICA IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From J. Brian Atwood's perspective, two numbers out
of Washington are combining to send a dangerous message to the
world: the Clinton administration forecast of a $1 trillion budget
surplus and Congress's refusal to pay back $1 billion in dues to
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, the Wareham, Mass., native who leaves his job today
(July 9) as US foreign aid chief, said in an interview Thursday
that the world's disfranchised are increasingly looking at
ever-richer America as ``arrogant'' as it hoards its bounty.
</P>
<P>
   After overseeing an almost steady six-year decline of funding
for foreign assistance at the Agency for International Development,
Atwood, will head international development programs at Boston's
Citizens Energy Corp. beginning in August.
</P>
<P>
   But before he leaves Washington, Atwood, 56, has been using the
last days of his high government pulpit to speak with a degree of
candor almost never heard in official Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He has held little back. He called the government's foreign
affairs budget a ``joke,'' blaming Congress for whittling foreign
assistance in the AID budget from $7.5 billion in 1993 to $6.9
billion last year, and for cutting AID staff by a third.
</P>
<P>
   He has said no one is speaking out about one of the most
troubling global trends: The widening gap between rich and poor.
Further US aid cutbacks could doom America's push for emerging
democracies because fewer people are reaping democracy's fruits, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood took his job at Citizens Energy _ founded by former
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II _ after realizing his
nomination as US ambassador to Brazil would never come up for a
vote before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Senator Jesse
Helms, the North Carolina Republican who chairs the panel, and
Atwood had long feuded over the senator's plan to merge AID into
the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   In his spaceous office in the Ronald Reagan Building and with
pictures still on the walls Thursday, Atwood said he hoped his
words would inspire development professionals and perhaps a
presidential candidate or two to raise the issue of helping the
less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone leaves a job like this, they all of a sudden have
a platform. It is important to try to provoke people into thinking
about what is right and what is wrong. ... It just seems to me that
I have almost an obligation to speak out. There are probably no
other voices in this town that are going to speak out on behalf of
the poor around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   America, he said, ``needs to be shaken out of our lethargy'' and
begin helping the world's poorest. ``We'll be lost if we don't, and
the resentment toward the US will only grow.''
</P>
<P>
   He urged the United States to immediately pay back its UN debt
without conditions. The Senate has passed a bill that would earmark
$800 million for the United Nations as long as the international
body reduced the US contribution to 20 percent from 25 percent of
the UN's budget.
</P>
<P>
   With the expected $1 trillion in US surplus, Atwood recommended
putting $10 billion a year for five years toward development
projects in the neediest parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood, a career diplomat long connected to the Democratic
Party, said he wasn't upset about leaving Washington this way. His
new job, he said, would keep him doing the work he enjoys most.
Later this month, Kennedy and Atwood plan to travel to Angola and
Nigeria to help steer corporations toward development projects.
</P>
<P>
   People want to portray him as angry, ``but I really don't feel
that way,'' Atwood explained. ``It was just fate. It wasn't meant
for me to go to Brazil at this time. I was prepared to go. I was
excited about going. But what I'm going to be doing in Boston is, I
think, going to be more important. ... If I went to Brazil, no one
would hear my voice on these issues.''

MINORITY JOURNALISTS HEAR TOP CANDIATES FOR PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Three leading presidential candidates appeared
Thursday at a national journalists' convention here, and offered
contrasting views on race relations and affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Former Senator Bill Bradley, who is seeking the Democratic
nomination for 2000, Texas Governor George W. Bush, the Republican
front-runner, and Arizona Senator John McCain, another GOP hopeful,
all made brief appearances at the Unity '99 convention of minority
journalists and media organizations, which organizers are calling
the largest one-time gathering of journalists in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the appearances drew criticism from convention
organizers, who said Bush and McCain had decided to show up only at
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   Because affirmative action is a dominant theme at this year's
conference, all the candidates either addressed or confronted
questions about whether they support such a policy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affirmative action is common sense,'' Bradley said at a
noontime speech to an audience of about 1,000 people. He added that
if he is elected president he will fight attempts to roll back
programs that set aside jobs or contracts for minorities. ``But if
we limit the discussion just to affirmative action, we're missing
the broader racial issues that affect the United States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who held a breakfast meeting with a small group of
journalists, also pledged to support more anti-hate crime
legislation, making vague allusions to Bush's opposition to such a
bill in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley also said he would be willing to support an end to
welfare-to-work programs when they expire in 2001, if they prove to
be unsuccessful at helping poor families out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour after Bradley's appearance, Bush paid a
surprise visit to the convention center. Originally, the governor
had declined an invitation to appear at the event, drawing sharp
criticism from convention organizers.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived Thursday, Bush declined to make a formal address
or to take questions, although he shook hands with people in a
quick walk through an exhibition area. When a reporter shouted out
a question about affirmative action, Bush responded, ``I am against
quotas but I support removing all racial barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, McCain held an outdoor press conference with
about three dozen reporters on a terrace near the entrance to the
convention. He said that despite ``an enormous wealth now
overflowing in America, lots of people are being left behind.'' And
rather than support affirmative action programs, McCain said that
now was the time to provide increased training and education
programs for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Like Bush, McCain drew criticism for rejecting an invitation to
speak at the convention and for changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   McCain called the initial rejection ``an oversight,'' but said
that it in no way reflected a lack of interest or sensitivity from
him or his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this has made me look bad,'' he added. ``I felt
it was a good thing to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, who is also seeking the Democratic
nomination, is scheduled to address a luncheon today (July 9) in
Seattle.

DISCOVERY MAY ENABLE SCIENTISTS TO PINPOINT THOSE AT RISK OF DEADLY
SKIN CANCERS &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By KEVIN MORAN
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Geneticists here have discovered an ancient
mechanism that protects life from the sun's harmful ultraviolet
rays, a find that could eventually make it possible to identify
people prone to deadly skin cancers.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery springs from results of a study published earlier
this year in which University of Texas Medical Branch scientists
identified a new enzyme that can replicate damaged DNA without
mutations that increase chances of developing skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published in Friday's edition of the journal
Science, the UTMB researchers reveal how they deduced that humans
are protected from ultraviolet rays in the same way as yeast that
evolved 300 million years earlier than man.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, their deduction started with a look at an enzyme
found in brewer's yeast. Searching a genetic library, they were
able to confirm a hunch that a defective form of the enzyme in
humans could lead to skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists said they were able to use information on the
Internet to hasten their research.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier study had identified the new enzyme, known as a DNA
polymerase. Based on that identification, UTMB geneticists Robert
Johnson, Christine Kondratick, and Satya and Louise Prakash
predicted that humans with normal forms of a gene called hRAD30 are
protected from ultraviolet rays' harmful effects.
</P>
<P>
   In the February issue of Science, Johnson and the Prakashes had
reported that people who have a genetic disease known as xeroderma
pigmentosum have defective hRAD30 genes that make them extremely
vulnerable to skin cancer caused by sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who are with UTMB's Sealy Center for Molecular
Science, believe that the normal hRAD30 and similar genes found in
organisms as diverse as plants and worms keep most healthy people,
plants and animals from being killed by ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally unexpected that there would be a protein
sitting in yeast as well as in humans whose job it is to faithfully
replicate DNA in an error-free manner,'' Satya Prakash said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's allowing life to adapt to ultraviolet rays,'' he said.
``So, when you have something so consistently present all over, it
means it's played a very important part in the evolution of life
and our adaptation to sunlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Prakash said he and his colleagues believe that the beneficial
DNA polymerase they discovered will turn out to be just the first
in a group of undiscovered DNA polymerases that will overcome
various kinds of DNA damage.
</P>
<P>
   Other polymerases likely will help overcome routine breaks in
DNA caused by toxic metabolic byproducts as well as exposure to
pollution and other environmental carcinogens, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Prakash emphasized that the new DNA polymerase doesn't repair
damaged DNA but replicates it without mutations that cause cells to
develop cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's other machinery at work which repairs the damage,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of six previously identified DNA polymerases, five have no
positive effect on cells or DNA damaged by ultraviolet rays, the
scientists said. The sixth goes to work on sun-damaged DNA but
frequently causes mutations in replicated DNA that can cause cells
to develop cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The newly discovered DNA polymerase is able to bypass roadblocks
around DNA damaged by ultraviolet light without making potentially
fatal mistakes, the scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   The UTMB researchers used a huge genetic library now available
in part on the Internet to pinpoint hRAD30 as the human counterpart
to the yeast gene that shares a code with the DNA polymerase they
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't had that database available, we still could have
accomplished this, but it would have taken several years to come up
with the same conclusion,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He said scientists who reviewed the UTMB research before
publication consider the work significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that there will be further studies in this area
which will hopefully develop either a potential cure or at least
early diagnosis of people who may be defective in this gene,'' said
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a professional standpoint, it's always nice to know that
you're helping humankind discover new and different ways of helping
people avoid damage from something we encounter every day,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The UTMB team already has discovered eight hRAD30 defects that
could destroy the effectiveness of their newly discovered DNA
polymerase, Prakash said. Those defects could cause rapid genetic
mutations and lead to development of skin cancers in humans in
early age.

COMMENTARY: FOR 3K FREEDOM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A cry for self-determination is again sending
shudders through world capitals. This time it's in Kashmir, a
lovely land coveted by autocratic Pakistan, most of it occupied by
600,000 troops of democratic India.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan unofficially sent a small force across the ``Line of
Control'' to take up mountain peak positions, and the Indian army
is fighting _ literally uphill _ to drive them back.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of Pakistan's raid is to get world attention paid to
India's unwillingness to negotiate the status of Kashmir, which
both sides claim. At the moment the world sides with India because
it is resisting an act of aggression, albeit symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   What has everybody touchy is that India and Pakistan are now
nuclear powers, and a third war between them could depopulate the
subcontinent. Last week, Pakistan's prime minister felt the need to
race to Washington to seek President Clinton's mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that Chinese intelligence, which has penetrated
India's nuclear facilities as much as it has our own, tipped off
its longtime ally, Pakistan, about increased Indian nuclear
readiness. China also wishes its ally to back off because world
pressure on India to end its occupation of Kashmir would set a
precedent for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton promised to take a ``personal interest''
(which India wants no part of). Pakistan's prime minister raced
home to tell his generals they had made their point _ and should
now pull back those supposedly free-lancing liberators.
</P>
<P>
   Let's climb up our own mountain peak to survey the international
3K trend toward ``protectoration.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, NATO acted forcefully to stop Serbia's bloody
assertion of sovereignty. Because we are loath to redraw borders,
we deny Kosovo independence but will enforce its autonomy. It is
now a protectorate of NATO; after a decent interval, a plebiscite
will probably be held to permit self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kurdish section of Iraq, the United States and its allies
have bolstered their ``no-fly'' edict with a ``no-go'' policy
toward Saddam Hussein's tanks. The dictator knows that if he moves
on Kurdish self-governing forces in his north, out will go the
lights in Baghdad and sirens will sound in his germ warfare
factories. Iraqi Kurdistan is a de facto protectorate, dependent on
the resolve of the U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   In Kashmir, we see a protectorate-in-waiting. As the British
learned in India, and as the Israelis learned on much of the West
Bank, a democracy's administration of a hostile population is
ultimately self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   India is a democracy. Much as it wants to incorporate Kashmir,
it faces growing local resistance and its own ensuing repression
and brutalization. Forget ``world opinion''; Indian self-respect
and economic self-interest will impel it toward the granting of
ever-greater autonomy to the Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
   But what then?
</P>
<P>
   Autonomy is desirable; it is seen as a grand experiment in
diversity-within-unity, and works fine in Puerto Rico and Scotland.
But in most of the world, autonomy is a peaceful stop on the way to
self-determination. In Kurdistan and Kosovo, that means
independence.
</P>
<P>
   What about Kashmir?
</P>
<P>
   In India's eyes, Pakistan is a garrison state with connections
to Afghan terrorists and with missile ties to Communist China and
crazy North Korea. It salivates at the prospect of swallowing
Kashmir. Would Kashmiris be able to fend off or be better off under
militant Muslim rule?
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Pakistanis say: Give Kashmir much more autonomy. Start
pulling out your occupation forces. We'll promise not to
infiltrate. Let the Kashmiris decide their future.
</P>
<P>
   India won't go for that for years. But Kashmir is like a fault
in the political earth, the tectonic plates under growing pressure,
and the now-nuclear region has much to fear from the Big One. The
answer may well take the form of protectorate as it has in Kosovo
and Kurdistan _ but in this case, the intercession would be invited
by all three parties rather than punitively imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody planned this protectoration trend. Nor does it offer
finality, because the world is not about to take over the world.
But it seems to be a way of giving peoples time to sort things out
for themselves.

AMTRAK TRAIN DERAILS AFTER HITTING TRUCK WEST OF HOUSTON; 18 HURT &HT;

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGLE LAKE, Texas _ An Amtrak train carrying 234 passengers hit
a tanker truck at a rural crossing Thursday and derailed, injuring
18 people, including the engineer and his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The truck, which was hauling a saltwater disposal tank, crossed
the tracks in front of the eastbound Sunset Limited just before
noon near Eagle Lake, about 65 miles west of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Two locomotives and seven of the train's 10 cars jumped the
tracks, with the engine landing on its side perpendicular to the
tracks. The train, en route from Los Angeles to Orlando, Fla., had
stopped in San Antonio and was heading toward its next stop in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There were no warning lights or crossing gates at the crossing,
which was on a short dirt road leading from a rice field onto U.S.
90A.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, Jason David Bubela, 21, of El Campo, was not
seriously injured, police said. Police said they are considering
possible charges against the driver. The truck, which police say
may have had bad brakes, is owned by Key Energy Services of
Bryan-College Station, which is conducting its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, these crossing accidents happen all too
often,'' Amtrak spokesman Derrick James said. ``People just don't
seem to want to wait.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific, owners of the track,
said an accident occurred at the same crossing three weeks ago when
an empty freight train clipped the back of a grain truck. The
wreck, however, was termed minor. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Vernon Stevenson, 32, of Eagle Lake, was using a portable
restroom near the tracks when the accident happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming out, and I heard all this commotion,'' said
Stevenson, who works at Rice Industries, behind the Colorado County
Rice Mill. ``The train just went up and went to flipping like. It
was like an explosion. It scared me so bad. I took off running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking that engine was coming into my car,'' said
Tommy Stewart, the train's head conductor, who was two cars behind
the engine. ``Nobody in my car was bleeding, and everybody could
walk, so I jumped out and saw my engineer on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the assistant engineer was trapped ``and he had a big
gash in his head. He was talking to me, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew members and rescuers used a sledgehammer to break a window
and pulled out the assistant engineer, Ed Guidon. He and engineer
J.D. Wood were in stable condition Thursday evening at Rice Medical
Center in Eagle Lake. &UR;  &LR; Their hometowns were not immediately known &UR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Sixteen other passengers and crew members were treated for
bruises, cuts and heat exhaustion from standing in the 90-degree
heat awaiting transportation into Eagle Lake, about five miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who spent the afternoon at the wreck site after a short
trip to the hospital to get his elbow X-rayed, said he planned to
check on his passengers at a makeshift shelter at the local
community center before heading home to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``I might go buy a bottle of whiskey. We were
very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers were Cindy and Jack McCain, the wife and
13-year-old son of presidential candidate and Arizona Sen. John
McCain, who were on their way to Florida on vacation. Authorities
said neither was hurt. They took a private plane to Florida a few
hours after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Other passengers were taken in school buses to the Eagle Lake
Community Center, where volunteers set up a first-aid station and
served barbecue and pizza donated by local restaurants. The
passengers later were bused to Houston, where Amtrak officials
planned to reunite them with their luggage and arrange other
transportation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Sunset Limited was involved in the worst accident in
Amtrak's 28-year history. On Sept. 22, 1993, 42 passengers and five
crew members died when the train went off a bridge into a bayou
near Mobile, Ala. The bridge had been damaged minutes earlier when
it was hit by a towboat.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, two Amtrak trains sideswiped as they passed each
other in Jacksonville, Fla., derailing several cars and slightly
injuring eight people.
</P>
<P>
   In April, in West Palm Beach, Fla., an Amtrak train slammed into
a car that had been pushed in its path, killing a passenger and
injuring five people.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Amtrak's City of New Orleans ran into a truck at a
crossing in Bourbonnais, Ill., killing 11 people and injuring more
than 100.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The power failure that darkened northern Manhattan
may have destroyed or set back by months hundreds of experiments
into illnesses like Alzheimer's disease, cancer and AIDS, Columbia
University medical researchers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Columbia's four laboratory buildings in Washington
Heights _ which together make up one of the state's largest medical
research complexes, with around $200 million annually in federal
financing _ were without any power for several hours on Tuesday
night and Wednesday morning when power was shut off and the
university's backup generators were either not in place or failed,
university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   They said that freezers that maintained samples of tissues,
blood, viruses and bacteria began to warm up before they could rush
in to pack them with dry ice. And incubators that maintain stable
environments for experiments stopped working, forcing scientists to
throw away dozens of cell samples.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take us weeks or months to be able to assess the full
extent of what has happened, but we do know there has been
extensive damage and damage to very important research,'' said Dr.
Herbert Pardes, dean of the faculty of medicine for the College of
Physicians and Surgeons at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, researchers dumped into pink biohazard trash bags
what they estimated to be hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of
enzymes and other chemicals that had been ruined when refrigerators
lost power.
</P>
<P>
   University officials said that their own emergency power systems
intended to protect delicate and in some cases irreplaceable
research material failed for a number of reasons. The university
was unable to supply emergency power to one 18-story research
building at 168th Street and Fort Washington Parkway for almost 24
hours because a back-up generator was on order and was scheduled to
be installed later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Another building's generator relied on steam from New York
Presbyterian Hospital's steam plant, which Columbia officials said
failed because of low water pressure in the area. The officials
said Con Edison was then unable to help the university connect
portable generators to those buildings for several hours because
they were busy assuring that backup power was provided to nearby
New York Presbyterian Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was multiple things that happened at one time,'' said
Carolyn Conway, a spokeswoman for Columbia's Health Sciences
Division. ``Nobody ever thought that power would be down for three
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Con Edison restored power to much of Washington Heights
Wednesday evening, the hospital and Columbia's research buildings
were still without power from the utility through most of Thursday
and were relying on minimal electricity from emergency generators.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Spall, a Con Edison spokesman, said last night that
while maintaining emergency power for the hospital was the first
priority, Columbia officials never asked for help in connecting
portable generators to the two buildings without backup power, the
William Black Medical Research Building and the Armand Hammer
Health Sciences Center, both on West 168th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia officials said the damage could reverberate beyond the
research at those buildings because it shared tissue samples and
other materials with as many as 30 other medical research schools,
including New York University and Mount Sinai medical schools in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Stern, a spokesman for the National Institutes of Health,
the federal agency that finances much of Columbia's research, said
he did not know whether Columbia had yet informed institute
officials of the extent of the damage.
</P>
<P>
   In lab after lab, researchers spent Thursday using dry ice to
save what they could and trying to figure out what they had lost.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Shelanski, a Columbia neurobiologist and an expert
on Alzheimer's disease, said that researchers in his lab thought
they were able to save what they called the ``brain bank,'' a
freezer with hundreds of samples of brain tissue, by packing it
with dry ice before temperatures rose substantially.
</P>
<P>
   But he said a bank of tumor tissue for several research projects
warmed up more, from 80 degrees below zero Celsius to 20 degrees
below. That may have ruined some tissues, especially because they
became colder again once emergency power was available, which may
have created ice crystals that damaged cells, Shelanski said.
Freezers with cells involved in prostate cancer research also
warmed to 20 degrees below Celsius and could have been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not know until we have used every individual sample,''
Shelanski said. ``Basically, what this does is makes you suspicious
of everything you have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He added that the situation was made worse because Con Edison
did not provide reliable information to the university about how
long central power would be off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unconscionable is not that power failed,'' he said
Thursday afternoon, ``but that we were made to think that it was
going to come back earlier, and it still has not.'' Behind him in
the sunlit laboratory, researchers were peering into a dark, warm
refrigerator that had not come back on with emergency power.
</P>
<P>
   Several floors below them, Dr. Samuel Silverstein, chairman of
physiology and cellular biophysics, said that the failure of two
incubators that kept cell cultures in a mixture of air and carbon
dioxide forced researchers to throw out dozens of samples. He said
there were similar problems with incubators around the building.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the cells in Silverstein's lab were from human umbilical
cords, being used to investigate white blood cell activity for use
in understanding inflammation in illnesses like rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was full of flasks of cells, and now they're all gone,''
said Silverstein, opening an nearly empty refrigerated case. He and
other researchers estimated that the white blood cell experiment
had been set back by a month.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, two scientists emptied the shelves behind a
stainless steel door in a room that should have been refrigerated
but was about as warm as the laboratory, where Silverstein stood
sweating. ``In this lab alone, I know we've lost hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of enzymes and other reagents,'' said
Dr. Indra Koraci, who was helping pull dark bottles and beakers
from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers were particularly worried that irreplaceable cell
samples _ those taken from patients as long as 15 years ago and
involved in long-term chronological research _ might have been lost
as freezers warmed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're working on a particular brain from some time ago,
especially in cases where the patient may have died or conditions
are changed, then we can't go back to that brain and gather more
tissue,'' Silverstein said. ``Right now, it doesn't look like we've
lost anything and we're trying to salvage what we think may have
been damaged. But in the weeks to come, we may find that we've lost
more than we think.''  &QL;

ARCHER PUSHING EDUCATION TAX BREAKS &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By DAVID IVANOVICH
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, will seek tax breaks for
families with school-age children as part of a 10-year, $864
billion tax-cutting package to be rolled out next week.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats on Capitol Hill intend to fight a provision they
consider an effort to provide school vouchers for private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee and the
primary tax writer in the House, said Thursday his tax bill would
allow private universities to offer prepaid tuition plans for
prospective students. Currently, only state-funded schools are
allowed to offer such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's proposal also would exempt the income earning in such
plans from taxes. Current law only defers the taxes until the money
is withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Using these pre-pay systems, families can begin to pay for
college long before their children are ready to enter a university.
By paying now families can lock in college costs at current rates
rather than wait for tuition prices to continue to escalate.
</P>
<P>
   Archer pointed to numbers from the National Commission on the
Cost of Higher Education, which calculated that the average annual
tuition for a four-year, public university rose from $642 in 1976
to $3,151 by 1996. For private colleges, the average annual tuition
soared from $2,881 in 1976 to $15,581 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700,000 families in Texas and 18 other states already have
begun paying for college under these pre-pay plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the federal government has a limited role in the
education of our school children, we should work within that role
to lighten the education tax bite whenever possible,'' Archer said
in a written statement. ``That means helping students and parents
save for college.''
</P>
<P>
   A far more controversial measure would allow families to set up
individual retirement accounts _ called education savings accounts
_ to help pay for elementary and high school expenses. The income
generated from these accounts would be tax-exempt.
</P>
<P>
   Current law allows families to establish individual retirement
accounts to save for college but not for students in kindergarten
through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would raise the caps on these individual
retirement accounts, from $500 a year to $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue the education savings accounts would help 14.3
million families pay for school, including an estimated 10.8
million whose children attend public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, however, say the
education savings accounts are a way to force the federal
government to help fund private schools. And they argue the
benefits that would accrue to the children would be minimal.
</P>
<P>
   To help school districts fund construction of new schools and
repair existing buildings, Archer's proposal also would give school
districts greater flexibility when using money raised with
tax-exempt bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, school systems must use those funds within two years.
Archer's proposal would increase that time to four years, giving
school districts greater opportunity to invest those dollars and
expand their building funds.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say the proposal would provide only minimal
benefits to larger school districts.

COMMENTARY: FOR 3K FREEDOM ... OF KASHMIRIS, KURDS AND KOSOVARS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs for new hedline)   By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A cry for self-determination is again sending
shudders through world capitals. This time it's in Kashmir, a
lovely land coveted by autocratic Pakistan, most of it occupied by
600,000 troops of democratic India.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan unofficially sent a small force across the ``Line of
Control'' to take up mountain peak positions, and the Indian army
is fighting _ literally uphill _ to drive them back.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of Pakistan's raid is to get world attention paid to
India's unwillingness to negotiate the status of Kashmir, which
both sides claim. At the moment the world sides with India because
it is resisting an act of aggression, albeit symbolic.
</P>
<P>
   What has everybody touchy is that India and Pakistan are now
nuclear powers, and a third war between them could depopulate the
subcontinent. Last week, Pakistan's prime minister felt the need to
race to Washington to seek President Clinton's mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   My guess is that Chinese intelligence, which has penetrated
India's nuclear facilities as much as it has our own, tipped off
its longtime ally, Pakistan, about increased Indian nuclear
readiness. China also wishes its ally to back off because world
pressure on India to end its occupation of Kashmir would set a
precedent for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Clinton promised to take a ``personal interest''
(which India wants no part of). Pakistan's prime minister raced
home to tell his generals they had made their point _ and should
now pull back those supposedly free-lancing liberators.
</P>
<P>
   Let's climb up our own mountain peak to survey the international
3K trend toward ``protectoration.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, NATO acted forcefully to stop Serbia's bloody
assertion of sovereignty. Because we are loath to redraw borders,
we deny Kosovo independence but will enforce its autonomy. It is
now a protectorate of NATO; after a decent interval, a plebiscite
will probably be held to permit self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kurdish section of Iraq, the United States and its allies
have bolstered their ``no-fly'' edict with a ``no-go'' policy
toward Saddam Hussein's tanks. The dictator knows that if he moves
on Kurdish self-governing forces in his north, out will go the
lights in Baghdad and sirens will sound in his germ warfare
factories. Iraqi Kurdistan is a de facto protectorate, dependent on
the resolve of the U.S. president.
</P>
<P>
   In Kashmir, we see a protectorate-in-waiting. As the British
learned in India, and as the Israelis learned on much of the West
Bank, a democracy's administration of a hostile population is
ultimately self-defeating.
</P>
<P>
   India is a democracy. Much as it wants to incorporate Kashmir,
it faces growing local resistance and its own ensuing repression
and brutalization. Forget ``world opinion''; Indian self-respect
and economic self-interest will impel it toward the granting of
ever-greater autonomy to the Kashmiris.
</P>
<P>
   But what then?
</P>
<P>
   Autonomy is desirable; it is seen as a grand experiment in
diversity-within-unity, and works fine in Puerto Rico and Scotland.
But in most of the world, autonomy is a peaceful stop on the way to
self-determination. In Kurdistan and Kosovo, that means
independence.
</P>
<P>
   What about Kashmir?
</P>
<P>
   In India's eyes, Pakistan is a garrison state with connections
to Afghan terrorists and with missile ties to Communist China and
crazy North Korea. It salivates at the prospect of swallowing
Kashmir. Would Kashmiris be able to fend off or be better off under
militant Muslim rule?
</P>
<P>
   Moderate Pakistanis say: Give Kashmir much more autonomy. Start
pulling out your occupation forces. We'll promise not to
infiltrate. Let the Kashmiris decide their future.
</P>
<P>
   India won't go for that for years. But Kashmir is like a fault
in the political earth, the tectonic plates under growing pressure,
and the now-nuclear region has much to fear from the Big One. The
answer may well take the form of protectorate as it has in Kosovo
and Kurdistan _ but in this case, the intercession would be invited
by all three parties rather than punitively imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody planned this protectoration trend. Nor does it offer
finality, because the world is not about to take over the world.
But it seems to be a way of giving peoples time to sort things out
for themselves.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A new federal survey shows that while minority
groups are increasingly gaining access to computers and the
Internet, the racial divide remains stark, with blacks and
Hispanics less than half as likely as whites to explore the net
from home, work or school.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the third and most comprehensive to be conducted by
the Commerce Department over the past three years, reinforces the
fear that minority groups are increasingly at a disadvantage in
competing for the hottest entry-level jobs in the country: those
that require a knowledge of computers and comfort in navigating the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also contained some new findings that add
considerable complexity to the ongoing debate about how race,
income level and location affect access to the technology explosion
of the 1990s. These are among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Among families earning $15,000 to $35,000 per year, more than
32 percent of whites owned computers but only 19 percent of blacks
and Hispanics at comparable income levels had computers at home.
That gap widened from eight percentage points five years ago, even
as the price of entry-level personal computers plunged.
</P>
<P>
   _ Children in single-parent households have far less access to
computers and the Internet than those in two-parent households. A
child in a two-parent white household is nearly twice as likely to
have Internet access as a child in a one-parent white household;
the disparity is even greater between single-parent and two-parent
black households.
</P>
<P>
   _ The highest penetration of computers in households in the
United States can be found in largely rural, cold-weather states,
many of which have pockets of high-technology jobs. The lowest
penetration is in southern states where poverty and education
troubles still reign; outside the South and Appalachia, New York
was at the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Irving, the assistant secretary of commerce for
communications and information, who oversaw the study, said, ``It
is positive that we doubled the number of computers and Internet
access for African-Americans and Hispanics over the past four
years, and it's great that we have seen an increase of 50 percent
in one year for use of the Net'' by minorities. But he said ``it is
abysmal that we still have a gap of 3 to 1 among the races'' in
Internet access at home, ``and that's what we have to work on.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton drew on the highlights of the report Thursday
during the last leg of his tour of impoverished corners of the
United States. He announced several private-sector initiatives to
make computers more available to the poor, particularly in inner
cities. But the White House did not link the study released
Thursday to any new government initiatives, arguing instead that
the disparities would be even greater if Clinton had not pressed
for more computers in schools, libraries and community centers.
</P>
<P>
   Among those initiatives has been an ``E-rate'' that reduces the
cost of internet access for schools and libraries in low-income
areas, a program Republicans have sought to limit because it is
underwritten by fees on telephone bills. But mostly the
administration has relied on private sector grants, chiefly from
computer and Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is that we need a lot of heavy lifting in the
private sector,'' Irving said Thursday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The study echoes the findings of several university and
corporate surveys of computer use. But several of those have found
an even wider racial divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big question is why African-Americans are not adopting
this technology,'' said Donna L. Hoffman, a professor of management
at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. ``It is not just
price, because they are buying cable and satellite system in large
numbers. So we have to look deeper to cultural and social factors.
I think there is still a question of `What's in it for me?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the statistics in Thursday's study suggest that
minorities are beginning to answer that question. In 1994, only 10
percent of black households reported that they owned a computer,
versus 27 percent of white households. Last year the Census Bureau
found after door-to-door visits to a sampling of 48,000 households
that the figure rose to 23 percent for blacks and nearly 47 percent
for whites.
</P>
<P>
   The divide is even greater when the Census Bureau looked at use
of the Internet from home. Last year, about 27 percent of white
households had Internet access, compared with about 9 percent of
black and Hispanic households. Black and Hispanic computer users,
unlike whites, are more likely to have Internet access outside the
home than at home.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most of the divisions in computer use
correlate to income levels and education. Sixty-one percent of
whites and 54 percent of blacks in households that earned more than
$75,000 used the Internet regularly, but the figures dropped to 17
percent of whites and 8 percent of blacks when families earned
$15,000 to $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, families in which the parents attended college were
three times more likely to access the Internet from home than
families where the parents stopped their education after earning a
high school diploma or its equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the curious issues is why single-parent families use
computers and the Internet so much less than two-parent families.
``It's an issue of money and interest,'' said Ms. Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most interesting figures in the study reveal a huge
difference in computer use depending on where in the country one
lives. Roughly one in four households in Mississippi, West Virginia
and Arkansas reported that they have home computers. But more than
half in California own at least one, and the figure approaches
two-thirds in places like Utah and Alaska. About 40 percent of
Texas households own one, about the same figure as in
Massachusetts. Both are considered high-tech centers: Dell and
Compaq, two of the biggest PC makers, are both Texas-based
corporations, while much of the computer age began in the Boston
suburbs.

   (Klein's group has also called for Laila Al-Marayati to be
removed from her post on the U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom.)
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Al-Marayati responded that he had a clear
record of opposing terrorism, ``not for the sake of political
expediency, but because of an Islamic stand.'' He said that when
bombs explode in Israel, his Muslim Public Affairs Council
frequently issues press releases condemning the violence against
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hamas and Hezbollah commit acts of terrorism, we condemn
those acts as events contrary to the principles of Islam. When
those groups build hospitals and develop social service agencies
for the disenfranchised, that's something that we do not condemn,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the reason he has never issued a blanket condemnation of
Hamas and Hezbollah, Al-Marayati said. And he scoffed at the idea
that he had ever supported Saddam Hussein, noting that his family
was forced to leave Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati says he has had a working relationship for more than
five years with local FBI officials in the counter-terrorism task
force. And he adds that when Sheikh Omar Abdul Rahman was in Los
Angeles in the early 1990s before his conviction for the bombing fo
the World Trade Center, Al-Marayati's organization denied him the
forum he sought at the Islamic Center of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Salam, I think very well, for five or seven years,''
said Joe Hicks, executive director of the Human Relations
Commission of the city of Los Angeles. ``He's a very fair, very
moderate individual who in my perception is respected in a number
of communities, including the Jewish community here in Los Angeles.
He is not given to wild, extremist views about the Middle East or
Israel, and has been critical of Saddam Hussein, critical of
terrorists and terrorism. So it's kind of amusing to see people
saying that he winks at terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Jewish leaders in Los Angeles who have publicly
supported Al-Marayati are Rabbi Alfred Wolf of The American Jewish
Committee's Skirball Institute on American Values, Rabbi Leonard
Beerman and Gene Lichtenstein, editor of the Jewish Journal.
</P>
<P>
   John Esposito, a professor of religion and international affairs
at Georgetown University and director of the Center for
Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown, said the whole affair
was ``anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bashing, to put it bluntly.''
</P>
<P>
   Esposito said that asking American Muslims to pass a ``litmus
test'' by issuing blanket denunciations of Hamas or Hezbollah is
like asking South Africans to denounce the African National
Congress, or asking Israelis to denounce Irgun or the Stern gang.
All are groups that have multiple wings, some political opposition,
some terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati, by bringing this perspective to a government
commission on terrorism, would have contributed a crucial
perspective, some argue, by representing Muslim American opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking mainstream,'' Esposito said. ``If these people
are not acceptable, who is?''

U.N. BACKS MINE EXPERT EXPELLED BY IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations defended a mine-clearing
expert who was expelled Thursday by Iraq, and expressed concern
about Baghdad's continuing attempts to bar employees of certain
nationalities or groups from working in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Manoel de Almeida e Silva, a spokesman for Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, said Thursday that Iraq's determination to expel a U.N.
contract worker, a New Zealander who was clearing mines in northern
Iraq, was ``a matter of concern to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats expressed far stronger concern about Iraq's
persistence in barring U.N. officials from countries and U.N.
agencies that Baghdad views as unfriendly. Several also expressed
anger at the United Nations for permitting Iraq and other states to
reject experts and relief workers in their countries based on their
nationality.
</P>
<P>
   The latest incident involves Ian Broughton, a 30-year-old former
noncommissioned officer with the New Zealand Army, who was employed
by a British company hired by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Baghdad told the United Nations that Broughton tried
on April 8 to sabotage Iraqi crops already hard hit by drought by
planting boxes of locust eggs near the Iranian border. Iraqi
officials demanded that he leave Iraq within 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   After interviewing Broughton and his associates, Hans von
Sponeck, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, told Iraqi
foreign ministry officials that ``neither Ian Broughton nor any
other person connected to the United Nations was in the area
specified'' by Baghdad, according to a document released Thursday
by the United Nations spokesman's office.
</P>
<P>
   Von Sponeck then suggested that there could have been a case of
``mistaken identity,'' the spokesman's note continued.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Iraq insisted that Broughton leave the country,
which he did Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said the decision to permit Broughton to leave
Iraq early was based solely on concerns for his safety. They noted
that another mine removal expert, Nicholas Speight, also from New
Zealand, was shot and killed by unknown assailants in northern Iraq
in late April.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and U.N. officials also expressed concern that Iraq
had ignored a request by a senior U.N. official to visit the site
where Broughton was accused of having planted the locust eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Benon Sevan, the executive director of the United Nations
humanitarian program for Iraq, expressed his ``disappointment''
that the charges against Broughton had ``marred his otherwise
successful visit to Iraq,'' according to a statement issued
Thursday by his office.
</P>
<P>
   Sevan, who had spent 20 days in Iraq evaluating Iraq's
humanitarian needs, added that he was disappointed that the
allegations against Broughton were not raised in any of the many
meetings he had held with ``a wide range of government officials''
during his tour.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the statement added, Sevan had raised the issue himself
and asked to visit the site in a meeting with the Minister of
Agriculture. The minister did not respond to Sevan's request, but
urged him instead to visit a vaccine production plant that Iraq
wants the United Nations to rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. Special Commission charged with disarming Iraq of
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons destroyed part of the
plant in 1996 after concluding that it was connected to Iraq's
effort to build biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After visiting the plant, Sevan denied Iraqi press reports that
he favored the plant's reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi press, which is controlled by Baghdad, continued
Thursday to press a campaign of invective against both the United
Nations and Broughton, reporting that the ``New Zealander'' had
left Baghdad for Jordan overland ``after it was confirmed that he
had carried out sabotage acts in Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Acts of spying and sabotage by some of those who wear the blue
hat have reached a level which cannot be imagined,'' declared
Babel, a paper owned by Saddam Hussein's eldest son, Uday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has previously accused several employees of the Special
Commission, including Richard Butler, its former chairman, of
spying. While Butler denied that he spied against Iraq, Washington
did not deny allegations that it had used the Special Commission as
cover for some intelligence gathering efforts.
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat argued that concern that Broughton might have spied
for New Zealand without the United Nations' knowledge led the world
body to issue its rather tepid denial of Iraq's charges.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed as to whether there was any indication that Broughton
had buried locust eggs or conducted any act of sabotage or
espionage, John Mills, Sevan's spokesman, said the United Nations
had ``found no evidence to support the allegations made against
Broughton.''

BRITISH BANK WINS DISPUTE WITH IRS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Mass.)   By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a stunning defeat for the Internal Revenue Service's efforts
to restrict strategies foreign corporations employ to avoid taxes,
a federal judge ruled in favor of Britain's National Westminster
Bank PLC in its demand for a $180 million tax refund.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who specialize in international corporate tax said
Thursday that the decision would prompt more foreign companies to
challenge the IRS in future cases and to press for favorable
rulings on issues currently in dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Judge James T. Turner of the U.S. Court of Claims ruled
Wednesday that the IRS had violated a 1980 tax treaty between the
United States and Britain by refusing to allow NatWest to deduct
interest on loans from its home office and Hong Kong operations to
its American branches from 1981 to 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In effect NatWest was taking money from one pocket, in, say,
Hong Kong, and lending it to another pocket in, say, New York.
Doing this allowed the bank to reduce its profits, and thus its
taxes, in the United States and to shift profits to locations, such
as Hong Kong, where tax rates are lower.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980 tax treaty allowed NatWest and all other British banks
to take such deductions. NatWest argued that under the tax treaty
its American branch must be treated as a separate company and not
just another pocket in its worldwide operations.
</P>
<P>
   But the Treasury Department, ever on the alert for abusive tax
strategies, issued a regulation shortly after the treaty took
effect allowing the IRS to disregard any deductions deemed
excessive. The regulation lets the IRS apply a complicated formula
to allocate interest based on a company's worldwide operations.
</P>
<P>
   But, Turner wrote, the Treasury regulation is ``fundamentally
incompatible'' with the tax treaty and must be ignored. In his
21-page decision, he also castigated the United States for its
conduct, quoting in detail from written promises made during the
treaty negotiations and other documents to show that NatWest was
justified in relying on the tax treaty in preparing its corporate
tax returns for the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the regulation ``plainly violates'' the tax
treaty and he characterized the reasoning behind it as
``fundamentally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not award the $180 million, plus interest, to NatWest,
however. Instead, Turner ruled in the bank's favor on the issue in
a pretrial hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Tax lawyers said the United States could appeal the judge's
ruling, continue the case and then appeal the entire case, go to
Congress for relief or give up.
</P>
<P>
   The case may cause a stampede by other foreign banks to recover
billions of dollars in taxes paid when their interest deductions
were curtailed. More broadly, the case is an important development
in a growing global battle between multinational corporations,
which want to take profits and pay taxes in countries of their
choice, and national governments that want to protect the integrity
of their tax regimes and maximize tax revenues, a variety of tax
lawyers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tremendously important decision, although it
specifically involves a backwater of the issues about global
corporate taxation,'' said Richard E. Andersen of the law firm
Jones, Day, Reavis &AMP; Pogue. He said the size of the award, expected
to ultimately be the full $180 million plus interest that NetWest
sought, and the ``drubbing'' the IRS took from the judge ``will
force the IRS to think hard about thumbing their nose at this
because if they do they will have to devote a lot of legal
resources to fighting other cases on similar issues and they will
probably lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen and other lawyers said that because of its enormous
market the United States had been able to ``get away with''
ignoring tax treaties. ``The fact is no bank has withdrawn from the
U.S. because of this issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur D. Pasternak, an international tax specialist at Gibson,
Dunn &AMP; Crutcher, said that ``the IRS has this no-cheating concept
that, to its credit, it tends to apply evenly to American and
foreign corporations operating in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the IRS has become much more aggressive in recent years in
fighting what it regards as using tax treaties for aggressive tax
avoidance,'' he said. ``The general rule is that the United States
government has been saying that statutes passed by Congress can
override existing treaties, but this case shows that mere
regulations can't override treaties.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney E. Unger, chairman of the tax department at the Kaye
Scholer Fierman Hays &AMP; Handler in New York, said foreign
corporations operating in the United States were a convenient
target for American politicians and the regulation the judge ruled
on illustrated this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, there has been a sense at Treasury and among
politicians that foreign entities with operations in the United
States are not paying their fair share of tax,'' Unger said.
``Whether that is true or not, certainly it is a wonderful issue
for American politicians and for Treasury officials to want to
pursue because it about taxing someone else who doesn't vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Inland Revenue, the British tax agency, filed a
friend-of-the-court brief supporting NatWest.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Libin, a tax specialist in the Washington office of
Sutherland Asbill &AMP; Brennan who filed the brief, said Inland
Revenue believed that even if NatWest's interest deductions were
dubious _ and that point was not conceded _ the deductions still
had to be allowed under the tax treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Libin won a similar case three years ago in U.S.Tax Court over a
tax treaty with Canada, but that case involved allocating income,
while the NatWest case involved allocating deductions.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in newer tax treaties the United States had sought
to reserve a right to disallow deductions if it could show that
they were abusive.
</P>
<P>
   One of NatWest's lawyers, Jerry Snider of Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell,
called Turner's decision ``a terrific, thorough and carefully
written opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service declined to comment or even to make
documents available. It referred questions to the Treasury
Department, where a spokeswoman, Maria Ibanez, offered to make a
senior official available for an interview on condition that he
neither be named nor quoted directly. That offer was declined.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department said last night that senior officials
familiar with the case had left and could not be reached for
comment.

Boston in December 1995. &QL;

LIBERIA'S FIRST LADY SEEKS AID FOR NATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KAREN ROUSE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Vials of saline, unopened rolls of gauze,
unused bed pads and an excess of sterile gloves and masks could
have all been tossed in the trash at the Vencor care facility in
nearby Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Amy Tinney, a respiratory therapist, gathered the
supplies and donated them to Liberia for use by doctors treating a
population debilitated after a bloody civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Liberian first lady Jewel Howard-Taylor encouraged individual
efforts such as Tinney's on Thursday during a breakfast at the Fort
Worth International Center. More than 100 people attended the
event, including several city and state elected officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to strengthen, renew and open up lines of
positive communication with our friends and our brothers and
sisters from around the world,'' said Howard-Taylor, who is on a
four-day visit to Fort Worth-Dallas. ``We're struggling to create
an enabling environment of positive, sustainable growth and
development in our nation, for all Liberians.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard-Taylor was invited to Fort Worth by Global 2000, a
year-old nonprofit organization created to help rebuild the West
African nation after the civil war ended in 1996. Liberian
President Charles Taylor began the war after he launched a coup in
1989 to overthrow former dictator Samuel Doe. About 200,000 people
died and half of the country's population of 2.6 million people
were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Howard-Taylor urged her audience to help Liberia find long-term
solutions to its problems by investing in its natural resources,
providing supplies to schools and training students at Liberian
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although the war is over, Liberians are still suffering,
Howard-Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberian children, many of whom have gone a decade without
education, sell candy and popcorn on the street to earn income for
their families, hospitals operate without electricity, and some
schools have untreated water and old textbooks, Howard-Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The civil crisis produced a mass destruction of all of our
infrastructure _ social, economic and civil,'' she said. ``Our
government is struggling to rehabilitate.''

 &HT;    Austin mayor urges state to enforce new fuel laws in 2000
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mayor Kirk Watson says he hopes the state will
put its new rules for cleaner gasoline into effect for Austin as
soon as May 2000, and not wait until 2004 as planned.
</P>
<P>
   The cleaner gasoline would mean cleaner air but also slightly
higher prices at the pump.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sooner we can do those things that make good sense, the
better off we're going to be from a health standpoint and from an
economic standpoint,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission last week
adopted new rules affecting a 95-county area that includes much of
the eastern half of the state.
</P>
<P>
   A key provision of the new rules _ to reduce sulfur levels in
gasoline by about half _ won't take effect until Jan. 1, 2004.
Reducing sulfur in gasoline enables a catalytic converter to remove
pollutants from engine exhaust more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of how much the new rules would add to the price of
gasoline range from two-tenths of a cent to 3 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The city councils of Austin and San Antonio, as well as the
Environmental Defense Fund, had urged the commission to require the
lower sulfur levels as soon as 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, increasing air pollution in the two cities has
threatened to tip them into noncompliance with federal clean air
rules, as has happened in Dallas and Houston. Cities in
noncompliance have to take steps to reduce pollution, such as
regularly checking their vehicles' pollution equipment and imposing
emission restrictions on plant expansions or new construction.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules allow individual cities and counties with at least
200,000 people to ask the commission to allow implementation sooner
than 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said he hoped the commission would apply the new rule
sooner in Austin, as the city requested.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is still studying just what process it must
follow to approve the requests from Austin and San Antonio, said
Patrick Crimmins, a commission spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision in the new rules requires that gasoline sold
in the hottest months of the year, between May 1 and Oct. 1 of each
year starting next year, evaporate less easily.
</P>
<P>
   Koch Industries Inc., whose Corpus Christi refinery provides
more than 90 percent of the gasoline sold in the
Austin-metropolitan area, already complies with the new evaporation
standard, said Jay Rosser, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Koch has said, however, that the state should defer to the
federal Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is considering its own rules on reducing sulfur that,
if adopted, would override the new state rules.
</P>
<P>
   The new state rules on sulfur don't take effect until 2004 to
give refiners plenty of time to upgrade their refineries.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's new rules take no position on the use of a
chemical additive, MBTE, or methyl-tertiary-butyl-ether, by
refiners to reduce engine ``knock,'' a problem that arises from the
process of removing sulfur as gasoline is refined from crude oil.
</P>
<P>
   MBTE _ used in about 15 percent of the gasoline sold in the
Austin area _ is highly soluble in water and is suspected of
causing cancer and other health-related problems.
</P>
<P>
   East Texas local governments, most of which are not facing the
same imminent air pollution problems as the state's larger cities,
had criticized the proposed gasoline rules, saying they could lead
to increased MBTE contamination of their water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the Environmental Defense Fund and the Sierra Club
applauded the new rules, but said the state needs to do more to
clean up its air.
</P>
<P>
   Mark MacLeod, a spokesman for the defense fund, said the state
should have ordered an even larger reduction in sulfur. And Neil
Carman, clean air director for the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra
Club, said MBTE should have been banned, but that ``Texas
refineries and chemical plants are the biggest producers of MBTE in
the nation, so they decided to dodge that bullet.''

BASEBALL'S MOST EXCITING PLAYER VISITS L.A.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is no greater endorsement for interleague
play than Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a Yankees-Mets series, or Cubs-White Sox, or, for sure,
Dodgers-Angels. Not this year, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It's Ken Griffey Jr. or, simply, Junior _ as he's called by his
Seattle Mariners teammates _ who is arguably the best player in the
game but someone pretty well tucked away in the Great Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   His national exposure is largely restricted to a few at-bats
every year in the All-Star Game, maybe nightly highlight clips on
ESPN, or a flock of television commercials. He has been in two
division playoff series and one championship series but no World
Series so far.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he's well known in American League circles, where for
the fifth time he was the leading AL vote-getter for the All-Star
Game. The National League? That's Mark McGwire-Sammy Sosa country.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until the advent of interleague play, a novel tinkering
of the schedule that offers select matches between the two leagues
NL West vs. AL West, for example. That has allowed Griffey's
exposure to widen a little. And, clearly, he's the draw, not the
Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, last year, when Seattle played an interleague
series against the expansion Diamondbacks in Arizona _ where the
Mariners hold spring training _ he was roundly booed when he came
to bat for the first time. When he walked, more boos, only this
time they were aimed at the Arizona pitcher, not Griffey. He was
wearing the other team's uniform, perhaps, but the fans didn't pay
to watch Griffey walk.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it'll be that way this weekend at Dodger Stadium, where
Griffey will perform for the first time in two years. Promos for
the series have a clear message: ``Come see Ken Griffey Jr. . . .
and the Seattle Mariners.''
</P>
<P>
   Advance sales for the three-game series which begins tonight at
7:10, the final series before the All-Star break, have picked up
noticeably, according to the Dodgers' ticket office. And that's
particularly interesting.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier interleague series at Dodger Stadium involving the
Texas Rangers, the first-place team in the AL West, an outfit with
such bona fide stars as two-time AL Most Valuable Player Juan
Gonzalez and All-Star catcher Ivan ``Pudge'' Rodriguez, drew fewer
than 30,000 fans the first two games. The third, on free-towel
night, lured more than 45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's an indictment of the Southern California sports
fan. Towels, not Pudge, bring 'em in. Or maybe they were merely
awaiting Junior's arrival. If so, it's no surprise to Lou Piniella,
the Seattle manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this,'' Piniella was saying the other evening at Edison
International Field, where the Mariners were playing the Angels,
``I certainly enjoy watching him play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an outstanding player, very graceful,'' Piniella went on.
``He's been in the (AL) more than 10 years now. He knows the
pitchers. He has great speed in his hands to make the plays. He
takes pride in it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on how long he wants to stay and if he stays
healthy, he has the ability to challenge some really big records.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest, of course, would be Henry Aaron's career home run
record of 755, unattainable in the eyes of many. Yet Griffey passed
the halfway point on Monday night at Anaheim, when he hit the 378th
homer of his career.
</P>
<P>
   It's often said that if anyone could overtake Aaron, it would be
Griffey, who hit 56 homers each of his last two seasons, has
averaged better than 49 homers four of the past five years, has 28
this year and doesn't even turn 30 until November.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Griffey isn't one of those doing the talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here a while. . . . I've been in the league 11
years,'' he said to a group of reporters in the visitors clubhouse
at Edison Field. ``If you look ahead too far, you can get into
trouble. This game is humbling enough. One day you're hitting .400,
got 60 home runs . . . the next you're hitting .167.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, besides, I'm a quiet guy. I kind of sneak in and out of
the clubhouse. I don't have a lot to say about myself. I don't
believe in putting myself above my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Interleague play, whether it's good or bad, is just one more
thing for the radio sports-talk shows to hash over. But this week,
it's definitely good for Ken Griffey Jr. It's three games in
Anaheim, then three this weekend at Dodger Stadium. An entire week
on the road without climbing aboard an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of flying for us,'' acknowledged Griffey, who
will be on another long, late-night flight after Sunday game, bound
for Boston and his 10th All-Star Game. ``Anywhere we go, it's a
long flight. We fly more than anybody else in major-league
baseball. We have the least rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, then, what Junior might be able to accomplish if he all
the shuteye he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if could compare Griffey with any of the other greats of
the game, Piniella smiled, shook his head and said, ``No. Junior
has his own unique style.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prices of key commodities, whose decline helped
restrain inflation the last few years, are climbing again.
</P>
<P>
   Oil is leading the charge. Crude has been flirting with $20 a
barrel this week, and financial analysts expect it to pass that
benchmark easily. Some see $25 a barrel by the end of the year, a
further increase of 25 percent. The price has jumped 73 percent
from its low point of the year, $11.37, reached in February.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the prices of some other important commodities for
industrial uses are staging small rallies. Copper has risen 15
percent this year while aluminum has gained 12.8 percent, nickel
44.1 percent and zinc 20.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put the lows behind us in March,'' said Ted Arnold,
minerals strategist at Hamburg Metals Division of Prudential-Bache
Ltd. in London. This rebound has not spread to agricultural
commodities, however, which continue to slump.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in the industrial commodity rebound, analysts say, is
a revival in many of the world's economies from the global
financial crisis that began in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data for world economic growth suggest that rates are going to
be higher than thought just a few months ago,'' said Michael
Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch. ``In the first
year of a recovery there is always a rise in demand for copper and
other base metals.''
</P>
<P>
   But some other factors have also pushed up commodity prices and
will continue to put pressure on the market in the months ahead.
For example, the rally in copper in the last month has been abetted
by a series of announcements about production cutbacks. Asarco is
reducing its copper mine output by 7 percent. Phelps Dodge Corp. is
trimming production by 8 percent, while Broken Hill Proprietary of
Australia will shut all its mines in the United States and reduce
global production by 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some other influences will probably be temporary. Gasoline
prices jumped to a 19-month high on Wednesday after Sunoco said a
power failure had closed the Point Breeze unit, which normally
produces 130,000 barrels a day, at its Philadelphia refinery for a
week. Copper jumped 3 percent on Wednesday because of speculation
that Canadian workers would strike at Falconbridge's metallurgical
division in Ontario. When the strike was called Thursday, copper
slipped four tenths of a cent to 77.80 cents a pound.
</P>
<P>
   For oil, which closed at $19.71 a barrel for August delivery
Thursday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the improved outlook
can be directly linked to the success of the OPEC countries in
maintaining production cutbacks. While the price of oil surged
after the countries reached an agreement in March to reduce
production, many analysts questioned whether the parties would
adhere to the terms.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman of Merrill Lynch said that oil analysts were expecting
70 percent compliance. But compliance was 93 percent in May, he
said. (Analysts use different measures, but their compliance
estimates were clustered around 90 percent.) The confirmation of
that unity was what was needed to get oil's second 1999 rally
going. The price had fallen as low as $16.34 a barrel June 1 after
peaking at $18.98 May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman predicts oil could end the year as high as $22 a barrel,
although he adds there could be a selloff between now and $22.
Frederick P. Leuffer, the senior energy analyst at Bear Stearns &AMP;
Co., is speaking of a ``shockingly high'' $25 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The compliance of OPEC members and the resulting decline in
inventories of both crude oil and refined petroleum products will
drive the price higher, he said. He estimates that if OPEC
production remains steady at May's 26 million barrels a day,
inventories at the end of this year will be lower than at the end
of 1996, when oil averaged $24.56 a barrel in the fourth quarter
and finished the year just below $26.
</P>
<P>
   American Petroleum Institute reported after the market closed
Wednesday that crude oil inventories dropped 1.92 million barrels
to 327.94 million barrels last week. Gasoline inventories dropped
4.4 million barrels to 216.38 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
   The oil outlook has changed so quickly that Leuffer still has an
official forecast of $19.50 a barrel in the second half of the
year. But, he said, ``I see a case developing for $25 oil or
higher.''
</P>
<P>
   This jump in oil and other industrial commodities is important
for investors, even though it is not expected to produce any big
jump in consumer prices or inflation over the longer term. Kathryn
Kobe, senior economist at Joel Popkin &AMP; Co. in Washington, said
that the jump in oil prices _ and the resulting surge in gasoline
prices _ has forced her to add about two tenths of one percentage
point to her forecasted gain in the consumer price index this year.
She now expects it to rise 2.4 percent from December to December,
compared with a 1.6 percent increase last year.
</P>
<P>
   That would put inflation back at its pace in 1997. So it is in
no sense an inflationary breakout.
</P>
<P>
   But an outsized jump in just one month could be enough to force
the Federal Reserve to raise its short-term interest rate target
another quarter of a percentage point. The quarter-point increase
that Fed policy makers announced at the end of June was prompted,
in part, by the seven-tenths of one percent surge in consumer
prices in April.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shepherdson, the chief U.S. economist at High Frequency
Economics, estimates that an average oil price of $21 a barrel this
month would push up gasoline prices to $1.28 a gallon. That would
be enough to produce a five-tenths of one percentage point jump in
the CPI.
</P>
<P>
   The consumer price figure for July will be reported Aug. 17, a
week before the next meeting of Federal Reserve policy makers.
Lawrence Kudlow, chief economist at American Slandia Life Assurance
in Shelton, Conn., said a move of that magnitude would force the
Fed's hand. ``If the CPI jumps up again because of oil or because
of other commodity price increases, they will snug up again,'' he
predicted.

 WASHINGTON: own funeral.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coelho was brought in as campaign manager to fix the problem of
blurred lines of authority in a top-heavy operation. But it is
unclear how the Eskew hiring will streamline the organizational
chart unless Squier leaves, a step he said he had no intention of
taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what my job is,'' Squier said. ``This is way too
important to throw away for some frivolous reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew said that when Coelho came to him a month ago, ``I asked
him if he was aware of the tensions and history, and he said,
`Yeah, I'm willing to take that on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Though supremely gracious, serving chevre and an '82 Chateau
Montrose way too fine for a business lunch, along with frittata and
rice salad he had made himself, Squier moaned periodically
throughout the interview: ``Can't we go swimming instead? I despise
this!''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew, for his part, was unruffled. Over a drink _ Evian,
actually _ he said he regretted the bad feelings of his past with
Squier. ``Bob was my mentor and taught me a lot of what I know
about this business,'' he said, ``but I needed to establish myself
on my own. If I had it to do over, I'd leave differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his hiring, he said, neither he not Gore have rehashed old
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I decided to come on, he said, `Welcome aboard,' and
`Get to work,''' Eskew said.
</P>
<P>
   On their difference of opinion over his work for tobacco
companies, he said: ``I can't imagine we'd have much to say. I'm
here to do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew met Gore when both worked on The Nashville Tennessean
newspaper in the 1970s, but they did not know each other well. They
had a lot in common, including Tennessee roots and Washington
childhoods. Eskew, whose father was an orthodontist, went to
Sidwell Friends, Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Squier, who comes from Minnesota, was on his own from a young
age, losing his mother to breast cancer when he was 12 and his
father to cancer, too, on the day he graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost two parents who were heavy smokers to cancer. I found
my mother,'' he said, explaining why Eskew's work for tobacco
companies got under his skin.
</P>
<P>
   He was a TV producer brought into politics by President Johnson
_ two days before Johnson decided not to run for another term. But
he stayed on to work for Hubert Humphrey, and has worked for
Democrats ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Squier and Eskew, then 24, met while working on Elizabeth
Holtzman's 1980 senatorial campaign. Later, it was Eskew who
brought in Gore's business, and the three became personal friends.
</P>
<P>
   Eskew said he hopes the reunion of the three will work. ``I
don't recall the '96 Clinton campaign being particularly
harmonious, but they bucked up and did it, and that's what we're
going to do,'' he said.

FRENCH STYLE: WHAT IS IT, AND HOW DO YOU GET IT? &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) Ask most Americans who embodies style, and they almost
invariably point to the French.
</P>
<P>
   Coco Chanel. Catherine Deneuve. Even Brigitte Bardot, who for a
few moments in history epitomized everything some viewed as French,
mainly sizzle and skin.
</P>
<P>
   As first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy had French style, and among
the British, both Princesses Diana and Fergie coveted it.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Americans what constitutes French style, and they have a
hard time putting their fingers on it. The women look put together,
they'll say, not overdone. And they always know what to do with a
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   While Paris is indeed considered the cradle of fashion, French
style is more than that. There is a certain je ne sais quoi, as the
Gauls themselves would put it, about the way a French woman puts
herself together.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, men dig it.
</P>
<P>
   Skirts in the States tend to fall straight from the hips, but in
France they are tighter, cupping the buttocks, and are often worn
with high heels that tighten and shape the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Men dig the way French women wear fresh, white men's shirts with
their jeans and even men's jackets, all elements of sportswear but
worn with femininity. Maybe the shirt collar's worn up, and for
sure the hair is shiny and clean, and the skin flawless.
</P>
<P>
   And men dig the way French women wear boots with skirts and
suits, exposing leg between the hem and boot tops. And at night,
they go for everything from simplest black to no-holds-barred
glamour.
</P>
<P>
   American women like it that their French counterparts wear hats
that are truly confections to weddings _ and without a speck of
self-consciousness. Basically, a casual approach to fashion that
comes off as trs, trs chic to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But French style goes much deeper than wearing a cartwheel hat
or casually tying on a scarf that costs as much as a month's
groceries. It involves not only fashion but beauty, attitude and
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   French style is in the home, the furniture they choose, the
tables they set, the flowers they arrange, the shopping bags they
tote to market and the sunglasses they wear for driving. French
style is in the food _ not only snails, sauces and mystery meats
but pt, souffls, steak frites (steak and French fries, to you) and
those long, crusty loaves of French bread called baguettes.
</P>
<P>
   The French have an ability unique among cultures, write Suzanne
Slesin and Stafford Cliff, authors of ``French Style'' (Potter,
$35), ``to be perceived as a more cultured, more elegant, more
stylish people, and to make others feel at some disadvantage in not
being born French themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Slesin and Cliff wrote of interior design and the
essentially Gallic way of arranging objects to best advantage, the
statement also applies to French everything, especially fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The French have almost institutionalized their style. So
confident are they that names such as Coco Chanel, Christian Dior,
Givenchy, Herms and Louis Vuitton can exist almost in perpetuity
that those houses now have designers who are German, British,
Belgian or American.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what constitutes French style is the element of
surprise. Yet the surprise is that the French themselves have
trouble pinning down what that element of shock is or how it is
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``French style is good champagne, costly perfume and a great
haircut,'' said Vronique Vienne in ``French Style: How to Think,
Shop and Dress Like a French Woman'' (Express, $20).
</P>
<P>
   When Vienne, born and raised in Paris, moved to the United
States, she found everyone expected her to live up to his or her
ideal of a typical Parisian woman _ ``with a beret, red lipstick
... and a baguette under my arm. Men were disappointed because I
did not wear fishnet stockings. Their wives assumed I was going to
be an outrageous flirt.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Vienne, a French woman does not flaunt her
Frenchness but never lets one forget she is a woman, although she
can't define what a woman is.
</P>
<P>
   Vienne describes the French fashion style as a mixed metaphor _
white socks with black lace, menswear with ruffles. Those surprises
again. But is it instinct or a learned art?
</P>
<P>
   Houstonian June Rives believes that French style is absorbed as
a child.
</P>
<P>
   As president and owner of June Rives Public Relations, she
represents Air France and travels to France frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French overall, especially French women, have a certain
basic, natural, inbred style. It's obvious when you walk down the
street: They accessorize beautifully, wear very fine shoes, the
finest fabrics,'' Rives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the simplest, most modest-income Parisian woman is taught
how to put accessories together _ to look simply chic. It's almost
done without thought. I've never seen a French woman that looked
unkempt,'' she said, ``compared to British men, who look like
unmade beds. The French men and women are always well-dressed, hair
well-groomed. Even if they don't have a lot of money, they'll spend
money to buy one Herms scarf, one good handbag.''

MEXICAN AUDIT PINPOINTS BANK CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Negligent government regulators allowed corrupt
practices to drive Mexico's banking system into insolvency, forcing
a financial rescue that has cost Mexican taxpayers $80 billion over
the past four years, say congressmen who have seen an auditor's
report to be released next week.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a six-month review of the government's handling of the
banking crisis requested by the Mexican Congress, the report
criticizes both shoddy oversight by government agencies assigned to
regulate the banking system before the disaster began in 1995 as
well as corruption and insider-dealing in the bailout that has
followed, the congressmen said.
</P>
<P>
   The audit by Michael W. Mackey, a Toronto auditor who
coordinated five Mexican accounting firms, looked into the
government's takeover of 13 collapsing banks and financial rescue
operations in a dozen others. The government intervened to avoid a
general financial meltdown as soaring interest rates bankrupted
thousands of businesses after the devaluation of the peso in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its apparently sweeping criticisms of President Ernesto
Zedillo's administration, the report has angered opposition leaders
because it will not include details about what they believe were
illegal donations by some banks to Zedillo's Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, during the 1994 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Leftist and independent legislators are accusing the
pro-business National Action Party of cutting a deal with the
government to stifle further investigation, bringing the audit to a
quick conclusion to avoid prolonging the country's financial
turmoil. The government, citing secrecy provisions of the banking
laws, has refused to turn over documents from a bank that made
apparently illegal donations to Zedillo's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're covering this up,'' Pablo Gomez, the legislative
coordinator of the center-left Party of the Democratic Revolution,
or PRD, said of National Action's decision to cooperate with the
government in ending the audit. ``We're not going to become
accomplices to this and we urge National Action to avoid a cover-up
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fauzi Hamdan Amad, the National Action deputy who has overseen
Mackey's work and is one of several lawmakers who reviewed the
report this week, said further confrontation with the government
over the audits could slow down efforts to rescue the financial
system, harming the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's clear in the report is the highly relaxed, even
negligent performance by the government authorities,'' Hamdan said.
``They permitted a series of hot spots that were highly damaging
the system to emerge, without ordering corrective measures.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mackey report will criticize government authorities for
allowing Mexican banks to issue thousands of imprudent loans and
for disguising the banks' ailing financial health by doctoring the
books, Hamdan said in a radio interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Mexican banks that collapsed had extended large
loans to their own executives and stockholders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mackey's report also concludes that once the financial rescue
got under way in 1995, authorities were overly generous in
negotiating the purchase of bad-loan portfolios from some banks,
said Marcelo Ebrard, another congressman who read parts of the
auditor's report.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks that had been poorly managed should have been
allowed to go bankrupt rather than be rescued, the report
concludes, Ebrard said.
</P>
<P>
   The Congress, in which Zedillo's governing party has slightly
fewer than half the seats and opposition parties led by National
Action and the PRD have a thin majority, debated for much of last
year about how vigorously to pursue investigations of wrongdoing by
bankers and government officials.
</P>
<P>
   In December, PRI and National Action lawmakers passed a law that
substituted a new banking rescue agency for the one that executed
the flawed bailout. The law also empowered Mackey to carry out his
audit.
</P>
<P>
   One of Mackey's jobs was to identify ``reportable operations,''
that is, bad-loan portfolios issued by banks in illegal or
particularly irresponsible ways that were subsequently purchased by
the government. Such questionable or corrupt rescue transactions
identified by Mackey are to be nullified, with bank shareholders
absorbing the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Hamdan said Mackey had identified ``an important number'' of
reportable operations, but he declined to say how much they
totaled.
</P>
<P>
   Many Mexicans believed there would be no more bank bailouts
after the establishment of the new agency. But authorities have
identified two banks, Grupo Financiero Serfin and Bancrecer. that
will need to be rescued with huge new injections of cash. The
government announced Thursday its formal takeover of Serfin, at a
cost of $1.4 billion.

 AMAZON.COM CONJURES UP BATTLE OVER BRITISH BOOK  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Amazon.com was stirring things up again Thursday, but not by
discounting best-sellers or losing lots of money.
<P>
   This time, the leading online bookseller's British site was
offering American readers first crack at the latest installment in
the hugely popular Harry Potter series of children's books by
author J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   The series' British publisher, Bloomsbury Children's Books, has
sold U.S publication rights to New York's Scholastic Inc., which
suddenly found itself losing potential customers to its British
counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, brick-and-mortar booksellers in America, which
had been looking ahead to another windfall in sales from the third
Harry Potter book, were crying foul that readers could get their
hands on the latest installment a full two months ahead of the U.S.
publication date.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's illegal for Amazon to import it and resell it,'' said
Margaret Simpson, a children's book specialist at A Clean
Well-Lighted Place for Books in San Francisco. ``It wouldn't be
legal for someone to travel to Europe and then resell the book.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. edition of ``Harry Potter and the Prison of Azkaban''
isn't scheduled to appear until September 8. But it was flying off
the shelves Thursday in London, and quickly jumped to the top of
the sales chart at Amazon's British site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's U.S. site is taking orders for the book, but it's not
yet selling it or advertising that it's available on its British
site.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Net-smart shoppers quickly figured out that the latest
Harry Potter was up for grabs at www.amazon.co.uk, and jumped at
the chance to take advantage of this latest example of the global
economy in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law is shadowy,'' said Bill Petrocelli, a lawyer and
co-owner of Book Passage in Corte Madera. ``These are not pirated
editions. These are legally published editions.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that if Amazon is making the British edition available
to American readers, his own shop will work to stock the book as
quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is having a serious effect on the whole
publication process, and this is just one aspect of it,''
Petrocelli said.
</P>
<P>
   For those late to the Harry Potter phenomenon, the books center
on the bespectacled young hero's magical exploits while studying at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   The first two books in the projected seven-book series occupy
the No. 3 and No. 6 spots on the New York Times Best-seller list,
and booksellers say it is extremely rare for a couple of kids'
books to be on the list simultaneously, especially two from the
same author.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of CHILDREN (99560 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  About 1.7 million Harry Potter books have been sold in the United
States, according to Scholastic Inc.
</P>
<P>
   For Amazon, bringing young Harry to his American fans in a
timely fashion is not a matter of turning a quick buck (or pound).
It is the right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an example of people getting the book they want when
they want it,'' said Bill Curry, a spokesman for the online
bookseller. ``The world is going to have to change to keep up with
the Internet. The Internet makes the notion of territorial rights
archaic.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason that Amazon has not broken any laws, he explained, is
because U.S. copyright statutes allow for citizens who travel
abroad to purchase and bring home a single copy of a
foreign-published book ``for personal use.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stop at Heathrow and buy a book and bring it with you,
you've done nothing wrong,'' Curry said. ``When Amazon.co.uk ships
it you, we've done nothing wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazon's British site notes that buyers with a U.S. address can
only order a single copy.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the cybershopper has not in fact set foot in
Britain, Curry pointed out that Amazon's British servers are on
British soil, so, in that sense, you have made your purchase
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of the series is so great that Scholastic has
been forced to advance its publication dates for each successive
book.
</P>
<P>
   A full year went by from the time the first Harry Potter book
debuted in London to when it arrived on this side of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   For the second book, Scholastic narrowed that gap to seven
months.
</P>
<P>
   With the latest book, the publisher cut the difference down to a
mere two months. But with Amazon U.K. already making copies
available in the United States, Scholastic will offer up the fourth
book at the same time it debuts in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Arthur Levine, who edits the Harry Potter books for
Scholastic's Arthur A. Levine Books imprint, insists that American
readers benefit from displaying a measure of patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been translated for an American audience,'' he said.
``I worked with the author to make sure the American reader has the
same experience as the British reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, young Harry dons a ``jumper'' in the British edition,
while here in the New World he's content to toss on a sweater.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the first book in the series was titled ``Harry
Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,'' while American readers,
unaccustomed to philosophy in their children's books, were treated
to ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be an understatement to say that Mike Kelly's
12-year-old daughter, Alta, enjoys the Harry Potter children's
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``She devoured them,'' the Albany attorney said. ``She read the
last one in one night. It's a big deal among kids her age.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that his daughter is expecting the third Harry Potter
adventure in September, so he has no plans to point and click his
way to an advance peek at the text.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the kid next door shows up at summer camp with it, I'd
go online and get one,'' Kelly admitted.

(UNDATED) ... one good handbag.``
<TEXT>
<P>
   A key ingredient that observers of French style mention
frequently is presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $5 item is wrapped like it cost $50,'' said Rives, ``and
that extends to their clothing style.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for outsiders, it is often difficult to penetrate the
French faade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French are wonderful people,'' said Rives, ``but until you
get to know them, they are a little reserved, especially compared
to Italians, who are sort of like the Texans of the
Mediterranean.''
</P>
<P>
   The French ike to do a lot of entertaining at home, but only
for people they know well. Rives describes their homes as a mixture
of old French with modern _ ``old velvet curtains with a
contemporary suede couch.''
</P>
<P>
   In fashion, the concept of professional business dress for women
does not exist in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wear dark clothes and never wear white sneakers,'' said
Georgene Brandon, head of community relations and special events
for PricewaterhouseCoopers, a business advisory firm with offices
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's how the women put their clothes together _ so chic, and
it looks so uncomplicated,'' she said. ``They have less in their
wardrobes but better quality. They can wear a black skirt and a
white blouse, and it looks so sharp but important and
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon also believes that it is possible to absorb French
style, especially by spending as much time there as possible
``eating, watching and wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After I visited our Paris office, it made me take a new look
at how we do things,'' she said. ``When I told them we had
breakfast meetings at 7 a.m., they were horrified. They start a
breakfast meeting at 9, at the civilized hour, and it's not `grab a
danish and a Slurpee.' They really have tables, are seated and have
a lighter breakfast than we do, with fruit, croissants and
preserves. They don't cram in as many meetings as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley credits some of the French sophistication to geography.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are well-traveled because of where they live. It gives
them more attitude and more cultural knowledge. More people know
more languages and so appear more sophisticated. And, too, they
take monthlong holidays every summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bearden is another Texan who has come to love the French
lifestyle. Bearden has visited France three times in the last two
years and admires the French imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are daring and try things other people wouldn't even
think to try. When you first see some of these things, you think,
`Oh, I wouldn't do that.' But when you try it on ... ''
</P>
<P>
   She most recently fell for a long, sheer skirt worn over a
short, opaque mini, and she bought a black Thierry Mugler skirted
cocktail suit with red velvet cuffs. Now she wears the suit jacket
with a pair of black Gap pants.
</P>
<P>
   But Bearden said she doesn't credit the French woman for style
as much as she credits the French designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me when I travel over there and everyone is dressed
in drab black, summer and winter. But their love of flowers amazes
me. There is a stand on every corner, and they take time out to buy
flowers and appreciate them.''

 &HT;    Retired Gingrich may be busier than ever
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newt Gingrich's eclectic pursuits take him to some
interesting places, like a northern California resort that hosted
an Independence Day weekend clinic on weight and stress reduction.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no mere effort by the former speaker to slim down.
The time spent at the Claremont Resort and Spa was for scholarly
study.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich, a senior fellow at the conservative American
Enterprise Institute in Washington, is researching the future of
health care in the information age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to learn a program is to participate in it
yourself,'' said Gingrich spokesman Mike Shields, rejecting the
idea that Gingrich attended the clinic for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   No longer constrained by the practical politics of running the
House of Representatives or the weight of being second in line to
the presidency after Al Gore, Gingrich is pursuing his interests
and getting paid at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's recent undertakings include signing on as a
consultant with Freddie Mac, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
The 20-year veteran of Congress will provide general advice about
legislation, but he will not be a lobbyist, Freddie Mac spokeswoman
Sharon McHale said.
</P>
<P>
   As a nonlobbyist working on legislative matters, Gingrich does
not have to disclose what he is being paid or worry about running
afoul of House ethics rules.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-speaker is expected to soon debut as a radio commentator.
Los Angeles-based Premiere Radio Networks, the same folks who bring
listeners Rush Limbaugh and Dr. Laura Schlessinger, hopes to
announce soon that Gingrich will do regular spots on topics of his
choosing, spokeswoman Jennifer Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   He has formed a consulting concern, the Gingrich Group, which
has entered into a ``strategic alliance'' with the accounting giant
PriceWaterhouse Coopers, said PriceWaterhouse spokesman Dave
Nestor. There are no financial ties, Nestor said.
</P>
<P>
   While still claiming Marietta as his home base, Gingrich also
has signed on as a senior fellow at Stanford University's Hoover
Institution, joined the board of the buyout firm Forstmann, Little
&AMP; Co. and traveled the country making speeches for reportedly up to
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The frenetic pace is vintage Gingrich, part of what alternately
attracted and frustrated his congressional colleagues. Now, though,
the time is all his.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got a person like Gingrich who's got the kind of
mind he has, for all its good and all its ill, anybody who thinks
they can use his eclectic mind for their benefit, it makes some
sense to latch onto it,'' said Rich Galen, a longtime Gingrich ally
who is executive director of GOPAC, Gingrich's onetime political
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The striking aspect of Gingrich's schedule is that he has
managed to stay somewhat in the public eye while resolutely
rebuffing all interview requests. Gingrich has not granted a formal
interview since leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a situation where he wants to learn how to do new
things,'' Galen said. ``He told me shortly after the turn of the
year that he spent two days with the senior leadership of a major
corporation to learn how deal with global challenges. I asked him
if he got paid and he said, `No, I was learning how to do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Learning about preventive health measures is what took Gingrich
to the Claremont, a landmark hotel in the hills above San Francisco
Bay, said David Wallace, spokesman for the American Enterprise
Institute. The program was run by Dr. Dean Ornish, who developed a
regimen of exercise, diet and stress reduction to ward off heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich brought his daughter, Kathy Lubbers, who suffers from
rheumatoid arthritis, to see whether she might benefit from
Ornish's program, Shields said.
</P>
<P>
   The poolside clinic included a meal of veggie burgers, tofu hot
dogs, fat-free coleslaw and soy-based ice cream, the San Francisco
Chronicle reported.
</P>
<P>
   Ornish has worked with President Clinton on his diet and
consulted with White House chefs. He directs the Preventive
Medicine Research Institute in Sausalito, Calif.

HOW TO ACQUIRE THE LOOK &HT;    w/FRENCH STYLE MAINBAR &HT;    By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) While the subject of what French style is wanders all
over the map, the guidelines on how to acquire it are more
specific.
</P>
<P>
   First, study French. Not only the language but the style. June
Rives, owner of June Rives Public Relations in Houston, said she
learns a lot about French style from magazines such as the French
Marie Claire and Elle, ``but obviously, direct observation is
best.'' For example, last October when she was in Paris, every
woman was in black leather _ ``just like in L.A.'' Visit antiques
shops to learn about French styles, museums to see French art and
foreign movies to see the French lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Keep up on fashion. While the French are not label-conscious _
you won't see designer names on their clothing or a French woman in
Chanel's big double-C jewelry _ they are very aware of fashion. For
example, the French are currently gaga over American Michael Kors'
designs for the French line Celine, and the newest Paris Gap is
opening on the Champs lyses.
</P>
<P>
   Be daring. Most fashion finds at French flea markets tend to the
exotic _ beads, paisley shawls, embroidered jackets, blouses,
skirts and shawls. These are often great for party or evening wear.
Try an embroidered Indian jacket with a pair of good white or black
pants, adding a shawl, dangling earrings or cuff bracelets. Sheer,
beaded dresses from the 1920s are perfect evening attire worn over
matching slips. Watch out for vintage bags that tend to look dated.
</P>
<P>
   Age gracefully. One reason Parisian women appear to age well is
because, surrounded by designers, they stay current on fashion,
said Gayla Bentley, a fashion consultant who also leads shopping
and style tours to Paris. ``People of all economic levels have more
of an understanding and respect for designers than in America, even
if they can't afford those clothes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Walk more. Europeans walk a lot, so despite the rich sauces, the
olive oil and the wine, many don't find it hard to stay fit and
trim.
</P>
<P>
   Forget faux body parts. ``In the United States,'' said Bentley,
``women spend a lot of money having fake nails put on, but no one
does that in France. They spend money on skin care, not nails or
boobs. Everything is real. And at St. Tropez and the Riviera, women
of all ages are going topless and proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dress simply but chicly. French women almost never go over the
top, and while they buy less, they buy the best they can afford. If
they cannot afford the very best, they visit it often to
familiarize themselves with what makes it best. Then they buy the
best similar styles they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Eschew fashion fakes. Wearing the real thing is important to the
French. They will never carry a fake Louis Vuitton or a fake Rolex.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overdo. Especially accessories. One good piece of jewelry
or one Herms scarf with an Herms or Louis Vuitton bag does the
French trick.
</P>
<P>
   Make up naturally. Most French women are minimalists in their
makeup and, with well-cared-for skin, they can afford to be. You
will never see the typical French woman in extreme rouge or eye
makeup. Their hair is simple, in ponytails or chignons or cropped
short.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule skin care. French women take very good care of their
skin, said Laura Mercier, whose cosmetic line will be joined by a
new line of skin-care products in September. The French learn skin
care at a very early age and usually avoid tanning.
</P>
<P>
   Wear perfume. But wear it sparingly. A pleasing fragrance is
like a petit cadeau (a little gift) that one person offers another.
Most women enjoy catching a whiff of men's fragrances as much as
men enjoy women in perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Iron things. The French often iron their underwear, socks and
jeans. Why? Because clothes dryers are not as common in France as
in the States, so ironing softens fabrics. The coincidental removal
of wrinkles gives the French a more polished look.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overdecorate. Europeans in general avoid the decorated
look in homes, preferring an eclectic mix of antiques and
contemporary furnishings. The French would never have an entire
house of French provincial or Louis the anything.
</P>
<P>
   Do the unexpected. Paint your bathroom yellow, your claw-footed
tub aubergine, and hang family portraits on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Acquire heritage. If you did not inherit antique furnishings,
buy some. The French are famous for haunting flea markets,
especially the Marche aux Puces, where one can find everything from
tassels to tinsel. Even in a thoroughly modern loft, a single
antique chair or table can lend credence.
</P>
<P>
   Rethink country. With the American penchant for casualness,
country styles have lingered for decades now. For a more
sophisticated look, try country French. You know the look _ olive
jars, lots of natural woods, baskets, lace curtains, blue, white
and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Don't dust. Although Paris apartments owned by Americans are
immaculate, clean enough to eat off the floors, the French are not
allergic to a little dust. It gives a patina of age to newer
furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Develop attitude. If, as Mercier said, French women are full of
complexes and insecurities, they cover it well. The secret is in
being the best you can be. Look your best and don't worry.
</P>
<P>
   Get a dog. And train it. Dogs are everywhere in France, almost
accessories, said Bentley, but they are well-behaved and treated
with respect.

ARGENTINE TRUCKERS END STRIKE AFTER GOVERNMENT RETREATS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ Tens of thousands of truck drivers
halted a three-day-old nationwide strike Thursday after the lower
house of Congress voted to postpone a new vehicle tax intended to
cover a $100-a-month raise for public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers and shopkeepers, who were beginning to suffer
shortages of milk and other perishable foods, were relieved by the
announcement that the strike was over, as were business leaders and
economists, who feared the strike could worsen an already deepening
recession.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's retreat under pressure by an interest group
underscored the weakness of President Carlos Saul Menem as his
second term winds down. It also raised questions about how the
government would pay for the $700 million raise for teachers when
its deficit is widening to levels that are alarming international
bankers and investors.
</P>
<P>
   The government's estimated fiscal deficit, currently projected
at $5.1 billion by year's end, has already been raised three times
this year and is approximately double the total originally agreed
to in negotiations with the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The vote by the Chamber of Deputies late Wednesday night gives
the vehicle owners until Nov. 15 to pay what amounts to a tax of 1
to 1.5 percent of the value of their vehicles. That effectively
puts off the confrontation between the truck owners and government
until two weeks after the coming presidential election, and
potentially will create a major headache for the next president,
who is to take office in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is we have stopped the loss of production
peacefully,'' Defense Minister Jorge Dominguez told reporters. He
emphasized that the vehicle tax had not been rolled back, but
simply delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to go along with the Chamber and approve
the tax suspension next week. Some members of the Alianza
opposition coalition charged that the congressional action
represented a dangerous surrender to a tax revolt by a special
interest group that was likely to produce more revolts, but the
opposition is divided on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Menem's aides used threatening language against the strikers all
week, and on Tuesday the Cabinet even discussed the possibility of
enacting a state of siege that would suspend constitutional
guarantees and give the military and police broad powers to arrest
striking truck drivers and seize their vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Menem signed a decree calling the strike illegal, and warned
that he would send Congress legislation declaring a state of siege.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed state of siege was attacked by the Alianza
presidential candidate, Fernando de la Rua, the mayor of Buenos
Aires, and by officials in Menem's own Justicialist Party. Congress
would most likely have rejected any presidential call for emergency
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials backed off their tough talk on Wednesday
afternoon after the Buenos Aires governor, Eduardo Duhalde, the
Justicialist presidential candidate, said publicly, ``There aren't
any difficulties serious enough to justify declaring a state of
siege.''
</P>
<P>
   Duhalde worked behind the scenes to cobble together a compromise
solution in the Chamber of Deputies that would satisfy the demands
of the truckers without rolling back the tax altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, a congressional committee voted to cut back
the tax by 70 percent for the drivers while allowing taxpayers who
have already paid the tax on their trucks, automobiles, boats and
planes to deduct the amount from their next income tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   But Duhalde maneuvered to shelve the bill in an act that showed
that the Buenos Aires governor had taken control of the governing
party's congressional delegation and effectively replaced Menem as
the party's leader.
</P>
<P>
   The two major trucking associations called the strike Monday in
protest against the vehicle tax, and threatened to block the
nation's highways indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The strike caused fuel shortages around the country, and
supermarkets reported they barely had enough supplies for the
coming three-day holiday weekend.

 SAFEWAY STOCK DOWN DESPITE GOOD EARNINGS  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Safeway Inc. stock declined slightly Thursday on
weak sales news, despite earnings that beat estimates.
<P>
   The Pleasanton, Calif., company reported that comparable-store
sales, or sales at locations open at least a year, rose a mere 1.5
percent in the second quarter, which ended June 19. That compares
to a comparable-store increase of 4.1 percent for all of 1998
versus 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Shares dropped about $2 over the course of the day but partly
recovered to close at $52.13, down 88 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable-store sales growth ``was not expected to be under 2
percent,'' said Elaine Hahn, president of Hahn Capital Management
in San Francisco, a Safeway investor. ``The top line clearly came
in under analysts' and the company's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   She blamed the shortfall in part on pricing pressure from
discounters like Wal-Mart. Safeway has also been forced to keep
prices of its private-label Safeway Select merchandise low because
of price cuts by manufacturers of branded merchandise like
breakfast cereal, Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Dominick's stores are also performing worse than expected,
Hahn added.
</P>
<P>
   Total Safeway sales grew 13 percent to $6.3 billion in the
quarter, a gain attributed almost entirely to the acquisition of
Dominick's of Chicago in November.
</P>
<P>
   Net income rose 22 percent to $236.4 million, or 46 cents per
share, compared to analysts' consensus estimate of 44 cents.
</P>
<P>
   On the upside, Safeway reported that gross margins rose to 29.9
percent of sales from 29.01 percent in the second quarter of 1998.
Safeway attributed the improvement to buying efficiency and an
increase in private-label goods as a percentage of sales.
</P>
<P>
   Operating and administrative expenses declined to 22.49 percent
of sales, the 25th consecutive quarter of improvement, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Richardson, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities,
described Thursday's news as a temporary negative. ``Overall,
Safeway is an extremely strong company,'' she said.

 ANALYSIS: REFLECTING ON CLINTON'S LEGACY FOR THE POOR (With (jw) 
 By JASON DePARLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lamenting the life of the Mississippi Delta, racing
from an Appalachian hamlet to an inner city Walgreen's, embracing
the vast desolation of the land of the Sioux _ these are unusual
things for a president to do.
</P>
<P>
   They are especially unusual gestures from this president, a
self-styled guardian of middle-class interests who has kept a
careful distance from the truly down-and-out. For years,
old-fashioned liberals have urged President Clinton to embrace the
cause of the poor more directly.
</P>
<P>
   But as he finally heeded their advice, dashing from ghetto to
hamlet to barrio this week to highlight the limits of American
prosperity, his curious tour seemed to arouse an equally curious
response: indifference, if not outright hostility among his natural
allies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but be skeptical,'' said Sen. Paul Wellstone,
D-Minn., though he himself undertook a similar tour just two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``An act of futility,'' wrote Carl Rowan, the syndicated
columnist, in a column published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   James Patterson of Brown University, a historian of anti-poverty
movements, said, ``I don't think this terribly exciting news.''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the river of dismissive reaction, it is worth mulling over
an unconventional thought: It is possible that historians will find
more to praise in the Clinton anti-poverty record _ perhaps even in
this mad-dash trip itself _ than meets the eye.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reasons for the skeptical reaction are obvious ones
that relate to the president himself. It is late in his second
term. He does not control Congress. He is armed with a modest
legislative proposal. Tainted by sexual scandal, he is an imperfect
leader of a moral crusade. And in some anti-poverty circles, he
will never be forgiven for signing a 1996 welfare bill that imposed
significant new restrictions on aid.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a reflexive national pessimism as far as
the poor are concerned. For decades, the world-weary prediction
that the poor are getting poorer seemed a safe enough bet.
</P>
<P>
   But the poor are no longer getting poorer _ not most of them
anyway. And while until this week the president has avoided casting
himself as an anti-poverty crusader, he has quietly assembled a
long list of anti-poverty achievements. Their final effect remains
to be seen, of course, as does the result of the welfare
legislation Clinton prematurely insists on calling a success.
</P>
<P>
   But some of his anti-poverty accomplishments already seem large,
like his expansions of the earned income tax credit. Though it has
a clumsy name and complicated rules, the program now distributes
nearly $30 billion a year in subsidies to low-wage workers.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more modest, like the Americorps program for
volunteers. Clinton has also won significant expansions of child
care, tax breaks for distressed areas called ``empowerment zones,''
a modest raise in the minimum wage, expansions of Head Start, new
school-to-work programs and significant increases in health
insurance for the children of the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in most corners of the anti-poverty world, Clinton fatigue
runs strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ways I preserve my mental health is to read as
little as possible about Bill Clinton,'' said Christopher Jencks, a
sociologist at Harvard University and a leading anti-poverty
authority.
</P>
<P>
   That was Jencks' reflexive response, when asked about the
president's trip. But five minutes later, he was acknowledging that
he did see things to praise in the Clinton record. Adding his
initiatives together, Jencks said, he saw a consistency in the
president's attempts to create a kind of work-based safety net,
with less welfare but more support for low-wage workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To move toward a more work-oriented system will make it a lot
easier to get things done for poor people over the next 30 years,''
Jencks said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Clinton came of age idolizing John F. Kennedy, it was the
style of Robert F. Kennedy he was self-consciously echoing this
week. In the spring of 1967, Kennedy, then a senator from New York,
took a famous tour of the Mississippi Delta, where he encountered
hungry children with bloated stomachs and open, running sores.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News had its cameras rolling, and the combination of
compelling footage and Kennedy's charisma, helped push hunger onto
the national agenda. Though Robert Kennedy won only modest
expansions of anti-hunger programs before his assassination in
1968, a significant increase in the food stamp program passed a few
years after his death.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy also made a stop at the Pine Ridge reservation in South
Dakota in the spring of 1968. ``All across America, people were
watching that,'' Clinton recalled while visiting the reservation on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the very gestures Clinton avoided until now. And
three decades later, they inevitably carry a different cultural
baggage. In Kennedy's day, it was possible to imagine that federal
concern alone would be enough to provide a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Now the country is less innocent _ inclined to believe Ronald
Reagan's famous line: ``We fought a war on poverty, and poverty
won.'' Wary of being dismissed as an old-fashioned, naive liberal,
Clinton has avoided bold poverty promises or even bold anti-poverty
photo opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   In addressing the question of timing this week, the president's
aides have said that the economy is finally strong enough,
businesses are hungry enough, and the middle class is secure enough
to push for a broader expansion of prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   If the country does not act ``at this time of prosperity,''
Clinton said, then ``we'll never get around to it,'' and ``we will
have failed to meet a moral obligation.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But that was not enough to repair the burned bridges between
Clinton and his welfare critics. Robert Kennedy's trip to the
Mississippi Delta was staffed by a young lawyer, and devoted ally,
named Peter Edelman.
</P>
<P>
   In a later life, Edelman went on to become a welfare official in
the Clinton administration, and a deeply disillusioned one. He
resigned in 1996, saying that Clinton's decision to turn the
welfare program back to the states _ with less overall money and
new time limits _ represented an abandonment of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Watching one former boss trying to emulate another this week,
Edelman found much to criticize. While the overall poverty rate has
declined in the Clinton years, to 13.3 percent from 15.1 percent,
Edelman cited evidence suggesting circumstances among the very
poorest had gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   And Edelman bristled at the president's talk of ``pockets of
poverty.'' With child poverty rates still hovering at nearly 20
percent, he said, deprivation is far too prevalent to be described
as a mere pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the administration, Edelman sent the president a memo,
urging him to take up the cause of helping needy adolescents make
the transition to adult life. He never got a response.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has never been comfortable in talking about poverty,''
Edelman said. ``I think on balance, Bill Clinton has hurt poor
people because of the welfare bill. This is just too little too
late.''

SPORTS COLUMN: BASEBALL'S PISTACHIO ICE CREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you were thinking about going to see the Yankees
and the Mets at Shea Stadium Friday night, tomorrow afternoon or
Sunday afternoon, you'd better have a ticket by now. If not,
fuhgeddaboutit. All three games are sold out.
</P>
<P>
   That's the bottom-line rebuttal to anyone who wondered, as both
Joe Torre and Bobby Valentine did for different reasons, if this
season's six Met-Yankee games, up from three in each of the
previous two seasons, were three too many.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Yankees won two of three from the Mets at Yankee
Stadium five weeks ago, Torre dreaded this weekend's rematch at
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nightmare for us,'' the Yankee manager said at the
time. ``When you're not competing against this team for a spot in
the standings, I think six is too many. It's overkill. It's like
trying to eat a gallon of ice cream instead of just a pint. I hope
the fans like six games, but it may be a little too much.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not for New York-New York fans. Judging by the ticket sales at
the Stadium and at Shea, the fans have already consumed that gallon
of ice cream. The flavor? Pistachio, the color of money.
</P>
<P>
   The Met-Yankee total of 168,404 customers five weeks ago was the
largest for a three-game series at the remodeled Yankee Stadium
since it opened in 1976; the Sunday night assembly of 56,295 was
the largest in the remodeled Stadium for a regular-season night
game and for a regular-season game not on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend the Mets expect to approach, if not surpass, the
total of 160,740 that witnessed last season's three Yankee games at
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   All this attention might be a nightmare for Torre, who
understandably is more concerned with the Boston Red Sox and the
other American League contenders, but it's a midsummer night's
dream for all the Yankee and Met aficionados.
</P>
<P>
   Not for Bobby Valentine, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for the fans; they make up this game,'' the Mets'
manager has said, ``but it's tough to have to play the best team in
baseball six times when none of the other teams in our league do.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, six aren't fair.
</P>
<P>
   But what, in baseball or in life, is fair? Is it fair that the
outfield dimensions in Yankee Stadium and Shea Stadium are
different? Is it fair that the Yankees can't use their designated
hitter, and their pitchers must bat in Shea, a National League ball
park? Was it fair that the Mets were allowed to use a DH in Yankee
Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   Two different ball parks, two different sets of rules. That's
not fair to teams supposedly playing the same game. But that's the
way baseball is.
</P>
<P>
   The fans don't seem to care what's fair for the Mets or the
Yankees. They just keep buying tickets. And that's the bottom-line
argument why Major League Baseball, in devising its future
interleague formula, intends to maintain the New York-New York
games along with the other natural rivalries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to adjust the interleague play to other divisions,''
Bud Selig, the commissioner of baseball, said, ``but we don't want
to disturb the natural rivalries.''
</P>
<P>
   By next season or in 2001, the Yankees and the Mets, for
example, might be playing the other league's Central or West
Division teams instead of its East teams as they do now, but the
Yankees and the Mets would still play each other each season in
order to maintain their natural rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in Chicago for the first Cubs-White Sox series this
year,'' Selig said, ``it reminded me of going to a Bears-Packers
game. You can't produce that excitement anywhere else except in the
natural rivalries.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine other natural rivalries exist: Dodgers-Angels,
Giants-Athletics, Rangers-Astros, Indians-Reds, Phillies-Orioles,
Blue Jays-Expos, Marlins-Devil Rays, Twins-Brewers,
Cardinals-Royals.
</P>
<P>
   The interleague schedule has tried to create a Braves-Red Sox
interleague rivalry based on Boston's being the Braves' ancestral
home before moving to Milwaukee and Atlanta. Six other teams are
without a rival that isn't already locked into a closer geographic
matchup _ the Tigers and Mariners in the AL, the Pirates, Rockies,
Padres and Diamondbacks in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees and the Mets have proved that the essence of
interleague baseball, the natural geographic rivalries, is here to
stay; that a gallon of ice cream is as easy to digest as a pint.
Especially pistachio. &QL;

 UNION BANK PLANS AMERICAN-STYLE OVERHAUL, JOB CUTS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Union Bank of California, the largest
Japanese-controlled bank in the United States, is about to go
through a wrenching, American-style reorganization that is expected
to cost more than 1,000 jobs.
<P>
   The initiative, dubbed Mission Excel, is in the final planning
stages and will go to top executives and the bank's board for
approval later this month. The bank expects to announce details to
employees and the public in August, and then put the program into
effect over a 21-month period.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of San Francisco's Union, the second-largest bank
headquartered on the West Coast after Wells Fargo, say the shakeup
will include a mix of cost-cutting and revenue-generating steps.
The aim, they say, is to bring the bank to the fighting trim of its
all-American rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Union spent about 61.5 cents on overhead for every
dollar of revenue brought in, compared to an average of about 59
cents per dollar for other large banks. Mission Excel's goal is to
cut expenses to 55 cents for every dollar of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the decade, as one American bank after another
launched a ``downsizing`` program, Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi,
Union's Japanese majority owner, vetoed harsh cost-cutting
medicine. The parent company feared harm would be done to employee
and customer morale.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan, the bank was struggling with bad loans amid the
country's financial &LR;   &LR; crisis, so it raised cash by selling part of
its stake to U.S. investors early this year. Those buyers, mainly
big institutions, insisted that the bank take dramatic action to
rein in costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we could commit to them that we would be as efficient
as our peer group, no one would take our stock,'' said Vice
Chairman Robert Walker, who is overseeing the project. That, he
said, gave the bank ``a rare opportunity to impose discipline on
the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said the bank will shed up to 15 percent of its
roughly 9,800 full-time positions, mostly through attrition, not
layoffs. ``We expect actual pink slips to amount to less than 5
percent'' of total job cuts, said Vice Chairman Richard Hartnack,
the bank's consumer banking chief.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the job cuts will take place in Southern
California, where Union's workforce is concentrated, Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   The Union vice chairman estimated the bank will cut $2 dollars
of expenses for every additional dollar of revenue raised. But he
said the bank hasn't set specific cost-cutting or revenue targets
for getting to its 55 percent expense-to-revenue goal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect approximately $90 million to $120 million in
annual cost savings, roughly 10 percent of total expenses.
``There's pain involved in the process,'' said Joseph Morford, an
analyst with First Security Van Kasper in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the 1990s, dozens of big American banks _ including
such institutions as old-money Chase Manhattan and nouveau riche
Fleet Financial in the Northeast _ launched ``re-engineering''
programs to juice up profits in the face of slow revenue growth.
</P>
<P>
   Pains and Gains
</P>
<P>
   Those programs had a mixed track record. Some banks that went
through the process thrived, such as Michigan's Comerica. Others,
such as Pennsylvania's CoreStates, slipped into a vicious circle of
falling morale and slowing business growth, and wound up being
sold.
</P>
<P>
   To skeptics, the re-engineering initiatives amounted to
slash-and-burn job cutbacks under a fancy name.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are processes that sap the strength of the
institution,'' said New York consultant Charles Wendel, a critic of
such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Banks going through reorganizations typically say they will
match job cuts with revenue gains, but the promises often prove
hollow, Wendel said. ``It's a lot easier to fire people than to
implement price increases,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Union's initiative doesn't reflect weak performance. Last year,
the bank posted record profits of $466 million and a solid, if not
spectacular, return on equity of 16.39 percent, slightly better
than average.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy Workers
</P>
<P>
   People close to the bank say the shakeup is taking a toll on
employees, especially middle- and senior-level managers who've been
drafted to work on the program and whose jobs may be at risk. Some
staff members have taken to calling the program ``Mission Expel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's had a pretty tough impact on morale,'' said one former
Union manager. ``But the word inside the bank is that they have to
go through with it. They're too top heavy.''
</P>
<P>
   Union was created in 1996 following the merger of Bank of Tokyo
and Mitsubishi Bank in Japan. The old Union Bank, which was Bank of
Tokyo's San Francisco subsidiary, then combined with Bank of
California, owned by Mitsubishi, to form Union Bank of California.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese-controlled banks in the United States, which include
Los Angeles's Sanwa Bank California and Tokai Bank of California,
generally avoided such traumatic shakeups. While they didn't offer
Japanese-style lifetime job promises to employees, they rarely
carried out the kinds of large-scale staff purges common among
their American peers.
</P>
<P>
   Union has long been the most Americanized Japanese-run bank
here. While Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi owns about 64 percent of the
bank's stock, profit-hungry U.S. investors hold most of the
remainder. Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi executives hold the chairman
and CEO slots, but American managers run Union's main corporate and
consumer banking units.
</P>
<P>
   Resisted Trims
</P>
<P>
   The bank's American executives, whose pay included options on
Union's stock, had long pressed to make Union leaner. But instead,
the bank became more bloated after it merged with Bank of
California, and the combined institution moved at a snail's pace to
shutter overlapping operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese didn't have the stomach to do big cost cuts,''
said a former Union manager.
</P>
<P>
   Union's sale of $750 million in stock in February was the thing
that finally prompted the bank to act. Potential investors told the
bank they would pass unless Union took dramatic steps to improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Union was ``viewed as a big, lumbering company and wasn't
getting any respect on Wall Street,'' said Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst
Campbell Chaney.
</P>
<P>
   To help plan Mission Excel, Union hired EHS Partners, a Los
Angeles consulting firm whose principals had engineered the
successful reorganization at Comerica.
</P>
<P>
   EHS suggested a radical procedure: Take about 40 of the bank's
most senior managers, move them to a huge, cubicle-filled room at
headquarters and put them to work full time on Mission Excel.
</P>
<P>
   The executives were told to comb every nook and cranny of the
bank's 61 business units and look for ways to cut costs or raise
revenue by 50 percent, a target intended to make them stretch to
come up with creative ideas. Rank-and-file employees were also
asked to suggest ways to save money or raise revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the thousands of ideas put on the table amounted to
small change, such as trimming the number of manuals the bank uses
from 29 to nine. But some of the proposals go deep.
</P>
<P>
   The bank may shutter as many as half of its 20 telephone
centers, Walker said. Six of those centers are in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   New Responsibilities
</P>
<P>
   And while the bank probably won't close more than a handful of
its more than 240 branches, job responsibilities inside those
offices will change, Hartnack said. The result would be about one
fewer full-time staff person per branch, not counting any staff
increases that might be needed to handle business growth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the bank will probably increase spending on
Internet-related activities and on overseas operations, Hartnack
said.
</P>
<P>
   Union has a reputation for providing high-quality service,
something that skeptics warn could be jeopardized by a shakeup. But
the bank insists it has no choice. ``The times no longer permit the
old way of doing business,'' said Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wendel doesn't buy that argument. ``This concept of
shrinking to greatness does not work,'' he said.

TECHNOLOGY SHARES LIFT NASDAQ TO ANOTHER RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks swept the NASDAQ market to its
fifth record in six sessions Thursday, while other widely watched
gauges sagged, rallied, then faded again to finish lower.
</P>
<P>
   Investors took heart from Yahoo's better-than-expected profit
report, issued late Wednesday, which was seen as a harbinger of a
parade of favorable quarterly results by high-technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks were also supported by strong demand for $10.8 billion of
corporate debt securities, which revived a sinking bond market. The
yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury issue, for example, rose as
high as 6.10 percent at midday before the price of the bond
rallied, pushing the yield to 5.99 percent at the close, down from
6.04 on Wednesday. The price and yield move in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed at how well bonds did,'' said Philip Orlando,
chief investment officer at Value Line Asset Management. ``If we
can get some constructive inflation data next week, we can get this
rally into gear.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, tobacco stocks were mostly lower in continued
reaction to a Florida jury's verdict that the industry conspired to
hide the ill-effects of cigarettes. And retailing stocks, with a
few exceptions, failed to benefit from a surprisingly strong tally
of June sales. Sales in stores that have been open at least a year
rose 6.5 percent last month, according to the Goldman, Sachs retail
composite index.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris, which fell 2 5/8 after the adverse court decision
late Wednesday, clawed back 3/8, to finish at 38 1/4. Brooke Group
fell 1 9/16, to 21 15/16; R.J. Reynolds, 3/4, to 30 1/8, and
Universal, 13/16, to 28 15/16.
</P>
<P>
   Costco, which operates wholesale warehouses, jumped 4 1/8, to 86
9/16, but Consolidated Stores, which said it expected to report a
loss for the current quarter, skidded 6 7/8, to 16 1/2. Wal-Mart
fell 1, to 47; J.C. Penney, 1 1/2, to 47 1/4; Sears, 15/16, to 46
1/16, and Saks, 3 5/16, to 26.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ market finished ahead by 1.05 percent at a record
2,771.86 as MCI Worldcom jumped 4 13/16, to 90, and most
computer-related stocks posted multipoint gains.
</P>
<P>
   Among the high-technology standouts was Hewlett-Packard, which
surged 6 1/2, to 105 13/16, to help support the Dow Jones
industrial average, which, nevertheless, finished with a loss of
60.47 points, or half of 1 percent, at 11,126.89. J.P. Morgan, down
4 13/16 at 141 3/16, was the biggest loser in the group of 30 blue
chips.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow pulled out of an early 95-point slump to show a 24-point
rise at midsession, only to slip back into negative territory, as
investors appeared to cash in profits. Some money may have been
shifted into the bond deals, $7.8 billion by Ford Motor and $3
billion by Freddie Mac, that came in the wake of the government's
big sale of inflation-indexed bonds on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Profit taking was also evident in Yahoo, which had run up
sharply in advance of reporting earnings late on Wednesday that
beat even the so-called whisper figure. The stock of Yahoo, the
biggest Internet search service, closed down 2 5/8 at 164 7/16
after trading as high as 175 1/4. It fell 8 1/16 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   With the technology sector strong, however, Dell Computer gained
1 5/8, and Compaq rose 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index finished with little
change, down 1.44, or one-tenth of 1 percent, at 1,394.42 as big
gains in a relatively few heavily weighted stocks made up for the
fact that 292 of its components fell, while just 187 gained.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the comprehensive Wilshire 5000 eased six hundredths
of a percent, but the Russell 2000 gauge, composed entirely of
small-company stocks, advanced nearly one-half of 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney issued its annual list of 15 most
attractive stocks, which included the sharply rising MCI Worldcom.
The others are Albertson's, Allstate, Amgen, Bank of New York,
Dayton Hudson, Electronic Data, Fort James, Honeywell, Lucent,
Marsh &AMP; McLennan, Mobil, Pitney Bowes, Raytheon and Tyco.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange expanded to 830.62 million
from 776.8 million as 1,315 issues rose and 1,684 fell.
</P>
<P>
   Major overseas markets were mixed, with none changing by as much
as 1 percent except for the Bovespa in Brazil, down 2 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Togo West, the embattled secretary of veterans
affairs, has told President Clinton that he plans to resign before
the end of the term but has set no date for his departure, a White
House official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman at the Veterans Affairs Department would say
little more than that West did not intend to leave in the near
future and would continue his work through the ``formulation of the
budget for the fiscal year 2001,'' a task that will presumably take
him well into next winter at the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. West has set no date to resign,'' said the spokeswoman,
Laurie Tranter. ``He has not submitted his resignation, and he has
not been asked to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Since February, West has been criticized by several veterans'
groups on the ground that he has failed to push for adequate budget
increases for his mammoth agency, especially for its health
programs. At a breakfast meeting Thursday with senior officials of
five leading veterans' organizations, the secretary said he agreed
that the department needed better financing, several participants
said. He also declared that despite reports that he would be
leaving, which were first published in The Los Angeles Times on
Wednesday, he had no intention of departing soon.
</P>
<P>
   The department's current budget is $38 billion. For the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1, the Clinton administration is seeking
$42.5 billion, of which $17.3 billion would be earmarked for
veterans' health programs. Veterans' organizations want at least
$1.5 billion more for the health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, West sent a memorandum to the director of the White
House Office of Management and Budget in March, objecting to the
proposed budget for his department and asking for greater financing
to demonstrate the administration's commitment to veterans. But the
White House did not comply.
</P>
<P>
   West has also been criticized for extensive travels while in
office, and an investigation to determine whether all his trips
have been legitimate business is being conducted by the
department's inspector general. In April, Sen. Christopher Bond,
R-Mo., said there ``appears to be a pattern of inappropriate
practices at the highest level of the department.''
</P>
<P>
   West has denied any inappropriate spending.

THE 3-POINTED STAR PROMISES THE MOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 11) 
(jt) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The mercury is soaring and the power is out. It's time to hit
the streets, and it sure would feel great to go topless. In a
convertible, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The newest ragtop on the market _ indeed, the only all-new
convertible this summer _ is the Mercedes-Benz CLK320 Cabriolet,
which actually made its debut last fall in more temperate weather.
</P>
<P>
   The CLK line, which began in 1998 with a six-cylinder coupe that
fell between the compact C-Class and full-size E-Class, was yet
another effort to inject some pizazz into Mercedes' once-stodgy
product line. For '99, Mercedes added a V8 coupe and this
six-cylinder convertible. The company's goal is to stir the market
for luxury coupes and convertibles just as it recast the roadster
segment with its SLK230 Kompressor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CLK's have sold briskly, with waiting lists in some regions;
buyers can expect to pay list price. And while the Cabriolet did
not excite me as the SLK did, it turned heads while providing an
elegant way to take in the sun and stars.
</P>
<P>
   Although the coupe and Cabriolet have an obvious resemblance,
Mercedes says both CLK's were designed from the start as distinct
models. They share few panels behind the windshield pillars.
</P>
<P>
   But both have sweeping, slice-through-the-wind lines and sleekly
elegant profiles. It is a look that got a lot of attention, and
particularly appealed to my 40-something women friends. Inside, the
Cabriolet has soft leather and touches of burl walnut. The car is
reasonably roomy and comfortable for four adults, and its front
seats move automatically when the seatback is folded, helping rear
passengers to get in. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though four adults can go for a spin, they had better travel
light. Although the CLK looks rather large on the outside, it
provides minimal storage. Officially, Mercedes says the trunk
measures 9.5 cubic feet with the top up, and about two-thirds of
that with the top down. But the car barely accommodated the basics
for two people on a three-day trip in Georgia. With the top down to
soak in the Southern sun, we could fit only one suitcase in the
trunk; the other stood upright on the back seat. It's a good thing
we weren't carrying golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
   The three-layer insulated power top can be raised and lowered in
seconds; when down, it disappears under a sleek panel that the
company says was inspired by its race cars of the 1950's. With the
top up, the interior is coupe-quiet. Indeed, the well-made top,
along with a traction control and a winter-shift mode for the
automatic transmission, makes this a convertible that could easily
serve year-round duty in the North. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The first Cabriolet I drove performed flawlessly. The power top
on the second car, however, occasionally froze in midair. I got it
down by nudging it or starting the process over. That was the only
quality problem I encountered.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the original coupe, the CLK Cabriolet has a 3.2-liter,
215-horsepower V6. The engine is not overpowered for this
relatively heavy, 3,669-pound car. Mercedes says it can run from a
stop to 60 miles an hour in 7.7 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The power is delivered smoothly and elegantly, in keeping with
the car's overall grace. The ride is comfortable, typical of a
Mercedes, and the handling is a bit ponderous; the Cabriolet looks
sleek, but it performs like a rather large, heavy automobile. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cabriolet comes with most of the coupe's equipment,
including a dual-zone automatic climate control, odor-blocking air
filters, 10-way power seats with memory settings for three drivers,
security alarm, cruise control and integrated garage door opener.
The premium Bose audio system includes a weather band and a
cassette player; a CD changer is optional.
</P>
<P>
   The typical Mercedes safety features are here, including side
air bags and Baby-Smart, which deactivates the passenger bag if it
detects the installation of a child seat. In a rollover, a roll bar
deploys and head restraints extend in less than a second. A yaw
control, the Electronic Stability Program, is optional to help
prevent fishtailing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All this class isn't cheap. The CLK320 Cabriolet starts at
around $48,000, about $7,000 more than the coupe. But think of it
this way: Adjusted for inflation, this is one of the least
expensive four-passenger convertibles ever to wear a three-pointed
star.  &QL;

MINDING THE MEETINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 11) 
(jt) 
 By MICHELLE COTTLE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I recently took over as head of a department in which a
weekly meeting is a longstanding tradition. All the employees
(about 20) discuss what they have been working on and offer
suggestions for future projects. The problem is that when we go
around the table, I'm met more often than not with blank stares and
monosyllabic responses. Typically, the same one or two people do
the majority of the talking. How can I make these meetings more
productive?
</P>
<P>
   A. Forget tradition. The first question you should ask is: Are
these meetings necessary?
</P>
<P>
   Far too often, people have a meeting because they've always had
a meeting, said Donald E. Wetmore, president of the Productivity
Institute, a consulting firm in Shelton, Conn. ``Nobody ever asks,
`What would happen if we didn't have a meeting?' or if we didn't
have it so often,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the habit can be substantial. Calculate the
collective hourly pay and benefits of the 20 people who attend the
meetings, Wetmore advised. Say it comes out to around $750. ``Now,
ask yourself: `What did we accomplish in our two-hour meeting that
justified spending $1,500 of corporate resources?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the meetings are worthwhile, find out whether
participation has always been so pathetic. If the meetings were
livelier before your arrival as department head, maybe the staff is
not yet comfortable with you. Silence, after all, can be a sign of
shyness, said Odette Pollar, president of Time Management Systems,
a training and consulting firm in Oakland, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe your employees consider the weekly ritual a monumental
waste of time. ``How long does that take _ 20 people going around
the room?'' Ms. Pollar asked. ``People may be quiet just because
they want to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Start asking employees what's wrong. Do the meetings start too
early? Last too long? Is the format intimidating? Does anyone even
remember the purpose of these gatherings?
</P>
<P>
   If meetings start to seem unproductive, employees will respond
accordingly. ``Sixty-five percent of business people report that
they daydream during meetings,'' Wetmore said.
</P>
<P>
   Seek suggestions on ways, aside from a weekly meeting, to keep
the group apprised of what its members are doing, Ms. Pollar
advised. E-mail and voice mail are possibilities _ and the
information you receive could help you draw people into the
discussion when a meeting is eventually called.
</P>
<P>
   Don't make the mistake of asking for critiques of the meeting
during the meeting, Ms. Pollar said. ``If people are shy in a
group, they're not going to tell you why they're shy in front of
the group,'' she said. Give them the opportunity to respond by
memo, e-mail or one-on-one. And make it clear that you expect to
hear from everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get to the bottom of the problem may seem an
unnecessary aggravation as you adjust to your new job. But now is
the time to strike _ before you, too, are sucked into the
mindless-meeting zone.

THREE HOUSTON MEDICAL INSTITUTIONS MAKE TOP 10 LIST &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By LISA DAVIS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Three Houston medical institutions are in the top 10
of U.S. News &AMP; World Reports' annual ratings of speciality
hospitals across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The July 12 edition of the magazine ranks the University of
Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in second place in two categories
_ cancer and gynecology. The Texas Heart Institute at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital placed seventh in cardiology and The Institute
for Rehabilitation and Research ranked third in rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best statement one can get _ to be recognized by
one's peers,'' said Dr. John Mendelsohn, president of M.D.
Anderson. ``We're proud that we give the kind of care that would
merit these rankings.''
</P>
<P>
   M.D. Anderson ranked second to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York for cancer treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is to make what we've learned available to more
patients,'' Mendelsohn said. ``We have better ways to detect
cancers early and treat them ... but we need to make these
treatments available around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Texas Heart Institute has pioneered many
advancements in cardiology and heart surgeries, including the first
heart transplant and the first implantation of an artificial heart
in a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pleasure to be recognized so consistently as a top
cardiovascular facility,'' said Dr. Denton Cooley, founder,
president and surgeon-in-chief of the Texas Heart Institute. ``We
plan to prolong and expand the high-quality research and education
programs that enable us to further combat the devastating effects
of cardiovascular disease.''
</P>
<P>
   The Institute for Rehabilitation and Research specializes in
medical care, education and research in the field of catastrophic
injury.
</P>
<P>
   TIRR Systems President E. Ashley Smith said placement on the
list ``is a tribute to the innovative, collaborative, world-class
care of our physicians, therapists, nurses, technicians,
researchers and all our support staff at TIRR.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the 10th year U.S. News has published its ``American's
Best Hospitals'' issue.
</P>
<P>
   For 1999, it ranked 188 hospitals. To qualify, hospitals had to
be a member of the Council of Teaching Hospitals, affiliated with a
medical school or offer a minimum of nine out of 17 key medical
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   According to U.S. News, the purpose of the evaluation is to be a
resource for patients needing maximum care in the diagnosis,
treatment and management of a difficult medical problem. Emphasis
was placed on hospitals that provided cutting-edge diagnosis and
treatment, rather than broad-based community care.

 MAKING A COMPANY'S RULES UNDERSTOOD  &HT;     By ILANA DEBARE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Q: I run a business with a large number of Spanish-speaking
workers. We have just developed a comprehensive employee manual and
are wondering how to present it to workers with limited English. My
wife speaks Spanish and we plan to hold employee meetings from time
to time to go over the main points in Spanish and English. We are
also considering putting the table of contents into Spanish as well
as English. Is our handling of this adequate both to serve our
employees and to protect us legally? Are there better ways to
handle this?
<P>
   A: Hats off to you for taking the time to develop an employee
manual. And hats off a second time for thinking about how to make
the manual truly useful to your employees, rather than just a fat
pile of paper that sits unread on some bookshelf in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Ho _ an attorney with the nonprofit Employment Law Center
who specializes in handling workplace disputes over language _
suggests that you translate the entire manual into Spanish, not
just the table of contents.
</P>
<P>
   That will make it easier for your Spanish-speaking workers to
check a particular rule or policy by themselves. It will also help
shield you from lawsuits claiming discrimination on the basis of
national origin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way to avoid potential claims like, `You told
these rules to the English speakers, but you didn't tell us,' '' Ho
said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the written translation, be sure to go over your
policies verbally with your staff _ both Spanish speakers and
English speakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you translate a manual doesn't mean people will
be able to read it,'' cautioned Rick Gilbert, a human resources
consultant with the Employers Group in San Francisco. ``Adult
literacy is still a problem in many workplaces. If you have a team
of 10 people and three don't read real well, it's a good idea to
hold a meeting and really have a conversation about what the
policies mean.''
</P>
<P>
   More questions about multiple languages in the workplace? The
Employment Law Center provides free advice to workers about their
language rights on the job at (800) 864-1664. For employers,
organizations like the Employers Group or the California Chamber of
Commerce can provide advice on how to manage a multilingual
workforce.
</P>
<P>
   ACCIDENT BENEFITS
</P>
<P>
   Q: I was recently struck by a truck while riding my bicycle to
work and was taken to the nearby hospital's trauma center for
treatment. The doctors told me I will be unable to work for two to
four weeks. My employer instructed me to apply for short-term
disability benefits through the state Employment Disability
Department. My question is: Since I was injured en route to my job,
should I be receiving workers' compensation rather than short-term
disability benefits?
</P>
<P>
   A: It would be nice if you could get workers' compensation
rather than short-term disability insurance, since workers' comp
often provides a higher payment than California's short-term
disability (SDI) program.
</P>
<P>
   But workers' comp covers injuries sustained in the course of
work _ not in commuting to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The so-called going and coming rule says that the commute to
and from work is not covered by workers' comp,'' said Julius Young,
a workers' comp attorney with Boxer &AMP; Gerson in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few limited circumstances where a commuting injury
might be covered by workers' comp _ for instance, if you were
detouring off your normal route to pick up some supplies that your
boss had requested.
</P>
<P>
   But in your case, a straightforward bike ride to work, the
injuries probably would not be covered by workers' comp.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING COLLARS
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have worked as a lead custodian and a regular custodian for
a school district for 14 years. Soon I'll be leaving for full-time
white-collar employment with a local county. I've worked several
white-collar jobs part time over the last four years, plus I've
taken a small arsenal of computer classes to help with the upcoming
transition. What advice can you offer to help make this change as
smooth as possible?
</P>
<P>
   A: The transition may be less abrupt than you fear. These days,
many blue-collar jobs require the exact same skills as white-collar
work _ teamwork, communication and problem solving. And the fact
that you've been a ``lead custodian'' signals to me that you've
already got some experience in these areas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, here are a few tips to keep in mind with this change:
</P>
<P>
   -- Be a student of your new workplace. Figure out who are the
stars of the office; learn from their examples. Find yourself a
buddy _ someone successful who understands the organization and can
help answer your questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always someone who's an informal font of knowledge,
although it may not be part of their job description,'' said Abby
Snay, executive director of Jewish Vocational Services, a career
resource center in San Francisco. ``Find out who that is and pick
their brain.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Actively manage your workload. One change may be the amount
of paperwork heading your way _ countless e-mails, memos and
reports. Don't get bogged down in trying to give each piece of
paperwork equal treatment; figure out which ones are most important
and which ones must be handled quickly.
</P>
<P>
   -- Ditto for meetings and phone calls. You may find that
meetings are devouring huge amounts of your work time. Carve out
some uninterrupted time each day when you can focus on things like
writing or planning. Maybe that means coming in at 8 rather than 9
a.m.; or maybe it means closing the door and ignoring the phone for
an hour each afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, your new job may have fewer clear-cut tasks and more
open-ended assignments than before. Keep your eye on the big
picture of what your organization is trying to do, and what you
individually need to do to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be assertive in asking for guidance and clarification about
whether you're doing OK,'' Snay advised.
</P>
<P>
   Want a good book on how to be a top performer at work _ in
either a blue-collar or white-collar job? Check out ``How to Be a
Star at Work,'' by Carnegie Mellon business Professor Robert
Kelley, which just came out in a new paperback edition.

 &HT;    Practice site draws thousands of fans
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ This sleepy bedroom community 35 miles east
of Los Angeles was invaded by more minivans and sport-utility
vehicles filled with kids and bearing soccer bumper stickers than
usual Thursday afternoon as more than 2,000 people crammed around
the edges of a tucked-away practice field at Pomona College for the
U.S. training session.
</P>
<P>
   The Claremont police department dispatched four officers on
motorcycles to keep the peace and clear the area for a closed
Chinese practice that followed, but they didn't have a great deal
of success. That's because they had their pictures taken with U.S.
players before going back on duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more people at practices now than at some of our
games in the early years,'' said midfielder Kristine Lilly, who has
been with the national team since 1987. ``It's great to see what's
happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebrity list grows
</P>
<P>
   One of those watching practice was actor Karl Malden, a nearby
resident and another celebrity who's taken an interest in the U.S.
team. In addition to President Clinton, who accepted FIFA's
standing invitation to attend Saturday's final, actor Peter Berg of
``Chicago Hope,'' actress Elizabeth Shue, country singer k.d. lang
and twin teen TV stars Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen also will be on
hand. Representatives of actor Bob Hope also have inquired.
</P>
<P>
   During the week, crews from celebrity TV shows ``Entertainment
Tonight,'' ``Extra'' and ``Access Hollywood'' have taped segments
with American players.
</P>
<P>
   USSF pro exploration
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Soccer Federation said Thursday it was continuing
efforts to help develop a business plan for the implementation of a
women's professional league as early as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The USSF and the Discovery Channel have kicked in roughly
$100,000 each for the project. U.S. coach Tony DiCicco has said the
creation of a pro league is essential for the Americans to stay
among the world powers of women's soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the National Soccer Alliance, an independent
group, announced plans for a league and enlisted support from
several U.S. national team stars before the efforts were deep-sixed
by then-USSF president Alan Rothenberg, who said they would hurt
World Cup preparations.
</P>
<P>
   The current goal is for the USSF to develop a viable plan,
possibly by early next year, and facilitate discussions with
investors who would run the league.
</P>
<P>
   China has seven all-stars
</P>
<P>
   Seven members of the Chinese team and five from the U.S. team
grace the World Cup MasterCard all-star team, as chosen by FIFA's
women's technical committee.
</P>
<P>
   Goalkeeper Briana Scurry, defenders Brandi Chastain and Carla
Overbeck, midfielder Michelle Akers and forward Mia Hamm were among
the 16 players who made the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Scurry's opposite in the net, China's Gao Hong, was the other
keeper, joining forwards Sun Wen and Jin Yan, midfielders Liu
Ailing and Zhao Lihong and defenders Wang Liping and Wen Lirong.
</P>
<P>
   The only players breaking the U.S.-China stranglehold were
German defender Doris Fitschen, Brazilian midfielder Sissi, German
midfielder Bettina Wiegmann and Norway forward Ann Kirstin Aarones.

 &HT;    U.S. coach soccer's modest motivator
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ Women's World Cup coach Tony DiCicco faced
the question without hesitating.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a great job, or what?
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by 20 attractive, articulate young women who also
happen to be world-class soccer players, DiCicco understood the
tone perfectly. In reply, he offered up his usual deadpan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have a great job,'' DiCicco said. ``I have the privilege
of working with a talented, motivated group of young women who are
committed to winning the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco is all business on a team whose bubbly personalities and
tales of lovey-dovey camaraderie have been revealed in the news and
on countless television talk shows.
</P>
<P>
   But with this circus swirling about him, DiCicco and his top
assistant, Lauren Gregg, have been self-effacing while staying in
the background, letting the players take center stage.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be true that fans don't buy tickets to watch
coaches, DiCicco, 50, has been every bit as amenable as his
players. The man who inherited the job from Anson Dorrance in late
1994 is as easy-going behind the scenes as he appears. To listen to
his players, he doesn't even yell at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who said that?'' DiCicco said earlier this week, a wide grin
protruding from beneath his thick black mustache. ``I don't yell at
them a lot because I'm too busy yelling at the referees. I'm a
passionate guy, but I have a pretty good idea of how to impact a
player's performance. It's not my style to get in their faces. I
have too much respect for them to belittle them that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, DiCicco takes his cues from Dorrance, the
successful women's coach at North Carolina whose presence is still
deeply felt on this team. Eight World Cup players are ex-Tar Heels
who soaked up Dorrance's belief that the best way to motivate
female athletes is to build them as a unit and appeal to their
emotional desire for togetherness.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean that DiCicco doesn't raise the roof when he
has to. He issued what players described as a pretty good Knute
Rockne speech at halftime of the Germany match in the quarterfinals
with the U.S. down 2-1 and lacking its normal sharp edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He raised his voice then, he really did,'' said forward
Tiffeny Milbrett. ``But it wasn't negative at all. He wasn't
telling us what we were doing wrong, he was encouraging us to carry
out the dream we've had about winning this World Cup. It was to
motivate us.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco's words must have made a difference, because he made no
tactical changes.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans scored two goals, both off corner kicks, and hung
on for a 3-2 win despite a far-from-convincing performance.
</P>
<P>
   A former goalkeeper who has run soccer camps for youths in the
Northeast for more than two decades, DiCicco is the married father
of four sons who lives in the same Connecticut suburb where he grew
up. After Dorrance stepped aside, DiCicco didn't change much and it
may have had an affect as the U.S. fell in the semifinals in the
1995 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, it was hard for him to impose his own style,'' said
Gregg, who came on board in 1989. ``What he's brought is a real
tactical sophistication to this team. He has incredible attention
to detail.''
</P>
<P>
   But delicately balancing the personalities on the team is just
as critical a job for DiCicco. Earlier this year, he dropped rising
star Debbie Keller from the roster shortly after she filed a sexual
harassment lawsuit against Dorrance. The timing appeared to be all
wrong, but DiCicco insisted that Keller, who had 14 goals in 1998,
wasn't versatile enough to play more than one role, a must for his
key attacking players, including Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly.
</P>
<P>
   Keller filed a retaliation suit against DiCicco and the U.S.
Soccer Federation but lost when the matter came to arbitration.
Even now, DiCicco feels stung by the accusation, but says he isn't
bitter about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most difficult thing I've ever had to deal with in
my coaching career,'' he said. ``I think we made the right choice,
but what coach wants to hear that he's being dishonest? Debbie's
still part of our player pool and I think she's going to have a
chance to play for the U.S. in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters was the fact that Lilly, who is dating
Keller's brother, believed Keller should have been named to the
squad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affected all of us in different ways,'' Lilly said, clearly
uncomfortable talking about the subject. ``I think Tony handled it
very professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the essence of how he looks at a job that rapidly has
been pushed out into the spotlight. With typical deference, he
thinks too much is being made of how he's managed to keep things on
a relatively even keel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about me, it's about the team,'' he said. ``If any
team deserves to win this championship, it's this one.

   PROKUPLJE, Yugoslavia _ Protesters against President Slobodan
Milosevic gathered in the main square of this small southern town
Thursday night, while the government, which had planned to stage a
rally of its own in response, failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Change, a collection of pro-democracy parties,
drew 3,000 to 4,000 people to its rally here.
</P>
<P>
   Ratko Zecevic, the leading regional official of President
Milosevic's Socialist Party and head of the Toplice regional
administration, said he had called off his rally after the police
denied his party the necessary permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a civil war,'' Zecevic told reporters as crowds
gathered early Thursday evening in the square. But he let off a
burst of pistol shots into the air from the balcony of his party
headquarters, perhaps to stop a scuffle that was going on below his
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   Zoran Zivkovic, the mayor of Nis and vice president of the
Democratic Party, interpreted the action differently. ``His aim is
to frighten people so they leave the rally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Across the square, government supporters unfurled banners from
the balcony of an apartment building with messages directed at the
Democratic Party leader, Zoran Djindjic, and Vuk Obradovic of the
Social Democracy Party, both local men. One read, ``Traitors, get
out of Toplice,'' repeating the criticism by the government news
media and Milosevic supporters that Djindjic is a traitor for
having left Belgrade during the war. The government has attacked
Obradovic for his demands that Milosevic resign.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd in the square _ a mixture of young and old, workers
and members of the middle class _ hit back, pelting the men hanging
the banners with stones and striking one in the head. The men
retreated, and let the banners sag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbia, get up!'' Goran Svilanovic, leader of the Civic
Alliance party, urged the crowd. He then referred to
anti-government protests in other cities. ``Look at yourselves!
Look at your friends in Cacak, Leskovac, Uzice and Novi Sad.
Everyone is on there feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Djindjic said, ``We should devote July and August to the
salvation of Serbia and go out into the streets every day to show
it.'' The crowd cheered and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout, in a town of only 35,000 people in an area
considered a bastion of Socialist control, was high. The people
ignored the violence, and even a group of men who described
themselves as ``old Communists,'' said it was time for change.
</P>
<P>
   The loudest cheers were for jokes about Milosevic and his wife,
Mirjana Markovic, and frequent jeers and boos were directed at
Zecevic.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd were Serbian refugees from Kosovo, while
others said they had relatives or close ties to the province, which
lies just an hour's drive from Prokuplje. ``They brought shame upon
us by committing war crimes,'' Svilanovic said at the rally. ``Four
wars are behind these people. Four wars that have been defeats.
Only one victory is in front of us. That he leaves!''
</P>
<P>
   That brought nods from Kristina Lula and her boyfriend, Jovan
Tomic, who had fled Prizren, Kosovo, together. A small-time trader,
he had been called up into the army as a reservist for the last
months of the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are unhappy with everything,'' Tomic said of Kosovo. ``We
blame both the regime and everything that was happening there.'' He
said the atrocities in Kosovo were committed not by the Yugoslav
Army but by others. ``We've got to have change,'' he said. ``It's
now or never.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lula's grandmother, a retired music teacher, spoke up beside
her. ``For 10 years we have been drowning, going down deeper and
deeper,'' she said. ``Change would mean a lot for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the rally, Djindjic and his group spent the day in
Kosovo, meeting with Serbian opposition leaders and representatives
of the Serbian Orthodox Church, and with U.N. and European
officials.
</P>
<P>
   As they emerged from a meeting on the grounds of the Gracanica
monastery, they were set upon by an angry mob of Serbs, who landed
a few punches and kicks before NATO soldiers arrived to break them
up.

METS LULLED INTO LOSING TO EXPOS 4-3  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)   By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thursday kept resembling one of those perilous
afternoons for the Mets, the kind of lethargic game in which they
were in front of the Expos yet were not really in control. There
was a listless atmosphere and the Mets always seemed to be in
danger of being lulled to sleep and into feeling that they were
fine. But they were not.
</P>
<P>
   After the vaunted bullpen faltered and the Mets fizzled during
what could have been a dramatic ninth inning, the Expos sneaked out
of Shea Stadium with a 4-3 victory and a surprising split of the
four-game series. For the post-season conscious Mets, it was
bewildering to lose two straight to a weak team that had lost 15 of
its last 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees invading Flushing for three games starting
Friday night, the Mets prepared for the important visit from their
talented neighbors with a shabby precursor.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost because they could not protect a 3-1 bulge, they
could not manage much offense after left fielder Ryan McGuire's
unreliable glove helped them score two runs in the first, and they
did not overpower Montreal when they had chances. Instead, the Mets
remained vulnerable and it destroyed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so upset that we lost the game and that we lost two games
to these guys,'' Turk Wendell said. ``These are the games we got to
capitalize on.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Wendell and Dennis Cook had allowed the tying and
go-ahead runs in the seventh and eighth, the Mets had life in the
ninth because Montreal's Ugueth Urbina struggled to throw strikes.
The closer walked pinch-hitter Rickey Henderson to begin the inning
and Manager Bobby Valentine eschewed the sacrifice bunt because he
figured the career stolen base leader could swipe his 1,320th.
Valentine's strategy failed as Chris Widger made a powerful throw
to the right side of the base, where Orlando Cabrera tagged
Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had two outs left, but they were deflated. ``I should
have bunted,'' Valentine said. ``Again, it's tough to predict a
perfect throw by the catcher.'' Indeed. Widger had thrown out only
11 of 69 runners and Henderson did not dispute a theory that Widger
would nab him in 1 out of 25 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when they get you, 1 out of 25 times when they make a
perfect throw,'' Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Urbina also walked Luis Lopez, but Roger Cedeno swung at ball
four on a 3-1 pitch, then struck out, and Edgardo Alfonzo grounded
into a fielder's choice as the Mets stranded their eighth and final
runner. That forced the Mets to address two topics that they
despise: losing to the Expos and playing the hated Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, who smacked his 17th homer, said falling to the
Yankees can make a player feel ``like an outcast in the city'' and
like ``complete losers.'' Thursday, the Mets were losers. Masato
Yoshii had a 3-1 lead in the sixth when Vladimir Guerrero reached
out and belted a shoulder-high fastball over the right-field fence.
It was a stunning homer because the 0-2 pitch was so high and
Guerrero still crushed it for Montreal's first homer in 64 innings.
Even Yoshii called Guerrero's homer incredible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yoshii left with a 3-2 lead after six decent innings and
complained of a cramp in his right thigh from a knee brace that was
too tight. Wendell made his team and major league-best 45th
appearance and it is not one the quirky reliever will want to
remember. After jumping ahead of Cabrera by 1-2, Wendell threw
another slider and Cabrera turned it into a souvenir to even the
score, 3-3, in what amounted to an amazing explosion of power by
the homer-deprived Expos.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mets' fifth botched save in 34 chances and Cabrera's
first hit in five at bats off Wendell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slider that didn't slide, it hung,'' Wendell said.
``That's why he is a big league hitter. He's supposed to hit that
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilton Guerrero, who is more of a big league hitter, doomed Cook
in the eighth when he smacked a fat fastball off the left
center-field warning track and hustled it into a triple.
Pinch-hitter Shane Andrews then followed with a flyball to medium
center field. Brian McRae retreated a few steps to corral it before
making a high throw that floated home too late and allowed the
Expos to go ahead, 4-3. That is when the Mets really knew it was a
perilous afternoon. ``We're humans,'' Cook said. ``We're going to
go through some bad stretches. We gave up some runs today. It's one
of those things. I'm not going to go home and slit my wrists.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   Robin Ventura's left big toe is still bruised and swollen and
Manager Bobby Valentine said he was doubtful to play against the
Yankees. ``I'm not expecting him to,'' Valentine said. ``If he
does, it'll be a pleasant surprise.'' Ventura, who was not in
uniform for the game, hopes to play again before the All-Star Game
break. ``It feels better,'' Ventura said. ``It's just sore.'' . . .
Octavio Dotel was not scheduled to start until July 19 in
Baltimore, so the Mets optioned him to Class AAA Norfolk and
promoted infielder Mike Kinkade to allow the rookie to pitch in a
game and to increase their bench flexibility. Dotel will start for
Norfolk Monday. . . . Rickey Henderson did not start Thursday and
strolled into the clubhouse 65 minutes before the first pitch, but
Valentine said the 40-year old has permission to arrive late
anytime he wants. . . . Edgardo Alfonzo, meet Rodney Dangerfield.
The second baseman was listed as Alfonso on the batting practice
time sheet. &QL;

PARK COMES OUT OF THE DARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ For the first time in seven weeks, the Dodgers scored
in double digits. For the first time in six weeks, right-hander
Chan Ho Park won.
</P>
<P>
   Snapping a losing streak at three games with an 11-8 victory
against Colorado on Thursday afternoon brought a few smiles into
the Dodgers clubhouse but no crazy talk of how this sinking ship
was all of a sudden sailing majestically.
</P>
<P>
   No way, no how, not now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, we don't need to worry about where we're
at,'' said Dodgers reliever Pedro Borbon, who retired both batters
he faced in the eighth. ``You go out, not worry about it and not
worry about where we'll be in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Jeff Shaw recorded a save, his 19th but his first since
June 26. Of course, it was the following day when the Dodgers began
this horrific stretch in which they've lost nine of 11.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros homered twice and Mark Grudzielanek had three hits
and drove in three with a first-inning double. The Dodgers tied a
season-high with five runs in the first inning and avoided getting
swept in a four-game series for the first time in six years. The
also finished their 16-game stretch against the NL West 4-12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could give a rat's (butt); we're just trying to win games,''
Karros said. ``We're not sitting here saying, `Oh (no), we may get
swept.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When the halfway point arrived Tuesday, the Dodgers talked about
needing to win 50 games in the second half to possibly propel them
into playoff contention. They say it's possible, though it's
unprecedented since the club moved to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Since moving from Brooklyn for the 1958 season, the Dodgers
haven't won 50 games in the second half of a season after finishing
the first half below .500.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Dodgers (36-47) finished the season's first half 35-46
_ their worst half in 20 years. From this point, they would have to
play .620 baseball just to get to 85 wins. The more realistic win
mark for the playoffs is 90, meaning the Dodgers would have to go
54-25 to get there.
</P>
<P>
   But the last time the Dodgers won 50 games in a half-season was
1985. They were 45-36 at the midway point and finished 95-67 and
won the NL West by 5{ games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little fire, a little battle (in us), but one game
isn't going to matter,'' Grudzielanek said. ``Five games wouldn't
matter, though it would be nice. We need to play for a few weeks, a
month, and look where we're at. We're struggling. We can't go out
and say we have to win 50 games. That's just the wrong way to think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   There were good points for the Dodgers, and that begins with a
win, which began with the pounding of former Dodgers left-hander
Brian Bohanon (9-7).
</P>
<P>
   Bohanon, who signed a three-year, $9 million contract during the
winter, lasted two-thirds of an inning, his shortest start in seven
years. He walked in a run, gave up Grudzielanek's three-run double
and then was pulled after Park singled in a run.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a long-overdue offensive onslaught.
Karros added a solo homer in the second. The Dodgers scored three
more in the fourth, marking the first time since May 22 they scored
10 runs in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Although Park (5-7) gave up three more homers (23 this season)
and allowed seven runs on 10 hits in five innings, he was applauded
afterward for surviving a typical Coors Field game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies kept cutting into the Dodgers' five-run lead until
it was 6-5 after three innings, but the Dodgers always remained in
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the Chan Ho I expect to see,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``When he had adversity, he beared down and mixed his
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who got relief help from Mike Maddux, Alan Mills, Borbon
and Shaw, won for the first time since May 26. Since then he's lost
four times and his ERA is 9.49.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel good because I gave up seven runs,'' said Park,
whose ERA rose to 6.52. ``But finally I can sleep tonight because I
won.''

FIREARMS MELTED DOWN TO MAKE BUILDING MATERIALS

<P>
   RANCHO CUCAMONGA _ Weapons of destruction became fuel for
construction Thursday when more than 14,000 confiscated rifles,
shotguns and handguns were converted into steel reinforcement bars
for the building industry.
</P>
<P>
   During the sixth annual Project Isaiah Meltdown and Recycling
Program at Tamco Steel Inc., the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department destroyed seized weapons that have been used in
assaults, robberies and other crimes, including those in the Santa
Clarita and Antelope valleys.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheriff's Department and 37 other agencies provided this
year's cache of nearly 18 tons of confiscated firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today our streets are safer,'' Assistant Sheriff Larry Waldie
told the small group that had gathered to watch the event. ``Every
one of these guns has a story.''
</P>
<P>
   One semiautomatic pistol was found under a blanket in a baby's
crib, Waldie said. Another replica of a 9 mm handgun was used by a
15-year-old carjacking suspect who pointed the gun at deputies
before surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   This year's project melted down 3,623 rifles and shotguns, and
10,412 handguns.
</P>
<P>
   After the news conference, the pile of weapons was scooped up by
two bulldozers and dumped into a 15-by-15 steel bucket. A huge
hook-and-cable system lifted the bucket and dumped the guns into a
fiery, 3,000-degree furnace.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the recycled metal from this year's meltdown will be
used for the Alameda Corridor project in downtown Los Angeles and
for the new Staples Center Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the material will be used by artist Lin Evola, who is
creating 13 ``Peace Angel'' sculptures that will be placed in sites
of conflict throughout the world. Her works are made from
decommissioned nuclear casings, and surrendered and confiscated
street weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard E. Robinson, Tamco's environmental and safety manager,
started the program six years ago as a symbolic gesture to victims
of firearms violence and their families. The project is named for
Isaiah 2:4, which says, ``They shall beat their swords into
plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks; one nation shall
not raise the sword against another, nor shall they train for war
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamco, the only steel recycling mill in California, has
processed more than 500,000 pounds of confiscated weapons since the
program began.

NORTH KOREAN MISSILE PARTS SAID TO BE FROM JAPAN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Two Japanese members of Parliament charged Thursday that
key elements of North Korea's missile program come from Japan, and
they called for tighter export restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   They said 30 percent to 40 percent of the semiconductors in
North Korean missiles, along with argon gas burners used inside
them, come from Japan. But they said they had no information about
the manufacturers or about how the materials ended up in North
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea launched a ballistic missile _ which it described as
a satellite _ in August, sending it arcing over Japan before it
splashed down in the Pacific Ocean. That caused a wave of unease in
Japan, and there is growing alarm because of reports that North
Korea is preparing to test an updated version of the missile, the
Taepodong 2.
</P>
<P>
   The two members of Parliament, Ichita Yamamoto, of the governing
Liberal Democratic Party, and Keiichiro Asao, of the opposition
Democratic Party, said they had gathered their information from a
variety of sources, including North Korean defectors and South
Korean military intelligence officers. They acknowledged that much
of the information was sketchy.
</P>
<P>
   A North Korean defector to South Korea handled Japanese
materials and heard that they had been used in the missile program,
but did not know whether they were used in Taepodong missiles or in
the earlier Nodong missiles, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Some diplomats and scholars warn against putting too much trust
in South Korean information about North Korea, or in North Korean
defectors who are under the control of South Korean intelligence
officials. In the past South Korea has sometimes deliberately
passed out misinformation to tarnish the image of North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Yamamoto and Asao also said they had inspected a North Korean
mini-submarine captured last year in South Korea, and that 21
percent of its parts had come from Japan. All these items are
widely available and there are no restrictions on their export.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the parts that we found can be exported legitimately to
North Korea,'' Asao said, in urging that restrictions be tightened.

NEW JERSEY BROKERAGE FIRM INDICTED IN HUGE FRAUD CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan district attorney brought an indictment
Thursday against A.S. Goldmen &AMP; Co., a small New Jersey brokerage
firm, and 26 employees on charges that the firm had orchestrated a
securities fraud that had cost thousands of investors $100 million
in losses.
</P>
<P>
   Among those named in the 240-count indictment announced by the
district attorney, Robert Morgenthau, were Goldmen's president and
owner, Anthony Marchiano, 37, of Naples, Fla., and his twin
brother, Salvatore, of Freehold Township, N.J., Goldmen's head
trader.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's chief financial officer, Stuart Winkler, 46, of
Morganville, N.J., was also named. According to prosecutors,
Winkler, who worked as a field examiner at the National Association
of Securities Dealers in New York from 1979 through 1986, devised
the firm's fraudulent schemes.
</P>
<P>
   From August 1992 to October 1998, prosecutors contend, A.S.
Goldmen employees broke numerous securities laws. The schemes,
prosecutors said, included the manipulation of markets in certain
stocks to benefit Goldmen employees; the use of phony accounts to
trade in securities that the employees were prohibited from owning;
trading on nonpublic information; the making of unauthorized
trades; refusals to adhere to customers' sell orders, and the
falsifying of the firm's records. Morgenthau also said that Goldmen
employees lied to regulators and destroyed documents.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the indictment, Morgenthau brought a civil action
seeking $100 million in repayment for what he called the criminal
proceeds of the corrupt activities.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Helen Freedman signed a temporary
restraining order on Thursday prohibiting the defendants from
disposing of any assets without court approval. The investigation
into the firm's activities is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   According to Morgenthau, Goldmen brokers focused on retirees as
investors, many of whom lost their entire savings with the firm.
One victim, he said, was a retired bus driver in upstate New York
who lost all his savings and had to return to work as a result of
the loss. Another Goldmen customer was a Maryland woman who lost
the $25,000 nest egg she planned to use to pay for her daughter's
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``These were real people who lost real money to a bunch of
crumbums,'' Morgenthau said. ``These guys were heartless.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for A.S. Goldmen, Marchiano and Winkler did not return
telephone calls seeking comment. The firm closed most of its
operations last year.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's two-year investigation into A.S. Goldmen
began as a result of numerous complaints from the firm's customers.
With offices in New York, New Jersey, Los Angeles and Naples, Fla.,
it had 50,000 investor accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The firm, which received mail at its headquarters in Red Bank,
N.J., in care of Body by Boris, had been the subject of 11 actions
by state securities regulators since 1991 and had been involved in
numerous investor arbitrations.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Goldmen had a creative but fraudulent way
of dealing with some complaints it received from investors. Winkler
and Marchiano were said to place warrants in companies Goldmen was
underwriting in the accounts of dissatisfied investors,
guaranteeing them profits. By controlling the repurchase and resale
of the securities, the firm could propel the warrants' prices
higher _ a manipulation, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Winkler, prosecutors said, used his knowledge of regulatory
practices and capabilities to divert regulators' attention from
Goldmen's misdeeds. After seven years as a NASD regulator, Winkler
became a vice president for compliance at two small New York
brokerage firms, Middlegate Securities Ltd. and Steinberg &AMP; Lyman.
He joined Goldmen in January 1989, six months after the firm was
incorporated.
</P>
<P>
   The charges in Thursday's indictment involve the marketing of
securities in Millenium Sports Management Inc., Stadium Capital
Inc., Independence Brewing Co., Imatec Ltd., Wanderlust Interactive
Inc., Winfield Capital Corp., Veritas Music Entertainment,
Nickelodeon Theater Co., Cinema Ride Inc. and Innovative Tech
Systems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the crimes, prosecutors said, rose from the use of
phony, or ``nominee,'' accounts set up by Goldmen employees for
their own benefit using the names of friends and family members
with different surnames. The indictment included charges against
seven individuals for such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   To evade rules prohibiting underwriters from trading in their
own initial public offerings, money provided by the Goldmen brokers
would be placed in these accounts and used to buy low-priced
warrants on stocks underwritten by the firm, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, warrants offered at 25 cents each would be bought
back by the firm at 75 cents even though the warrants were trading
publicly for twice that price. The profits would then be repaid to
the Goldmen employees by the account holders in cash to avoid
detection.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission also instituted
administrative proceedings against Goldmen Thursday as well as a
cease-and-desist action charging it and eight employees with
securities violations.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Walker, director of enforcement at the SEC, said that
criminal actions like those brought by Morgenthau against
fraudulent brokerage firms like Duke &AMP; Co., A.R. Baron and A.S.
Goldmen were crucial in fighting securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deterrents achieved by criminal sanctions are extremely
important in this battle because many of the people involved are
undeterred by civil sanctions,'' Walker said. ``The A.S. Goldmen
case shows that `boiler rooms' are corrupt enterprises that defraud
investors and we'll chase 'em high and low.''

ABC RADIO HIRES INTERNET'S DRUDGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ABC Radio network has hired Matt Drudge, who composes an
Internet news-and-gossip column called the Drudge Report, to do a
Sunday night radio talk show that will be syndicated across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, completed on Wednesday, has caused concern for the
president of ABC News, said two ABC News executives who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News and ABC Radio are separate entities within ABC Inc., a
unit of Walt Disney Co., and Drudge's two-hour radio show, which
has been on WABC in New York for about a year, will not be billed
as news.
</P>
<P>
   Still, David Westin, the president of ABC News, was so concerned
about Drudge's reputation as someone who reports rumors and
occasionally does not adequately check facts that he tried to
dissuade his radio colleagues from making the syndication deal, the
two ABC News executives said. Westin declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The executives said that Westin was concerned that Drudge could
be associated in viewers' or listeners' minds with ABC News.
Westin's opposition was first reported Thursday in The Washington
Post.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge, who also has a half-hour Saturday evening television
show on the Fox News Channel, said Thursday by telephone from his
home in Los Angeles: ``I'm not a journalist. I'm an Internet
reporter. Everything I've learned about journalism I learned from
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Drudge has been criticized for tarnishing the reputations of
journalists because he describes what he reports as news, yet
deflects criticism by saying he is not trained as a journalist and
has no editor to supervise his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he's not a journalist but he plays one on the
Internet,'' said Deborah Potter, a former CBS News and CNN
correspondent who is now executive director of NewsLab, a nonprofit
organization in Washington that assists local television stations
in improving their news operations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Potter maintained that opinionated talk-show hosts like Rush
Limbaugh are heard on radio stations, and listeners apparently do
not mistake him for a journalist. If that were the case with
Drudge, she said, there would be no cause for concern. ``But the
creeping, fuzzy line can confuse people,'' she added, because ``on
his Web site, he purports to break news and he passes himself off
as an ersatz journalist.''
</P>
<P>
   Drudge said he did, in fact, break news, and added, ``My
triumphs and successes have overshadowed my mistakes or growing
pains.''
</P>
<P>
   On his radio show, which in the latest ratings had the most
listeners in its 10 p.m.-to-midnight time slot, Drudge talks about
news stories ``from all over the world,'' he said, and takes
telephone calls from listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Sunday, his show will be heard on 15 to 20 more
stations, including ABC Radio affiliates in Washington, Chicago,
Los Angeles, San Francisco, Detroit and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge is the subject of a $30 million defamation lawsuit by
Sidney Blumenthal, a White House aide, because Drudge reported on
his Web site, then retracted, rumors that Blumenthal had abused his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Drudge also helped break the story of President Clinton's
involvement with Monica Lewinsky, by reporting on the Web site much
of Newsweek magazine's exclusive story on the subject before the
magazine had finished double-checking its report.

PINCAY REGAINS FORM IN RACE FOR RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Pete Rose batted .264 the season he broke Ty
Cobb's record for career hits.
</P>
<P>
   Laffit Pincay fans feared their hero would be in similar
decline, a graying athlete hanging on for personal glory as he
tried to become horse racing's Pete Rose by surpassing Bill
Shoemaker's record for career victories by a jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Now it appears we needn't have worried.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Pincay, 52, is riding better than he has in years,
steaming toward Shoemaker's record 8,833, now 70 wins away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that way, too,'' Pincay said in the Hollywood Park
jockeys' room Thursday between races. ``A lot of people tell me I
look better and I'm riding better, and it makes me feel good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I'm just hanging in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than a year ago, jinxed by injuries and losing business,
Pincay thought out loud about moving to a softer circuit in
Northern California or Washington state. That might have cleared
his path to the record and tainted it at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay decided against the move because it would have meant
flying on Mondays and Tuesdays to be with his wife, Jeanine, and
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided maybe I could do something different and improve
myself so I could ride better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A new diet has increased Pincay's energy and stamina, allowing
him to stay home and pick up his win rate all at once.
</P>
<P>
   The man with the miniature Mr. Panama physique said he has been
able to increase his daily calorie intake to 850 by eating more
fruit, cutting back from two or three glasses of wine a week to
one, and eliminating the nondairy creamer from his morning tea.
</P>
<P>
   He spares no detail to weigh out at 117 pounds on a body made
for 140.
</P>
<P>
   The results: 86 wins (15 percent) in 1999, on pace for his best
season since 1992; 30 wins so far at Hollywood Park, good for a
fourth-place tie in the standings; a gratifying victory June 25 in
the four-race National All-Star Jockey Challenge at Lone Star Park
near Dallas; and Hollywood Park stakes victories last weekend
aboard Virginie in the Beverly Hills Handicap and Salish Shaman in
the Harry Henson.
</P>
<P>
   The only bad news lately is Pincay's split with trainer Bill
Spawr _ the result, the rider says, of a misunderstanding between
agent Bob Meldahl and Spawr over a riding assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming he stays healthy and keeps winning at this rate, the
question is whether Pincay will break the record late in the Nov.
10 to Dec. 20 Hollywood Park meet or the Dec. 26-on Santa Anita
meet.
</P>
<P>
   Leading Hollywood Park jockey Alex Solis, a fellow Panamanian,
said he senses the record chase is ``adding to his motivation.''
But Pincay said he tries not to follow the countdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no pressure,'' Pincay said. ``I have all the time I
need. The way I feel, I can ride another five years.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Voice change: Michael Wrona is on his way home to Brisbane,
Australia, to be with an ailing grandfather. Alan Buchdahl will
call the races for the last nine days of the Hollywood Park meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been like a father to me,'' Wrona, whose parents divorced
when he was young, said of Harry Deane, hospitalized since March.
``It's very important I'm back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrona, who replaced the outstanding Luke Kruytbosch, has been a
delight in his return to Hollywood _ observant, informed, creative
and, refreshingly, intent on pronouncing names correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, Trevor Denman will return from his Minnesota
farm to call the Del Mar, Fairplex Park and Oak Tree meets.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: Pincay will ride Quake in Saturday's Bel Air
Handicap, the race that set up 1998 winner Free House for a victory
in the Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Without anything resembling Free House in the 1 1/16-mile Bel
Air this time, 4-year-old Quake could win his first stakes, easing
trainer Richard Mandella's frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not real smart and that's the best thing I can say about
him,'' Mandella said of Quake. ``But the bottom line is, he can
run.''
</P>
<P>
   Quake, coming off a three-length win in an optional-claiming
sprint with Pincay, faces seven horses, including Barter Town
(Victor Espinoza) and Scooter Brown (Alex Solis), second and third
in the All-American Handicap at Golden Gate Fields.
</P>
<P>
   __ Series injury: Puerto Madero, last in the Hollywood Gold Cup,
his third disappointing performance since his Donn Handicap
victory, will miss most of the rest of the year with a left-front
ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella said a nuclear scan, more intensive than an X-ray,
showed ``some kind of stress'' in the sesamoid bone, which could
have developed into a fracture.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 5-year-old Chile-bred is expected to race again,
this is another blow to the inaugural ``NTRA Champions on Fox''
series for older horses. Puerto Madero, Free House (injured) and
Silver Charm (retired), third through fifth in the points behind
Behrens and Real Quiet, will miss the series-ending Pacific Classic
at Del Mar on Aug. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Madero's 20 points would have been worth $100,000 to
owners R.D. Hubbard and Dwight Sutherland if he'd won the Pacific
Classic, less if he'd finished second through fifth. Under the
series' contrived rules, missing the climactic race will render the
points worthless. &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES &QL; 
__ Hollywood Park leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Alex Solis,
48 wins; David Flores, 41; Garrett Gomez, 36; Laffit Pincay and
Emile Ramsammy, 30. Trainers: Ron McAnally, 23; Bob Baffert, Julio
Canani, David Hofmans and John Sadler, 13. &QL; 
__ Handicapper helper: The tight turns of most turf courses give an
edge to horses starting from inside-post positions. At Hollywood
Park it depends on the distance. At 1 mile and longer, post 1 has
produced a staggering 19 percent of the winners. But in the
5{-furlong sprints, post 1 has yielded only 1 winner in 31 tries. &QL; 
__ On the stakes schedule: At Hollywood Park: Saturday, $125,000
Bel Air Handicap, 3-year-olds and up, 1 1/16 miles; Sunday,
$125,000 Khaled, California-breds 3 and up, 1 1/16 miles on turf.
At Belmont Park: Saturday, $150,000 Bowling Green Handicap,
3-year-olds and up, 1] miles on turf; Sunday, $150,000 Dwyer,
3-year-olds, 1 1/16 miles. At Monmouth Park: Saturday, $150,000
Monmouth Oaks, 3-year-old fillies, 1 1/16 miles. &QL; 
__ Mileposts: Frank Stronach's Magna International, which owns
Santa Anita, announced an agreement to purchase Gulfstream Park
near Miami from a Japanese concern for a reported $95 million. The
deal is expected to close before Gulfstream hosts the Nov. 6
Breeders' Cup. Stronach will control the nation's two major winter
thoroughbred tracks and take on Churchill Downs in both Los Angeles
(where Churchill is taking over Hollywood Park) and Miami (where
Churchill runs Calder). . . . The Meadowlands harness announcer
will resign in September but receive a reported $250,000 from the
New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority in a lawsuit settlement.
John Bothe accused track management of trying to force him to
conduct televised handicapping seminars, which he said could plunge
him back into compulsive gambling. The suit inspired debate last
winter over the very existence of compulsive gambling, including
Andy Beyer's assertion that people who find ruin at the track are
simply ``bad bettors.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   Behrens' Suburban Handicap victory at Belmont Park solidified
his ``NTRA Champions on Fox'' series lead and sent him past Victory
Gallop to No. 1 in the NTRA media poll. . . . Louisiana refused to
renew the license Billy Patin used to ride at Evangeline Downs
after Arkansas suspended him for five years for using a battery on
Valhol in the Arkansas Derby. Patin's lawyer said he intends to
appeal. Valhol won the Arkansas Derby but was disqualified. The
Dallas Keen-trained 3-year-old was ridden by Donnie Meche when he
scored his first official victory June 30 in an allowance race at
Lone Star Park in Texas. . . . Cat Thief joined General Challenge
and Desert Hero among probables for the July 18 Swaps Stakes. Cat
Thief trainer D. Wayne Lukas is tied with Gary Jones for most Swaps
victories with three. . . . San Fernando winner Dixie Dot Com
(broken cannon bone) aims for a mid-August return. ``Our long-range
dream _ with an emphasis on dream _ is the Breeders' Cup Classic,''
trainer Bill Morey said. . . . Emile Ramsammy (broken collarbone)
thinks he could ride before Hollywood Park closes July 19. . . .
Average win payoff at Hollywood last Friday night: $33. . . .
National leaders just past the year's midpoint: Shane Sellers
($7,850,421) and Edgar Prado (244 wins) among jockeys; Bob Baffert
($7,475,101) and Dale Baird (156 wins) among trainers; Charismatic
($2,007,404) among horses. . . . The 12-day Vallejo fair opens
Wednesday. . . . Del Mar, whose meet opens July 22, will take
simulcast bets on Saratoga and Monmouth (N.J.) Park _ and Ellis
Park in Kentucky on Monmouth's dark Mondays. . . . Fries with that
trifecta? Lone Star has become the second track _ after Keeneland _
to offer drive-up windows for early-bird betting. &QL;

AT $90 MILLION, ROTHSCHILD SALE EXCEEDS GOALS

   LONDON _ Sales records were broken one after another for Old
Master paintings, medieval manuscripts and antiques of every
variety here at Christie's on Thursday as more than
three-and-a-half hours of feverish bidding erupted over a trove of
treasures looted by the Nazis and returned to the Rothschild family
this year by the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   Prized Frans Hals portraits, an illuminated medieval prayer book
and a Louis XVI royal commode were among the highlights that
attracted record-shattering bids for the more than 200 lots,
holdings from the Austrian branch of the great banking family.
</P>
<P>
   The sale jammed Christie's Great Hall to overflow, with many
members of other branches of the Rothschild family present and
bidding, officials at the auction house said. Virtually every item
sold, most for more than their estimated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to bring in $40 million, the sale totaled $89.9 million
as it reached its exhausting ending.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Christie's said 10 records were set: five for
Old Masters paintings and for a manuscript sold at auction, an
Italian manuscript sold at auction, a piece of furniture sold at
auction and a carpet sold at auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most successful sales in the history of
auctions in Europe,'' said Lord Hindlip, chairman of Christie's.
``Never before has such a cross-section of the arts fetched such
extraordinary sums of money in one evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Attracting the attention were the glittering contents of the
family palaces originally belonging to the brothers Albert and
Nathaniel von Rothschild in southwest Austria. They had acquired a
staggering variety of holdings from the declining monarchs and
aristocrats of 19th-century Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were connoisseurs and passionate collectors who
personified the opulence of fin-de-siecle Vienna. But the family's
holdings were seized by the Nazis during the German Anschluss in
1938. When surviving members tried to retrieve their possessions
after the war, the Austrian government allowed them to leave the
country with only a portion of what they owned, citing an export
law, similar to those in other European countries, that forbade the
movement of many treasured works out of the country. Many of them
were hung in Vienna's great museums. The Rothschilds and other
families said they agreed to leave their works only under duress.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her intention to return the possessions, Austrian
Culture Minister Elisabeth Gehrer said last year that she wanted to
rectify what she termed immoral decisions at the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   She ran into criticism from some Austrians who viewed the
post-war agreements as legitimate and also argued that the valuable
art works belonged not in a private collection but in public view.
</P>
<P>
   Saying their holdings had been vastly reduced over the years, in
part because of wartime destruction by the Nazis, family members
decided to auction the holdings after they were removed from the
museums and released to them this year.
</P>
<P>
   Present Thursday was the Baroness Bettina de Rothschild, the
matriarch of the Austrian branch, who watched the sale on a
closed-circuit television monitor from a private office at
Christie's. The baroness, along with her two children, a niece and
a nephew were the sellers. They watched as one by one, Old Master
paintings, French furniture, clocks, textiles, scientific
instruments, Islamic glass and illuminated manuscripts were sold
for multiples of their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday how many of them would wind up in the
hands of museums and on public view. Most of them ended up going to
an international group of collectors.
</P>
<P>
   One museum that did buy one of the evening's most expensive
objects was Versailles. It bought a commode made by Jean-Henri
Riesener, the finest cabinetmaker to work for Louis XVI; it was
delivered to him for Fontainebleau in October 1778 and in 1787 sent
to Versailles. The French museum paid $10.9 million, 2.5 times the
high estimate, $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Christie's said other museums had made purchases as
well, but none were ready to announce them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One visible bidder was Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the
emir of Qatar, who bought two mosque lamps and two carpets for
roughly $6.6 million. Most of the bidding was done either on the
telephone or through dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The highest priced work in the sale was a prayer book, a
medieval illuminated manuscript containing 67 full-page miniatures.
Five people tried to buy the work, which was estimated to sell for
$3.3 million to $4.9 million. It sold to an unidentified telephone
bidder for $13.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The same bidder bought another manuscript, the Cornaro Missal,
an illuminated manuscript, circa 1503, that was expected to bring
$250,000 to $330,000. It sold for $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Old Master paintings also fetched record prices.
Among the finest was Frans Hals' portrait of Amsterdam merchant
Tieleman Roosterman. The three-quarter-length portrait shows him
posed in black with a white ruffled color and cuffs. In the upper
right corner of the painting is the Roosterman coat of arms.
Estimated to sell for $4.1 million to $5.7 million, it was bought
by Clovis Whitfield, a London dealer for $12.8 million, making it
the second highest priced work in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for a Hals was set on July 3, 1997, at
Sotheby's in London when ``St. John the Evangelist'' sold for $2.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Three Hals paintings were sold Thursday night. One of the
others, a ``Portrait of a Gentleman,'' in a black coat and cape
with a black hat and gloves in his left hand, carried an estimate
of $2 million to $2.9 million; it was bought by an unidentified
telephone bidder for $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Cooney, a private dealer in New York, bought ``Portrait
of a Lady,'' also dressed in black, which had an estimate of $1.3
million to $2 million, for $1.4 million. Cooney also bought
Tenier's portrait of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his picture
gallery for $4.6 million, nearly three times its high estimate of
$1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   An evening landscape by Wynants, estimated to sell for $330,000
to $490,000, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $3.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many works that sold for far more than their estimates
were a Louis XVI ormolu-mounted long-case clock made for the Duc de
Choiseul, which was expected to bring $820,000 to $1.3 million. It
sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik al-Thani bought a 16th-century Tabriz medallion carpet for
$2.4 million, way above its $410,000 high estimate. A 10{-inch
Louis XV microscope, estimated to sell for $130,000 to $200,000,
was snapped up on the telephone for $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the sale, Peter Looram, the son of the baroness, said he
was speechless at the results. ``I had no idea it would do this
well,'' he said. ``Who wouldn't be shocked?''

this year by the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   Prized Frans Hals portraits, an illuminated medieval prayer book
and a Louis XVI royal commode were among the highlights that
attracted record-shattering bids for the more than 200 lots,
holdings from the Austrian branch of the great banking family.
</P>
<P>
   The sale jammed Christie's Great Hall to overflow, with many
members of other branches of the Rothschild family present and
bidding, officials at the auction house said. Virtually every item
sold, most for more than their estimated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to bring in $40 million, the sale totaled $89.9 million
as it reached its exhausting ending.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Christie's said 10 records were set: five for
Old Masters paintings and for a manuscript sold at auction, an
Italian manuscript sold at auction, a piece of furniture sold at
auction and a carpet sold at auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most successful sales in the history of
auctions in Europe,'' said Lord Hindlip, chairman of Christie's.
``Never before has such a cross-section of the arts fetched such
extraordinary sums of money in one evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Attracting the attention were the glittering contents of the
family palaces originally belonging to the brothers Albert and
Nathaniel von Rothschild in southwest Austria. They had acquired a
staggering variety of holdings from the declining monarchs and
aristocrats of 19th-century Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were connoisseurs and passionate collectors who
personified the opulence of fin-de-siecle Vienna. But the family's
holdings were seized by the Nazis during the German Anschluss in
1938. When surviving members tried to retrieve their possessions
after the war, the Austrian government allowed them to leave the
country with only a portion of what they owned, citing an export
law, similar to those in other European countries, that forbade the
movement of many treasured works out of the country. Many of them
were hung in Vienna's great museums. The Rothschilds and other
families said they agreed to leave their works only under duress.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her intention to return the possessions, Austrian
Culture Minister Elisabeth Gehrer said last year that she wanted to
rectify what she termed immoral decisions at the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   She ran into criticism from some Austrians who viewed the
post-war agreements as legitimate and also argued that the valuable
art works belonged not in a private collection but in public view.
</P>
<P>
   Saying their holdings had been vastly reduced over the years, in
part because of wartime destruction by the Nazis, family members
decided to auction the holdings after they were removed from the
museums and released to them this year.
</P>
<P>
   Present Thursday was the Baroness Bettina de Rothschild, the
matriarch of the Austrian branch, who watched the sale on a
closed-circuit television monitor from a private office at
Christie's. The baroness, along with her two children, a niece and
a nephew were the sellers. They watched as one by one, Old Master
paintings, French furniture, clocks, textiles, scientific
instruments, Islamic glass and illuminated manuscripts were sold
for multiples of their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday how many of them would wind up in the
hands of museums and on public view. Most of them ended up going to
an international group of collectors.
</P>
<P>
   One museum that did buy one of the evening's most expensive
objects was Versailles. It bought a commode made by Jean-Henri
Riesener, the finest cabinetmaker to work for Louis XVI; it was
delivered to him for Fontainebleau in October 1778 and in 1787 sent
to Versailles. The French museum paid $10.9 million, 2.5 times the
high estimate, $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Christie's said other museums had made purchases as
well, but none were ready to announce them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One visible bidder was Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the
emir of Qatar, who bought two mosque lamps and two carpets for
roughly $6.6 million. Most of the bidding was done either on the
telephone or through dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The highest priced work in the sale was a prayer book, a
medieval illuminated manuscript containing 67 full-page miniatures.
Five people tried to buy the work, which was estimated to sell for
$3.3 million to $4.9 million. It sold to an unidentified telephone
bidder for $13.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The same bidder bought another manuscript, the Cornaro Missal,
an illuminated manuscript, circa 1503, that was expected to bring
$250,000 to $330,000. It sold for $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Old Master paintings also fetched record prices.
Among the finest was Frans Hals' portrait of Amsterdam merchant
Tieleman Roosterman. The three-quarter-length portrait shows him
posed in black with a white ruffled color and cuffs. In the upper
right corner of the painting is the Roosterman coat of arms.
Estimated to sell for $4.1 million to $5.7 million, it was bought
by Clovis Whitfield, a London dealer for $12.8 million, making it
the second highest priced work in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for a Hals was set on July 3, 1997, at
Sotheby's in London when ``St. John the Evangelist'' sold for $2.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Three Hals paintings were sold Thursday night. One of the
others, a ``Portrait of a Gentleman,'' in a black coat and cape
with a black hat and gloves in his left hand, carried an estimate
of $2 million to $2.9 million; it was bought by an unidentified
telephone bidder for $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Cooney, a private dealer in New York, bought ``Portrait
of a Lady,'' also dressed in black, which had an estimate of $1.3
million to $2 million, for $1.4 million. Cooney also bought
Tenier's portrait of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his picture
gallery for $4.6 million, nearly three times its high estimate of
$1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   An evening landscape by Wynants, estimated to sell for $330,000
to $490,000, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $3.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many works that sold for far more than their estimates
were a Louis XVI ormolu-mounted long-case clock made for the Duc de
Choiseul, which was expected to bring $820,000 to $1.3 million. It
sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik al-Thani bought a 16th-century Tabriz medallion carpet for
$2.4 million, way above its $410,000 high estimate. A 10{-inch
Louis XV microscope, estimated to sell for $130,000 to $200,000,
was snapped up on the telephone for $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the sale, Peter Looram, the son of the baroness, said he
was speechless at the results. ``I had no idea it would do this
well,'' he said. ``Who wouldn't be shocked?''

AD COLUMN: DELIVERING A MESSAGE BEFORE THE CONSUMER SEES IT
COMING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alexander Gelman came to New York from Moscow six
years ago with few contacts in advertising but an impressive
``book'' of design work from a big Russian publishing house where
he was creative director.
</P>
<P>
   Now at the age of 31, he is one of New York's hot young art
directors with a tiny but thriving company called Design Machine, &UR;  &LR; 
which has done advertising projects for such powerhouses as J.
Walter Thompson, Dell Computer, Absolut Vodka and MTV.
</P>
<P>
   His success reflects the growing importance of art design in
advertising and marketing. Many design firms _ from the small ones
like Design Machine to big firms like the Attik &UR;  &LR; and Duffy Design
and Interactive _ are finding their talents more in demand as
visuals become more important to communicating a message.
</P>
<P>
   Strong art and design is taking the front seat as companies try
to cut through that growing enemy of advertising: media clutter. A
properly designed visual can provide an instantaneous message and
feeling. And it can capture the attention of consumers quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. 1 is that the consumer is on to us,'' Bill Oberlander,
executive creative director of Kirshenbaum Bond &UR;  &LR; &AMP; Partners and
president of the Art Directors Club, said. ``They know advertising
100 miles off and when they see it coming they're programmed to
shoot it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Art direction,'' he said, ``offers a faster, deeper and more
emotional connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Designers are taking a greater role in defining and executing a
brand's look and image, from the logo design to the package to the
advertising. At Kirshenbaum Bond, designers recently sat with the
advertising team at work on a product line for Target stores. Duffy
Design regularly goes into pitch meetings with its owner, Fallon
McElligott, to offer clients a totally integrated campaign from
typeface to finished advertising.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Duffy Design created the logo and the packaging
for Coca-Cola's Fruitopia, and worked with the advertising agency
on the advertising. Duffy and Fallon are currently working on an
integrated program of brand identity, packaging and advertising for
FAO Schwarz, the venerated toy store, and for Nordstrom department
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Design firms are now often brought in at the start of a project.
In the past they might be the last to get an assignment after all
the important brand decisions had been made, said Jim Moran, who
heads the New York office of the Attik.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just an afterthought anymore,'' Moran said. ``We
have much more say now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the way some of the design firms describe themselves has
changed. Years ago, Design Machine might have been called a design
firm or a graphic-arts house. Gelman says he explains to clients
that his firm is a ``multidisciplinary branding company.''
</P>
<P>
   In the business, it is known as convergence. Gelman is a design
specialist but his firm does everything from brand research to Web
site design to planning a client's party. The Attik now produces
television commercials, and 40 percent of Duffy Design's work now
involves interactive design on the Web. Duffy said interactive
design alone has opened up a whole new world of design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that if you're on top of what's going on there is no
distinction between branding, advertising or product design,''
Gelman said. ``We're a business consultancy that helps solve
communications problems using design and art.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott has been using designers as part of a
whole-brand approach for years, said Alison Burns, president of
Fallon McElligott, New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Design is no more separate than account planning or media,''
Ms. Burns said. ``Using design to help solve the brand problem
seems to me a no-brainer _ it's where the whole thing starts.`
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, in a media-cluttered world, the look everyone
is after is to not look like advertising. The trend is toward
minimalism, with clean lines, not much copy, a strong visual
element and often a clever message. The look is designed to catch
the consumer off guard _ like one print ad that shows a photograph
of feet, with just the toes sunburned. The ad is for Wonderbra.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ideas _ sometimes you have to search and think about it
before you get it and there's often a sense of humor,'' said Myrna
Davis, executive director of the Art Directors Club in New York.
``It's not about the product anymore, it's really about things
around the product that engage you, almost like guerrilla marketing
_ the product is noticed after the feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the focus on design, many small shops have popped up
around the city, and the bigger firms are growing. The Attik, which
was started in 1986 in an attic in England, now has five offices
and 130 people on staff. The Art Directors Club, a venerable old
boys club dating back to 1920, says its membership is expanding and
its events are often sold out. People lined up at the opening
exhibit of its Young Guns II show, a biennial exhibit of
outstanding work in visual media created by people 35 and under.
</P>
<P>
   Gelman _ who wears his head shaved and goes by the moniker of
just ``Gelman'' _ believes his firm is growing because advertisers
and agencies are looking to young, small firms for cutting-edge
ideas. While he has just five staff members, he said he literally
had dozens of designers in all media at his disposal to work on
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The designers are known as perma-lancers who work in advertising
the way actors work in Hollywood, jumping from one job to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Oberlander agreed, saying creative companies are willing to take
new ideas wherever they can find them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big business knows that the old ideas aren't cutting it
anymore, and it needs young renegade minds to connect to
consumers,'' he said. ``I definitely think there's a trend to find
unconventional ways to reinvent brands.''

GE EARNINGS EXCEED EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Wash.)   (jw) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   General Electric Co., benefiting from its continued push into
high-margin service businesses as well as from improved efficiency,
reported Thursday that its second-quarter earnings rose 15 percent,
slightly beating analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   GE, based in Fairfield, Conn., posted earnings of $2.82 billion,
or 85 cents a diluted share, which compared with $2.45 billion, or
74 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. The company
enjoyed strong top-line growth in each of its 11 businesses,
lifting revenue 9.3 percent, to $27.4 billion from $25.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Although GE's earnings beat analysts' estimates by a penny a
share, its stock still foundered in a down market. After investors
drove the stock up $4 this week in anticipation of stellar numbers,
shares of GE fell 87.5 cents, to $117.0625.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most analysts say the solid performance is a harbinger of
better quarters ahead. ``The underlying growth of this company is a
tad better than people had been assuming,'' said Russell Leavitt,
an analyst with Banc of America Securities.
</P>
<P>
   There was some bad news: Price pressure hurt earnings in its
appliance business, while the finance arm, GE Capital, has had
trouble with accounts receivable in a few of the companies it
acquired last year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, GE Capital led the company's earnings growth, with a 17
percent increase, to $1.092 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the company's NBC television unit had strong growth, with
earnings up 15 percent. ``Considering that most of its competitors
are struggling to get by, NBC's numbers are staggering,'' said one
analyst, whose firm's policy prohibits identification.
</P>
<P>
   The company's Six Sigma program, which is intended to produce
near-perfect quality and eliminate defects, also contributed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most industrial companies, GE was helped by the Asian
economic crisis. It has expanded in Asia primarily through
acquisitions, ``so it used the strong dollar to pick up assets at
rock-bottom prices,'' Leavitt said.
</P>
<P>
   GE's industrial businesses had a particularly lucrative quarter.
The booming economy has sent utilities rushing to buy generators.
That pushed the volume at GE Power Systems up by 60 percent for the
first half, ``and this hot summer means sales will remain strong,''
said GE spokesman Bruce Bunch.
</P>
<P>
   The fast-growing market for small aircraft helped GE Aircraft
Engines, which also was just named the exclusive supplier of
engines for the Boeing Corp.'s new long-range 777 aircraft. The
industrial businesses also are experiencing increased demand for
maintenance and other high-margin services.
</P>
<P>
   And GE continues to invest in Internet technologies and
companies. Polymerland, GE's plastics distribution business,
already conducts 15 percent of its business on the Internet. NBC
joined the fast-growing portal site Xoom.com to create NBC
Internet, a publicly traded company with services that NBC can
promote on its broadcast shows and which can in turn promote
NBC-related products on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The appliances business has joined Buildnet.net to sell
refrigerators and other large items to contractors over the
Internet. GE Capital has invested in more than 40 Internet
companies and has started operating a vehicle-leasing business on
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our businesses are going flat out to utilize
E-commerce,'' Bunch said.

CAPTURING WWC'S VISUAL JOURNEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, remember the goose bumps viewers had all across America when
the U.S. women's soccer team captured the gold medal at the '96
Olympics?
</P>
<P>
   It's more like goose eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you were there to witness the darn thing (here's the
test: who the heck did the U.S. play in the title game?) there
wasn't any way to see it. NBC's virtually live coverage of the '96
Atlanta Games might have included a few highlight snippets from the
game, but that's about how it covered the U.S. women's softball
gold-medal game, too.
</P>
<P>
   Blame the network, which in part is responsible. But in its
defense, it really had no data to justify live coverage of a
women's team event. With so many other things going on _ including
a park bombing _ that game, as well as the tournament, was lost in
the mix.
</P>
<P>
   This comes up again because ABC and ESPN have captured what
executive producer Geoff Mason loves to call lighting in a bottle.
Both networks have made the U.S. national team's run to the FIFA
Women's World Cup soccer title game Saturday a completely different
visual journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, television is the reason,'' ABC/ESPN soccer
play-by-play man J.P. Dellacamera said when asked why more people
know about this team today even though the core is the same squad
from '96. ``Going back to the 1995 Women's World Cup, we did five
games total (on ESPN) and that was it. We couldn't give any kind of
overview then. Now by televising every game there's so much media
attention _ even David Letterman is talking about it every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellacamera adds he's ``always disappointed when there's a big
event and they don't give soccer full coverage. NBC will have to do
it differently in the next Olympics (a year from now from
Australia) partially because of the feedback. Those numbers don't
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The early, microscopic TV ratings have finally gotten better.
The U.S.-Brazil contest on the Fourth of July was the most-watched
soccer telecast ever on ESPN _ 2.9 million homes, based on a 3.8
rating. Back in '94, the U.S. men's World Cup win over Colombia was
viewed in 2.7 million homes, according to Nielsen research. For the
tournament, ESPN has averaged a 1.45 rating (1.1 million homes) on
seven telecasts; ESPN2 has a 0.54 rating (347,700 homes) for the 22
broadcasts that included the U.S.-North Korea match on June 27.
</P>
<P>
   And _ surprise _ buried in those stats is the fact that nearly
two of every three viewers are men, who are used to grazing on ESPN
and will watch whatever fodder is on.
</P>
<P>
   ABC won't attempt to guess what the ratings will be for
Saturday's President Clinton-attended final between the U.S. and
China, basically because it doesn't want Nielsen-ratings
comparisons to other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know ratings are a measure of success in this business, but
from what I gather, the programming people who analyze this are
thrilled,'' said Mason. ``In my opinion, the ratings are
respectable, but what do I know? I'm just worried about production.
We've surpassed expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Going from here: Just as Disney's ABC/ESPN broadcasting combo
has helped prop up the men's Major League Soccer as a programming
option based on the success of the '94 World Cup, there's
speculation that the networks will go one step further to help
support a women's pro league _ possibly going so far as to own and
operate the venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard nothing to indicate it, but in this business of a
virtual explosion of programming alternatives, maybe it's a good
idea,'' said Mason. ``I'm not surprised by anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He concluded: ``I guess it speaks about a new world where . . .
Title IX has made things different and, among other things,
catalyzed aggressive approaches that have resulted in wonderful
opportunities. This is an example of the kinds of achievements
women in sports are capable of. This is only a precursor. You'll
see more of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider yourself warned.
</P>
<P>
   __ Down to the last (Media) One: Fox Sports West 2's Dodgers
coverage for the rest of the season has been picked up by all
Southern California-area cable operators except the 500,000
customers in the Media One area that covers the Hollywood and South
Bay areas. A Media One spokesperson doesn't expect an agreement
anytime soon and Media One vice president of marketing Scott Tenney
is quoted in this week's Los Angeles Business Journal as saying he
feels Fox has ``held us hostage'' and it ``looks unlikely that
we'll carry the extra games.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fox expects to have a reworked agreement with
Marcus/Charter, the system that covers Glendale and Burbank and was
at the eye of the storm when the increased-cost issue came up
several weeks ago. Talks actually began after Fox, acting in good
faith, agreed to resume its cable feed to the system last Friday.
Hoping to smooth over all hard feelings between the cable company
and the customers, Fox and Marcus/Charter will likely co-sponsor a
Dodgers-ticket giveaway for new subscribers next month.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Dodgers-Rockies telecast Tuesday, which was the
deadline for implementing the second 40 games of the 80-game
Dodgers package, Fox reached an agreement with Time-Warner, which
covers much of the West San Fernando Valley. TCI, which covers most
of the East Valley, was on board from the beginning. &QL; 
WHAT SMOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ As much as we'd have loved to hear him rant again four hours
a day, Joe McDonnell will stay anchored at KFWB. Two weeks ago, he
and Doug Krikorian were all but set to restart their weekday
afternoon sports-talk show at One-On-One's KCTA-AM (1540). But
after KFWB gave McDonnell a day to think about it, he decided it
wasn't worth leaving the stable all-news station. ``It was going to
be a revenge thing,'' admitted McDonnell, who salivated at the idea
of going up against the station that fired him, AM-1150. ``But why
let them still control me? I can do my thing _ be a journalist and
do commentaries at KFWB. They would have let me out of my contract,
but it would be idiotic to blow this job off at this point. Burning
KXTA wasn't enough of a reason to leave.'' &QL; 
__ Let's hope KTLA Channel 5 doesn't give up so quickly on new
weekend anchor Claudia Trejos. Based on her first day on the air
last weekend, she just has one real shortcoming _ she doesn't speak
English. Once she gets past that, it'll surely be muy bien, si? &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES
</P>
<P>
   __ I want my mummy: Apparently exhausting her talents at Fox
after raiding tombs in Egypt, Suzy Kolber has left the network
after 2{ years and will return to ESPN in August to co-anchor the
3:30 p.m. ``SportsCenter'' and work as the network's NFL reporter. &QL; 
__ Fox Sports' catch-and-release philosophy continues with the
announcement that it will televise the $3.5 million Ranger
Millennium M1 Bass Tournament in early November. The 90-minute
broadcast, which will air before or after that day's NFL telecast,
also includes an unprecedented hour of live network coverage from
the action. Is Kolber sure she wants to leave so soon? &QL; 
__ Something you can count on not making the KTLA Channel 5 ``News
At 10'' highlight reel: Recently deposed sportscaster Ed Arnold
will be recognized for his 30-plus years of broadcasting and
community service with a tribute on Wednesday sponsored by the Los
Angeles Sports &AMP; Entertainment Commission in downtown L.A.

   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For a long time, Cheryl Ford refused to play
basketball.

   To her friends and grade-school coaches, Ford seemed a natural.
Not only was she always tall for her age, but she was the daughter

   ``I didn't want to follow in his footsteps,'' Ford said of her
father.
</P>
<P>
   Years of pestering finally persuaded Ford to take up the game as
an eighth-grader in her hometown of Summerfield, La. Now, whether
she likes it or not, she is following in her father's footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-3 post player is a Nike High School All-American and
was a member of last year's U.S. Junior Olympic team. She is
playing for the second-seeded Monroe Magic _ wearing No. 32, like
her father _ in this week's Amateur Athletic Union 18-and-under
Girls Basketball National Championships in Arlington and Mansfield,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   She will begin her college career on scholarship at Louisiana
Tech _ her father's alma mater _ this fall and says her eventual
goals are the Olympics and the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess \Rbasketball\S grew on me,'' she said. ``It's a huge
part of my life now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford would rather play basketball than deal with the media
attention that has come with being a top player and daughter of an
NBA star. Malone fathered Ford and her twin brother, Daryl, during
a brief relationship with Bonita Ford when he was 18. He had been
estranged from his daughter until last year and has been in
Arlington and Mansfield this week to watch her play.
</P>
<P>
   The Magic won its quarterfinal game yesterday, defeating
Indiana's Finest, 81-71. Monroe plays the Georgia Magic in the
semifinals at 10:30 a.m. today at Mansfield High School's north
campus.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was unavailable for comment yesterday, and the
18-year-old Ford said she gets tired of the question about her
famous father. She said she wears No. 32 because it was the number
her mother, Bonita Ford, wore as a high school player, and that she
chose to attend Tech for her own reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets on my nerves when people ask me if I'm his daughter
because you know they already know,'' Ford said. ``I've made my
decisions on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   In March, Malone said he made a decision to re-establish a
relationship with Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised by my granddad and my mom,'' said Malone, who is
married and has three children with his wife, Kay. ``My father
committed suicide when I was 5. I was bitter for a long time. I
finally got over it about five years ago. But I learned something
from it: If you ever have the opportunity to make things right, do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance to do something about that for the twins. I
told the twins, `What me and your mom did was a mistake, but you
guys are not a mistake. I want to be part of your life. I want to
be a dad and a friend, and I am not going to overwhelm you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Ford gives the credit for her basketball skills to Monroe Magic
coach Linda Harper, former head women's coach at Northeast
Louisiana in Monroe. Harper has guided Ford since Ford took up the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw her, I noticed how well she could run up and
down the floor. And she had great hands,'' Harper said. ``She just
needed help in developing her shot and some post moves.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford has developed those moves, and this season has averaged 19
points, nine rebounds and three blocked shots per game for the
Magic. She has been hampered by a sore right shoulder, which she
injured at the beginning of the season. Ford said she is scheduled
to have surgery on the shoulder Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the team would rather have Ford injured than not at all.
The Magic finished second to Team Texas in last year's tournament
without Ford, who was in Russia with the U.S. junior team.
</P>
<P>
   ``She doesn't mind telling another player when they need to step
up,'' Harper said. ``And when a game's on the line, she plays
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper said Ford has the ability to be a top college player, and
said Ford better be ready to handle even more attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to start comparing her to her father, and
that will put a lot of pressure on her,'' she said. ``But we each
have a mold that's our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Ford eventually decided basketball was part of her mold.

MRS. CLINTON SPLITS WITH PRESIDENT OVER ISRAEL ISSUE

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLINTON, N.Y. _ Taking a position that differs from her
husband's policy on a rancorous Middle East dispute, Hillary Rodham
Clinton says she considers Jerusalem the ``eternal and indivisible
capital of Israel'' and favors moving the U.S. Embassy there from
Tel Aviv as soon as possible, according to a letter released by her
aides Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's position on what is perhaps the most difficult
issue in the Middle East peace negotiations _ the permanent status
of the city that Israel calls its capital _ was disclosed in a
letter she wrote to a conservative Jewish organization last week.
</P>
<P>
   It was reported in this week's issue of The Forward, a weekly
newspaper that covers Jewish issues. It marked the second time in a
week that Mrs. Clinton, who traveled through central New York on
Thursday in preparation for a possible run for the U.S. Senate, has
taken a position at variance with her husband's on a subject that
has particular political resonance in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton wrote the letter in response to an inquiry from
Mandell Ganchrow, president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish
Congregations of America.
</P>
<P>
   Her statements of support for Jerusalem _ a standard position
for politicians in New York _ came five months after some Jews
criticized her for expressing support for the establishment of a
permanent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   In her letter, she said, ``I personally consider Jerusalem the
eternal and indivisible capital of Israel, and I admire the
leadership shown by Senator Moynihan on this issue.'' Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, whose seat she would fill, is a leading advocate
of moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am chosen by New Yorkers to be their senator,'' she
wrote, ``or in whatever position I find myself in the years to
come, you can be sure that I will be an active, committed advocate
for a strong and secure Israel, able to live in peace with its
neighbors, with the United States Embassy located in its capital,
Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   In tone and in commitment, Mrs. Clinton's letter was unlike
anything President Clinton or his administration has said on the
subject since he took office in 1993. The language she used _
calling Jerusalem ``the eternal and indivisible capital of Israel''
_ is the very language Israel uses in discussing Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's official position is that the
future status of Jerusalem, claimed by both Israelis and Arabs,
will be determined in the final round of peace negotiations that
are now about to resume following the seating of Israel's new prime
minister, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position, the administration's position, on the issue of
Jerusalem has not changed,'' said James Foley, a State Department
spokesman, when asked in Washington about Mrs. Clinton's remarks.
``Israel and the Palestinians have agreed that Jerusalem would be
one of the issues covered in the permanent-status negotiations.
This issue needs to be dealt with by the parties themselves in the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Mrs. Clinton's views conflicted with the
administration's policy, Foley said, ``The first lady was
expressing her personal views and it does not complicate in any way
our efforts to promote and accelerate the Middle East peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Mrs. Clinton's position, he said, ``We don't have an opinion
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was the latest evidence of the uncommonly difficult
political road that Mrs. Clinton will have to negotiate if she runs
for the Senate. It is already clear that she will confront
conflicts between her husband's policies and her own political
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, she joined New York officials in a meeting at
the White House to lobby against Medicare cuts that the president
had proposed.
</P>
<P>
   The letter about Jerusalem became public as Mrs. Clinton dived
into a second day of campaigning in central New York. Tracked by an
outsized entourage of reporters and drawing large and cheerful
crowds along the way, she worked her way across the Mohawk Valley,
turning her attention to the issues of health care, Social Security
and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   As promised, Mrs. Clinton spent a good deal of her day listening
rather than talking. She spent three hours at two forums, the first
devoted to a detailed discussion of health care, the second to
issues of concerns to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Mrs. Clinton began gingerly to hint at how she
might campaign against Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York this
fall, by pledging to serve out her full six-year term if she is
elected. Giuliani has declined to make a similar pledge, in what
most Republicans take as an attempt by the mayor to leave open the
option of leaving the Senate to run for national office. There has
also been speculation that Mrs. Clinton might like to run for
president some day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to serve out the entire term,'' Mrs. Clinton said
during a 27-minute interview with 10 reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Giuliani declined to comment on Mrs. Clinton's
pledge.

BUSH, RIVALS MAKE CAMPAIGN VISITS TO UNITY CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The smooth, front-running GOP presidential campaign of
George W. Bush ran into turbulence Thursday during the Texas
governor's first visit to Washington state, amidst allegations that
Bush gave the brushoff to a national convention of minority
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did just fine among the party faithful, picking up the
endorsement of Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., packing a Spokane,
Wash., breakfast with 700 Republicans and taking in between
$250,000 and $300,000 at a party hosted by cellular telephone
billionaire Craig McCaw.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasn't the only presidential aspirant in town. GOP Sen.
John McCain and Democratic former Sen. Bill Bradley, spoke to UNITY
'99, a convention that has drawn 6,000 journalists to Seattle. Vice
President Al Gore will speak Friday on the topic of race,
technology and the future of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has reached out to the minority community, preceding his
fund-raising appearances around the country with photogenic stops
at Boys and Girls Clubs. He used such an appearance Thursday to
project Clinton-like skills in the use of symbols, photo backdrops
and one-on-one politicking.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's aides had repeatedly turned down requests that he
speak and answer questions at UNITY '99. After reading a critical
newspaper article en route to Seattle, however, he decided to make
a brief appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, son of former President George Bush, shook hands
in the exhibition hall at the Seattle Convention Center, but did
not make a speech. ``I thought I would go by and see some
friends,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, more seriously, Bush added that the drop-in was
designed to show he would be ``an inclusive-type president.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the conference were critical, however, that Bush
did not make remarks and field questions on sensitive issues like
his competitors in both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no opportunity to engage in dialogue,'' said
Catalina Camia, president of UNITY and national president of the
Asian American Journalists Association.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Baca, UNITY vice president and head of the National
Association of Hispanic Journalists, added: ``I would think the
governor would have embraced a situation like this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been ideal if he would have followed up our
invitation and made the same kind of appearance that Bradley and
Gore have scheduled,'' Baca said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, the Republican senator from Arizona, begged off a
Cincinnati appearance and rearranged his schedule to fly here and
speak to the minority journalists.
</P>
<P>
   He appealed for campaign finance reform, arguing that the
present system allows ``the wealthiest Americans'' to purchase
access to power through big political contributions. McCain said
that he and a Democratic co-sponsor, Sen. Russ Feingold of
Wisconsin, will try to add the reform measure to other legislation
pending in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also took on a pair of issues used by some Republican
groups, initiatives making English a state's ``official'' language
and measures denying social benefits to illegal immigrants and
their families.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should have to abandon the language of their birth in
order to learn and use the language of their future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the careful phrases of his ``compassionate conservatism,''
Bush steered clear of such hot button issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly oppose quotas and preferences,'' he told a news
conference after his Boys and Girls Club appearance. Bush said he
favors ``affirmative access'' but did not elaborate on what that
means.
</P>
<P>
   At a late afternoon rally in Bellevue, Wash., Bush promised to
``rally the armies of compassion'' and to make the American dream
available to every child in the land. ``The next president of the
United States must close the gap of hope and that is what I intend
to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has lost no opportunity to decry President Clinton's moral
conduct. He rallied Republicans Thursday night with a promise to
``uphold the dignity'' of the office of president.
</P>
<P>
   But he also has picked up many of Clinton's devices and
mannerisms on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend a lot of time shaking hands and looking people in the
eye,'' said Bush, who has mastered the Clinton style of the drawn
out, meaningful handshake.
</P>
<P>
   Bush stood in shirstleeves Thursday at the Boys and Girls Club,
surrounded by enthusiastic young people. Bush put his arm around
one young man. He was introduced, not by a politician, but by an
Eastlake High School senior, Paolo de Guzman, recently named 1999
Youth of the Year for Washington state by the Boys and Girls Clubs
of America.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bush was asked if he seeks the advice of his father as he
hits the presidential trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do ask him for advice,'' the governor replied. ``The first
thing I ask him for is love.''
</P>
<P>
   At only one point did Bush seem surprised. ``Did you think you
would go to university 10 years ago?'' he asked de Guzman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' replied the self-assured young man, who will attend
Pepperdine University in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has evolved a series of well-modulated positions. He did
not talk about proposed gun safety measures. He did, however, tell
the young people: ``Somebody shows up with a gun, throw him out of
school. Send him to an alternative school.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made it clear that he is a free trader, and opposes those
in the Republican Party who would try to use trade as a political
weapon against China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely!'' Bush replied when asked if, as president, he
would seek fast-track authority to negotiate new free trade
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Bush came out strongly in favor of China's bid to join the World
Trade Organization. He argued it would enhance U.S. access to
Chinese markets, and foster growth of ``an entrepreneurial class''
in China that will agitate for democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley made another of the low-key Seattle appearances that
have become a trademark of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He took a poke at Bush, telling a hall of about 550 journalists,
``I didn't change my schedule to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley focused his 45 minutes of remarks on race, health care
and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm president and you want to please the boss, then one of
the things you're going to have to do is show what you've done
toward'' promoting racial unity, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Seattle last year, the former New Jersey
senator celebrated local efforts to create a dialogue on race
through a series of small dinner parties. He added that the
dialogue created should continue across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that should be part of the air you breathe, not a
project but the way you live your life,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   P-I reporter Kimberly A.C. Wilson contributed to this report.

ON GORE CAMPAIGN, TWO ANTAGONISTS MUST NOW COOPERATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to insert clarifying material in 6th graf of 2nd take,
beginning: Eskew, for ...)  (mk) 
 By MELINDA HENNEBERGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bob Squier is more than just another consultant to
Al Gore. He has worked for Gore since the early '80s and is among
his half-dozen closest friends and advisers. Funny and smooth,
Squier relaxes the vice president, frequently travels with him and
is typically the last person he sees before a debate or an
important speech.
</P>
<P>
   So it looked like a sure sign of panic last week when the Gore
presidential campaign hired Carter Eskew, Squier's former business
partner and protege, to whom he has not spoken in the seven years
since their bitter and public breakup. Eskew has also had minimal
contact with the vice president in recent years, especially since
he began representing tobacco companies, which Gore crusades
against and blames for the lung cancer that killed his sister.
</P>
<P>
   With the American Lung Association calling for Eskew's firing
before he has even gone to work _ and Republicans openly drooling
over the whole soap opera _ the campaign insists that the move was
simply part of a long-term strategy of building the strongest
possible team, one that would put personal differences aside for
the greater good of moving Al Gore into the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   But separate interviews with Squier and Eskew cast serious doubt
on whether that will be possible. Over a lunch of nearly three
hours at his farm in Virginia, Squier did not even try to put a
happy face on recent events and had almost nothing good to say
about the man many people see as his replacement as the Gore
``message guru.'' (So far, most of the press Gore has received on
the stump could run under the headline ``Stiff Guy Still Stiff.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I had six calls from the campaign this morning about this
lunch, telling me what to say,'' Squier said by way of a greeting.
``I told them I'd say what I want and we'll explain it later.''
When asked how he and Eskew could work together, he sighed deeply
and said, ``I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Public feuding among top aides in a presidential campaign, while
never a good sign, is highly unusual at so early a moment. Though
Gore's nomination once looked inevitable, he has taken a couple of
early hits, one from President Clinton, who publicly urged the
candidate to loosen up. Just two months ago, amid concerns that his
campaign lacked direction, Gore enlisted Tony Coelho, the former
congressman from California, as a top strategist. Now Coelho's
efforts to correct the problems seem only to have compounded the
sense that the campaign is in disarray.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore communications team is still not communicating: Gore
did not deliver the news to Squier himself, and almost a week later
has still not spoken to him about it. Eskew and Squier have not
spoken at all. (Why not? ``He called me, but I haven't called him
back,'' Squier said. ``Maybe if I didn't have to speak to The New
York Times. Not that I wouldn't rather talk to you. And you won't
take that as a compliment, I hope.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore is asking for trouble bringing in two people who hate
each other,'' said Dick Morris, who has generally been a fan of
Gore and, as chief strategist to the 1996 Clinton campaign, brought
Squier in as an adviser. ``It's like asking the Albanians and the
Serbs to work together on your campaign. I have high regard for
Carter, but I didn't bring him in in '96 because I wasn't about to
start a civil war. He's making all the wrong moves at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Why had Squier and Eskew fallen out in the first place? ``I've
never said because it would be harmful to Gore if I did. It was
deeply unprofessional behavior'' on Eskew's part, he said. Later,
Squier called back to clarify that the dispute at the time Eskew
left their firm after the '92 election was over money and had
nothing to do with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   By Eskew's account, they split for no other reason than his
desire to strike out on his own. His own view of the squabble is
that Squier was deeply hurt by the abrupt way he left his mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a kid then,'' he said of years with Squier that were
like being part of a ``surrogate family.'' He added, ``I don't need
a family now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even to those who believe the hiring was a smart one, reuniting
Gore and a strategist so brilliant that personal considerations
should be disregarded, the timing seemed reactive, coming the day
after the news that both of Gore's leading competitors, Democratic
former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley and George W. Bush, the
Republican governor of Texas, had raised surprising amounts of
cash.
</P>
<P>
   Both Squier, 64, and Eskew, 44, have stellar track records as
consultants and ad makers. Mandy Grundwald, who briefly formed a
company with Eskew after the '92 election, described her former
partner as ``part of the new generation'' who had simply outgrown
his mentor. ``In '92 Bob traveled with Gore. Carter was the
creative genius,'' she said. ``I'm just surprised they were smart
enough to ask him'' to join the team.
</P>
<P>
   But Squier's many friends said the suggestion that he was past
his prime as a strategist was unfair. One of them added, ``This is
not a problem that can be solved with ads.''
</P>
<P>
   And Eskew's sudden return to Gore's inner circle made even some
allies question the vice president's personal loyalty, so
frequently cited as Gore defended the president throughout the
Lewinsky scandal. Squier defended the vice president, but said he
had gotten so many condolence calls it was ``a little like
attending your own funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Coelho was brought in as campaign manager to fix the problem of
blurred lines of authority in a top-heavy operation. But it is
unclear how the Eskew hiring will streamline the organizational
chart unless Squier leaves, a step he said he had no intention of
taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what my job is,'' Squier said. ``This is way too
important to throw away for some frivolous reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew said that when Coelho came to him a month ago, ``I asked
him if he was aware of the tensions and history, and he said,
`Yeah, I'm willing to take that on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coelho did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Though supremely gracious, serving chevre and an '82 Chateau
Montrose way too fine for a business lunch, along with frittata and
rice salad he had made himself, Squier moaned periodically
throughout the interview: ``Can't we go swimming instead? I despise
this!''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew, for his part, was unruffled. But over a drink _ Evian,
actually _ he said he did have regrets, particularly at leaving the
firm without discussing his decision with Squier. Instead, he had
his secretary distribute notes at a meeting of partners. ``Bob was
my mentor and taught me a lot of what I know about this business,''
he said. ``But I needed to establish myself on my own. If I had it
to do over, I'd leave differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his hiring, he said, neither he nor Gore have rehashed old
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I decided to come on, he said, `Welcome aboard,' and
`Get to work,''' Eskew said.
</P>
<P>
   On their difference of opinion over his work for tobacco
companies, he said: ``I can't imagine we'd have much to say. I'm
here to do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Eskew met Gore when both worked on The Nashville Tennessean
newspaper in the 1970s, but they did not know each other well. They
had a lot in common, including Tennessee roots and Washington
childhoods. Eskew, whose father was an orthodontist, went to
Sidwell Friends, Phillips Exeter Academy and Yale University.
</P>
<P>
   Squier, who comes from Minnesota, was on his own from a young
age, losing his mother to breast cancer when he was 12 and his
father to cancer, too, on the day he graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost two parents who were heavy smokers to cancer. I found
my mother,'' he said, explaining why Eskew's work for tobacco
companies got under his skin.
</P>
<P>
   He was a TV producer brought into politics by President Johnson
_ two days before Johnson decided not to run for another term. But
he stayed on to work for Hubert Humphrey, and has worked for
Democrats ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Squier and Eskew, then 24, met while working on Elizabeth
Holtzman's 1980 senatorial campaign. Later, it was Eskew who
brought in Gore's business, and the three became personal friends.
</P>
<P>
   Eskew said he hopes the reunion of the three will work. ``I
don't recall the '96 Clinton campaign being particularly
harmonious, but they bucked up and did it, and that's what we're
going to do,'' he said.

MARTINEZ BLASTS A TIE-BREAKING HOME RUN IN YANKEES FINALE AT TIGER
STADIUM  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Tiger Stadium, ancient and rundown by modern ball-park
standards, never appealed to the esthetic side of Tino Martinez.
But, he added with a smile before Thursday night's game, he always
liked hitting here.
</P>
<P>
   In the final game between the Yankees and Tigers in this old
ball park, Martinez smashed a tie-breaking home run in the top of
the ninth inning, atoning for an earlier mistake, and the Yankees
nipped the Tigers, 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 943rd meeting of the Yankees' franchise and the
Tigers at this address, at the corner of Trumbull and Michigan
avenues, and their 821st at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tigers first played the New York Highlanders _ who
preceded the Yankees in that franchise _ on June 1, 1912, the
Highlanders' best offensive player was Hal Chase, and Jack Warhop
was the best pitcher. Thursday night, Orlando Hernandez pitched
eight innings, and it was Martinez who was responsible for blowing
a lead and then establishing another.
</P>
<P>
   With two out and a runner at second in the seventh inning,
Detroit's Luis Polonia hit a hard smash toward Martinez, who fell
to his left in an attempt to stop the ball. But the grounder got
through him, a double. Hernandez looked skyward in disgust and
Martinez grimaced as Frank Catalanotto ran home with the run that
tied the score, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   C.J. Nitkowski, a left-handed reliever who has piqued the
Yankees' interest as trade bait, relieved the Detroit starter Jeff
Weaver for the ninth inning, to face Martinez. The Yankees' first
baseman foiled the Tigers' strategy by whacking his 14th home run,
into the stands in right-center field _ only the eighth hit
Nitkowski has allowed to a left-handed batter all year. Mariano
Rivera pitched the ninth inning for his 22d save.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won't miss Tiger Stadium, which opened in 1912 _
before that, the Tigers had played in Bennett Park at this site _
and their list of complaints is shared by players around the
American League. The dugouts are small and uncomfortable _ if you
are taller than 5-foot-10 and stand up, you're liable to wallop
your head against the ceiling _ and the clubhouses are veritable
closets, compared with the huge clubhouses of the newer ballparks.
The place is dingy, the paint is peeling.
</P>
<P>
   But Tiger Stadium is unique. The second deck in the right- field
stands juts out over the outfield, some 10 feet, turning catchable
fly balls into home runs. Center field is monstrous _ the wall is
440 feet from home plate _ while the alleys are short, 365 feet to
left-center field, 370 feet to right-center. The bullpens, located
in foul territory adjacent to the foul lines, include remarkably
small dugouts that house the relievers. The stands behind center
field are a solid blue, and this background is part of the reason
why hitters have always done well here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't miss it,'' said Scott Brosius, the Yankees' third
baseman, ``but I appreciate the park, the history of it, when you
think of all the Tigers that played here. You have your Ty Cobbs,
and Al Kaline, and even for someone younger like me, there was Kirk
Gibson and Sparky Anderson.''
</P>
<P>
   Brosius has toured the various corners of the park, sat in the
second deck above right field. ``The ultimate case scenario,'' said
Brosius, ``would be to have the same field and change everything
around it.''
</P>
<P>
   The reliever Jason Grimsley is looking forward to the new ball
park. Sitting in the bullpens at Tiger Stadium, said Grimsley,
makes you ``feel like you're sitting in a hole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you're in a bunker,'' he said. ``You figure
mortars will be come at you any second.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who grew up in Kalamazoo, Mich., guessed he might have
seen a dozen games here as a fan, and he liked watching the
double-play combination of Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker. But
there is no warm and fuzzy side to Tiger Stadium, as far as he's
concerned. ``I think the field is in terrible shape,'' Jeter said.
``The grass, the dirt. I think it's bad. I just think it's time for
a new one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers won that first game against the Highlanders 87 years
ago. Let the record show that the New York franchise won the last.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees begin their second series of the season with the
Mets Friday at Shea Stadium, and Yankee Manager Joe Torre &UR;  &LR; believes
there isn't nearly as much anticipation for this three-game set as
there was for the series in June. For example, Torre said he has
been asked almost no questions by reporters about this series _ and
he was asked about the June series in 10 days leading up to it.
``We'll find out if six is too much this weekend,'' said Torre, who
has made clear his distaste for the games against the Mets. But
Torre acknowledged the emphasis placed on the games within the
organization. ``It's something you can't help but pay attention
to,'' Torre said. ``Both owners want to win very badly because it's
New York.'' . . . Paul O'Neill &UR;  &LR; mentioned that he was not sure how
he'll spend his All-Star break. ``I don't know, we've got to get
through the World Series this weekend,'' O'Neill said drolly.
``It's a World Series in July.'' &QL;

   (jw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   Few places in America are as impoverished as the Pine Ridge
Indian reservation in South Dakota. On Wednesday, President Clinton
sat on a dilapidated porch belonging to a woman who had 28 people
living in her five bedrooms. He heard about the troubles of a place
where the unemployment rate among the Oglala Sioux is 73 percent.
The day before, on a sweltering afternoon, he walked through the
boarded-up streets of the Mississippi Delta town of Clarksdale.
</P>
<P>
   This week Clinton traveled through some of America's poorest
areas, turning attention to communities left out of the prosperity
enjoyed by much of the country. Such trips can raise awareness of
poverty, often, most importantly, for the politicians themselves.
John Kennedy began his anti-poverty programs after being haunted by
what he saw while campaigning in West Virginia. Robert Kennedy's
visit to the Mississippi Delta in 1967 helped set one of the themes
of his presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first president to make an official visit to an
Indian reservation since Calvin Coolidge. He is also promoting an
innovative, if somewhat limited, program designed to inject $15
billion in new capital into these communities, a more promising
plan than some previous initiatives to help depressed areas.
</P>
<P>
   America's current economic expansion, while broad, has produced
inequality not seen since the Depression. From 1980 to 1995, the
earnings of those at the bottom fell by more than a quarter in real
terms, and many also worked less and lost benefits such as
employer-paid health insurance. Their lot has improved slightly
since 1995, but they are still worse off than those at the bottom
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason is that this boom is centered on the knowledge
industry, which demands well-educated, skilled workers. Many of the
low-skill light manufacturing jobs that expanded in previous booms
have moved overseas. Unionization has declined, and the minimum
wage has dropped in real terms. The president visited six
communities bypassed by economic recovery _ Pine Ridge, towns in
Appalachia and the Mississippi Delta, the city of East St. Louis,
Ill., a Hispanic neighborhood of Phoenix and the Watts area of Los
Angeles. All suffer from poor education and low skills, buying
power and access to credit, as well as few contacts with the
business world so necessary for attracting investment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's New Markets Initiative would cost the government $1.6
billion, most of that going to a 25 percent tax credit for
investments such as community development banks and venture capital
funds that aim to bring new capital to poor communities nationwide.
Other parts of the program would provide technical assistance and
loan guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative is small, and may take more time than direct
government spending to help these communities. But a well-run
program could help create new investments rather than moving old
ones around. Many poor areas are better markets and less risky
investments than businesses realize.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress should refrain from funneling the money to
their own districts, as they did with enterprise zones. The
political powerlessness of Indian reservations and coal mining
towns leaves them vulnerable, but makes Clinton's decision to
highlight their problems all the more welcome.

EDITORIAL: THE RESISTANCE TO MILOSEVIC  
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   Even some of Slobodan Milosevic's strongholds are now the scenes
of large street rallies calling for him to step down. While this
display of clear thinking by ordinary Serbs is cheering, it is not
likely to result in a quick change in leadership. He has faced
widespread protests in the past and outwitted his opposition, and
he holds the power to do so again.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's term as president of Yugoslavia does not end until
2002. He also controls Serbia's media. What can happen when this
control lapses was dramatically illustrated in normally
pro-Milosevic Leskovac. Last Friday a television technician there
took control of his station during halftime of a widely watched
basketball game. He criticized local and national authorities and
called on people to protest. Three days later, 20,000 citizens
marched.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after the end of the Bosnian war, Serbia erupted in 100
days of street demonstrations. Milosevic agreed to restore
opposition electoral victories he had annulled in major cities,
including Belgrade. But then he divided his opponents by giving a
high government job to the most popular _ Vuk Draskovic, an
opportunistic nationalist. Although Draskovic was fired for
criticizing Belgrade's Kosovo policies, he has attacked the
opposition and until Leskovac refused to join protests.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is also good at rallying public support. It is highest
during a war, one reason he started four of them. He can do it
again, notably in Serbia's sister republic of Montenegro, whose
pro-Western leader, Milo Djukanovic, is perhaps the most credible
challenger to his rule.
</P>
<P>
   One surprising aspect of the anti-Milosevic rallies is the
dearth of attacks on NATO. But this does not mean that his critics
oppose nationalism. Many are reservists who fought in Kosovo and
are yet unpaid, refugees from Kosovo or people who think Milosevic
sold out Serbs there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, any likely replacement would be better than Milosevic. He
is a wanted war criminal, and NATO should be ready to arrest him if
it can. The West should also be helping the independent media to
resume broadcasting, perhaps from Montenegro, and encouraging a
united opposition. But democracy in Serbia cannot come from
outside. The opposition must learn from its mistakes.

CLINTON FINDS THAT THE POOR WANT A HAND UP, NOT A HANDOUT &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By NANCY MATHIS
 &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton completed his tour Thursday of
the nation's impoverished regions, following a path carved 32 years
ago by Robert F. Kennedy but eschewing the big-government politics
that made the New York senator an icon to the downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   From the desperate hollows of Kentucky to the tough streets of
Watts, Clinton's trip demonstrated how completely the Democratic
Party has overhauled its views on a major domestic plank _ its
compact with the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The party's emphasis on government action has given way to
Clinton's embrace of Wall Street investments as the key to lifting
the poor from poverty. And even Jesse Jackson, the party's leading
liberal figure, speaks of a needed ``war for profits'' in the war
on poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every place we went, nobody wanted charity; nobody wanted a
handout. What they wanted was a hand up. That's why this will work.
What people want is a good private sector job, the simple dignity
of a paycheck, the ability to house and educate their children and
provide health care for them,'' Clinton told educators in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, saying he wanted to show investors the enormous
opportunities, escorted corporate chiefs into the poorest sections
of Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, East St. Louis, Ill., the
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and a Hispanic
neighborhood in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   He closed the trip by emphasizing the need for corporate
training of youths in neighborhoods such as Watts and spoke to the
National Academy Foundation in Anaheim, which links education,
business and government leaders to help high school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last four days we have all spent together has been a
significant step toward opening America's new markets. But it can't
be the end of the journey. It has to be, instead, the opening salvo
of a battle to build a real economy in every community in this
country,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real measure of success is not whether CEOs join the
president on a trip like this which moved the nation, but whether
the same CEOs and others will return to those markets and move the
lives of the people there.''
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, Clinton maintained that the thriving national
economy _ 19 million new jobs and a jobless rate under 5 percent _
provides a historic opportunity to expand the riches to the poorest
sections. Clinton said those areas will be the key to continue
economic expansion without inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also used the trip to promote his New Market Initiative,
which would offer a series of tax incentives to businesses that
relocate or expand in areas of poverty. He said he will send
legislation to Congress next week and challenged the Republican
leadership to ``set aside its partisan differences'' and put into
law more investments for struggling communities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, while not ignoring poverty, has not placed it high on
his agenda until recently, said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political
science professor at nearby Claremont College.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality of it is the political environment has changed,
the electorate has changed, the Democratic Party has changed. We
are all moving toward the center,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The ideology-driven Kennedy, whose 1967 poverty tour also took
him to Watts and many of the same regions visited by Clinton, could
``wax lyrical'' about the need for government action, she said. But
Clinton is in a far different position.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a sitting president who is facing a Republican
Congress, a centrist electorate and a need to build a legacy,''
Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, the president's spokesman, said: ``If you go back
and look at the language he used in 1991 (when he announced for
president), you'll find it's the same. There were those in the
Democratic Party in 1991 who were slightly uncomfortable with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Democratic Party has moved much more into a
mainstream, moderate view. The president has been preaching from
this page for some time and I think there is many more converts
both within the Democratic Party and the corporate community, as
well as out in the country,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jackson, who accompanied Clinton at every stop, calls access to
capital the latest battle in the civil rights movement. Jackson
recently created the Wall Street Project to encourage Wall Street
investment firms to hire minorities.
</P>
<P>
   And, his Rainbow/PUSH operation has invested in 250 public
corporations and uses its shareholder status to encourage firms to
expand jobs to low-income areas and open retain stores in those
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson repeatedly used the down-home analogy of two winos, one
black and one white, sitting on a railroad track. One drunk says he
thinks he'll buy the track; the other wino responds that he doesn't
want to sell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the man who owns the railroad track is at the table,
dialogue is almost irrelevant,'' Jackson said. ``For two unemployed
blacks or whites or browns, what does it matter what they think
about anything if they can't make the train stop and can't buy the
track. President Clinton brings to this dialogue are those who own
the railroad, those who own the track.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged to do another tour in the fall, starting in
Newark, N.J., to highlight the partnership between the New Jersey
Nets and the New York Yankees to dedicate a percentage of the team
profits to investment in local ventures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make another round here to show people that
there are things that we can do together that are both morally
right and good business,'' Clinton said.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   With the launching of Hillary Rodham Clinton's undeclared Senate
campaign, taxpayers are no longer paying for her trips around New
York. Or so it is said. In fact, the cost of Mrs. Clinton's flights
on Air Force jets will be reimbursed only by the equivalent of
first-class air tickets for her and her campaign assistants. Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, meanwhile, has begun using private jets for his
campaign travel, and is also paying the owner the equivalent of
first-class fare. In effect, both campaigns are being subsidized _
by the taxpayers in Mrs. Clinton's case and by private jet owners
in Giuliani's. There ought to be a better way.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's travel arrangements are dictated by the same
rules that the Secret Service has long imposed on sitting
presidents and vice presidents running for election. The Secret
Service believes that security needs are best served if the
candidates fly on Air Force jets. Both the president and vice
president are deemed to need an entourage of aides because their
official duties do not go away when they are in campaign mode.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady is not an elected official, and she has no
official duties. Even so, she may have little choice but to listen
to the Secret Service. If she cannot fly commercial, it also seems
unreasonable to ask her to pay the full cost of chartering a plane.
Nevertheless, it seems fair to ask her to pay for a larger share of
her travel expenses, and to avoid abusing the privilege of an Air
Force jet by not using it unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   By availing himself of private jets, Giuliani is merely
following a long-established practice for candidates running for
president, the House and Senate. In fact, many corporations are
said to keep jets on hand simply to ferry candidates for federal
office around for no more than the price of a first-class fare.
This form of subsidy has long been one of the worst loopholes for
corporate patronage in Washington. It clearly invites abuses.
Common Cause and other groups have tried to challenge the practice,
but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   Although what they are doing is perfectly legal, Giuliani and
Mrs. Clinton ought to exercise restraint and common sense. Mrs.
Clinton should figure out a way to ease the burden on taxpayers,
and Giuliani and all other candidates for the Senate should
minimize private or corporate jet travel or forgo it altogether.
The loophole on corporate-subsidized jet travel ought to be
closed. &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   A Florida jury's strong ruling against the tobacco industry in
the first class-action lawsuit to reach a verdict may prove a
watershed in the history of tobacco legislation. The cigarette
makers earlier settled with all the states for $246 billion for
Medicaid costs arising from smoking-related diseases. But those
settlements did not deal with the potential claims of millions of
individual smokers, which may be far more expensive to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The current case was brought by nine plaintiffs representing the
class of Florida residents injured by certain smoking-related
illnesses. The ruling delivered in the first phase of this case,
which has lasted nearly a year, concludes that cigarette
manufacturers marketed an unreasonably dangerous product and
conspired to conceal the dangers and addictiveness of smoking. The
jury also ruled that smoking can cause 20 different diseases,
ranging from lung cancer to heart disease _ facts that the industry
has persistently denied.
</P>
<P>
   The jury also ruled that compensatory and punitive damages could
be awarded. The next phase of the trial will determine the damages
owed the nine plaintiffs. The ruling means that other Floridians in
the class, which may total hundreds of thousands of people, could
potentially go to court to get compensation for their illnesses
without re-litigating questions about the defendants' conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is likely to appeal the decision and seek to
decertify the class. But even if it were to prevail on appeal in
this case, it is unlikely to reverse a growing public perception
that the tobacco makers should be held accountable for products
that contribute to more than 400,000 deaths a year.

</P>

   Several officials who attended a two-hour closed-door conference
with Whipple, who doesn't comment on ongoing cases, said he also
left them with the impression that the board shouldn't feel
pressured to quickly hire Benjamin Demps Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge was very clear that he's not forcing them to make a
decision they don't want to make,'' said Charles McClain, a member
of the court-appointed Desegregation Monitoring Committee. ``Just
because Demps is the last one standing doesn't mean they have to
take him.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still uncertain what would happen if the board is unable to
reach agreement with Demps, a longtime state and federal
administrator who lives in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. July 19 to review the
board's progress and to consider the district's future leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to do what the court has asked us to do, which is
hire someone,'' said board vice president Patricia Kurtz. ``I'm not
going to predict what's going to happen in this. It has been fairly
unpredictable so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the hearing Thursday said Whipple also
emphasized that he is not eager to put the district into
receivership, which would give the court day-to-day control of
district operations.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members had said they felt pressured to quickly
select a superintendent or face a court takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Whipple's) not in any way trying to get them to select a
candidate based on their fear of receivership,'' McClain said.
``He's very adamant he doesn't want receivership.''
</P>
<P>
   Demps was one of four finalists identified by a Desegregation
Monitoring Committee-dominated screening committee. He has told
district officials he remains interested in the superintendent's
job. Demps did not return repeated phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Three other finalists withdrew, although one -- retired Air
Force Maj. Gen. Jay T. Edwards -- also said he still is interested.
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's conference, Whipple made no mention of seeking
additional candidates. And McClain said the screening committee has
no plans to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows? Maybe somebody could drop out of the sky,'' McClain
said. ``I suppose if we found somebody before next week we thought
could walk on water we could nominate them.''
</P>
<P>
   McClain also discounted any speculation that former Mayor
Emanuel Cleaver might be tapped for the role. ``He's not in the
equation,'' McClain said.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the plaintiff schoolchildren
in the district's desegregation lawsuit, applauded the extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the prudent thing to do is not to rush,'' Benson
said. ``We don't want the district to be forced to choose the last
man standing if he's not right.''
</P>
<P>
   Board members are struggling to find someone to serve as a
full-time replacement for former Superintendent Henry Williams, who
resigned under pressure last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Board members initially offered a contract to Edwards, now
general administrator of the Oklahoma Corporation Commission.
Edwards traveled to Kansas City last week but returned to Oklahoma
the next day after he and board members said they could not reach a
contract agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coalition that initially voted for him was a loose one,''
McClain said of the initial 7-2 school board vote to offer the job
to Edwards. ``It was solid in terms of numbers, but not in terms of
commitment. I think they were ready for him to go back to Oklahoma
by afternoon. I don't think it was related to the negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has since notified the district he would still consider
the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't close the door if he's interested,'' Kurtz said.
</P>
<P>
   The board next turned its attention to Pascal Forgione Jr., a
former U.S. commissioner for education statistics. Most board
members said they considered Forgione the most qualified candidate
and on Monday voted 5-1 to offer him a contract.
</P>
<P>
   But in a twist, Forgione withdrew his candidacy in the midst of
negotiations Tuesday, saying he felt slighted by what he termed the
district's ``lowball offer'' and negotiating tactics he termed
``used-car salesmanship.''
</P>
<P>
   District officials have disputed Forgione's version of events
and contend he simply got cold feet. They also contend Forgione
withdrew before monetary offers were exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, board members as late as Wednesday were discussing
sending a delegation to Washington to convince Forgione to change
his mind. In the end, board members voted 5-3 with one abstention
to pursue Demps should Forgione reject the approach.
</P>
<P>
   But Forgione on Thursday faxed a statement to The Kansas City
Star and the school board's secretary saying he should no longer be
considered for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was going to be that much sensitivity it probably
wasn't going to be a good marriage anyway,'' McClain said. He also
defended the board's handling of the Forgione negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were miscues, they were honest ones,'' McClain said.
</P>
<P>
   Several board members on Thursday expressed relief about the
extension.
</P>
<P>
   Kurtz said board members were worn out from long meetings and
late nights. She said she didn't expect the board to meet again on
the superintendent issue until next week, when the board might try
to schedule an interview with Demps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody wants a little break,'' Kurtz said.
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, are discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a positive outcome,'' said board member Fifi
Wiedeman. ``We need to have a lot more discussion about what needs
to happen rather than just filling the spot and repeating what
we've done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The district will continue its background investigation of
Demps, who was a top administrator for many years with the Federal
Aviation Administration. From 1991 to 1994 he was director of the
Oklahoma Department of Human Services. He now runs an aviation
consulting business in Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Lee Barnes Jr. on Thursday continued to promote
consideration of the fourth finalist, Grandview Superintendent John
Martin. Barnes said some board members never gave Martin a chance,
even though the selection committee had deemed all four finalists
qualified.
</P>
<P>
   Martin has said he is no longer interested in the position. He
could not be reached Thursday to determine whether he would
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to get the person they wanted and no one else was
going to do,'' Barnes said. ``They never had their mind set on
anyone but Forgione. It's just not fair.''

2 GOP RIVALS SURPRISE JOURNALISTS' CONFERENCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two Republican presidential candidates made
last-minute appearances Thursday at a convention of thousands of
Hispanic, African-American, Indian and Asian-American journalists
here, after reading a newspaper article highlighting their decision
to decline an invitation to speak and take questions at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who leads all candidates in
fund-raising, arrived at the Washington Trade and Convention Center
here Thursday morning, with 10 minutes notice to convention
organizers. Glad-handing startled journalists as he passed by the
booths of a large job fair for journalists, he breezed in and out
in less than 20 minutes, without participating in the organized
question-and-answer session two other presidential contenders had
agreed to.
</P>
<P>
   As the knot of reporters around him expanded and he was asked
about affirmative action, Bush responded, ``I'm against quotas and
I'm against special treatment and I'm for breaking down barriers as
we did in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few other shouted questions and quick answers, he was
off to meet with a group from a local youth club.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John W. McCain of Arizona, who is also a candidate for the
Republican nomination, came with a few hours' more notice and a
little more time. He said he decided to come Thursday morning after
reading an article in The Los Angeles Times that noted the absence
of Republicans at a convention which Vice President Al Gore is to
address on Friday morning, and which Gore's Democratic presidential
rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, addressed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's press spokesman, David Beckwith, said Bush also decided
to appear after reading the article. Asked why the candidate had
rejected invitations that had been proffered as early as May and as
recently as Tuesday, Beckwith said, ``We have literally 100 to 200
invitations a day,'' adding, ``He can't do it all.''
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session after his prepared remarks to
reporters at the second convention of the group called Unity:
Journalists of Color Inc., McCain said that he favored affirmative
action, but added, ``It's a phrase we have to define better.'' If,
he said, ``it means what it takes to get people on a level playing
field,'' he supported it.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Bradley, who had accepted Unity's invitation, told the
journalists that he would defend affirmative action programs, but
added, ``Race in America is a much broader issue than just
affirmative action. If we constrain it to just affirmative action,
we will miss the broader picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity, a coalition of the National Association of Black
Journalists, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, the
Native American Journalists Association and the Asian-American
Journalists Association, assembled 5,000 journalists at this
convention. About 3,500 are members of the four associations.
</P>
<P>
   The drop-in visit by Bush provoked reactions from bemusement to
indignation among those at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was deliberate of him to catch us off-guard,
because he didn't want to be bombarded with questions,'' said
Cheryl Martin, an anchor for Black Entertainment Television.

RESULTS OF STREETLIGHT PROJECT STARTING TO SHINE ON CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATT STEARNS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- After a shaky start and a few glitches, the
$110 million project to brighten Kansas City's streets at night is
starting to show some results.
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 new or improved streetlights gleam in the city.
Nearly 7,000 more are under construction. An additional 56,000 new
or improved lights are still to come.
</P>
<P>
   The project, approved by voters in November 1997, is intended to
make Kansas City one of the country's best-lit cities by the end of
2001. Proponents said the city's quality of life would go up and
crime would go down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's on time and on budget,'' said Kansas City
Councilman Ed Ford, chairman of the council oversight committee.
``As long as we get it done on time and on budget, I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Ford, ``We're getting terrific feedback from the
neighborhoods where we've had the lights installed.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods with high levels of street crime were the first to
get new lights, said James M. Lee, manager of the streetlight
project.
</P>
<P>
   For Beulah Thomas, who has lived in the 3900 block of Indiana
Avenue for 37 years, the new lights have had the desired effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the lights and the security it might help
provide,'' Thomas said. ``Before, we had maybe one or two lights
scattered here and there. The visibility is much better. You can
see onto front porches, see a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvin Brooks, City Council member and president of the Ad Hoc
Group Against Crime, said he hasn't seen statistical evidence of
reduced crime rates in those neighborhoods. But, he said,
perceptions have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said it makes them feel safer,'' Brooks said.
``And it has created a different environment for dope dealers, who
feel less comfortable under the lights. ... It is a deterrent.''
</P>
<P>
   It has made a difference in Blue Hills, said Linda Spence, who
represents that east Kansas City neighborhood on the Citizen
Streetlight Advisory Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting rid of crime is a multifaceted thing, but increased
light makes it easier on the neighbors and easier on the police,''
Spence said.
</P>
<P>
   Spence's only concern is that she has seen some lights in the
area out for days before they are replaced, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The November 1997 bond issue called for buying, upgrading and
expanding the city's streetlight system. Kansas City Power &AMP; Light
Co. owned the bulk of the system, and Missouri Public Service Co.
owned some streetlights in the city's outlying areas. The city
leased the system from those companies.
</P>
<P>
   So the city bought KCP&AMP;L's system for $21.5 million, and has
been expanding it ever since. The city recently paid $1.7 million
for the Missouri Public Service portion of the system.
</P>
<P>
   The project got off to a slow start when negotiations with KCP&AMP;L
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   But Ford said that wouldn't change the promised completion
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told people we'd get this done in four years,'' Ford said.
``We just didn't say four years from what. It really took six
months to get off the ground'' after voters passed the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton Adams, a former member of the Citizen Streetlight
Advisory Committee, was less optimistic about the delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magnitude of the project and its importance to the
community and its cost demand more efficient planning and
execution,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams suggested the city audit KCP&AMP;L and its contractors to make
sure the city is getting its money's worth.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said the city and the utility company are working well
together and are committed to finishing the project on time.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody realized how big the tree problem was,'' Lee said.
``The city was really behind on tree-trimming. Trees have a huge
impact on streetlights.''
</P>
<P>
   So 30 workers will trim about 60,000 trees as part of the
project. Some trees will be lost, but the Public Works Department
is trying to treat the trees gently.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working with the foresters in the tree service to make
sure we don't butcher the trees,'' said Mike Schoeppner, the
project's construction engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Finding -- and keeping -- qualified workers also hindered the
project. The booming local economy kept many electricians tied up
on lucrative private-sector construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   And because of natural disasters, many of the electricians on
the streetlight project kept getting better offers.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma suffered devastating tornadoes earlier this year.
Mississippi was hit hard by a hurricane last fall. Electricians
could make double time or overtime on projects in those states, Lee
said. Many took the opportunity, temporarily leaving Kansas City
shorthanded both times.
</P>
<P>
   Ten teams totaling about 100 workers are now on the project, Lee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents have complained about the project's
implementation. Guidelines say streetlight poles should be placed
150 feet apart. That doesn't account for driveways, front doors,
odd plot sizes and other vagaries of real life.
</P>
<P>
   Officials log about a dozen citizen calls daily. They have tried
to stick close to the guidelines while taking into account
residents' concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bend it as far as we can bend it,'' Lee said. ``99.5
percent of the time, we can make some accommodation to a citizen's
request by tweaking the pole's placement.''
</P>
<P>
   One tweaking took place in front of Ken Patrick's house in the
4700 block of Mercier Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just arrived and dug a hole,'' Patrick said. ``You walk
out the front door and there's a big, red, nasty pole. I said,
`You're not putting a pole there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Workers moved the pole. Patrick is happier -- although he still
doesn't much like the pole. He's not convinced his neighborhood
needs more light. Patrick said he'd prefer a steel pole to the
``aesthetically hideous'' wood one.
</P>
<P>
   Even Thomas, who said she appreciated the safety the new lights
provided, doesn't care for the wooden poles in her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not too sharp,'' Thomas said. ``Of course, the
neighborhood's not too sharp, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhoods with wood poles for existing lights get wood poles
for the new lights. Putting steel poles in all the neighborhoods
probably would have doubled the project's cost, Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Saving money is one goal of the project. The city already is
doing that in a couple of ways.
</P>
<P>
   Replacing all the existing lamps with more efficient ones should
save the city about $250,000 a year in operating costs, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, the city paid KCP&AMP;L 8 cents per kilowatt hour when the
utility owned the system. Now, the city pays the utility 4.7 cents
per kilowatt hour. Missouri Public Service offered the city a rate
of 3.7 cents. The savings is going into bond payments.

FAA PROBE SET FOR AVIATION FACILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a team of special Federal Aviation Administration
investigators prepare to do a major examination of B.F. Goodrich
Aerospace, the company says it has made significant improvements in
areas which should enable them to better follow government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Everett company, which says it is the nation's largest
independent maintenance facility for commercial aircraft, has long
been the target of increased FAA scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Post-Intelligencer reported that FAA inspectors
had recommended closing the sprawling facility because of a series
of violations of FAA regulations and ``dangerously incompetent
work'' on several jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   Another inspector told agency lawyers that BF Goodrich's
``violations raise significant concerns for safety and clearly
raise the potential of a catastrophic failure leading to a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidents noted by the FAA included cases where planes were
released for service with missing bolts, leaking fuel tanks and
other incomplete or improper repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA found that the company used under-trained mechanics
doing flight-critical repairs, unqualified inspectors signing off
on work improperly done, incorrect parts and tools.
</P>
<P>
   But FAA managers said they would rather allow the plant to
remain open under increased surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Michel, the FAA's principal maintenance inspector for the
facility, ran a one-man show there until last summer, when four
other inspectors were added to his team. That's still far less than
the dozen he requested.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Seattle-based safety inspectors say they are
eager to have the six-person team of national FAA experts check out
the operation, which includes repairs, heavy maintenance,
modifications and inspections on jets owned by dozens of passenger
carriers such as United, Northwest, Continental and Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The special team is to start its work next week.
</P>
<P>
   BF Goodrich managers said in February that Michel and his
colleagues overstated the severity of the violations and that ``all
problems cited have been addressed and resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the FAA said 13 violations or administrative
actions have been filed against the company so far this year.
Inspectors say several other cases are being examined.
</P>
<P>
   Some inspectors continue to express concern over safety
deficiencies at the plant and FAA lawyers have again been asked to
consider sanctions beyond the $1,100 maximum allowed per violation.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, officials at the Everett plant _ the largest of BF
Goodrich's 25 repair facilities worldwide _ insist the FAA has
given the plant a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA may not agree with that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the FAA would use the term `clean bill of
health,''' said FAA spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn. ``Goodrich has
implemented a series of improvements, but the FAA would say it's a
little too soon to measure the effectiveness of those programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Post-Intelligencer report in February, BF Goodrich
brought in a team of outside experts to examine operations at the
Everett plant. Six weeks ago, the leader of that team, William
White, former deputy director of the FAA's Flight Standards
Service, briefed the FAA on some of his findings.
</P>
<P>
   White noted only one area of major concern or deficiency, which
dealt with repair manuals, said BF Goodrich spokeswoman Sherry
Bergstrom. But two FAA safety specialists who attended that
briefing said White confirmed shortcomings identified by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, BF Goodrich said it has instituted an ``action plan''
to improve the ``safety and quality'' of work at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The effort includes hiring two additional senior managers: A
training director and a director of regulatory compliance, quality
assurance and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The company also pledged to improve its inspection manuals,
Bergstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   And in what Bergstrom called an unrelated move, the company
Thursday announced the resignation of a top official at the Everett
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Avery, vice president of the Maintenance, Repair and
Overhaul Group in Everett, resigned effective Aug. 31 after 32
years with the company. In a letter released to the media, Avery
said the move was ``to make a major change in my work and personal
life.''

CHAIN OWNER WEIGHS DEAL FOR A PAPER IN NEW YORK
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, N.Y., Israel, Ill., Britain, Conn., Ala.)   (jw) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Canadian newspaper publisher Conrad Black _ whose company,
Hollinger International Inc., publishes The Jerusalem Post, The
Chicago Sun-Times, The Daily Telegraph in London and 61 of Canada's
105 daily newspapers _ has turned his eye to New York City, and is
examining the weekly newspaper The New York Observer.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's editor, Peter Kaplan, said that Black and
Observer owner Arthur Carter had discussions about a deal recently,
but he would not predict the outcome. Senior staff members at The
Observer said Carter had told them that the talks were serious and
involved a sale or a partnership arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Healy, who is vice president for corporate development of
Hollinger International Inc. and handles investor relations in New
York for Black, said that the two owners had discussed the
possibility of some collaboration or a sale within the last six
months. But Healy said that no specific transaction was in the
works.
</P>
<P>
   Carter has told senior staff members at The Observer that if
Black were to become involved with the newspaper, it might alter
its publishing schedule from weekly to five days a week, making it
a new entry into the intensely competitive daily newspaper field in
New York City. Carter did not return several phone calls seeking
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Black has searched for a presence in New York City in the past.
In 1992, he tried to buy The New York Daily News, which was then
bankrupt. After six months of negotiations, he backed off because
he was unable to reach an agreement with the 12 unions represented
at the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In circulation, Hollinger International Inc., is the world's
third-largest newspaper and magazine publisher, behind Rupert
Murdoch's News Corp. and the Gannett Co. Hollinger owns about 200
newspapers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Broadwater, a managing director of Veronis, Suhler &AMP;
Associates Inc., the investment bank that handled The Daily News
negotiations, said, ``At one time, Hollinger had an interest in
acquiring a newspaper in New York, but it is not clear that any of
them are buyable right now. Maybe The New York Observer is
buyable.''
</P>
<P>
   Several business associates who know Carter well said they
believed he would rather enter a partnership agreement than sell.
That would make for an odd coupling, since The Observer, which
claims a circulation of 50,000, mostly in Manhattan, has a
generally liberal sensibility and Black's views are strongly
conservative. Carter, a former investment banker, started The
Observer in 1987. He owned The Nation, the liberal weekly magazine,
before selling it in 1995 and still owns The Litchfield County
Times, a weekly in Litchfield, Conn., and The East Hampton, a
weekly on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Stern, a friend of Carter's and chief executive of the
Hartz Group, which owns The Village Voice, said: ``If you tell me
he will sell out to Conrad Black, well, every man may have his
price. But I don't think Arthur will sell it completely.''
</P>
<P>
   Because The Observer is privately held, it does not reveal its
finances. But two years ago, Carter said in an interview that he
lost about $2 million a year on the paper. Carter's own worth has
been estimated at more than $100 million.

<P>
   Establishing a foothold in the world of New York newspapers
appears to fall within Black's corporate strategy, which in recent
years has been to sell his small and medium-size American
newspapers and focus his capital on newspapers in urban areas
around the world. This year, Hollinger sold 45 American newspapers
with circulations below 100,000 in a deal for $475 million to
Community Newspaper Holdings Inc., based in Birmingham, Ala., in
order to focus on the company's larger, more visible newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what is going on here? The company has basically decided
that they have other uses for their capital _ a larger, more urban
focus,'' Broadwater said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of this strategy, Black bought The Financial Post in
Toronto a year ago, and then folded it into a new national
newspaper he created, The National Post. The resulting daily
newspaper, introduced nationally in Canada in November, offers
business news and gossip in an easy-to-read format that some
readers compare to that of USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   But starting another daily newspaper in New York would require a
leap of faith and a vast investment. Such a venture would have to
overcome an array of obstacles, from finding access to printing
presses to dealing with distributors and unions.
</P>
<P>
   Black committed about $100 million to the start of The National
Post.

GEPHARDT TO WITHDRAW APPOINTMENT OF MUSLIM TO TERRORISM PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to rewrite with stronger lede, response from Nihad Awad in
8th graf, other changes throughout.)  (mk) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After protests from Jewish organizations, the House minority
leader, Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., decided late Thursday to withdraw his
appointment of an American Muslim leader to a congressional
counterterrorism commission, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public
Affairs Council in Los Angeles, had been named by Gephardt in June
to serve on the National Commission on Terrorism, a 10-member group
charged with reviewing national policy on preventing and punishing
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his appointment, Al-Marayati was denounced by Jewish
organizations that accused him of condoning terrorism against
Israel. But other political and religious leaders, many of them
Jewish, who have worked with Al-Marayati had begun speaking in his
defense, praising him as a responsible moderate, and many American
Muslims had contacted Gephardt to signal their support.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's aide, Susan Harvey, said Al-Marayati had been told
late Thursday that the appointment was in jeopardy, but not because
of political pressure. Instead, Al-Marayati was told that the
process of gaining a security clearance would take longer than the
six-month life of the counterterrorism commission itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Al-Marayati said Thursday: ``I am not withdrawing. I think
that if there is a political will, there is a way to expedite these
security clearances and get down to the business of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati, who is 38, says he has lived in the United States
since his family fled political persecution in Iraq when he was 4
years old. As executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs
Council, Al-Marayati has visited the White House several times for
Muslim holidays and twice to witness the signing of Middle East
peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   He has served on the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission for
more than a year after being nominated by Mayor Richard Riordan.
The leader of the commission calls Al-Marayati ``a very fair, very
moderate individual.'' Al-Marayati's wife, Dr. Laila Al-Marayati,
was appointed by the White House to the U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Informed Thursday night of Gephardt's decision to withdraw
Marayati's appointment, Nihad Awad, executive director of the
Council on American-Islamic Relations, said, ``I think it's a
cowardly decision, because the absence of a credible Muslim voice
will further institutionalize discrimination against Muslims and
Arabs around the issue of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine other members of the commission include L. Paul Bremer,
former U.S. ambassador at large for counterterrorism; R. James
Woolsey Jr., former director of central intelligence, and Gen.
Wayne Downing, commander in chief for special operations and
director of the investigation of the 1996 bombing that killed 19
American airmen in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Six commission members were chosen by majority leaders in the
House and Senate, and four were chosen by the minority leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt's choice of Al-Marayati immediately came under
attack by groups like the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations, which represents 55 groups, the
Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to statements made by Marayati, his organization,
his magazine and his co-workers that were critical of Israel and
appeared to blame the Israeli government for provoking Palestinian
anger and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Among the quotes cited by the Jewish groups was this from a
March 1997 press release from the Muslim Public Affairs Council:
``Because the Palestinian people have no avenues to redress their
grievances, some of them have been pushed beyond the margins of
society and have adopted violent reactions to express their despair
and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Gephardt, the Jewish groups accused Al-Marayati of
failing to denounce the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah, of
supporting Saddam Hussein and of failing to support the peace
agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Seven members of Congress sent a letter to FBI Director Louis
Freeh last week requesting his ``personal involvement'' in
conducting the background check on Al-Marayati.
</P>
<P>
   And Morton Klein, national president of the Zionist Organization
of America, said: ``Salam Al-Marayati has justified Arab terrorism
against Israel. He's justified future terrorism against America.
He's compared America's behavior to Saddam Hussein's behavior. He's
compared Islamic terrorists to the American soldiers of the
American Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Klein's group has also called for Laila Al-Marayati to be
removed from her post on the U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But Al-Marayati has many supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Salam, I think very well, for five or seven years,''
said Joe Hicks, executive director of the Human Relations
Commission in Los Angeles. ``He's a very fair, very moderate
individual who in my perception is respected in a number of
communities, including the Jewish community here in Los Angeles. He
is not given to wild, extremist views about the Middle East or
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Jewish leaders in Los Angeles who have publicly
supported Al-Marayati are Rabbi Alfred Wolf of the American Jewish
Committee's Skirball Institute on American Values and Gene
Lichtenstein, editor of The Jewish Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Al-Marayati said he had a clear record of
opposing terrorism, ``not for the sake of political expediency, but
because of an Islamic stand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hamas and Hezbollah commit acts of terrorism, we condemn
those acts as events contrary to the principles of Islam,'' he
said. ``When those groups build hospitals and develop social
service agencies for the disenfranchised, that's something that we
do not condemn.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayti said that this was the reason he had never issued a
blanket condemnation of Hamas and Hezbollah. And he scoffed at the
idea that he had ever supported Hussein, noting that his family had
been forced to leave Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   John Esposito, a professor of religion and international affairs
at Georgetown University and director of the Center for
Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown, said the whole affair
was ``anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bashing, to put it bluntly.''
</P>
<P>
   Esposito said that asking American Muslims to pass a litmus test
by issuing blanket denunciations of Hamas or Hezbollah is like
asking South Africans to denounce the African National Congress.
All are groups that have multiple wings, some political opposition,
some terrorist, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati would have contributed a crucial perspective to the
commission on terrorism, Esposito said, by representing moderate
American Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking mainstream,'' he said. ``If these people are
not acceptable, who is?''

 &HT;    Millwood pitches like an All-Star in 5-2 win
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A day after being chosen for his first All-Star game,
Kevin Millwood sought a little reinforcement for NL manager Bruce
Bochy and win No. 11 while he was at it.
</P>
<P>
   Why not throw in a complete game and a 5-2 win over the Marlins
to end this four-game series with the Braves holding a 3-1 edge?
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to come out here and blow up and have an awful
game,'' said Millwood, who won his fifth start in a row Thursday
night to move to 11-4 and drop his ERA to 3.20. ``I wanted to end
the first half on a positive note and go in on a roll. That's what
I did.''
</P>
<P>
   To do it, Millwood, who'd had four losses all year, had to get
past the Marlins' Brian Meadows, who'd had four losses in his
previous five starts. Meadows held his own against everybody but
Chipper Jones and Ryan Klesko, who each doubled, homered and drove
in two runs off him to give Millwood the offense he needed.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood allowed seven hits in the first five innings and none
in the last four. He finished with 10 strikeouts and only one walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had complete command all night,'' Jones said. ``He had a
good curveball, stayed ahead of hitters. What can you say? He's
been our horse so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones won't be joining Millwood in Boston but should have Bochy
scratching his head after the third baseman hit his sixth home run
in his last seven games and third in the last three games. This one
came on a Meadows change-up in the sixth inning, the last of a
series of change-ups. Jones had homered on fastballs from Alex
Fernandez and Ryan Dempster the previous two nights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good thinking on his part,'' Jones said. ``But to throw
me that many? Eventually I'll get it in my thick head to sit on
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones doubled in Bret Boone in the first inning for his eighth
RBI in the last eight games and extended his hitting streak for
that stretch as well. He gave the Braves a 1-0 lead in the first
inning, a lead they wouldn't lose thanks to Millwood.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood gave up a pair of runs off the bat of Marlins No. 3
hitter Bruce Aven, the second of which cut the Braves' lead to 3-2
on a double in the fifth. Millwood gave up an infield hit to the
next batter and nothing else, retiring the last 13 batters of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, Kevin would tire a little bit in the middle of a
ballgame when it got hot,'' said Atlanta manager Bobby Cox, who had
no problem staying with Millwood despite 116 pitches after eight
innings. ``Not this year. It seems like he gets stronger all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves ended this three-week jaunt through the National
League East with 11 wins and 6 losses and moved to five games ahead
of the second-place Mets.

CHAMBER BLASTS PROPOSED FEDERAL RULES ON CONTRACTS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)   (jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before the Clinton administration issued new rules that
would bar federal contracts to chronic corporate lawbreakers, the
U.S. Chamber of Commerce was attacking the rules, calling them an
arbitrary ``blacklist'' and a sop to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules, to be announced Friday, recommend that
federal procurement officers award no contracts to companies guilty
of repeated and substantial violations of laws on discrimination,
labor, tax, environmental or antitrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government should not enter into contracts with
contractors who do not comply with the law,'' said the new
regulations, which expand on existing rules saying the government
should award contracts only to responsible companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Chamber of Commerce officials suggested that the new rules
would be used mainly to help labor unions and would create havoc
and uncertainty for the thousands of companies vying for more than
$170 billion in federal contracts each year. The chamber had
closely monitored development of the rules.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, listed hundreds of federal
contractors that had been found guilty of violating labor law. The
report did not include the hundreds of companies guilty of
environmental, tax and other violations.
</P>
<P>
   Chamber officials predicted that the new rules would be used
principally to punish companies found to have violated labor laws,
like those prohibiting companies from firing workers in
unionization drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration's blacklisting regulation is not only bad
public policy, it's probably illegal,'' said Thomas Donohue,
chamber's president. ``The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will do
whatever is necessary to block this politically motivated policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Vice President Al Gore announced at an AFL-CIO
meeting that the administration would issue tougher procurement
regulations, but the administration delayed issuing the new rules
when congressional Republicans threatened retaliation. At an
AFL-CIO meeting in February, labor leaders pressed Gore to move
forward with the promised rules.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to the presidential campaign, Randel Johnson, chamber
vice president for labor policy, said, ``We think Vice President
Gore has promoted issuing these regulations as a payoff to the
unions.''
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials insisted they were issuing the new
rule for reasons of good government, not for political motives.
``This rule says if you expect to do business with the government
then you had better follow the law,'' said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman
for the White House Budget Office. ``There is no reason for the
American government to do business with companies that don't pay
their taxes, don't respect our environmental laws and don't follow
health and safety regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamber officials insisted that the rules were unclear,
asserting that companies did not know how many violations _ 2, 20
or 200 _ might bar them from government contracts. These officials
voiced fears that procurement officers might use the rules'
ambiguities to pick on companies that have antagonized labor.
</P>
<P>
   AFL-CIO officials welcomed the new regulations, saying they were
long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These strike us as good, sensible reforms that reinforce the
idea that taxpayer dollars shouldn't be subsidizing chronic
lawbreakers,'' said Lynn Rhinehart, the AFL-CIO's associate general
counsel. ``This is not blacklisting. This is about responsible
contracting.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules, which face a 120-day comment period, also state
that the federal government will no longer reimburse contractors
for the amounts they spend in fighting unionization drives. The
rules also say the government will not reimburse legal expenses in
cases in which a federal contractor is found to have violated a
law.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For years, labor leaders have pointed to the unionization
struggle at Avondale Shipyard in Louisiana as evidence that tougher
rules for government contracts were needed. The shipyard, which
relies heavily on Navy contracts, had refused to recognize a union
even though the yard's 5,000 workers had narrowly voted to support
unionization six years ago. A federal administrative judge has
found the shipyard guilty of more than 70 labor law violations,
including firing 28 workers because they supported the union.
</P>
<P>
   But Avondale won a major victory on Wednesday when a federal
appeals court overturned the union's election victory, accepting
Avondale's arguments that the National Labor Relations Board did
not do enough to check the voters' identification to prevent
election fraud.

FAA PROBE SET FOR AVIATION FACILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a team of special Federal Aviation Administration
investigators prepare to do a major examination of B.F. Goodrich
Aerospace, the company says it has made significant improvements in
areas which should enable them to better follow government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Everett company, which says it is the nation's largest
independent maintenance facility for commercial aircraft, has long
been the target of increased FAA scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Post-Intelligencer reported that FAA inspectors
had recommended closing the sprawling facility because of a series
of violations of FAA regulations and ``dangerously incompetent
work'' on several jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   Another inspector told agency lawyers that BF Goodrich's
``violations raise significant concerns for safety and clearly
raise the potential of a catastrophic failure leading to a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidents noted by the FAA included cases where planes were
released for service with missing bolts, leaking fuel tanks and
other incomplete or improper repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA found that the company used under-trained mechanics
doing flight-critical repairs, unqualified inspectors signing off
on work improperly done, incorrect parts and tools.
</P>
<P>
   But FAA managers said they would rather allow the plant to
remain open under increased surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Michel, the FAA's principal maintenance inspector for the
facility, ran a one-man show there until last summer, when four
other inspectors were added to his team. That's still far less than
the dozen he requested.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Seattle-based safety inspectors say they are
eager to have the six-person team of national FAA experts check out
the operation, which includes repairs, heavy maintenance,
modifications and inspections on jets owned by dozens of passenger
carriers such as United, Northwest, Continental and Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The special team is to start its work next week.
</P>
<P>
   BF Goodrich managers said in February that Michel and his
colleagues overstated the severity of the violations and that ``all
problems cited have been addressed and resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the FAA said 13 violations or administrative
actions have been filed against the company so far this year.
Inspectors say several other cases are being examined.
</P>
<P>
   Some inspectors continue to express concern over safety
deficiencies at the plant and FAA lawyers have again been asked to
consider sanctions beyond the $1,100 maximum allowed per violation.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, officials at the Everett plant _ the largest of BF
Goodrich's 25 repair facilities worldwide _ insist the FAA has
given the plant a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA may not agree with that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the FAA would use the term `clean bill of
health,''' said FAA spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn. ``Goodrich has
implemented a series of improvements, but the FAA would say it's a
little too soon to measure the effectiveness of those programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Post-Intelligencer report in February, BF Goodrich
brought in a team of outside experts to examine operations at the
Everett plant. Six weeks ago, the leader of that team, William
White, former deputy director of the FAA's Flight Standards
Service, briefed the FAA on some of his findings.
</P>
<P>
   White noted only one area of major concern or deficiency, which
dealt with repair manuals, said BF Goodrich spokeswoman Sherry
Bergstrom. But two FAA safety specialists who attended that
briefing said White confirmed shortcomings identified by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, BF Goodrich said it has instituted an ``action plan''
to improve the ``safety and quality'' of work at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The effort includes hiring two additional senior managers: A
training director and a director of regulatory compliance, quality
assurance and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The company also pledged to improve its inspection manuals,
Bergstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   And in what Bergstrom called an unrelated move, the company
Thursday announced the resignation of a top official at the Everett
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Avery, vice president of the Maintenance, Repair and
Overhaul Group in Everett, resigned effective Aug. 31 after 32
years with the company. In a letter released to the media, Avery
said the move was ``to make a major change in my work and personal
life.''

CERNER SAYS SECOND QUARTER WON'T MEET EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Cerner Corp. said Thursday that it expected
a shortfall in second-quarter earnings and revenue because of the
year 2000 computer bug and federal health-care cutbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The North Kansas City, Mo.-based medical software company, which
in June proposed a $237 million expansion, said it expected to
report that it broke even or earned up to 2 cents a share -- before
an extraordinary item of $1.4 million related to the early payoff
of debt -- during the quarter that ended July 3.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' consensus estimates had pegged Cerner's second-quarter
earnings at 10 cents a share. Cerner shares closed Thursday at 18,
down 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``We indicated early in the year that there would be
uncertainties inherent in 1999 created by the impact of Y2K and the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997,'' said Neal L. Patterson, Cerner's
chairman, president and chief executive officer. ``Both are
contributing to a deferral of purchasing decisions. We believe that
this higher level of uncertainty will continue through 1999 and
into the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerner said it expected to report second-quarter revenue in the
range of $81 million to $85 million. Bookings are expected to range
from $66 million to $70 million. Final results are expected to be
announced July 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are clearly disappointed with the results for the
quarter, we did see a halt to the sequential decline in base
business bookings we had experienced over the last three
quarters,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Cerner's HNA Millennium software is designed to loop together
the information systems of hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories,
doctors' offices and other health-related entities, thereby cutting
paperwork and streamlining services.
</P>
<P>
   Daren Marhula, an analyst who follows Cerner for U.S. Bancorp
Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis, said he wasn't surprised by
Thursday's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has been saying for some time that there's a
Y2K-related slowdown in the market, and most research analysts have
been coming to the same conclusion,'' Marhula said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Marhula said it was encouraging that Cerner
expected its second-quarter bookings to exceed those of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said in late May that some potential Cerner customers
had delayed purchases until they finished fixing Y2K problems. He
also said then that the federal Balanced Budget Act of 1997 had cut
$115 billion of payments that were aimed toward hospitals, doctors
and home health agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said Thursday that Cerner had a ``broad client base
and industry-leading technology. We remain committed to our
strategy of delivering the only contemporary enterprise system
architecture to health care across all sites of care. We believe
that this strategy provides us with a superior competitive position
in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cerner in April reported a first-quarter earnings decline of 25
percent from the previous year.

   Cerner's expansion of its campus would be built in five phases
over 15 years, from 2000 to 2015, and would have space for an
additional 3,600 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company is asking for about $42.09 million in property tax
abatements under Missouri's Chapter 353 redevelopment law.
Officials with Cerner said it needed the tax breaks to compensate
for the added costs of building on the site's erosion-prone soil.

 &HT;    First lady 'polished' early in N.Y. tour
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ She runs late, she runs long, and if she
doesn't totally run away from personal questions, she seems
determined to dance around them.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody gets a listen on the issues. Nobody gets much in the
way of answers yet.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, as happened here Thursday, Hillary Rodham Clinton
even admits to having learned from a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may recall I had some thoughts about health care in the
past,'' Clinton told a packed room at Bassett Healthcare, peals of
laughter greeting her gently self-mocking reference to her
far-reaching reform efforts back in 1993. ``But I now come from the
school of smaller steps.''
</P>
<P>
   If it both does and doesn't sound like a typical political
campaign, make no mistake about it: It's Hillary Clinton's version
of one. And on the second day of her much-ballyhooed ``Listening
Tour'' across central New York State, something else became clear.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, it's sinking in.
</P>
<P>
   Said Joseph Sellers, a Bassett physician and avowed Republican
with a barely contained sigh, ``I was very much impressed with Mrs.
Clinton. She was polished.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments earlier, Sellers had snapped to attention parts of the
packed meeting room by rising in the audience and informing Clinton
that much of largely rural central New York's health care woes
could be traced to the region's poor economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He even invoked President Clinton's memorable 1992 campaign
phrase, ``It's the economy, stupid,'' causing Mrs. Clinton to
exclaim, ``That's a very good point.'' That got much of the
seemingly snoozing press contingent suddenly vying for interviews
with Sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Day Two of Clinton's four-day visit here contained none of the
drama or glamour of Wednesday's endorsement by Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan among the hay bales and weathered buildings of his
900-acre farm.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton conducted two more ``listening sessions,'' each
marked by the would-be candidate's attempt to demonstrate her grasp
of issues affecting the health care community and the elderly, and
her almost endless willingness to let people talk to her.
</P>
<P>
   Both sessions started on what has been called ``Bill Clinton
time,'' getting under way nearly an hour late. And despite what
members of her exploratory committee staff suggested ahead of time,
neither ended after only an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she almost appeared to be begging for more time with her
audience Thursday afternoon at Utica's East Side Senior Center,
telling a crowd that had just spent some 45 minutes bending her ear
about the need to protect Social Security, reduce crime and lower
prescription drug costs, ``I'd like to learn from you. What ELSE
can we do to better economic conditions here?''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the senior center audience responded enthusiastically
when Clinton reminded them of ``my husband's'' announced intention
to direct budget surplus dollars to assuring the future solvency of
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Such unwavering loyalty was not totally in evidence earlier in
the day, however, when Clinton took pains to tell her Bassett
audience when she didn't think the president's health care policies
went far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something my husband and others in Washington, D.C., think we
need is to empower patients more through the Patient's Bill of
Rights,'' Clinton said. ``But even that is a diversion. I'm for it.
I hope it passes. But at the end of the day, we'll have more people
arguing over what should be done for patients.''
</P>
<P>
   More evidence emerged later Thursday that the all-but-announced
candidate is as willing to publicly separate herself from her
husband on certain issues as she is to invoke his successes in the
appropriate settings.
</P>
<P>
   Her campaign released a letter she wrote last week to Mandell
Ganchrow, president of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congress of
America, stating that she viewed Jerusalem as ``the eternal and
indivisible capital of Israel'' and would advocate to move the U.S.
embassy there from Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   That would seem to put her at odds with her husband, who
recently blocked the embassy shift and maintains that Israel and
the PLO should together determine Jerusalem's fate.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton's statement on Jerusalem may play well with the
large Jewish community in New York and could help reverse the
negative attitude many Jews have toward the first lady for a
statement she made several years ago in support of a Palestinian
state.
</P>
<P>
   Now if only she could approach her husband's campaign mastery.
Asked Thursday about reports President Clinton had advised her on
communicating with voters, she seemed to confirm that. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I decide to run I will certainly do that, and I will
practice in front of my husband,'' she said in an interview session
with reporters from New York newspapers, a transcript of which was
made available. ``If he gives me a passing grade, then I will go
out and tell the world.''

CORPORATION ACQUIRES MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS ON SEVERAL HOTELS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Buckhead America Corp. of Atlanta announced
Thursday that it had acquired management contracts on 12
limited-service hotels in Missouri and Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Buckhead will take over management of eight
Super 8 hotels and four Country Hearth Inns that had been run by
Quality Lodging LLC, a Kansas City hotel developer.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase price of the management contracts wasn't disclosed,
but Buckhead said it would pay a combination of cash and Buckhead
stock valued at a minimum $7 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Buckhead's stock closed down 1/4 at 5 5/8 Thursday on the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Wallace, spokesman for Buckhead, said the company was
taking over contracts on hotels that were part of a previous
agreement between Buckhead and Quality Lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Under that contract, Quality Lodging had agreed to develop 12
Country Hearth Inns during a five-year period, with options for an
additional 22 properties.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Country Hearth Inns have opened and are included in
the transaction announced Thursday. Buckhead said it would manage
additional Country Hearth Inns developed by Quality Lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Executives with Quality Lodging were not available for comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Gary Sirna and Stephen Danner,
principals with Quality Lodging, said they would be able to
accelerate the development of new Country Hearth Inns by
transferring management responsibilities to Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said the Missouri hotels in the transaction were in
Chesterfield, Chillicothe, Columbia, three in Kansas City, Mount
Vernon, North Kansas City, Platte City, Riverside and Smithville.
Wallace said the Kansas hotel was in Gardner.

NASD FINES PRUDENTIAL $20 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH B. TREASTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Receiving yet another sanction for misleading customers for more
than a decade, Prudential Insurance Co. of America was fined $20
million Thursday by the National Association of Securities Dealers,
the highest fine ever imposed by the association.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Goldsmith, the head of enforcement for NASD, said
investigators found that Prudential, one of the largest insurers in
the country, had committed ``serious violations of securities law
and our rules'' in the sale of variable life insurance policies,
which are a combination of life insurance and investments similar
to mutual funds. Officials of the association said they thought the
highest previous fine had been $5.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Prudential had already paid more than $70 million in fines to
state insurance regulators for widespread deception of customers.
It also paid $1 million to federal authorities for allowing the
destruction of sales documents, and it has set aside $2.6 billion
for restitution to policy-holders nationwide. No other insurer has
faced such heavy sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of Prudential's hallmark product, life insurance, has
slumped under the repeated pillorying of its reputation. Earlier,
Prudential paid $1.5 billion in a settlement with federal and state
regulators over improper sales of limited partnerships through its
subsidiary, Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Robert DeFillippo, a spokesman for Prudential, said he knew of
no further pending investigations of the company as it revamps with
expectations of making its first public offering of stock, probably
in about 18 months. ``We see this as one of the final steps in a
very long process to put the problems of the past behind us,''
DeFillippo said.
</P>
<P>
   DeFillippo said it had never been company policy to mislead
customers, but he acknowledged that safeguards against such abuses
``were not adequate.'' He said steps had been taken to prevent
customers from being cheated.
</P>
<P>
   In concluding a two-year investigation of Prudential, NASD
issued a stronger and more detailed criticism of the company and
its management than had state insurance regulators and it reported
uncovering violations that other investigators had not addressed.
</P>
<P>
   In its settlement with the association, Prudential did not admit
or deny wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   While insurance regulators said that senior managers at
Prudential knew about widespread deceptive sales practices among
its agents at least by 1992, the association said that the
Prudential board was given a report on the improprieties a full
decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   DeFillippo acknowledged that the board had received the report
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The association said that both Prudential agents and their
supervisors failed to obtain licenses required for the sale of
securities, failed to submit sales literature to the association
for review and either failed to take disciplinary actions against
sales representatives or filed incomplete or inaccurate reports.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the NASD investigators said, Prudential agents singled
out older people, many of them retired, who ``did not know what
they were purchasing.'' Sometimes, the investigators said,
Prudential agents falsely told customers they were buying savings
and retirement plans rather than insurance.
</P>
<P>
   NASD reiterated the finding of insurance regulators that the
heart of the problem for Prudential was that its agents told
customers they could exchange old policies for new ones with better
benefits at little or no extra cost. In some cases, the association
said, customers were told their premiums would eventually vanish,
leaving them with no further expenses. In fact, costs rose. Many
policies lapsed when higher premiums were not paid and customers
lost their coverage and everything they had invested in their
policies.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the association's report said, the Prudential
subsidiary that was responsible for variable life insurance,
``operated in an environment where sales production was emphasized
over other considerations.'' State regulators had suggested that
such an ethos permeated Prudential.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they saw the association's action as a setback for
Prudential in its attempt to break free of its troubled past.
``This really is impeding their progress in trying to put this
behind them,'' said Michael Albanese, a senior analyst at A.M. Best
&AMP; Co., the rating agency.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Finnegan, a senior analyst at Moody's Investors Service
Inc., another rating agency, said, ``The bad news is that the bad
news continues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In our opinion,'' he said, ``we believe they've addressed what
this fine relates to.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting Prudential's plans to go public, Finnegan said: ``This is
not the kind of news or posture that reflects well with investors.
I think what they really need to point to is the fact that this is
history; it ended in 1995. And since then new management has much
tighter reins around the manner in which they sell and deliver
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFillippo said that of the 10.7 million policies sold between
1983 and 1995, holders of 1.2 million policies had filed for claims
in the settlement of a class-action suit that Prudential estimates
could cost up to $2.6 billion. He said that 2.85 million of the
policies had combined insurance and securities. The association
said it found securities violations in connection with the sale of
more than 200,000 of the combination policies.
</P>
<P>
   DeFillippo said the number cited by NASD had been provided by
Prudential after those policy-holders requested compensation in the
class-action settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While many policy-holders reported no problems with their
policies, some opposing lawyers and former Prudential employees say
the number of claims may not reflect the full scope of
improprieties at the company. The critics say the procedures for
compensation are complex, the rewards are relatively slight and at
least some customers may well have decided not to bother.

SINGAPORE INVESTORS WAIT FOR STOCK FREEZE IN MALAYSIA TO MELT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ Historic rivalries and a politically charged
stalemate between this city's stock exchange and its counterpart in
neighboring Malaysia are teaching investors here a new twist in the
time-honored investment strategy of buy and hold.
</P>
<P>
   Until Malaysia imposed capital controls in September, the Stock
Exchange of Singapore handled a lively over-the-counter trade in
Malaysian issues. Often, more Malaysian shares changed hands than
Singaporean shares did.
</P>
<P>
   But in September, Malaysia outlawed trade of its companies'
shares off-shore as part of efforts to keep money inside the
country. That left 172,000 investors in Singapore's so-called
Central Limit Order Book, or CLOB, as the market is known, caught
with nearly $4 billion in shares they could not sell _
``Clobbered'' as headline writers quickly punned.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange and the Stock
Exchange of Singapore have clashed about how to return the shares
to the Malaysian marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here reported Thursday that the Singapore exchange
had sent a plan to the Kuala Lumpur exchange that proposes
staggering the release of the shares in Kuala Lumpur to reduce
chances of a shock wave of selling on Malaysia's newly buoyant
market. Neither exchange would comment on the reports.
</P>
<P>
   But such a plan is unlikely to solve the problem of the CLOB
shares, part of a larger dispute that has already touched air,
water and railway links between the two nations, which were both
created during the British Empire's breakup in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``CLOB is a four-letter word,'' says Azman Mokhtar, head of
Malaysian research at Salomon Smith Barney. ``Malaysian authorities
hold the view that it was an illegal exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, CLOB shares have in theory risen in value
since being frozen. Malaysia's benchmark stock index has more than
tripled since controls were imposed, and Malaysian authorities fear
what might happen if so many investors suddenly had the chance to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has proposed that Singapore shareholders swap their
CLOB shares, which represent 104 Malaysian companies, for nonvoting
shares in two government-linked companies, Telekom Malaysia and
United Engineers (Malaysia) Bhd. The shareholders object because it
would require them to accept the equivalent of a 42 percent
discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair,'' said Chia Yeng Boo, a 52-year-old Singaporean
who has owned his Malaysian shares longer than he can remember, but
now considers them ``a total write-off.''
</P>
<P>
   The CLOB dispute is about people like Chia, small-time local
investors who bought their first Malaysian shares a decade or more
ago. But it also has implications for Malaysian efforts to woo back
foreign investors unsettled by the government's financial meddling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's watching what's going on here and how it's going to
be resolved,'' said David Lum, who advises American clients as
director of banking and strategy at Prudential-Bache Securities in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore and Malaysia struck out together from under British
rule as the Federation of Malaysia, but differences between the
Malay-led government in Kuala Lumpur and Singapore's predominantly
ethnic Chinese politicians led to a split in 1965. The two
countries' stock exchanges did not split until 1973; even then,
they kept listing each other's stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, a more assertive Kuala Lumpur exchange ordered all
Malaysian companies to shed their Singapore listings. The move was
seen as potentially devastating to Singapore's financial industry:
though Singapore was the dominant market, most of its stocks were
Malaysian.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore's exchange blunted the impact by setting up CLOB, to
let investors in Singapore trade foreign shares the way investors
in New York can trade some foreign stocks as American depository
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia never approved of CLOB. ``We've objected since 1990,''
Mohamed Azam Ali, a Kuala Lumpur exchange spokesman, said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Malaysia decided it could no longer tolerate CLOB last year,
when the government imposed economic changes that banned outflows
of its currency. That meant closing the back door CLOB had
provided. ``You can't have capital controls if you have this
loophole,'' Azman said.
</P>
<P>
   The move further strained relations between the two nations.
Bickering over a Malaysian railway immigration post in Singapore
had already escalated into disputes about air and sea lanes. Last
year, when Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of Malaysia visited
Johor Bahru, a city across a causeway from Singapore, residents
shouted ``cut! cut! cut!'' referring to the water Malaysia pipes to
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors snubbed an offer in May to sell CLOB stocks to a
friend of Malaysia's finance minister at what the Singapore
exchange called half the market value.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the only firm indication of what Malaysia will accept
comes from Mahathir, who has accused CLOB investors of contributing
to the Malaysian market's fall last year. ``I don't think it is
morally right,'' he was quoted as saying in May, ``for them to gain
benefit from something they didn't help achieve.''
