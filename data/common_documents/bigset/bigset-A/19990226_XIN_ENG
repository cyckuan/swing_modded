<HEADLINE> U.S. New Orders for Factory Goods Rise 3.9 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Department
said Thursday that new orders to factories for big-ticket products
rose 3.9 percent in January, the most in 14 months.
</P>
<P>
The January increase in demand for durable goods followed a
healthy 3.4 percent rise in December, the Department said.
</P>
<P>
The January surge, mainly pushed by strong demand for autos and
aircraft, caught economists by surprise. They had been projecting
that new orders declined 0.1 percent in January following what
they believed was an unsustainable jump in demand in December.
</P>
<P>
The Department said the January increase of 7.7 billion U.S.
dollars pushed total orders up to 203.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The advance was led by a 15.4 percent jump in orders for
transportation equipment, a 7.1 billion dollars increase led by
increases in aircraft and autos.
</P>
<P>
New orders for electronic equipment rose 1.9 billion dollars, a
5.7 percent advance that followed an even stronger 6.4 percent
December gain.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the surge in demand in transportation and
electronics, orders for industrial machinery fell by 3.1 percent
last month while orders for primary metals, such as steel, were
down 3.3 percent, following a 3.4 percent December drop.
</P>
<P>
If excluding the volatile defense category, durable-goods
orders were 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
While new orders have surged for the past two months, those
gain followed a sustained period of weakness. For all of 1998, new
orders to factories posted their smallest advance since an
outright decline in 1991, the year when the last recession ended.

<HEADLINE> Japan Pledges 100 Million Dollars in Aid to Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Foreign Minister
Nasahiko Komura on Thursday pledged to provide 100 million U.S.
dollars in aid to Cambodia and resume an unspecified amount of yen
loans.
</P>
<P>
Komura made the pledge during a two-hour meeting with visiting
Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, a Japanese Foreign Ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
The official said Japan will convey the 100 million dollar
pledge on Friday at the second-day session of the two-day meeting
in Tokyo of donor countries and international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese aid will be part of a one-year package worth 450
million dollars expected to be adopted at the third World Bank-
sponsored Consultative Group (CG) meeting to meet Cambodia's
request for 1.3 billion dollars over the next three years from 16
participating donor nations and seven international financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
Along with this, Tokyo will also express its intention to
resume yen-denominated loans for the first time in about 30 years,
but will not spell out any specific amount, the official said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Komura also urged the Cambodian government
to step up reforms, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen underscored his commitment to pursue a "full range of
reforms," and reiterated his new initiative of holding a
monitoring session with donors every three months to assess
progress.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Rules out General Amnesty for Apartheid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela made it clear Thursday that the government would
not grant a general amnesty for Apartheid wrongdoers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a parliament debate on the report of the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC), Mandela said that those who
committed gross human rights abuses should be prosecuted for the
sake of "accountability".
</P>
<P>
"Let us reiterate that we are not contemplating a general
amnesty under any guise," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, a time limit should be set for such prosecution as
long as judicial processes would hamper the government's efforts
to solve current problems, said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
A realistic time frame needed to be set, which would allow
prosecutors to gather enough evidence to secure successful
prosecution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The matter would be handled by the National Director of
Prosecutions, who has to both "establish accountability and the
rule of law" and "advance reconciliation and the long-term
interests of the country."
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the government should convene a national summit on
 reconciliation to implement the TRC's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
The TRC is a special court set up in 1995 in terms of an
agreement by all parties during the talks which led to the
country's first democratic election.
</P>
<P>
It listens to those who alleged a gross violation of their
human rights at the hands of either the previous government or the
liberators, and receives amnesty applications from those who had
committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
In a report released last October, the commission found many
political leaders, past and present, guilty of gross human
violations. Among the named were former state president P. W.
Botha, Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi and
ex-wife of Mandela, Winnie Madikizela-Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Offers to Help NATO's Kosovo Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian government on
Thursday endorsed a framework accord expressing support for NATO's
possible peacekeeping activities in Kosovo and allowing NATO
troops to pass through the country.
</P>
<P>
NATO sent a draft agreement to Bulgaria on February 18
requesting approval for NATO troops to enter Kosovo via Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The framework accord approved by the Bulgarian government
Thursday still needs further consultation with NATO, according to
the Bulgarian news agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, NATO needs Bulgarian parliament's approval if
its troops want to go through or stay on Bulgarian territory.
</P>
<P>
The accord also requests NATO to pay for its motor vehicle
repairs done in Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mikhailova and Defense
Minister Georgi Ananiev have been authorized by the government to
negotiate with NATO on the proposed document and sigh a formal
framework accord.
</P>
<P>
Mikhailova told a news conference that the proposed document
demonstrated the Bulgarian government's "political will" to assist
NATO in its peacekeeping activities in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Bulgaria and NATO is a kind of
partnership on a voluntary basis, rather than NATO exerting
pressure on Bulgaria, the foreign minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, another senior military official announced
that Bulgaria's air force will be used to help resolve crises and
facilitate NATO's peacekeeping efforts.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's capital, Sofia, is only some 100 kilometers away
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in October last year on Bulgaria's
relations with NATO over the Kosovo crisis, the Bulgarian
National Assembly, or parliament, required the government to
consult with NATO and sign a concrete relationship accord if
necessary.

<HEADLINE> UN Agency Warns of AIDS Epidemic Among Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Joint United Nations
Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) launched Thursday the World AIDS
Campaign with Children and Young People to increase their
awareness about the killing disease.
</P>
<P>
"All over the world, children and young people continue to be
in the line of fire of this virus and we have to ask ourselves why,
" Piot said in a statement released ahead of the campaign's
official launch in Brasilia, Brazil, later on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 33.4 million people alive with HIV infection or AIDS as
of end 1998, around a third are young people aged 15-24, according
to the UNAIDS statistics.
</P>
<P>
"Working with people under 25 is perhaps the best hope we have
today of bringing the epidemic under control," said Peter Piot,
the executive director of UNAIDS.
</P>
<P>
Every day, 7,000 young people worldwide contract the HIV virus,
the UNAIDS estimates. Overall, young people account for at least
50 percent of all those who become infected after infancy, and in
some countries the rate exceeds 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, entitled "Listen, Learn, Live!," aims to
stimulate dialogue about AIDS between adults and children and
among children themselves. It will enlist the help of the music
television channel, MTV, as well as the Scout movement and
teachers.

<HEADLINE> Leu-Against-Dollar Exchange Rate to Get Steady in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Romanian Prime Minister Radu
Vasile stressed on Thursday that measures will soon be applied to
ensure a relatively stable exchange rate between Leu and U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The leu-dollar rate of exchange has varied this week between 12,
432 lei/dollar on Monday and 12,816 lei/dollar on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Romanian National Bank Governor Mugur Isarescu had predicted
the day before that in the period ahead the leu-dollar exchange
rate would get steady, explaining that the sharp depreciation of
the leu in these days was generated by tensions created in
connection with the resignation early this week of Vlad Soare,
president of state-owned bank Bancorex, together with other board
members.
</P>
<P>
The bank is the country's third largest bank. It specializes in
foreign trade financing and holds 25 percent of the Romanian
banking market. The resignation caused strong repercussions among
the depositors who these days ran on the bank.
</P>
<P>
"We thought it more appropriate for the adjustment of the leu's
exchange rate to be made at this time and not later", stressed
Isarescu.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Obasanjo Promises to Address Niger-Delta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The presidential flag bearer of
the People's Democratic Party (PDP), General Olusegun Obasanjo,
has promised to address the Niger-Delta problems if elected during
his campaign for the Saturday presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The PDP presidential candidate acknowledged n Asaba,
southeastern Nigeria, Wednesday that past efforts had failed to
address the problems in Niger-Delta area where Nigeria produces
crude oil for export.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the problems in the area are those of injustice,
lack of development and the neglect of the area from where the
resources of the country were sourced.
</P>
<P>
Having identified the problems, Obasanjo said that "solution is
quite clear to me."
</P>
<P>
If it is a problem of injustice, he said, "we shall ensure
justice. If it is the problem of a lack of development, then we
have to develop the Niger Delta."
</P>
<P>
"Your cannot afford to ignore the chicken that lays the golden
egg," said the strongest contender for February 27 presidential
election in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing to be done is to have a master plan for a
comprehensive development of the Niger Delta," Obasanjo noted,
adding that the plan would take care of the energy needs of the
people, roads, health, schools and potable water supply.
</P>
<P>
From Asaba to Warri in Delta State on Wednesday afternoon,
Obasanjo reiterated his promise to address the Niger-Delta
problems, saying that Delta State has a unique role to play as a
center of the important centers where the most significant
resources is produced.
</P>
<P>
He promised to set up committees of all stake-holders in
government "so that by the first six months or the first 180 days
in office, you will feel the changes that are taking place."
</P>
<P>
As his PDP won the majority vote in the local, state and
National assembly elections, Obasanjo looks well on his way back
to power 20 years after he handed over the power to an elected
government in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old presidential candidate, who belongs to the
Yoruba, the second largest tribe living in southwestern Nigeria,
enjoys the backing of many in the largest Hausa-speaking people in
northern Nigeria, which dominated the Nigerian government in the
past decades.
</P>
<P>
During the last leg of his campaigning, the PDP presidential
candidate has focused his attention to the Niger-Delta area where
the Igbo people, the third largest tribe in the country, have
grieved over the unfair distribution of Nigeria's oil revenue.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: What's Next for Bangladesh Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The opposition-sponsored
three-day destructive strike in Bangladesh ended more or less
peacefully Thursday, coinciding with the three-day elections in
136 municipalities across the country.
</P>
<P>
The strike, called by the major opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) and its allies, was designed to put
pressure on the government to accept their four-point demand
including the resignation of the chief election commissioner and
distribution of voters' identity cards before the elections.
</P>
<P>
Now the strike was over and so were the elections. Observers
here were surprised to see the opposition alliance had been by and
large "mild" during the polls this time.
</P>
<P>
Their four-demand was apparently ignored by the government,
which not only held the elections as scheduled but also put aside
a proposal of the chief election commissioner to conduct a
dialogue with the opposition on the issue of elections.
</P>
<P>
Without participation of the opposition parties, including the
BNP, the Jatiya Party, the Jamaat-e-Islami, the Islami Oikyo Jote
(Islamic Solidarity Front) and others, the ruling Bangladesh Awami
League (BAL) was sure to win an overwhelming victory in the
election of chairmen and commissioners in 136 out of the country's
182 municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The opposition, claiming that people had rejected the elections
by observing the shutdown and there was a very low turnout, asked
the government to cancel the elections and demanded for fresh
municipal elections.
</P>
<P>
Having made so much effort in organizing the elections, the
ruling party was unlikely to give in to the opposition's demands,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
Some observers here were of the view that the BNP-led
opposition alliance might have lost points in boycotting the
municipal elections while the BAL seemed to have gained
politically by inducting their men and women in the elected
municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The government, after the municipal elections, might try to
tempt the opposition to join the next city corporation elections
in the four metropolitan cities - Dhaka, Chittagong, Khulna and
Rajshahi, likely to be held in April, they said.
</P>
<P>
The opposition earlier threatened to launch a one-point
movement to dislodge the government if their demand was not
satisfied. Now with the municipal elections over and their demand
unheeded, the opposition would have to think of ways by which to
launch agitation to remove the government.
</P>
<P>
As the BAL did in the past when in opposition, it was very
likely that the opposition alliance now might think of resigning
from the parliament en masse and taking to the streets to launch
their one-point oust-government movement, observers said.

<HEADLINE> France Sends Troop Reinforcement to Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- France is sending 1,000 more
troops to Macedonia to reinforce the NATO force stationed in
Macedonia which borders the Yugoslav province of Kosovo, said
French Defense Ministry on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The French warship ``La Foudre'' arrived on Wednesday at the
Macedonian port of Salonique with armoured vehicles and 400
soldiers, while 600 more French soldiers is being sent in by
planes.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Ministry officials said that in the wake of the
Rambouillet conference on Kosovo which ended on Tuesday, France
still follows the logic that either NATO will launch an air strike
against Serb forces in case of a continuation of blockade, or NATO
will deploy peace-keeping force in Kosovo once an agreement is
reached.
</P>
<P>
The NATO force already stationed in Macedonia is expected to
increase to 4,000 soldiers from the present 1,800, after France,
Britain and Italy have sent in reinforcement.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urged to Avoid Irregularities in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter Thursday called on Nigeria's two presidential candidates to
make a public statement to eschew election irregularities in
February 27 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Carter who arrived here Thursday sent two separate letters to
presidential candidate Olusegun Obasanjo of the People's
Democratic Party (PDP) and the joint presidential candidate for
the alliance of the All People's Party (APP) and the Alliance for
Democracy (AD), Chief Olu Falae.
</P>
<P>
In the message distributing to reporters, Carter said that the
"high level of election irregularities seen by observers in the
National Assembly election" held on February 20 should not be
allowed to take place in Saturday's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
"If repeated this Saturday, international acceptance of the
legitimacy of the elections and the entire transition process is
threatened, not to mention the voting rights of the Nigerian
people," the former U.S. president noted.
</P>
<P>
Carter, who is leading a delegation of election monitors from
his center and the National Democratic Institute for Saturday's
election, blamed party operatives as "the main culprits" of the
irregularities experkenced during the February 20 National
Assembly election.
</P>
<P>
International observers largely endorsed last week's election
although there were some reports of pockets of irregularities, the
most prominent being in Rivers State and Bayelsa State.
</P>
<P>
February 27 presidential election is the last in the series of
elections under the current transition program in the west African
country before the hand-over of power to a civilian administration
on May 29 this year.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Destroy Surplus Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to contain arms
proliferation in the country, the South African government said it
will destroy all surplus small arms in the future rather than
selling them as done previously.
</P>
<P>
The South African police service had already begun destroying
its surplus small arms, melting down 20 tons of arms in October
1997, the National Conventional Arms Control Committee said after
a meeting Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The proliferation of small arms was having a devastating effect
on the socio-economic development and reconstruction of civil
societies in southern Africa, the committee said.
</P>
<P>
The police had destroyed a total of 4,504 confiscated firearms,
 including pistols and rifles, and 11 tons of confiscated
ammunition, worth more than two million Rand (333,333 U.S.
Dollars), the committee said.

<HEADLINE> Britain Welcomes EU Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain said here on Thursday
that it supports the next stage of economic reform for the
development of the single market in European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Representing the Britain at the EU's Internal Market Council of
ministers in Brussels, British Minister for Trade and
Competitiveness in Europe Lord Simon said he welcomes the work the
German presidency has put into the preparation of the practical
conclusions on EU's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
"I also look forward to further work following this council to
build on these conclusions to produce a more detailed program
including clear and measurable targets, which imposes the same
sort of discipline on member states which was so successful in the
Single Market Action Plan. This work is also important for the
further success of the euro," he said.
</P>
<P>
During a debate on the German Presidency's conclusions on
economic reform, Lord Simon said the conclusions provided a good,
forward looking basis for further improvement of the single
market.
</P>
<P>
He said the conclusions highlight the key areas for further
progress, such as simplification and better regulation, reduction
in state aids, further liberalization of utilities markets, more
effective rules on public procurement, improvements in mutual
recognition, and integration of service markets including
financial services.
</P>
<P>
"I know there has been debate over some of these conclusions. I
regard that as a vindication of the process set in hand by the
Cardiff Council. We have begun a genuine debate about the pace and
direction of reform. Such a debate is more necessary than ever in
the context of the single currency," Lord Simon said.
</P>
<P>
The economic reform process was set in train under the British
Presidency of the EU during the first half of 1998. Last June at
the European Council of heads of Government in Cardiff, the
British port city, the Britain called on the 15 EU member states
and the European Commission, the EU executive, to produce short
reports on the functioning of national product, capital and
service markets, which are designed to encourage a debate among
member states about the need to ensure that EU markets are
sufficiently flexible once the single currency is in operation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Jobless Claims Falls Slightly Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Department said
Thursday that the number of U.S. filing new claims for
unemployment benefits fell by 5,000 last week to 293,000.
</P>
<P>
The four-week moving average for claims, which smoothes out
some of the week-to-week volatility, was down as well, dropping
2,000 to 292,500. That was the lowest level in a decade and a
strong signal that labor markets remain tight.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Federal Reserve has been looking for a slowing in the
U.S. economy after three years of rapid expansion. It is worried
that tight labor markets, reflected by an unemployment rate which
was at a 28-year-low of 4.3 percent in January, will cause wage
pressures to intensify and set off a bout of higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, delivering his semiannual report
to Congress Tuesday, predicted that the economy, which grew at an
annual rate of 3.9 percent in 1998, will slow this year to between
2.5 percent and 3 percent growth in the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that if this slowdown does not occur, the Fed will be
ready to move quickly to raise interest rates to make it happen.

<HEADLINE> Norway Cautions Against Declaration of Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Norwegian Prime
Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik maintained on Thursday the possible
declaration of a Palestinian state on May 4 "may not be fruitful."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, Bondevik expressed belief that the possible move
would rather "strengthen the enemies of peace" just two weeks
before Israel's general elections due on May 17.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian prime minister said he discussed with Mubarak the
stalled Middle East peace process and focused on the possible
declaration of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he has also tackled the issue with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and advised him to take all the
factors into consideration and that the Palestinian leader has
promised to do so.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel have been
stalled due to Israel's failure to honor signed agreements and the
Israeli early general elections.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Arafat announced that he might declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 regardless of the results of the peace
talks and that he has been rallying international support for his
plan.
</P>
<P>
Israel, however, has voiced opposition to the possible move and
has threatened to take tough actions should it materialize,
including annexation of parts of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
To move ahead with the peace process, Norway will pursue
contacts with the concerned parties, including Egypt, Bondevik
said.
</P>
<P>
Norway hosted the secret talks between the Palestinians and
Israel, which led to the signing of the Oslo Accord in 1993. The
accord stipulates that a five-year period of interim Palestinian
self-rule on the West Bank and Gaza Strip expires on May 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik arrived here Wednesday for a two-day visit. Egyptian
Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri held talks with him in the same
day on bilateral relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik told reporters after the meeting that the talks
covered means of enhancing economic cooperation and increasing
trade volume, which he said stands at an annual 60 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have agreed to carry out a program aimed at
increasing trade exchange and fostering bilateral investment in
addition to stepping up cooperation in culture, agriculture and
communications, he added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Calls for Early Re-Establishment of Ad Hoc </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has called for the
re-establishment of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an
Arms Race in Outer Space within the Conference on Disarmament
(CD).
</P>
<P>
"The militarization of outer space and establishment of TMD
(Theater Missile Defences) systems has global as well as regional
implications for both nuclear disarmament and further
proliferation of nuclear weapons," said Pakistani Ambassador Munir
Akram at the CD's plenary meeting here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Noting the concerns over peace and stability, Akram said that
his country believed it is timely for the CD to re-establish the
ad hoc committee.
</P>
<P>
"The militarization of outer space which is being pursued by
certain quarters will be inevitably perceived as designed to
achieve global domination and thus provoke new strategic
antagonisms," he pointed out. "The absence of global rivalry among
the major powers may be replaced by new, dangerous and
destablizing confrontations."
</P>
<P>
The emplacement of TMD systems, he went on, with or without
integrating them with systems deployed in space, could provide one
side with a quantum military advantage over potential adversaries.
</P>
<P>
"Nuclear stability would be seriously eroded," the Pakistani
ambassador warned. "Nuclear disarmament efforts would come to a
standstill."
</P>
<P>
"The legitimization of missile defence systems by one or more
powers will have serious consequences for regional security,
including in South Asia which is now nuclearized," Akram said.
</P>
<P>
In a statement at the same meeting, Austrian Ambassador Harald
Kreid said that his country would support the re-establishment of
the Ad Hoc Committee on the Prevention of an Arms Race in Outer
Space as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Mogadishu Factions Meet to Narrow Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Islamic courts of the
Somali capital Thursday held a face-to-face meeting for the first
time with the main faction leaders of Mogadishu including Ali
Mahdi Mohamed and Hussein Mohamed Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, the largest of its kind, sponsored by the Islamic
court of Ifka Halan was meant to narrow the political gap between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the meeting, Aidid said it is their collective
responsibility to avoid giving their enemy the pretext of
attacking Somalia with missiles as happened in Sudan, a word which
meant that the Islamic courts should not go beyond the limits.
</P>
<P>
He said it is now time to work together in reopening the air
and sea ports in the capital to help create normal life for
Mogadishu and the country as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the administration which he co-chairs with Mahdi,
Aidid said the judicial system of the administration is based on
Islam and the implementation of the Islamic norms.
</P>
<P>
Mahdi congratulated the Islamic courts on their commendable
achievements in the restoration of peace in Mogadishu, saying that
he will be the first to give support to the implementation of the
Islamic Sharia law.
</P>
<P>
"It is only through unity that we can establish a sustainable
and durable administration both at regional and national levels,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his call to the opposition leaders to do tangible
work for the people or join the new administration by making
corrections on what has gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
The Moslem scholars who also spoke at the meeting have all
emphasized the need for reconciliation between the opposition
leaders and those of the administration.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hassan Adde speaking for the Islamic courts has offered
to mediate between the administration and the opposition leaders,
and agree in principle with the establishment of an administration
and the need for reopening the air and sea ports.
</P>
<P>
Nearly one thousand heavily-armed militiamen and about 50
battle wagons from both the Islamic courts and the administration
have tightened the security in the area.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Privatize Coffee Firm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Coffee and Tea
Authority of Ethiopia announced Thursday that preparations are
underway to privatize the state-owned Coffee Development
Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
General Manager of the authority, Tsegaye Berhane told the
press that the enterprise to be privatized administers large
coffee plantations in Bebeka, Limu and Tepi regions.
</P>
<P>
Berhane said the privatization of the state-owned enterprise
would encourage investors to widely engage in the coffee
development in the Horn of African country.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is one of major coffee producers and exporters in
Africa and its coffee export earns 60 percent of its foreign
exchange income every year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the participation of the private sector in coffee
development is "very low," said the general manager.
</P>
<P>
He called upon entrepreneurs to engage in the coffee
development sector, saying that there are vast areas of farmland
suitable for coffee production in Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar in Need of Foreign Doctors: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar President
Salmin Amour Thursday underscored the need for bringing in foreign
doctors on a rotational basis to the isles to treat as many
patients as possible, especially for the cases which cannot be
treated locally.
</P>
<P>
Amour said this in Zanzibar when inaugurating the
rehabilitation of the Mnazi Mmoja General Hospital which cost more
than 1.5 million U.S. Dollars and is funded by the government of
the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Amour said the move of introducing doctors to carry out
operations in Zanzibar instead of sending patients abroad will
help reduce costs, particularly for the poor who cannot afford the
travelling costs.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, the isles government leader
 commended the Abu Dhabi government for funding the rehabilitation
of the isles' largest medical institution which was in bad shape.
</P>
<P>
He said the support came at an appropriate time and will help
strengthen relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Dhabi government also donated hospital X-ray machines
and equipment for trans-urethral resection of prostate.
</P>
<P>
The Mnazi Mmoja Hospital faces a shortage of doctors and
specialists, a situation which sometimes forced patients to seek
treatment abroad to save their lives.
</P>
<P>
Amour called on Zanzibar doctors and the specialists working
abroad in particular to come back and team up with local doctors
in assisting local residents.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he urged local medical personnel to be
compassionate with their patients.
</P>
<P>
The function was attended by the isles Chief Minister, Mohammed
Bilal, and a special delegation from the Abu Dhabi government.

<HEADLINE> Zhu: Sino-Russian Economic Ties Face Wide Vistas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here Thursday that Sino-Russian economic and trade cooperation
face bright future and vast vistas so long as both sides bring
into full play their respective advantages.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who arrived here Wednesday on a four-day official visit,
said during a meeting with Russian Federal Council Speaker Yegor
Stroyev that the economies of China and Russia are highly
complementary but the huge potentials of economic and trade
cooperation have not been fully tapped.
</P>
<P>
He said Russian President Boris Yeltsin, during his meeting
with Zhu earlier Thursday, gave heartening remarks on the
development of bilateral economic and trade cooperation, which
makes the Chinese side even more confident of the bright future of
such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese customs statistics, Sino-Russian trade
last year, at 5.48 billion U.S. dollars, shrank 10.5 percent from
1997.
</P>
<P>
Stroyev, the head of the Russian upper house of parliament,
praised China for successfully standing the test of the Asian
financial crisis, adding that Russia hopes to draw useful lessons
from studying China's experience in reforms and construction.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that there would be more cooperation at
the regional level as such cooperation is of major importance to
development of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu, who is here on his first visit to Russia since assuming
premiership last March, said the bilateral strategic partnership
of cooperation based on equality and mutual trust, which was
initiated by Chinese President Jiang Zemin and President Yeltsin,
enjoys heartfelt support from peoples of both countries.
</P>
<P>
This partnership has been developing extremely smoothly with
the personal input of the two presidents, Zhu noted.

KAMPALA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba will pay a two-day official visit to Uganda this week for
talks with Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni on the Congo (K)

He added that a mayor can be removed if he is found to commit

Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda Radio Broadcasting Commissioner Jack Turyamwijuka said

Sebaggala was arrested in June of 1998 in the U.S. for eight

His case has been suspended for more than half a year before
the final verdict. He is said to be widely supported by the local
people in the city although his opponents accused him of lacking
required education for the post.
</P>
<P>
He defeated other candidates in a fierce race in April of 1998
and thus became the first directly elected mayor of the capital
city.

<P>
AMMAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States signed a grant
agreement with Jordan Thursday to provide 100,000 metric tonnes of
wheat, worth 13 million U.S. dollars, to the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Jordanian Planning Minister Nabeel
Ammari and U.S. Ambassador to Amman William Burns, Jordanian
news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
The wheat is part of the U.S. aid to Jordan in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the total aid to the kingdom in the year will reach
269 million dollars in various economic, financial and military
aid programs.
</P>
<P>
Burns also said the U.S. aid to Jordan has reached 2.4 billion
dollars during the past eight years, including 700 million dollars
of debt waiver, 524 million dollars of grants and soft debts, 368
million dollars of military assistance and 125 million dollars of
military equipments.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Calls for Revival of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa Thursday called for renewed efforts to revive
co-operative unions since they are nucleus in the national
development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a mammoth crowd at Kiomboi township in the northern
region of Shinyanga, Mkapa pledged the government's full support
for reviving the unions, most of which have either collapsed or on
the verge of crumbling.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa noted that unfaithful union officials have been
contributing to the death of co-operative movement through
embezzlement or outright theft.
</P>
<P>
"It is very unfortunate that co-operatives officials are very
difficult to correct their mistakes," the president said at the
end of his five-day tour of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the unfaithfulness of unions officials has forced
members to lose confidence in the entities and opt to sell their
produce to private buyers, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The president underscored the importance of the unions in
improving the social status of the majority of poor Tanzanians,
saying the co-operative movement was a major contribution to
Tanzania's independence and it should not be allowed to end in
failure.
</P>
<P>
The president called on people to continue to implement
development projects. He said development needs resources from
both the people and the government.
</P>
<P>
Co-operatives are formed by persons who have voluntarily joined
together for the purpose of achieving a common need through the
formation of a democratically controlled organization, and persons
who make equitable capital contributions and accept the risks and
the benefits from their undertakings.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Peace Activists' Protest Blocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police Thursday
blocked peace activists from holding a protest vigil at the grave
of Baruch Goldstein, who killed 29 Muslim worshipers at the
Patriarchs' Tomb in the West Bank city of Hebron in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Thursday is the fifth anniversary of the mosque massacre,
during which Goldstein, a Jewish settler, was also bludgeoned to
death by the survivors.
</P>
<P>
Goldstein was buried on the outskirts of the Jewish settlement
of Kiryat Arba, which is very close to Hebron. And Jewish
extremists have turned his grave into a shrine.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of members of Israeli Peace Now Movement tried to hold a
protest vigil at Goldstein's grave Thursday in a bid to call for
the removal of the memorial there.
</P>
<P>
But they were blocked by the police several miles away from the
grave and the police commander said the Hebron region has been
declared a closed military area.
</P>
<P>
Clashes broke out between the two sides. Israel Radio said
that seven protesters were detained, but they were released later.
</P>
<P>
Last June, Israel's Knesset (parliament) passed a law ordering
the removal of the memorial at Goldstein's grave.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel's High Court, in response to a petition by
Goldstein's parents, issued a temporary injunction at the end of
last year postponing dismantling of the memorial.

LUSAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Vice-President Christon
Tembo said Thursday the government will work for the early
delivery of agricultural inputs in the 1999-2000 farming season to
prepare farmers adequately.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said this when he received 10,000 tons of relief maize
from Jochen Krebs, the head of the European Union delegation for
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will put in place adequate preparations
for farmers so that inputs are available in time to improve their
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue dishing out aid to people forever as the
resources are not there but we would like the people to start
looking after themselves," he said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that in the years to come people will grow their own
food and feed themselves instead of looking to the government for
food relief.
</P>
<P>
Tembo admitted that the past few years have been difficult in
terms of drought which was brought about by the El Nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
El Nino had an impact on Zambia in which four provinces had
more than normal rainfall while others did not have adequate
rainfalls.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said the country had a 643,000-ton deficit
in cereal in 44 districts where 1.2 million people suffered
hunger.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Role in Capture of Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Thursday denied its
alleged role in the capture of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A government official, requesting anonymity, dismissed the
allegations as "baseless" and attempts to divert attention from
the role played by Israel and other parties in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Turkey on February 16 in the Kenyan capital
of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and
the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad had a hand in the
operation. But the Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet reported that
Egypt also played a part in Ocalan's capture.
</P>
<P>
The official termed Cumhuriyet's allegations as "an unacceptable
plot" to mar Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's mediation efforts
to solve the Syrian-Turkish disputes.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's efforts were intended to contain the crisis by
averting a possible military conflict between the two neighbors,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long accused Syria of harboring the PKK which has
been fighting for autonomy in southeastern Turkey since 1984. Last
year, it massed troops along the Syrian border, threatening to
uproot PKK bases in Syria by force.
</P>
<P>
Mediated by Mubarak and other parties concerned, Turkey and
Syria signed an agreement, under which Syria pledged to shut down
PKK camps and stop supporting the Kurdish group.

Zhu, holding the fourth regular meeting between the premiers of
the two countries together with his Russian counterpart, Yevgeny

ties remain to be the weak link in bilateral relations and one of
the major goals of his visit is to further boost cooperation in
specific areas in this field.

<P>
Primakov, for his part, said the two sides reached consensus on
all issues discussed in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The two sides signed 11 agreements at the end of the
Zhu-Primakov meeting on cooperation in economic and trade, science
and technology, transportation and other fields.
</P>
<P>

cooperation, which will open bright prospects for bilateral
collaboration, especially in economy and trade.

Before his meeting with Primakov, the Chinese premier also met
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Yegor Stroyev, speaker of the
Russian Federation Council, or upper house of parliament, early
Thursday.

Primakov said Yeltsin was very satisfied with his fruitful
talks with Zhu, noting that he himself and the Chinese premier
also reached agreement on cooperation in many important fields.

understanding and cooperation will surely be strengthened,

replace aging models.
</P>
<P>
BAGHDAD -- The U.N. approved 92 contracts allowing Iraq to

<P>
The Arabic daily Al-Alam Al-Youm quoted a U.N. statement
released in Baghdad as saying Thursday that U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan's appeal on December 29 to review the status of the
spare parts contracts led to the approval.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Thursday
condemned the continued air raids on Iraqi targets by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Ben Hali, the league's assistant secretary general, told
reporters that the Arab League "condemns and denounces the
continued military operations" in Iraq by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Ben Hali made the remarks after a meeting with Iraqi Permanent
Delegate to the Arab League Sultan al Shawy, who briefed the
league official the latest developments in his country.
</P>
<P>
The league official called for the lifting of the no-fly zones
in the north and south of Iraq, arguing that they were "imposed by
a unilateral decision" by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The two Western powers, supported by France, imposed the no-fly
zones after the 1991 Gulf War, which drove Iraqi troops out of
Kuwait, to allegedly protect the Kurdish ethnic minorities in the
north and the Shiite Muslims in the south.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad announced recently that it would no longer recognize
the no-fly zones and fired at U.S. and British warplanes patroling
the zones. The U.S. and British air forces attacked Iraqi targets,
killing and wounding Iraqi troops and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi delegate condemned the U.S. air raids on Iraq as
"aggressive acts," which he maintained should be denounced by the
United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Al Shawy also called on Arab countries to condemn "this
American aggression."
</P>
<P>
"All Arab countries should adopt a stand against it,
considering that it is away from international legitimacy and is a
continued aggression on an Arab country," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi diplomat said that Iraq has requested the issue of
the no-fly zones be tabled on the agenda of the Arab League
Council, which is due to meet on March 17-18.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Arbitration Committee Reaffirms Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the first local
elections in the country, an arbitration committee of Iran on
Thursday once again rejected the decision by the conservative
election supervisory board to disqualify 12 moderate candidates.
</P>
<P>
The five-member committee announced in a statement that the
candidates can run in the elections, the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after President Mohammad Khatami Thursday
urged the committee to announce its final view regarding the
disputed move by the supervisory board in order to break the
deadlock between the board and the Interior Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Ali Mowahedi Savoji, head of the board in charge of the
qualification of candidates, on Tuesday night threatened to
announce the election process in Tehran null and void if the
Interior Ministry does not remove the 12 candidates from the list.
</P>
<P>
The five-member board last week informed the pro-moderate
Interior Ministry, which is responsible for holding elections,
that it had rejected 12 prominent candidates of the moderate
factions including former Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri, who
was sacked by the conservative Majlis (parliament) in June.
</P>
<P>
However, two members of the board soon denied the decision and
the Interior Ministry also rejected it and refused to halt the
election campaigns of the disqualified candidates.
</P>
<P>
The arbitration committee, appointed jointly by President
Mohammad Khatami and Majlis Speaker Nateq Nouri to solve the
dispute, on Sunday night also turned down the decision.
</P>
<P>
However, Savoji argued that the arbitration committee has no
power to scrutinize and assess the qualifications of the
candidates and no one has the authority to reject the decision of
the supervisory board.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that according to the final statement of the
arbitration committee, the disqualified candidates can run for the
elections, which will start on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Some 297,500 candidates have been qualified to run for 200,000
seats of city and village councils, which will in turn choose city
mayors and village chiefs.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Tibet Autonomous Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Editor's Note: This year is the
40th anniversary of the democratic reform of the Tibet Autonomous
Region of the People's Republic of China. To help readers acquire
a better understanding of Tibet, the Xinhua News Agency will
release a series of backgrounders on the politics, economy,
culture and society of the Tibet Autonomous Region beginning today.
</P>
<P>
The following is a brief introduction to the Tibet Autonomous
Region:
</P>
<P>
Tibet has been an administrative region of China since the Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368). The central people's government and the local
government of Tibet signed the 17-Article Agreement on measures
for the peaceful liberation of Tibet on May 23, 1951, and Tibet
was peacefully liberated. The Tibet Autonomous Region was
officially established on September 1, 1965.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in southwest China, the
Tibet Autonomous Region occupies a huge area of 1.2 million square
kilometers, accounting for one-eighth of China's territory. The
average elevation of the region is above 4,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Rivers flowing through Tibet include the Yarlung Zangbo River,
the Nujiang River, the Lanchang (Mekong) River and the Jinsha
River, and some 1,500 lakes dot the region. The Nam Co Lake, which
covers an area of 1,920 square kilometers, is the highest lake in
China at an elevation of over 4,700 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
Tibet is abundant in natural resources including forests,
grassland and minerals.
</P>
<P>
The fourth national forestry survey which began in 1991
indicates that Tibet has a forest cover of 9.84 percent, and its
lumber reserves total 2.084 billion cubic meters, making the
region the largest forestry area in China.
</P>
<P>
The mineral reserves of the Tibet Autonomous Region are also
tops the country, with 94 confirmed minerals.
</P>
<P>
The river runoff volume in Tibet reaches 328.9 billion cubic
meters, accounting for 12.2 percent of the country's total, while
its hydropower resources, mainly from the Yarlung Zangbo River,
ranks the third of the country.
</P>
<P>
By June 1995, Tibet had a population of 2.43 million, over 95
percent of whom belong to the Tibetan ethnic group. In addition,
the region has members of the Han, Hui, Monba and Lhoba ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
As a region devoted to Buddhism, the Tibet Autonomous Region
now has 1,700 monasteries, and other venues for religious
activities, and 46,000 monks and nuns.

Brussels, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
executive body of the European Union (EU), said here Friday it has
approved humanitarian aid of 500,000 euros for Mozambique and 500,
000 euros for Algeria.

</P>
<P>
The funding will be carried out by a Swiss non-governmental
organization for both treatment and preventive action, including
the upgrade of water supply and sanitation systems.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy to Visit Kabul on Sunday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. special envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi is scheduled to visit Kabul on Sunday
for talks with Taliban leaders on his fresh peace mission, U.N.
sources in Islamabad said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, currently in Pakistan, will proceed to the Afghan
capital in a special U.N. plane for one-day visit.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have several issues for discussion while mainly
focusing on the return of U.N. staff to the war-ravaged country.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. agencies withdrew their international staff from
Afghanistan last August following the murder of an Italian U.N.
official in Kabul and the earlier killing of two national U.N.
workers in Eastern Afghan city of Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who embarked on his fresh peace mission earlier this
week, have also held discussion with the Islamabad-based "six plus
two" group's representatives and briefed them about his mission.
</P>
<P>
The group comprises Afghanistan's six immediate neighbors
China, Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan
plus the United States and Russia.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources in Islamabad said that the visit of Brahimi is
aimed at seeking views and opinions of the Afghan rival factions
and other concerned parties to the conflict in a bid to make the
forthcoming proposed six plus two group meeting in the
Turkmenistan capital, Tashkent, a success.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi's visit coincides with the eruption of fighting between
Taliban and the joint forces of Hizb-e-Wahdat and Ahmed Shah
Masood in the central province of Bamiyan on Wednesday when the
anti-Taliban forces captured a strategic district of Yakawlang in
Bamiyan province on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> UK Unveils Plan to Boost Tourism for Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- British Culture Secretary Chris
Smith unveiled a 15-point development plan on Friday to boost the
tourism industry as the new millennium approaches.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in the Millennium Dome, which will be
open on December 31 to celebrate the new millennium, Smith said an
estimated 2 million extra people will visit Britain to take part
in millennium celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"The millennium marks an excellent opportunity to make Britain
everyone's destination of choice," he added.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of Britain's key industries, employing 175,000
people in 125,000 businesses. It brings about many social and
environmental benefits as well.
</P>
<P>
Under the ambitious plan, Smith promised more central
government support for the regions, regeneration of traditional
resorts and development of niche markets like film or sport
tourism to meet new and changing demands.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry and government are to hold a summit, and
overseas promotion is to be boosted and Internet sales widened.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which last year attracted 25.7 million overseas
visitors, currently ranks fifth in the world tourism market behind
the United States, France, Spain and Italy.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Chief Calls for Protection of Children in Armed Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) has praised a report on Guatemalan children during
the 36-year-long armed conflict as a groundbreaking document that
will help protect children in future.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemala Truth Commission Report, released on Thursday in
Guatemala, "demonstrates that children were not only indirect
victims of the conflict, but also direct targets of cruel violence
", UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The document not only throws a spotlight on the horrific
violations inflicted on Guatemalan children during the 36-year-
long armed conflict, but draws lessons to ensure that such
violence will never happen again," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, children were killed, abducted,
forcibly recruited as soldiers, illegally adopted and sexually
abused during the years of the Guatemalan conflict.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, in collaboration with the German Technical Cooperation
Agency, provided technical support to the Truth Commission in the
collection and analysis of information on the impact of the armed
conflict on children.
</P>
<P>
Among its landmark recommendations, the report calls for the
establishment of a national commission for the search of
disappeared children. The commission would have the role of
looking into the fate of those children who were kidnapped,
illegally adopted or separated from their families.
</P>
<P>
The disappearances of children, which in some cases included
the stealing of infants for adoption, occurred throughout
Guatemala during the conflict, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> IMF Team in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials from the
Kenyan Finance Ministry held a brief informal meeting Friday
afternoon with a technical team from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF team, who have come to Nairobi for an assessment on
whether to resume negotiations on a suspended loan, will begin a
formal talk with the Kenya government next Monday, an official at
the Permanent Secretary Office told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of the IMF team is a good signal for the Kenyan
economy, financial analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S. Dollars three-year loan to
Kenya under its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) in
July 1997 to show its protest against corruption and poor
governance in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The team will review whether Kenya has satisfied the conditions
the IMF set before formal talks on a new loan can restart.
</P>
<P>
Those conditions include bolstering the independence of the tax
 collection agency and forming a new Kenya Anti-Corruption Board
with an advisory board drawn mainly from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
IMF officials said earlier this month that if this visit was
successful, Kenya could move quickly toward formal talks and a new
ESAF program by late April or May.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Dutch international soccer
star Rob Witschge announced his retirement Friday in The Hangue of
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The 32-year-old began his career with first division Dutch side
Ajax, where his brother Richard now plays, followed by stints with
French second division side St. Etienne, Feyenoord and FC Utrecht.
</P>
<P>
Capped 31 times at international level, Witschge had been
playing with Saudi Arabian side Al Ittihad.
</P>
<P>
Witschge won the 1987 European Cup-Winner's Cup with Ajax but
later lost his place in the side. He moved to St. Etienne in
France for 3.2 million US dollars in 1989, but returned to the
Netherlands with Feyenoord 18 months later.
</P>
<P>
An injury to his younger brother Richard earned him a late call-
up to Holland's 1992 European championship squad.
</P>
<P>
Witschge said Friday that he would have liked to continue his
career in the Netherlands, but had not received any worthwhile
offer.

<P>
China has been taking a positive attitude in developing
economic and trade cooperation with Vietnam, and is ready to

under the principles of equality and mutual benefit, taking into
consideration efficiency and quality, seeking common development
in various forms, in order to promote common prosperity, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Can't Subscribe to IMF Recommendations: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's First Finance
Minister Daim Zainuddin said it was illogical for the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to recommend the same set of
solutions for all countries since "one cannot use the same
medicine to cure all illnesses".
</P>
<P>
Malaysia could not subscribe to the recommendations of the IMF
to revive its economy as it would have resulted in chaos and riots
in the country, Daim, who is also executive director of the
National Economic Action Council (NEAC), told a group of visiting
editors from East Asia here Thursday, NEAC said in a statement
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Daim said that among the IMF recommendations opposed by
Malaysia was the sudden closure of banks and the lifting of
subsidies on certain essential items.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia was facing a private sector problem and therefore, we
needed measures to heal our economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In Indonesia, the IMF had ordered them to close certain banks
and this had resulted in chaos and panic as people rushed to
withdraw their savings," Daim said.
</P>
<P>
He said even though certain quarters are working hard to
cripple the country, the Malaysian government will continue to
fight such efforts as its political and economic independence is
extremely important.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Urges Preparations for Drought Relief and Spring Ploughing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen
Jiabao today urged various localities and relevant departments to
make full preparations for drought relief and spring ploughing, so
as to lay a sound foundation for steady agricultural development
this year.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a national televised and telephone conference on
drought relief and spring ploughing here today, the vice-premier
said that the country's agricultural production has had a good
beginning this year, but there exists two problems that should not
be neglected.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, there exists serious drought in some parts of the
country which is still worsening. Some 11.3 million ha. of winter
crops nationwide, and more than one million ha. of the spring
ploughed farmland has been affected by the drought. In addition,
some 12 million people and 8 million head of domestic animals are
short of water supply.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the farmers are short of money to increase input in
agricultural production. The increase of farmers' income slowed
down last year which has weakened the farmers' ability to invest
in agricultural production, particularly in the flood-ravaged
areas.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier urged various localities to take urgent
efforts and mobilize all forces possible to make preparations for
drought relief and spring ploughing, in a bid to gain a good
harvest this summer.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the vice-premier called for the relevant departments
including agricultural banks, financial institutions and the power
sector to give full support to drought relief and spring ploughing.

<HEADLINE> HK Government Increases Expenditure on Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) will increase its
expenditure on education to 55.2 billion HK dollars (7.08 billion
U.S. dollars) in 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
This represents the largest share, or 19 percent of the total
public expenditure and a 7.9 percent increase in real terms over
the current financial year.
</P>
<P>
This indicated clearly the government's commitment to promoting
quality education and cultivating talents even in times of
economic difficulty, Joseph W P Wong, secretary for Education and
Manpower, said at a press conference on the draft estimates of
expenditure on education for the next financial year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total education expenditure for 1999-2000, 37.35 billion
HK dollars (4.78 billion U.S. dollars), or 67.7 percent will be on
basic education, which represents a 11.1 percent increase in real
terms compared with the figures for 1998-99; the 17.85 billion HK
dollars (2.29 billion U.S. dollars) on tertiary education, which
accounts for 32.3 percent of the total expenditure, represents 1.8
percent increase in real terms.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that the government would continue to devote much
efforts to the development of basic education in the coming year
and would introduce new initiatives in nine major areas such as
promoting school-based management, improving the learning
environment, building more schools, and enhancing the
professionalism of teachers.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Current Account Surplus Hit 40 Billion Dollars in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's current account
surplus hit a record 40.04 billion U.S. dollars in 1998, reversing
deficits of the past four years, the Bank of Korea (BOK) said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest current account figure slightly outnumbered the
government-set surplus target of 40 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the record surplus to a sharp decline in
imports rather than a recovery in exports.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting sluggish domestic demand and corporate investment,
customs-cleared imports declined 35.5 percent to 93.28 billion
dollars in 1998 from 1997, and it was the first time that imports
plunged by more than 30 percent, said the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Last year witnessed the import of consumer goods fall 41.3
percent, capital goods down 35.9 percent and raw materials plunge
34 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the central bank said that customs-cleared exports
decreased 2.8 percent to 132.31 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Exports of heavy industrial and chemical goods amounted to 90.5
billion dollars, a 2.2 percent year-to-year drop while overseas
shipments of light industrial goods slipped 3.6 percent to 31.48
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said South Korea registered a trade surplus of
39.03 billion dollars on a customs-cleared basis for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The bank forecast that the nation's current account surplus
will sharply decrease this year.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier set its current account surplus target
at 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The level of current account surplus will be largely
determined by the pace of import growth this year and we can
easily expect a rebound in imports as the economy is showing signs
of earlier-than-expected recovery," said Chung Jung-ho, head of
the Economic Statistics Office of the central bank.

BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The culture business needs
stricter supervision to help the nation's film industry, Tong Gang,
the CEO of the China Film Group Company, told a recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
Tong said that, in the market economy, industrializing the film
business could be a way to stimulate culture and the market. The
greatest threat to China's film industry, he said, is smuggling
and copyright violations and there is still a lot to be done in
spite of the crackdown on these activities.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown on illegal VCD production and smuggled films
needs to be strengthened to guard the healthy development of the
film industry, Tong said.
</P>

The seminar was organized in early February by Premier Zhu
Rongji to solicit experts'opinions for the forthcoming sessions of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee and the National People's Congress (NPC) this

<HEADLINE> China to Maintain Relatively Rapid Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China will maintain a
relatively rapid economic development this year, but the growth
rate is not expected to reach last year's level, according to Liu
Hong, director of the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held earlier today, Liu said
this year's economic development faces both favorable and
challenging international and domestic environments.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the Asian financial crisis combined with
ongoing economic crises in Russia and Brazil will adversely affect
China's exports and hinder economic development.
</P>
<P>
A number of state-owned firms continue to face difficulties,
said Liu, adding that problems related to the irrational
industrial mix cannot be solved overnight. He also noted that the
poor income expectations of Chinese citizens will hinder China's
economic development to some extent.
</P>
<P>
Liu noted that China will continue policies designed to
increase investment and accelerate infrastructure construction to
help promote economic development.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the country has vast energy resources, as
well as abundant grain and foreign exchange reserves. The high
savings rate will also provide funds for continuing rapid economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
Liu failed to elaborate on the possible contributions to be
made by exports, consumption and investment to this year's GDP
growth, but did note that increased investments contributed 63.1
percent to last year's growth rate.

<HEADLINE> Australian Gov't Warns of Possible Y2K Chaos for Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Canceled flights, power and
water failures, overloaded hospitals and no money are some of the
crises Australian travelers may face because of the year 2000 bug
(Y2K), the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) Friday
warned.
</P>
<P>
"Australians traveling abroad in the period late 1999 to early
2000 should be aware that the millennium bug may cause breakdowns
in some essential services in some countries," DFAT warned in its
travel advice.
</P>
<P>
"Australians may experience disruption to their business,
personal or holiday plans caused by breakdown in a variety of
services including transport, medical, police, financial,
telecommunications and other essential public services including
power and water supply."
</P>
<P>
The millennium or Y2K bug affects older computers which record
dates with only two digits, leading to fears they will read 2000
as 1900 and break down.
</P>
<P>
Australian missions overseas have formed an unofficial alliance
with those from the United States, Canada, Britain and New Zealand
to exchange information on the extent of the problem throughout
the world.
</P>
<P>
DFAT is confining itself to a general warning to all travelers
on possible consequences of the millennium bug including:
</P>
<P>
* Transport - flights, ferries and trains delayed or canceled;
customs and immigrations delays.
</P>
<P>
* Services - power, sewerage, water and gas supplies may fail
or be disrupted.
</P>
<P>
* Emergency - hospitals, police and security services may be
placed under strain.
</P>
<P>
* Finance - credit cards and automatic teller machines may not
work.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Researchers: Chlamydia Causes Heart Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Canadian scientists have shown
for the first time the mechanism of how bacteria can cause heart
disease, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at Princess Margaret Hospital in Toronto say they
have proved the link between heart disease and chlamydia-- a
bacterial infection nearly everyone gets because it is most often
spread like a cold by coughing and sneezing.
</P>
<P>
Chlamydia is also the culprit behind the most prevalent
sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
The findings raise questions about whether lack of exercise and
a poor diet can determine who will suffer a future heart attack.
They also suggest antibiotics or a vaccine may help to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
"If you can kill the chlamydia early enough, there is a good
chance you don't get heart disease," said Dr. Josef Penninger, who
heads the research team.
</P>
<P>
Using mouse models, the researchers discovered chlamydia
actually mimics a protein found in the heart.
</P>
<P>
Because the body's immune system recognizes and fights off
foreign agents like a virus or bacterium, chlamydia can
essentially trick the body into launching two attacks-- one of
them against the heart.
</P>
<P>
As in the mouse models, not every person exposed to chlamydia
develops heart disease. Dr. Penninger said this is because not
every immune system mistakes the heart protein for the chlamydia
bug.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- France and Germany are disputing over a reduction of EU aid
to agriculture in the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy.

approaching, fighting is going on among Russia's political-
financial clans.

This is in the long-term interests of the two countries and
peoples, and conforms to the common wish of the two sides, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese communist party is fully prepared to
advance the relations with its Vietnamese counterpart on the basis
of independence, equality, mutual respect and non-interference in
each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Phieu agreed with Hu, saying that the two parties adhere to the
path of socialism and keep the road which promotes their
respective national characteristics.
</P>
<P>
However, there is a long way to go to genuinely realize
socialism, he said, adding that it is imperative for the two
parties to sum up experiences and learn from each other while
combining theory with practice.
</P>
<P>
Phieu said that the Vietnamese communist party hopes to
increase cooperation in various fields with the Chinese communist
party, especially in exchanging views on how to better administer

<HEADLINE> Iranian People Enthusiastic for Local Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian people on Friday
showed great enthusiasm in casting their ballots to elect
councilors for cities, towns and villages in the first local
elections since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
As polling stations opened at 8 a.m. local time (0430 GMT),
long queues were seen on the live reports by the state television.
</P>
<P>
Like the presidential elections in 1997, many elders and women
turned out to cast their ballots in favor of moderate reformists.
</P>
<P>
"I hope for a better future for the Iranian people and the
country," an 83-year-old man told Xinhua before casting his vote
inside the Husseinie Ershad Mosque in northern Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Under the Iranian constitution, council members will elect
mayors and chiefs for cities, towns and villages, draw up local
policies and regulations and monitor local affairs.
</P>
<P>
"I came to vote in support of President Khatami as I voted for
him in the presidential elections," a schoolgirl said.
</P>
<P>
Most of the voters brought with them lists of their favorite
candidates published by political parties and groups during a
week-long elections campaign which ended on Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
However, some people complained that some of their favorites
were not on the list and criticized the conservative elections
supervisory board for disqualifying candidates.
</P>
<P>
"I'm against the decisions of the supervisory board to
disqualify candidates," the schoolgirl said, "It should let the
people to choose."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian moderate and conservative factions engaged in a
harsh political quarrel after the supervisory board denied the
qualifications of some prominent moderate candidates including
former interior minister Abdollah Nouri, who was impeached by the
Majlis (parliament) last June.
</P>
<P>
The deadlock was solved on Thursday when an arbitration
committee, jointly appointed by Khatami and conservative Majlis
Speaker Ali Nateq-Nouri, reconfirmed their candidacy.
</P>
<P>
The moderates pinned their hope on the elections to push
forward the political reforms promised by Khatami while the
conservatives, who still control most of the country's powers,
intended to strengthen their political base through the elections.
</P>
<P>
A total of 298,865 candidates are running for about 200,000
seats in councils of 720 cities, towns and villages throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
Some 39 million people, above the age of 15, out of the
country's 65 million population are eligible to vote.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Rise at Auctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Renewed interest from China
sent wool prices up by two percent this week, the biggest rise
since last November.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator gained 11 cents to end the week at
4.95 Australian dollars (3.12 U.S. dollars) a kilogram clean, the
Australian Wool Industries Secretariat (AWIS) said in its weekly
wool market review.
</P>
<P>
The increase was based on rises of eight cents and 12 cents
respectively in the north and south markets, while the western
indicator rose five cents.
</P>
<P>
A total of 90,129 bales were offered for sale, with 13.8
percent passed in (7.2 percent in Newcastle, 11.8 percent in
Melbourne and 20.6 percent in Fremantle).
</P>
<P>
"The principal difference in the market this week was renewed
activity from China, which augurs well for next week's Adelaide
sale with its offering of traditional Chinese types," AWIS said.
</P>
<P>
"China remains a difficult trading environment, however, being
our largest market, most exporters have little option."

<HEADLINE> Stable Yuan Enjoys Solid Foundation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Third, foreign investors continue to favor China. In 1998
direct foreign investment in China exceeded 45 billion U.S.
dollars, making China the largest destination of foreign
investment in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign investors say they continue to see China as one of
the most ideal investment destinations.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, China adheres to the principle of going step by step in
the process of making the yuan fully convertible, and the cautious
control of capital accounts helps keep foreign speculative capital
out of China's financial market.
</P>
<P>
Financial expert Liu Guangcan said that since the second half
of last year, China's foreign-exchange administration departments
have adopted active measures to examine the authenticity of trade
under current accounts, reinforced the management of foreign
exchange under capital accounts, and firmly cracked down on
illegal practices, all of which is conducive to the continued
stability of the yuan.
</P>
<P>
Song Qun of the State Planning and Development Commission has
noted that China's economic development requires a stable currency.
</P>
<P>
"After many years of reform and development, China's economic
strength has undergone great changes, and has now entered a period
of restructuring and transition. Comparatively stable price levels,
exchange rates, and economic policies are enabling enterprises to
reliably forecast profits, which is a significant prerequisite for
smooth restructuring," he said.
</P>
<P>
Well-known financial expert Zhao Haikuan has said that people's
confidence is another important factor in maintaining a stable
currency. China's sound economic situation and the government's
firm policies have instilled that confidence in the Chinese people,
providing a solid psychological foundation for the exchange rate
of the yuan.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the People's Bank of China Dai Xianglong has
recently pointed out that the central bank has full confidence in
maintaining a stable yuan in 1999, saying that devaluation of the
yuan would hurt the interests of foreign investors, increase China'
s debt, and would not be conducive to the stability of the Asian
financial market.
</P>
<P>
"The level of China's foreign exchange reserves exceeds one
year's total import payments; purchasing prices for export goods
are stable; the interest-rate level is fairly low, and export tax
rebates for some products have been increased. Analysis of the
exchange rate formation mechanism shows that the yuan will not be
devalued," he said.

<HEADLINE> Stable Yuan Enjoys Solid Foundation (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The exchange rate of the
Chinese currency, the yuan, stood at one U.S. dollar to 8.2778
yuan at the end of January, a slight appreciation over the end of
last year.
</P>
<P>
Economists have called this a "good beginning" for maintaining
a stable yuan in 1999, and say this indicates that the favorable
factors supporting the yuan's stability are still intact.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, despite severe pressure from the Asian financial
crisis, China succeeded in keeping its word that "the yuan does
not need to be devalued and will not be devalued."
</P>
<P>
At the annual central conference on economic work held last
December, the Chinese government pledged again that the yuan will
continue to be stable in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Economists in Beijing believe that continued stability of the
yuan remains critical this year for regional economic stability
and domestic economic development, and that China's pledge is
quite reasonable, considering a variety of related factors.
</P>
<P>
First, China is politically stable and has a national economy
growing at a fairly fast rate. The gross domestic product is
expected to grow at about seven percent this year, experts predict.
Although this will be slightly lower than last year's growth rate,
it will still be the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Second, China has more than 145 billion U.S. dollars in foreign
exchange reserves and a favorable balance of international
payments, both contributing to a stable exchange rate.

outside world does of China, because mutual exchanges and
understandings are vital to the development of any country", Jiang,
also General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the work to promote understanding of China
was mainly aimed at clarifying the country's internal and
diplomatic policies as well as principles towards major
international issues, and to introduce the country's historic and
current situations to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"It will be of great significance to help China enhance
economic, technological and cultural exchanges and cooperation
with other countries, foster mutual friendship, gain more overseas
aids and safeguard political, economic and cultural security, " he
said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also emphasized that departments in charge of the work
should be equipped with advanced information technology and
facilities. More support should be provided by CPC committees and
governments at all levels.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by Vice President Hu Jintao and
Vice Premier Li Lanqing, who are both members of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.

Phieu said problems involving bilateral relations have been
solved, and noted that the parties and nations have maintained the
excellent momentum for developing relations.
</P>
<P>
"We will strive to ensure the full and stable growth of
bilateral relations," said Phieu.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman noted that the Vietnamese people have
proceeded under the leadership of the Vietnamese Communist Party
and have scored universally acknowledged achievements by adhering
to the socialist course, and reform and opening policies.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has greatly enhanced its international status by
maintaining social stability and economic growth, while at the
same time improving living standards. Li added that Vietnam has
maintained macroeconomic stability in the face of the Asian
financial crisis and natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Vietnamese people will overcome all
difficulties and will realize its set strategic development target
for the 21st century," said Li.

<HEADLINE> Donors Pledge 470 Million Dollars for Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia got a one-year aid
package commitment worth 470 million U.S.dollars from donor
countries and international aid agencies Friday at the just-
concluded third Consultative Group (CG) meeting on aid to Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The package, which was adopted by 17 donor countries and six
international aid agencies at the two-day Tokyo meeting sponsored
by the World bank, was 20 million dollars more than the Cambodian
government had sought from donors to finance its reform programs.
</P>
<P>
In return, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen promised to
implement the reforms to which he has committed his new government
and affirmed that he will maintain a quarterly dialogue with the
donor community on progress in implementing those reforms.
</P>
<P>
World Bank official Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, who chaired the
meeting, told reporters that the amount donors pledged was "a
signal of the world's concern and commitment about Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
"Very substantial progress has been made already by the (
Cambodian) government in trying to demonstrate its commitment to
these reforms," she said regarding actions to curb illegal logging,
implement a value-added tax and embark on military demobilization.
</P>
<P>
"But donors made a point that there needs to be attention to
implementation -- that is, actions over words -- in a sustained
manner, and to the monitoring of the government's reform programs,
" she said.
</P>
<P>
While Hun Sen will leave Tokyo with more aid than he had sought
for and more than Cambodia got at the last donor meeting, he was
unable to persuade donors to agree to a three-year commitment
totaling 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CG held its first meeting in July 1996 in Tokyo, pledging
500 million dollars for 1996 through 1997 to back up Cambodia's
medium-term development program.
</P>
<P>
In the second meeting held in July 1997 in Paris, the group
hammered out a total of 450 million dollars in aid to the
southeastern Asian nation.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to launch a nine-day
naval maneuver in the Gulf as of Saturday, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the Fateh-77 (Victor-77) maneuver Admiral Fariborz
Fazel said that the war games are to be held near the Abu Musa
island, which is also claimed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE),
extending to the strategic Hormoz Strait at the mouth of the
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
He said ships, submarines and fighter jets will be called in
from a southern base to join the exercises. But he did not
mention the number of troops to be involved in the operation.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the UAE claim sovereignty over Abu Musa, the
Greater and Lesser Tunbs in the Gulf, although the islands were
taken over by Iran in 1971 following the withdrawal of British
troops from the region.
</P>
<P>
Iran repeatedly called for talks between Tehran and Abu Dhabi
to solve their "misunderstanding" over the issue, but the UAE
insisted on an international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
The dispute has hindered Iran's efforts to improve its ties
with Gulf states, although Tehran said it was ready to conclude
security pacts with its Arab neighbors.

NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Leaders from central African
states have called for a cease-fire in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) and urged all foreign troops to withdraw from that
country, a report reaching here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Friday after a summit in Camerounian
capital Yaounde, the heads of state said that the six-month Congo
(K) conflict has threatened peace and stability across Africa.
</P>
<P>
The central African leaders called upon Congolese leaders to
pursue dialog in a bid to end the civil war in the third largest
African country. Congolese  President Laurent Kabila
participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The summit also called on the parties in the Angolan civil war
to respect the 1994 Lusaka peace protocol and expressed concern
over the niggling border dispute between Cameroun and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between Angola and Zambia has soured recently
because Angola accused Zambia of supplying arms to the forces of
the rebel National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The leaders appealed to Nigeria, which is at the crucial
crossroad in the power to civilian process, and Cameroun to
refrain from acts likely to raise tension ahead of a verdict on
the dispute from the International Court of Justice in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
 Rwanda's foreign minister attended the summit and Uganda was
not represented. The two countries have been allegedly supporting
the Tutsi- led rebels in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Camerounian President Paul Biya hosted the summit which were
also attended by leaders from Burundi, the Central African
Republic, Chad, the Congo Republic and Sao Tome and Principe.

<HEADLINE> China's Efforts to Protect Wetlands Praised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Delmar Blasco, secretary
general of the Wetlands Convention, today praised China's efforts
to protect its wetlands.
</P>
<P>
As an important member of the convention, China is now setting
an example for other convention members by formulating a national
wetlands-protection action plan, said Blasco, who arrived in
Beijing yesterday for a four-day tour of China.
</P>
<P>
China is now formulating this plan, which is expected to spell-
out a detailed timetable next year, said an official from the
National Bureau of Forestry, who added that the plan is expected
to be completed in near future. Wetlands, the natural ecological
systems often referred to as the earth's kidneys, play an
important role in water conservation and erosion and flood
prevention.
</P>
<P>
The Wetlands International Convention, Especially for Waterfowl
Habitats, known simply as the Wetlands Convention, was set up in
1971, with the aim of promoting wetlands protection and
utilization worldwide. So far, 963 wetlands in 114 countries have
been listed as International Important Wetlands.
</P>
<P>
China now has wetlands covering more than 60 million hectares,
accounting for ten percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
In past years, increasing population and economic development
have resulted in the continuous deterioration of wetlands in China.
</P>
<P>
Some experts have even blamed the heavy flooding along China's
Yangtze, Nenjiang and Songhua rivers last summer, at least in part,
on the continuing degeneration of the wetlands.

<HEADLINE> South Asia Introduces Bed Technology for Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Bed technology for wheat,
which allows for efficient water and weed management, is being
introduced in the South Asian region after acclimatization, an
expert said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Timothy G. Reeves, director general of the
Mexico-based International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center,
made the announcement at a press conference held at the end of a
two-day meeting of the Regional Steering Committee of the
Rice-Wheat Consortium for the Indo-Gangetic Plain involving Nepal,
India, Bangladesh and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said the technology was developed by his center.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nepal, India, Bangladesh and Pakistan are
self-sufficient on rice and wheat, where rice and wheat are
cultivated in about 12 million hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
The Rice-Wheat Consortium was formed in the early 1990s with a
view to promoting a sustainable growth of rice and wheat. It
consists of the national research programs in the four countries
as well as some international research centers.
</P>
<P>
Rajendra Singh Paroda, Indian agriculture secretary and
director general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research,
said that due to the lack of proper farming technology, farmers
are not getting proper profit and the productivity has declined.
</P>
<P>
He said that countries in the region have to share experience
and learn lessons from each other for the purpose of increasing
sustainable productivity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed problems facing the farmers such as
integrated pest, nutrient and water management and new hybrid rice
and wheat seeds suitable for the Indo-Gangetic Plain.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Sri Lanka, Mexico, the Philippines, the United
States, Britain and Peru also attended the meeting.

The NPA has reportedly set up special operating units to
monitor the movements of its kidnapping targets, which allegedly
include government officials and military officers close to
Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Estrada earlier suspended peace talks between the government
and the NPA following the abduction of two army officers and one
police inspector by the rebel guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that his administration will continue to
implement, with even more vigor, its initiatives aimed at
addressing the causes of insurgency.
</P>
<P>
These initiatives include the government's anti-poverty
program, social reforms, the granting of amnesty to rebels and
peace talks at the local level.
</P>
<P>
In Manila, National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre assured
the public that the government is prepared for possible attacks by
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the government's peace initiatives at the
local level will continue.

<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, who is a member of
the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party's Central Committee, met here today with Le Kha Phieu,
general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of Vietnam (CPV).
</P>
<P>
 Li said that the reforms and the socialist construction in
Vietnam have had achievements since the CPV's 8th national
congress in 1996 and that Vietnam has maintained stability and
growth in its economy in spite of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The smooth transition of Vietnamese leadership can guarantee
the development of the socialist cause in Vietnam, Li said, and
the Vietnamese people will surely reach the goals of the 8th
national congress under the leadership of the CPV, headed by Le
Kha Phieu.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the CPC and CPV had a comprehensive
restoration and have developed since 1991, with bilateral
exchanges and co-operation and increasing mutual trust and close
contacts between the two countries and two parties' leaders have
played an important role in promoting bilateral ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
The consensus reached between President Jiang Zemin and Phieu
on Sino-Vietnamese ties in their talks Thursday will bring
bilateral co-operative relations up to a new high, Li said.  (

<HEADLINE> Estrada Invites Group Leader to Meet for Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Friday invited Hashim Salamat, chairman of the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to visit him at the presidential
yacht for talks on peace and development in Mindanao, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, who is visiting Mindanao, said in an interview that
since the yacht is an extension of his office, inviting Salamat to
visit there would be equivalent to asking him to go to the
Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
He said Salamat would not need armed bodyguards during his
visit to the presidential yacht and he assured the MILF leader of
personal safety.
</P>
<P>
Estrada reiterated his call for an end to violence and conflict
in the south and for Salamat to join him in developing Mindanao
and helping its residents, especially Muslim Filipinos, to lead a
better life.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Estrada called on Salamat to abandon his plan to set
up an Islamic state and join him in turning Mindanao into a land
of growth and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Estrada is on his five-day tour in Mindanao to inspect ongoing
government projects and find out a way to transform the island
into the country's food basket and a new gateway to trade.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Renews Call on Japan to Stimulate Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers on Friday renewed his call on Japan to take
additional measures to spur domestic demand-driven economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Japan National Press Club in Tokyo, Summers
said, "I think it is now very widely believed that the over-
arching challenge of policy in Japan today is the creation of
strong domestic demand-led growth."
</P>
<P>
The global economy is now at a critical juncture, faced with "
too little growth, too little demand" and the lack of balance in
growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States cannot be the world's sole growth
engine indefinitely, Summers expressed concern about weakening
signs of growth in Europe as well as prospects for the Japanese
economy.
</P>
<P>
He called on Japan to take fiscal and tax-related measures to
spur the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the steps Tokyo has taken recently to stabilize its
banking system, which he said are necessary for strong domestic
demand growth.
</P>
<P>
But he said Japan needs to take further action to address the
problem of Japan's capital-starved banking sector than it has
already mapped out and done.
</P>
<P>
Summers was in Japan on the last leg of his seven-day five-
nation Asian tour.

<HEADLINE> S. African Opposition Party Loses Legal Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's New
National Party Friday lost a legal battle against the government
over identity requirements in the upcoming general election.
</P>
<P>
The Cape High Court ruled that only bar-coded identity
documents are valid for the election, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The New National Party has argued that the requirement is
unconstitutional as it meant that up to four million potential
voters would be effectively disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
The government argued that all South Africans were being given
sufficient warning and time to obtain the required documentation
for voter registration.
</P>
<P>
The party's application for a ruling on what it alleged was
interference with the Independent Electoral Commission's autonomy
was also dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Despite the ruling, the New NP has vowed to carry on fighting
against the bar-code requirement for voters.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly a looming crisis could now become a full-scale
crisis," New NP spokesperson Sheila Camerer said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a civil rights issue. At stake is the right to vote."
</P>
<P>
She said the party's legal representatives were studying the
judgement, and the party would decide what to do next after
hearing from them.
</P>
<P>
It was widely expected that the party would take the case to
the Constitutional Court.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate in S. Africa Not Up Since 1994: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Contrary to the
perception that crime rate had risen since the birth of a
democratic South Africa in 1994, crimes had decreased, a South
African research organization said.
</P>
<P>
The false perception resulted from a widening of the police's
statistical net, The Citizen paper Friday quoted the South African
Institute of Race Relations as saying.
</P>
<P>
The net now includes the 44 percent of the country's population
who lived in the previous homelands, which were not counted under
the Apartheid government.
</P>
<P>
If comparing the numbers of reported crimes for identical
three-year periods before and after 1994, the rate of increase for
many types of crime is lower after 1994 than before it, according
to the organization's study which is to be published in March.
</P>
<P>
Serious assaults increased 17 percent pre-1994 and 12 percent
post-1994, robbery up 43 percent before 1994 and four percent
afterwards, and house- breaking up 15 percent as opposed to seven
percent.
</P>
<P>
In some cases there had been a decrease in crime, the
organization found.
</P>
<P>
Murders rose 30 percent between 1990 and 1993, but dropped
eight percent between 1994 and 1997; and while car thefts climbed
14 percent before 1994, they fell four percent after 1994.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year increase for many crimes had been considerably
lower since 1994 than before it, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, there has been mounting public outcry for the
South African government to curb the high level of crime, which
began to deter foreign investors and tourists. Statistics show
that South Africa has one of the world's worst rates for murder
and rape.

<HEADLINE> FUNCINPEC Loyalists Reintegrated Into RCAF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 5,000 former
soldiers of the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF), who are loyal
to the FUNCINPEC party led by Prince Norodom Ranariddh, were
reintegrated into the RCAF Friday.
</P>
<P>
This integration signaled that Cambodia has gained real peace
and "we can from now on concentrate our energy on developing our
country," Co-Minister of Defense Tea Banh said.
</P>
<P>
The reintegration ceremony, held in Samraong, Siem Reap
Province, was presided over by Co-Ministers of Defense Tea Ban and
Prince Sirirath. Also present were other high-ranking officers
including Deputy Commanders-in-Chief Meas Sophea and Khan Savoeun
and some foreign military attaches and diplomatic envoys.
</P>
<P>
The FUNCINPEC loyalists broke ranks with the government troops
following the bloody fighting in July 1997 between forces loyal to
the then Co-Premier Hun Sen and Prince Ranariddh who was ousted
from power later.
</P>
<P>
The breakaway forces then fled to the northern and western
borders of Cambodia and camped at O'smach and Samlot to resist
government troops.
</P>
<P>
They were allowed to rejoin the RCAF after FUNCINPEC and the
Cambodian People's Party agreed to form a coalition government
following the general election on July 26, 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the reintegration ceremony had been postponed due to
controversy over the number of the troops. FUNCINPEC claimed the
number was more than 10,000, but the government said only 5,011
troops were eligible for reintegration. The rest, the government
insisted, were new recruits who do not belong to the RCAF.

<P>
Citing people's rule over their own destiny as one of the 1979
Islamic Revolution's goals, Khatami said that the elections will
entrust the administration of cities and villages to public hands
and his government is honored to transfer parts of its authority
to the people.

<P>
He called on the Iranian people, the youth in particular, to
turn out in the elections whose initial results are expected
Saturday.
</P>
<P>

He said that as the solution to the Kosovo crisis would benefit
Macedonia, his country has joined the NATO mission.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Nine Kenyan Officials Fired over Bhang Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Nine Kenyan officials have
been interdicted for their failure to curb the illegal bhang
growing in Mt. Kenya forest, the independent Daily Nation
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The nine people included four assistant chiefs, a forestry
officer and four forest guards, all from Tharaka Nithi District
of Eastern Province.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Provincial Commissioner Nicholas Mberia accused the
chiefs of neglecting their duties. The chiefs' interdiction was
effected Monday but the interdiction letters were faxed to the
district headquarters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Charles Mbaka, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of
Natural Resources, who signed the interdiction letters, questioned
how the crop had been cultivated without the knowledge of the
officers on the ground and the guards with the responsibility of
protecting the forest.
</P>
<P>
Last week, more than 100 acres of bhang were destroyed in the
forest in an operation by administration police and forest
guards.

<HEADLINE> Botswana Records First Deficit in 15 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Botswana, which boasts
the fastest growth in Africa and enjoys a stable economy in three
decades, is facing a budget deficit for the first time in 15
years.
</P>
<P>
Botswanan Finance Minister Ponatshego Kedikilwe said this week
that the country posted a deficit of 400 million Pula (89 million
U.S. Dollars) last year, or 1.5 percent of gross domestic product,
The Star newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
This was due to depressed diamond sales after a quota system
was imposed by De Beers, the South Africa-based diamond giant, in
response to the Asian crisis. Diamond industry played a
significant role in Botswana's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The right-sizing of the public service should be accelerated
with a view to improving efficiency in government and cutting
unnecessary costs," Kedikilwe said.
</P>
<P>
A freeze on hiring additional unskilled labor by the government
would be extended for at least another two years. There would be
no salary increases for civil servants this year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the country's foreign exchange reserves are still
very high at 5.7 billion Dollars, enough to cover 29 months worth
of imports.
</P>
<P>
Botswana abolished all exchange controls earlier this month and
adopted a new tax regime to woo foreign investors, as part of a
campaign to build the country into a financial services center in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Confederation of Commerce, Industry and Manpower in
Botswana commended the government for not panicking in the face of
the deficit.
</P>
<P>
But it said the government should introduce some sort of
subsidy for the credit schemes instead of fixing interest rate.
The government should also speed up privatization, which would
help solve the deficit problem.
</P>
<P>
Business leaders also expressed their doubt over the efficiency
of the abolition of exchange controls and about the government's
ability to fulfil its promise of turning Gaborone into a financial
center.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Records Trade Surplus in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's trade
balance defied expectations of a deficit in January by notching up
a surplus of 919 million Rand (148 million U.S. Dollars), Business
Day newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
January's trade surplus was astonishing because the figure
included aircraft imports worth about two billion Rand (323
million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
As a result of the aircraft purchases, economists expected a
deficit of about 700 million Rand (113 million Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Excluding the aircraft, imports were virtually unchanged,
further proving that last year's Rand depreciation and extremely
high interest rates have crushed domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The trade number follows gross domestic product figures
released earlier this week showing there was virtually no growth
last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports surged to 12.06 billion Rand (1.95 billion Dollars) in
January from 9.95 billion Rand (1.6 billion Dollars) last
December.
</P>
<P>
Exports rose from 12.22 billion Rand (1.97 billion Dollars)
last December to 12.98 billion Rand (2.09 billion Dollars) in
January.
</P>
<P>
A trade surplus is good news for interest rates, as it means
less foreign capital is needed to finance the country's current
account deficit. When foreign capital is scarce, interest rates
have to be high to attract enough inflow to cover the current
account deficit.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Presidential Candidate Advocates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Only spiritual revival anchored
on political stability can turn around Nigeria politically,
economically, socially and morally, General Olusegun Obasanjo was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a forum organized by the Nigerian Association of
Chambers of Commerce, Industry, Mines and Agriculture on Thursday
in Lagos, Obasanjo said that a turn-around situation required
efforts beyond "cosmetic economic measures".
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo, presidential candidate of the People's Democratic
Party (PDP), noted that "all is not well with us politically,
economically, socially, normally", The Guardian newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We have sunk too low and cosmetic economic measures will not
do," he said, adding "we have to go down to the heart of the
problem and the hearts and minds of our people."
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo stressed that "unless we change their hearts, we
change their minds, and it's only spiritual revival and spiritual
regeneration I believe can do that."
</P>
<P>
He noted that Nigeria had been regarded as one of the most
corrupt in the world, adding "I don't see how we can encourage
investment in this country when corruption has become our
tradition."
</P>
<P>
He announced his intention to establish an anti-corruption
agency toward reducing Nigeria's current top placement on global
corruption list within his first year in office, if elected.
</P>
<P>
The PDP presidential flag bearer described the current full
adoption of globalization policy by Nigeria as inimical to
economic growth, saying that further pursuance of the strategy
could contribute to de-industrialization of the nation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "little industries we have are struggling to
exist and I found that most of them are dead."
</P>
<P>
On the subsidization to agriculture, Obasanjo pointed out, in
Europe, agriculture is subsidized to the tune of over 50 billion
U.S. Dollars a year while in America, it is even more because they
see food as part of essential security.
</P>
<P>
"Food security is regarded as important as physical security or
military security" in Europe and America, he noted, so "they are
right to subsidize agriculture and we are wrong to give the farmer
just a little bit of increment to break from his back-breaking,
tedious job."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Obasanjo was given a rousing welcome in Ibadan,
southwestern Nigeria, on the last lap of his campaign tour for the
Saturday presidential election.
</P>
<P>
A mammoth crowd of party supporters and residents toured out
for the Mapo Hall ground in the city where the PDP presidential
candidate addressed a campaign rally.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Inaugurates Reform Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie Friday inducted into office the National Reform Team for a
Civil Society.
</P>
<P>
The president explained that the aim of creating a civil
society means placing the supremacy of the law and the
constitution as the basis of the country's life.
</P>
<P>
A democratic political life, justice, equal business
opportunities for everyone and the observance of human rights
principles are needed to ensure this supremacy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The head of state asked all quarters, including
non-governmental organizations, to help ensure the success of the
upcoming general election.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has pledged to try hard to hold a fair,
open and just election.
</P>
<P>
Presidential Decree No. 198/1998, which serves as the legal
basis of the setup of the National Reform Team for a Civil
Society, states that the team has the task of gathering ideas on
economy, politics, law and culture and making predictions about
global impacts on various aspects of the country's life.
</P>
<P>
It states that the team is also tasked to draft policies on
forecasting the trends of transformation and to report this to the
president as well as to formulate recommendations and thoughts on
efforts to boost national transformation toward the creation of a
civil society.
</P>
<P>
The president will be the team's patron and there will be a
21-member advisory council, to be chaired by Cooperatives Minister
Adi Sasono.
</P>
<P>
After the inauguration, Sasono told reporters that the
109-member team was formed not to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the June 7 general election, he said, the team does
not aim to uphold the status quo because the government is
committed to fair, transparent and democratic polls.
</P>
<P>
This commitment could be seen from the government's decision to
involve the people and foreign observers in monitoring the
election, he added.

<HEADLINE> UAE to Combat Waste Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
will take measures to combat the waste problem as it was listed as
one of biggest waste generators in the world, the English daily
Gulf News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The rate of household waste per capita had reached an average
of 730 kilograms in Abu Dhabi and 725 kilograms in Dubai, said a
report of the Emirates Consumer Protection Society (ECPS).
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the average annual waste per person is
710 kilograms, in Australia 690 kilograms and in Britain 300
kilograms, it said.
</P>
<P>
The country also saw additional refuse scattered in littered
streets, gardens and wastes dumped in the seas and on beaches.
</P>
<P>
The problem has inflicted heavy burdens on the municipalities
in charge of clearing and waste disposal operations.
</P>
<P>
Measures are to be taken to cope with the problem, including
reusing plastic bags, carton packs and newspapers before throwing
them away, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It also called for enhancing public awareness about the health
hazards which result from the improper disposal of wastes.
</P>
<P>
The report urged more volunteers to join the public clean-up
campaigns in an effort to help maintain a clean environment and
preserve the image of the country.

<P>
CAIRO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- An official source on Thursday dismissed as groundless the
reports carried by some Turkish media that Egypt was involved in
the capture of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan. The source
added that such allegations were part of a bid to deflect
attention away from the role of Israel and others in the Ocalan
operation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Economists and oil experts predicted that the decline in oil
prices at the world market would continue due to the continuation
of Asian and Latin American financial crisis. Gulf oil exporting
countries registered losses of 60 billion U.S. dollars in 1998
from the oil prices drop.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Egypt was awarded a gold medal by the Milan Tourist Bourse
for the fourth consecutive time in appreciation of its active role
in the organization.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
-- Oslo was ready to "contribute" to efforts aimed at reviving
peace negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and was
willing to cooperate with Egypt, Jordan and the Unites States,
said Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Bondevik on Thursday after
meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Jobless Rate Up to 8.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 26 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's unemployment rate
soared to a record 8.5 percent last month, the highest since 1966,
reaching 1.762 million, the National Statistical Office said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Last December, the country's jobless rate stood at 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The office attributed the rise to a drop in sectors of
construction, agriculture, fisheries and forestry and suspension
of major public works in winter.
</P>
<P>
However, the seasonally-adjusted unemployment rate fell to 7.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The worst is yet to come as university graduates will enter the
labor market in March and the number of unemployed could reach two
million with the jobless rate hitting nine percent next month,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They said the anticipated surge in the jobless population is
likely to cause further unrest in labor circles over ongoing
corporate restructuring, which may, in turn, produce more mass
layoffs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions,
one of two labor umbrella groups, dropped out of a three-way labor
negotiation with the government and business leaders, saying it
could not accept further layoffs.

levels, a weekly market review said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities

banking and cement stocks.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share index closed at 575.8 points Thursday,
remaining virtually unchanged since last week's closing.
</P>
<P>
Volume of transactions remained at relatively high levels with

million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Total volume of transactions for the last five trading sessions
reached 24.7 million pounds (49.4 million dollars), compared to
39.9 million pounds (79.8 million dollars) the week before. The

<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Law enforcement officials and public figures in the United
States expressed outrage Thursday over the decision by the
Supreme Court in Jerusalem to block the extradition of suspected
murderer Samuel Sheinbein, 18, to the U.S. and try him in Israel
instead. U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno said she was
"disappointed" but would work with Israeli officials on
Sheinbein's prosecution in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:

<P>
-- Another Israeli citizen suspected of committing murder in
the U.S. is also thought to be in Israel. Dror Chaim Goldberg,

Texas, with stabbing to death a 45-year-old woman last
November.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:

<HEADLINE> Japan Vows Continued Backing for Landmine Removal in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi on Friday pledged continued cooperation with Cambodia on
the removal of antipersonnel landmines in the southeastern Asian
country.
</P>
<P>
In meeting Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen at the Diet, or
Japanese parliament, Obuchi was quoted by a Kyodo News report as
saying that he was "especially concerned" about the removal of
land mines in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Noting that land mines have afflicted great damage on Cambodian
people, Hun Sen lauded the Japanese government's plan to provide
support not only for the removal of weapons but also for programs
to assist landmine victims.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura told Hun
Sen at a two-hour meeting that his country is considering
providing Cambodia with equipment for landmine clearance as well
as aid for the victims.
</P>
<P>
Japan has provided a total of six million U.S. dollars to
Cambodia since 1994 to assist landmine removal. An estimated
number of four to six million land mines, laid during a protracted
civil war, are yet to be removed in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi also urged the Cambodian leader to step up reform
efforts in areas such as democracy and human rights while Hun Sen
asked Japan to continue economic assistance to his country,
including yen-denominated loans.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday for a six-day visit and to
attend the third Consultative Group meeting on international aid
to Cambodia.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Sets Rules on Purchase of Private Lands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has issued new guidelines on the acquisition of private
lands by the government for public use in a drive to combat
corruption, government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidelines, government agencies shall first offer in
writing a purchase price 10 percent higher than the value of the
land while the owner is given 15 days to consider such an offer.
</P>
<P>
If no acceptance has been made after 15 days, the concerned
agency shall initiate expropriation proceedings before the proper
court and deposit 10 percent of the offered amount.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines also cover the right-of-way easement of public
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Estrada set these conditions in an administrative order which
asks government agencies engaged in public infrastructure projects
to strictly follow them.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said it has been the usual practice of the government
to approach the owner and negotiate the acquisition of private
lands, but such a process could spawn graft and corruption
detrimental to the interest of the government.

HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 400 police officers from
four southern African countries have mounted roadblocks along most
major roads in Zimbabwean capital Harare and another city in a
renewed campaign to recover vehicles stolen in the region, the
daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The five-day operation, dubbed Operation Sesane (which means
"clean up" in Cicewa), has brought together officers from
Botswana, South Africa, Tanzania and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It is successor to Operation Voyager Four, which led to the
recovery of about 1,000 vehicles in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's police spokesman Superintendent Wayne bvudzijena
said Thursday that an increase in car thefts, and the movement of
contraband across national borders had necessitated the current
operation.
</P>
<P>
He said the operation was being conducted under the auspices of
the Southern African Regional Police Chiefs Cooperation
Organization and Interpol.
</P>
<P>
"This operation has been necessitated by the increase of car
thefts and movement of contraband across borders in the region.
It is generally accepted that most of the vehicles stolen in one
country often ended up in another, and hence the need for a
coordinated approach by the various police forces," he added.

DAR ES SALAAM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is scheduled to
begin early May the construction of a 13.5-km long bridge across
the Rufiji River to develop the less developed southern regions.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ministry of Works said Friday that the
project, under a contract between the Tanzania government and
Italian Impresa Fortnato Fredrici company, is financed by the
Kuwait Fund, Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
Fund for International Development and Saudi Fund for Development.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the 26-million-US Dollar bridge project and
the Kibiti-Lindi road will link the coastal regions of Dar es
Salaam with Lindi and Mtwara areas to ease their long-term
transport predicament.
</P>
<P>
Since its independence from British colonial rule in 1961,
Tanzania has dreamed to build a key road and a bridge across the
Rufiji River to develop its southern regions of Lindi and Mtwara.
</P>
<P>
Last year President Benjamin Mkapa laid the foundation stone of
the Rufiji River project and some preliminary construction work
has been completed so far.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, it was projected that the whole scheme would be
completed by May next year, but construction was disrupted by
heavy rains caused by the El-Nino weather phenomenon.

CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar shed
nearly two-thirds of a U.S. cent Friday in Sydney, as disenchanted
offshore sellers moved in.
</P>
<P>
Heavy selling out of the United States was a large factor in
Friday's dive, but Thursday's weaker than expected capital
expenditure data was a continuing hangover factor.

"I think what we have seen is just a bit of disenchantment set

The Australian dollar finished in Sydney at 62.33 U.S. cents,
from 62.98 U.S. cents late Thursday after trading between 62.10

<HEADLINE> Recalled Greek Envoy Leaves Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The recalled Greek Ambassador
George Costoulas left Kenya Thursday evening following his role
in the entry of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan in Nairobi
on February 2, Kenya's major newspapers reported here in the front
page Friday.
</P>
<P>
The envoy left the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport aboard a
private jet accompanied by three Kurdish women associates who
have been holed up in the embassy since Ocalan's arrest on
February 16.
</P>
<P>
He arrived at the airport in a convoy of cars, including two
with Belgium's embassy number plates, said the local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government demanded Costoulas' recall with immediate
effect on February 16, citing that he played a role in " the
illegal entry of Ocalan".
</P>
<P>
However, Pavlos Apostolidis, Greek secretary-general of the
Foreign Ministry, claimed here Thursday that Ocalan's entry into
Kenya was " procedural". Apostolidis arrived in Kenya last
Wednesday to negotiate for the safe passage of Costoulas and the
three Kurdish women.
</P>
<P>
"He (Ocalan) had an entry stamp on his passport. They checked
his luggage," said Apostolidis. "We did not use any diplomatic
arrangement (to have him in Kenya)".
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was captured by Kenyan and Turkish security agents en
route to the airport, when attempted to travel to Europe for a
political asylum. He faced a charge of treason in a Turkey court.

<HEADLINE> ADB Urges Help in Restoring Asia's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank
(ADB) Friday urged other international financial institutions to
play their vital role in restoring Asia's growth.
</P>
<P>
In a keynote speech at Asia Society's 10th annual meeting here,
ADB President Tadao Chino said international financial
institutions have played a positive role in helping the Asian
economies contain the financial crisis during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, restoring Asia's growth and preventing
similar crisis in the future are the most challenging tasks.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the international financial institutions will
have a vital role to play in restoring Asia's growth and bringing
in the world a more stable environment conducive to sustained
growth for developed and developing economies alike," Chino said.
</P>
<P>
He said the international financial institutions should
continue to provide financial assistance to help Asian economies
move up the development ladder.
</P>
<P>
They also need to promote regional and global cooperation to
reduce the likelihood of crisis and to effectively deal with them
when they indeed occur, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, the international financial institutions,
together with others including those in the private sector, must
strike carefully a balance between liberalizing capital flows and
the stability of international capital market," the ADB chief
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the international financial institutions need to
place an increasing emphasis on helping developing economies
enhance their own capacity in economic management and financial
supervision.
</P>
<P>
With continuing assistance from the international financial
institutions and help from all others, Asia will return to the
path of growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the future course of development in Asia, the
international financial institutions will have an important role
to play in helping Asia not only to come out from the crisis
sooner, but more importantly to sustain its future growth," said
the ADB president.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Renews Call for Japan to Stimulate Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers on Friday renewed his call for the Japanese
government to step up moves to spur domestic demand-driven
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"I think it is now very widely believed that the over-arching
challenge of policy in Japan today is the creation of strong
domestic demand-led growth," he said in a speech at the Japan
National Press Club in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
He said the global economy is now at a critical juncture, faced
with "too little growth, too little demand" and the lack of
balance in growth.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the United States cannot be the world's sole growth
engine indefinitely, Summers said Japan should galvanize the
economy at an early date for the sake of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Specifically, he spoke of the need for Japan to take fiscal and
tax-related measures as a means of spurring growth.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official hailed the steps Tokyo has taken recently to
stabilize its banking system, which he said are necessary for a
strong domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
But he said Japan should take further action to address the
problems of its capital-starved banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Summers is in Japan on the last leg of his seven-day five-
nation Asian tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Eduardo dos
Santos has asked his Mozambican counterpart Joaquim Chissano to
continue his efforts in seeking a solution to the Angolan conflict
with relevant parties.
</P>
<P>
Chissano revealed this Thursday evening upon his arrival at the
Maputo air port from Angola, the Noticias newspaper reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos also hopes that Mozambique supports Angola's stand
that Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), is a war criminal, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, the Angolan president noted that
Angola's goal in the military sphere should be supported, so that
the government could continue to dialog with other oppositions
including the splinter UNITA Renovation Committee.
</P>
<P>
On the possibility of military intervention to the Angolan
conflict by the Southern African Development Community (SADC),
Chissano said it has been raised during the SADC summit in
Mauritius last September.
</P>
<P>
The summit had issued resolution, pledging various support to
Angola, including military means.
</P>
<P>
Chissano said Zambian President Frederick Chiluba will soon
preside over a SADC summit on conflicts in the Great Lakes region,
which might also touch on the Angolan issue.
</P>
<P>
On February 21, the Mozambican president started his visit to
several African countries including Zambia, Uganda, Rwanda, the
Democratic Republic of Congo and Angola.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Chissano had held talks with presidents of
the countries, which he said is very helpful to understanding the
regional situation.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice-chairman of SADC reiterated that his visit is
only restricted to information collection, with no mediation
color.

<HEADLINE> BOC Takes Measures to Collect Bad Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China (BOC) will
name 30 large borrowers as its focus to gain repayment of
potentially bad loans in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The BOC has asked eight of its branches, including the
Guangdong Provincial Branch, to give priority to collecting these
loans this year, according to today's People's Daily.
</P>
<P>
The BOC vowed to avoid issuing new questionable loans after
January 1, 1998, but should they occur, the lending branch is
required to take them back within a limited period of time.
</P>
<P>
Each month, the BOC will circulate a notice of criticism on the
ten of its branches having the largest bad-loan balances, and
those whose bad-loan ratios increase the fastest.
</P>
<P>
Job promotions at the branches will be closely related to their
efforts in dealing with bad loans, a BOC official said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a difficult economic environment, the BOC reduced its
bad-loan ratio by 0.39 percentage points in 1998.

WASHINGTON -- U.S. jurors Thursday sentenced John William King
to death for dragging a black man to his death behind a pickup
truck, rejecting tearful pleas from the white racist's sickly
father to spare his life.
</P>
<P>
King, 24, was the first man sentenced to die for killing a
black man in Texas state since the death penalty was reinstated in
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
The 11 white jurors and their elected black foreman took just
under three hours to render the decision, about the same time as
they took to find King guilty earlier in the week. They offered a
few clues to their deliberations, sending out notes asking to see
a 20-centimeter shank found in King's cell as well as racist
letters he sent from prison. (US-Death Sentence)

JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J.
Habibie has agreed to postpone for two weeks the announcement of
banks to be liquidated on recommendations from top government
officials in charge of economic affairs.
</P>
<P>
"There is no pressure from anywhere," Coordinating Minister for
Economy, Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita told
reporters here Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on Thursday which was attended by officials of the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian
Development Bank, the officials formulated the plan which was
later put forward to the head of state, Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement, originally to be made on February 27, was put
off in order to give concerned officials a chance to settle the
issues including business plans and management improvement of a
bank comprehensively.
</P>
<P>
The postponement also aims to allow ailing banks to upgrade
their performance.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar expressed the hope that the postponement will also
bring a better, transparent and accountable decision.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Ginandjar said in Bali that about 96 out of more
than 200 banks in the country are currently insolvent with a
negative net worth of around 40 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia has said that almost 40 ailing banks would
possibly be closed down.
</P>
<P>
Liquidation is a part of the government's measures to reform
the banking sector so that the country will recover from the
prolonged economic crisis.

SEOUL, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Seoul High Court Friday
sentenced former Kia Group Chairman Kim Sun-hong to four years in
prison for making huge cross-payment guarantees to ailing
subsidiaries and embezzling from corporate fund.
</P>
<P>
The court said Kim should be responsible for dealing an
enormous blow to the national economy by causing the eighth
largest South Korean corporation's insolvency in July 1997 with
his incompetent management.
</P>
<P>
A low court at the capital city earlier handed down a seven-
year prison sentence to Kim on the same charges.

<P>
The ex-Kia group leader was indicted last June for providing
payment guarantees for loans worth 2.22 billion U.S. dollars to
four Kia subsidiaries, which then lacked capital, and
misappropriated 42.83 million dollars from corporation coffers.
</P>
<P>
Although the accused insisted the payment guarantees or fund
assistance to affiliates fell within the scope of his management
power, the court ruled that he should take criminal
responsibilities since he breached the authority.

<HEADLINE> Harare City Council Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The beleaguered Harare
Executive Mayor, Councillor Solomon Tawengwa, and the entire city
council have been suspended indefinitely and a commission will be
appointed soon to run the city's affairs, the daily Herald
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The council has been under heavy criticism from all corners,
including rate-payers, politicians and civil society, who felt
that it was failing to deliver essential services.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital, on
Thursday,

Minister of Local Government and National Housing John Nkomo said
he had taken the drastic action to prevent the situation from
deteriorating any further.
</P>
<P>
He said the city had become "unmanageable" which had denied the
city's residents vital services.
</P>
<P>
The move comes in the wake of the city's chronic failure to
provide services, heightened by last October's shortage of water
which left some suburbs dry, and the authority's subsequent
failure to pay its workers salaries and wages.
</P>
<P>
The minister's action follows an interim report by a
ministerial commission of inquiry which confirmed suspicions of
mismanagement in the council. Action on councillor found guilty
of wrong-doing would be taken after presentation of the
commission's full report.
</P>
<P>
The commission to run Harare has been tasked to, among other
things, bring normalcy in the administration of the city,
including raising money to meet Harare's liabilities.
</P>
<P>
On why it had taken so long to deal with the council, the
minister said the only blame he could shoulder was that of not
firing the council early enough, but said until the commission of
inquiry's report was produced, his ministry could not take any
action.

<HEADLINE> Fluoride Concentration in Tanzania's Water too </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A researcher on
environment has appealed to the government of Tanzania to reduce
high concentration of fluoride in the country's drinking water.
</P>
<P>
While other countries are striving to reduce a maximum
guideline value of 1.5 milligram of fluoride per liter of drinking
water, Tanzania has a concentration maximum of eight milligram,
Eli Dahi of the Environmental Development Co-operation, was quoted
by Friday's media reports as saying.
</P>
<P>
Presenting a paper to the seventh annual joint scientific
conference of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR)
Thursday in Arusha, north Tanzania, Dahi said Tanzania is one of
the countries most affected by fluoride, particularly in the Rift
Valley areas which form the fluoride zone.
</P>
<P>
High fluoride concentration in drinking water affects human
bones causing swollen knees, colored teeth and bow-legs and other
problems.
</P>
<P>
The researcher emphasized the need for the country to devise a
strategy and decide what type of technology to use in controlling
fluoride in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
He said the defluorization technology, adopted in Tanzania
since 1990, has produced desired results and the users have shown
interests in it.

<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain and the United States
Thursday threw their weight behind the Southern African
Development Community's (SADC) efforts to end the six month-old
conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), the daily
Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Envoys from Britain and the United States separately met
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in Harare as part of their
countries' efforts to end the conflict which has drawn half a
dozen African countries into war.
</P>
<P>
British Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs
Tony Lloyd told reporters after meeting Mugabe that his country
supported the ongoing peace initiative led by Zimbabwean President
Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain was not imposing a solution to the DRC conflict
which was an African problem, but simply supported and recognized
peace efforts being made by regional countries.
</P>
<P>
The DRC war, he said, was draining resources which could be
used in the education and health sectors of the countries
involved.
</P>
<P>
Lloyd said he had been asked by his Prime Minister Tony Blair
to meet all major players in the DRC conflict.
</P>
<P>
"I have met President Mugabe. We agreed that there is need for
an early ceasefire and negotiated settlement to ensure lasting
peace and prosperity of the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton's special envoy to the Great Lakes,
who is also Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
Howard Wolpe also met Mugabe, as part of his consultations with
all regional leaders involved in the conflict, to find lasting
peace for the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We exchanged information. We exchanged ideas and I
think it was a very helpful exchange."
</P>
<P>
He, however, refused to give details about their discussions.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
invited Russian experts to visit Colorado from mid-December to mid-
January to share warning data on nuclear missile launches caused
by false computer signals, the Pentagon said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Defense Secretary Edward Warner told reporters that
the Russians had not yet formally accepted the offer, which was
presented at a high-level joint security meeting in Moscow last
week.
</P>
<P>
The Russian military is sending a delegation to Washington next
month to discuss the issue and other possible problems that might
be triggered by military computers unable to deal with the
millennium bug, Warner told a briefing about his visit to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
"We received acceptance from them to send a team of specialists
to the United States in the latter part of March in order to
follow up on the set of proposals we made," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin
have agreed to set up a system for the sharing of early-warning
data on missile launches as soon as possible. But no final
decision has been made on that proposal.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Approves Sending Troops to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's parliament approved a
government proposal Thursday to send German troops to join the
peacekeeping forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping declared Monday that Germany
plans to dispatch 5,500 troops to participate in NATO's
peacekeeping operation in the Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During the parliamentary debate on the proposal, most
parliamentarians held that warring parties involved in the Kosovo
crisis were likely to reach a peace agreement eventually, and the
world community should be prepared to send peacekeeping forces
there to monitor the implementation of such an agreement.
</P>
<P>
They also believe Germany, one of the six members of the
Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, should shoulder its
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
If peace cannot be brought to Kosovo, Western Europe will be
lashed by a new wave of refugees, according to these parliamentary
members.
</P>
<P>
Scharping has said that peace will be impossible if no military
means are employed to guarantee the implementation of a peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian authority and the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo
reached an agreement in Rambouillet, France, on substantial
autonomy for Kosovo regarding self-rule but failed to sign any
formal document at the end of their 17-day talks outside Paris.
They are expected to resume talks on March 15.
</P>
<P>
NATO has pledged to send troops to Kosovo if the two sides sign
a peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Study: 2.5-Year Space Between Births Produces Healthy Babies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Spacing your children 2.5
years apart may be ideal for producing healthy, full-term babies,
said a study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
</P>
<P>
The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine and based on 173,205 births in Utah from 1989 to 1996,
found that while having babies too close together can be bad for
the infants' health, having them too far apart may be worse.
</P>
<P>
The study calculated that waiting 18 to 23 months after giving
birth to get pregnant again is best. That works out to about 2.5
years between children.
</P>
<P>
Compared with babies born during the ideal interval, those
whose mothers became pregnant again within six months had a 30 to
40 percent greater chance of producing premature or undersize
babies, the study found.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Insists All Its Members Be Invited at ASEAN-EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A senior Thai official has
said ASEAN has made it clear that all its foreign ministers,
including that of Myanmar, be invited to the ASEAN-EU meeting
scheduled for next month in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
"We have come up with an agreed position, a unanimous position,
that for the ASEAN-EU foreign ministers meeting, which we call the
AEMM, all the foreign ministers of ASEAN must be present," Saroj
Chavanaviraj, permanent secretary of the Thai foreign ministry,
told reporters here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached on the sidelines of a senior
officials' meeting between ASEAN and India held here Thursday,
according to Saroj who participated in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In explaining ASEAN's firm stand, Saroj said: "It has been the
understanding between ASEAN and EU from the very beginning that it
is a bloc-to-bloc meeting."
</P>
<P>
As Myanmar is part of ASEAN, Saroj emphasized, it will not be
ASEAN if not all the ASEAN foreign ministers are present at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Saroj expressed the hope the postponed ASEAN-EU Joint
Cooperation Committee(JCC) meeting can be convened so as to pave
the way for the AEAN-EU foreign ministers' meeting
</P>
<P>
The meeting of JCC, a forum to discuss cooperation projects
between the two groupings along technical lines, was to have been
held in Bangkok last month. But it was postponed reportedly
because EU imposes conditions on Myanmar's participation.
</P>
<P>
This was the second postponement of the meeting, which was to
have been held originally in Bangkok in November 1997. The meeting
had been deferred because of EU's opposition to Myanmar's
participation.
</P>
<P>
Saroj noted that Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, who is
on a European visits in a bid to salvage the ASEAN-EU meeting,
would hold discussions on the problem with Germany that is
assuming the current EU presidency.

<HEADLINE> Penny Hardaway Probable Friday with Bruised Hamstring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A bruised left hamstring is
not expected to keep Orlando Magic star guard Penny Hardaway out
the lineup Friday night against the Indian Pacers, the team said
today.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway banged the leg in Wednesday's loss at Boston. He had
the injury examined today as a precautionary measure and nothing
more than a bruise was evident. The injury is unrelated to the
left calf problems that ended his 1997-98 season on February 13.
</P>
<P>
He was scoreless in 26 minutes against the Celtics, the first
time he went without a point since a five-minute stint on April 19,
1997, in the season finale against the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway underwent knee surgery on December 10, 1997 and was
bothered by the calf thereafter. The injuries and operation
limited him to 19 games last season.
</P>
<P>
The Magic lead the Eastern Conference with a 9-3 record behind
Hardaway, who has averaged 16.1 points, 5.5 rebounds, 5.1 assists
and 2.0 steals.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Planned Bid for 2006 Asiad Sparks Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI)'s planned bid for the 2006 Asian Games has sparked
controversy among the sports federations, the Jakarta Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Tennis Association and the Indonesian Amateur
Boxing Association rejected the idea on Thursday, citing a lack of
funds as the main barrier to staging the quadrennial event.
</P>
<P>
Deputy secretary-general of the tennis association Benny
Mailili was pessimistic that Indonesia would be capable of raising
the funds needed to host the continent's biggest sports event.
</P>
<P>
"Experts predict that our economy will only recover after 2002.
I don't think the government will have enough money to stage the
event four years from 2002," he said.
</P>
<P>
The amateur boxing association's deputy secretary-general
Didiet Soedijoto said he was doubtful that KONI could sell the
event because the economic crisis had lowered Indonesia's buying
power.
</P>
<P>
Both Benny and Didiet agreed that Indonesia must also improve
the performance of its athletes if the country wants to host the
Asiad.
</P>
<P>
"We would have to win medals in 40 percent of the sports
contested at the event. Otherwise we would only succeed as a host,
but not as a participant," Benny said.
</P>
<P>
KONI's plan did receive support from the Indonesian Fencing
Association and the Indonesian Taekwondo Association, which
insisted that the event was worth bidding and believed that the
government and the people would work together to make the Games a
success.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general of the fencing association Soejono said KONI
must begin its six-year preparations for hosting the Asiad.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, India and the United Arab Emirates have also showed
interest in bidding for the 2006 Asiad.
</P>
<P>
KONI deputy chief of athletes development affairs Mohammad
Sarengat said that the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) usually
invites all of its member countries to hear the proposals of Asian
Games bidders.
</P>
<P>
"So far, I haven't heard when OCA will hold such a meeting for
the 2006 Games. It should have taken place during the Asiad last
December," he added.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Hold Population Census in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- After a lapse of 20 years, a
census of population of Sri Lanka is scheduled to be taken in
March 2001, Census Department officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A census has usually to be held every ten years. The last
census was held in 1981. The census in 1991 could not be held due
to the security situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The officials said that the department was already making
preparations for the census. The staff of 1,350 employees would
not be adequate for the purpose. Hence a further 10,000 persons
would be temporarily mobilized.
</P>
<P>
Though the 1991 census could not be held, the Census Department
had kept track of population growth by monitoring births, deaths
and immigration and emigration statistics.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the present population of the country was 18.6
million and its growth rate is 1.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate of growth in recent years suggests that the country's
population is fast aging. Today families have only one or two
children resulting in a reduced population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2031 the population can be expected to be 23.1
million. However, according to a seminar held recently, 25 percent
of the total population will be over the age of 60 by then.
</P>
<P>
Infant mortality per 1,000 births in 1995 was 16.5 down from
22.6 in 1987. Maternal mortality per 1,000 live births was 0.2 in
1995 which is a reduction from 0.6 in 1983.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economists Propose New Strategy to Reduce Unemployment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists and
sociologists recently suggested that the government implement new
policies to curb the rising unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
Writing in the latest Report on National Conditions, released
by the National Conditions Analysis and Research Group under the
Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), experts urged the government to
give full support to the construction of infrastructure facilities
to absorb more urban laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
A larger number of schools, hospitals, highways, bridges, and
water conservation facilities should be built, and more
afforestation, environmental protection and garbage treatment
projects should be launched, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested that the government should establish
a comprehensive social security system including unemployment
benefits, worker's compensation and life insurance, and set up
labor markets and information networks.
</P>
<P>
Recently, "laid-off" has become one of the most frequently used
words in Chinese newspapers, and also the hottest topic among
urban residents.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental way to cope with the unemployment problem is
to develop the economy," said Niu Renliang, a researcher with the
Social Development Research Center under the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences (CASS), "but some special situations should be
attended to."
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that while continuing rapid, sustained and
healthy economic development, China should also give priority to
industries capable of creating more jobs.

<P>
"This depends on implementing certain development policies and
deciding which industries are able to create more job
opportunities," said Dr. Hu Angang, an economist who has been
studied the national economy for many years.
</P>
<P>
He said that China should fully develop the service sector and
other labor-intensive industries in order to continuously create
jobs, and also choose a method of industrialization which relies
on labor resources while saving capital.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hu added, New economic sectors should be developed to
create more job opportunities, and the private sector should be
further enlarged to absorb the surplus workers laid off by state-
owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Many economists say that China may ease the stress of
unemployment by training surplus labor for the future with
training programs for job seekers.
</P>
<P>
Women workers of the childbearing age could enjoy longer
maternity leaves, and workers could be released from work for
study for a certain period of time. These are some of the ideas
proposed by economists as ways to help alleviate the current
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that if each worker enjoys one year of study every
ten years, there will be one million more job opportunities
created in the cities every year.

<HEADLINE> Why China's Gold Production Is Dropping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to produce 175
tons of gold this year, a 1.5 percent increase from last year, in
striking contrast to the 10 percent annual growth rate of the past
quarter century.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shan'en, the deputy-director of the Gold Economic
Development Research Center, says that the drop comes mainly from
a declining demand for gold.
</P>
<P>
For a long time before the 1980s, China had an acute short of
foreign exchange, and gold constituted a major part of those
reserves, accounting for as much as 90 percent in some years. But,
after the reforms and opening up in 1978, China's foreign exchange
reserves increased dramatically and the amount of gold reserves
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
China has 397 tons of gold reserves, which, at current prices,
account for less than 3 percent of the state's more than 140
billion US dollars worth of foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Liu explains that reckless mining was also part of the problem.
In some parts of the country where gold output grew rapidly in
recent years, as much as two thirds of the output came from small
private enterprises, whose backward technology caused waste and
limited production. Last year's 172.8 tons of gold was produced at
1,200 gold mines.

<HEADLINE> Regulations on Qualification of Insurance Staff Issued </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The China Insurance Regulatory
Commission (CIRC) yesterday issued a temporary regulation on the
qualifications of senior management personnel of insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
The first of its kind in China, the document is believed to be
helpful to the standardization and upgrading of the insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the insurance sector had to refer to a People's
Bank of China (PBC) regulation in setting the qualifications of
its senior management personnel.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the PBC's document, the new regulations lay more
stress on the professional experience, is stricter and more
comprehensive in regulating the qualifications of senior foreign
staff, today's China Daily quoted a CIRC official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that senior management personnel in
the insurance sector must have professional knowledge and possess
a strong managerial ability. They must also have a spotless work
record.
</P>
<P>
Senior management staff at the headquarters of insurance
institutions must possess an advanced professional qualification
and, as a minimum, have a bachelor's degree in economics, finance
or related majors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the document has specific stipulations on the period

<HEADLINE> Official Calls for Measures to Ensure Safety in Use of Pressure Cookers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese pressure cooker
manufacturers need to improve safety devices on their products and
maximize security, an official said here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Zhan Yuanchao, deputy secretary-general of the China Consumers
Association (CCA), said a quality inspection at the end of last
year found hidden risks in 24 percent of the pressure cookers
checked, today's China Daily reports.
</P>
<P>
The quality examination was conducted by the CCA and the
Tianjin Consumers Association, and covered 25 major brands.
</P>
<P>
The inspection indicated that some manufacturers were still
following old standards which did not specify requirements for
safety devices.
</P>
<P>
Of the 13 brands of aluminum cookers, only seven fulfilled the
present state safety requirements. Four of the 12 brands of
stainless steel cookers was not up to the standards.
</P>
<P>
Zhang urged sub-standard manufacturers to adopt new quality
standards issued by the government in 1992 for aluminum pressure
cookers and in 1994 for stainless steel ones.
</P>
<P>
CCA statistics show that pressure cooker explosions accounted
for 10 percent of major accidents involving consumer goods last
year.

with rich natural resources, must improve the productivity of its
farmers so that the country can feed not only its own people, but
also those in other countries.
</P>
<P>
"The government should focus on improving the productivity of
farmers, otherwise we may become the world's largest importer of
foodstuffs by early next century," he said in a seminar on
Indonesian food policy in the 21st century hosted by the Center
for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).
</P>
<P>
Dillon noted that Indonesia is already one of the world's
largest wheat importers, bringing in about 4.2 million tons in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The country also imported 500,000 tons of corn, 607,000 tons of
soybeans, and 1.7 million tons of sugar in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia claims to have been self-sufficient in rice, a staple
for most Indonesians, since 1984. However, it has been importing
the commodity since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Prolonged drought which resulted in a sharp drop in domestic
production of rice last year forced the State Logistics Agency to
import 4.6 million tons of rice during the 1998/1999 fiscal year
ending March 31, a 780-percent increase over the 523,776 tons it
imported during the 1997/1998 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Rice consumption for the country's population of more than 200
million is expected to reach over 33 million tons this year. The
country is expected to produce 52 million tons of unhusked rice,
or about 32 million tons of milled rice.
</P>
<P>
Dillon said that the government's past and present agriculture
policies have shown that the government does not have a long-term
view needed to create better policies to increase crop production.
</P>
<P>
He warned the government that the supply of foodstuffs traded
on the world market is very tight, making it very difficult to
rely on imports in the future.
</P>
<P>
"So we have to make all-out efforts to supply ourselves with
sufficient foodstuffs," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday
as saying.

<HEADLINE> Macedonian Territory Must Not be Used to Attack Yugoslavia, President Vows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian territory must not
be used by any military force to commit aggression against
Yugoslavia or its main republic, Serbia, Macedonian President Kiro
Gligorov said in Skopje on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He voiced concerns over the massing of foreign troops in
Macedonia during a meeting with a delegation of ethnic Serbs, the
Albanian telegraph agency quoted the Tanjug news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached by NATO and the new Macedonian
government formed in November last year, NATO will send troops to
Macedonia, which borders the separatist Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
A rapid reaction force has already been deployed in Macedonia
to protect observers from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe. Other troops are being deployed to provide
logistic support to those troops and persons NATO may eventually
deploy in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a U.N. Preventive Deployment Force has been
performing tasks in the country's border areas since 1992.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the president also voiced dissatisfaction with
the country's current ethnic policy, accusing the government of
attaching too much importance to cooperation between ethnic
Macedonians and Albanians while neglecting ethnic minorities,
including Serbs and Montenegrins.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Chinese Capital Gains From Advanced Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Xi'an, capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi Province, recorded a 13.5 percent economic growth
in 1998, thanks to high-tech and tourist development.
</P>
<P>
The High-tech Development Zone of this capital city of ancient
dynasties is one of three major state-level development zones in
China and is linked with the technology and industry park network
of the Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The zone had four 14 billion yuan in profits in technology,
industry, and trade last year, up 36 percent from the previous
year. Its new Sino-foreign projects involve 130 million U.S.
dollars worth of investment, 90 million dollars of which have been
used.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an was the capital of 13 ancient dynasties, so tourism is a
major industry. The city earned 194 million U.S. dollars from
accommoding 480,000 overseas visitors last year and 5.6 billion
yuan from 10 million domestic visitors.
</P>
<P>
Local economists predict that technology and tourism will
maintain their growth in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for Greater Role of Cultural Venues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cultural venues should play a
full role in the advancement of our society, suggested Zhou Heping,
deputy-director for the National Library of China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar organized by Premier Zhu Rongji, Zhou
said that cultural venues such as libraries, museums and art
galleries are essential to enrich the country's culture and
civilization. Libraries, for instance, are places where citizens
can obtain knowledge and information and pursue their life-long
education.
</P>
<P>
He said: "the current situation for cultural venues is far from
meeting the increasing demand from citizens, and the government
should set up a multiple system of investment and invest more to
promote them," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
Zhou pointed out that the construction of a computer network
has achieved a lot while the development of information sources is
relatively slow. "About 90 percent of the information on the
Internet is in English and the scarce information in Chinese is
disproportionate to our long history and current status," Zhou
added.
</P>
<P>
The seminar was held to solicit opinions on the government's
work for the upcoming sessions of both the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee and
the National People's Congress (NPC) this March.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Plan to Eliminate Pirate VCDs Gets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government's
plan to eliminate pirated VCDs nationwide starting from Friday
received a warm welcome from the VCD industry, the Jakarta Post
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
They, however, strongly urged the authorities to first identify
and apprehend major pirates instead of arresting small-scale
traders and rental shop owners.
</P>
<P>
Raiding retail and rental shops would only cause further
unemployment during the economic crisis, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to Hayidrali Muhammad from the working committee of
the Indonesian Corruption Watch of the Foundation of the
Indonesian Legal Aid Institute, the massive operation against
shops selling or renting out pirated VCDs would leave at least
33,000 people jobless.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, suggested the government arrest major pirates.
</P>
<P>
Director of Film and Video Recording Supervision of the
Ministry of Information Suryanto has announced that beginning
Friday, the ministry with the help of the police would carry out a
nationwide operation against producers, distributors, retailers
and renters of pirated VCDs.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources in the industry told the Jakarta Post that
netting major VCD pirates in the capital would not be difficult.
</P>
<P>
"There are only three or four big VCD pirates here. They are
not invisible but just untouchable because of the power of their
money," one source said.
</P>
<P>
These three pirates, the source said, own 85 percent of the
country's total annual production of 17 million copies of pirated
VCDs.

<TEXT>
<P>
The cabinet approved Thursday a draft framework agreement to
allow the transit of NATO forces and provide logistical support if
there is a peacekeeping operation in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Under the draft agreement, each request for the transit of
foreign military forces or their possible sojourn on Bulgarian
territory should be approved by the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers has authorized the country's foreign
and defense ministers to conduct negotiations with NATO and sign
an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Asked if this decision allows for a change in Bulgaria's stand
in case Belgrade refuses to let a peacekeeping force on its
territory, Mihailova said: "We expect both sides to accept the
conditions of the agreements which formed the basis for the
negotiations at Rambouillet. We are considering a scenario where
both sides would agree to sign the agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Bulgaria will allow the transit passage of NATO-led
peacekeeping forces which means that it accepts NATO because NATO
will accept Bulgaria as a member," Mihailova said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria received NATO's draft for an agreement on transit on
February 18. Mihailova said Bulgaria-NATO ties were based on
partnership and voluntary cooperation and not on pressure on
Bulgaria.

MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) Thursday gave the Philippines high remarks for its handling
of the Asian economic contagion and released a loan of 129 million
U.S. dollars, the Journal newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
IMF Deputy Managing Director Alassane D. Quattara was quoted as
saying in a statement that the Philippines made "continued
satisfactory progress in implementing the (IMF) program under
difficulty circumstances."
</P>
<P>
The loan was the third release of a total 1.4 billion-U.S.
dollar precautionary arrangement reached by the IMF and the
Philippines, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF ties each release to compliance to so-called
performance criteria that is reviewed every three months, it said.
</P>
<P>
However, Quattara strongly warned the country that "the outlook
for 1999 is uncertain," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the external situation remains vulnerable,
although it has strengthened in recent months reflecting continued
export growth and return of capital inflows."

<P>
After changing the court, Sun, who is against wind, fought back
and gained an upper hand with delicate placement shots and sudden
attacks. He took the following two games 15-3, 15-4.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese will face Atlanta Olympic gold medalist Poul-Erik
Hoyer-Larsen of Denmark, who outclassed Budi Santoso of Indonesia
12-15, 15-11, 15-6, to decide the winner of men's single Group D.
</P>
<P>
"I'm full of confidence to oust the Dane because I beat him
many times," said Sun.
</P>
<P>
But Sun's teammate Dong Jiong, who won the title at the Bangkok
Asian Games two months ago, suffered a 13-15, 8-15 loss to Yong
Hock Kin of Malaysia. Dong beat the Malaysian in the semifinals at
the Asian Games in straight games.
</P>
<P>
In the other men's singles matches Thursday, pre-favorite
Peter Gade Christensen of Denmark, now ranked first in the world,
was stretched to the full before beating 31-year-old veteran
Rashid Sidek of Malaysia 11-15, 15-11, 15-11.
</P>
<P>
The Dane is going to take on China's Chen Gang, who also booked
the second win in Group A by powering past Thomas Johansson of
Sweden 6-15, 17-16, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
In the women's singles, up-rising talent Zhou Mi of China and
her teammates Dai Yun and Zhang Ning made easy work of Swedes
Karolina Ericsson and Margit Borg and Mette Pedersen of Denmark in
straight games respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kelly Morgan from Wales put up a stiff fight before defeating
Japan's Yasuko Mizui 4-11, 11-7, 11-5.

UNITED NATIONS -- China on Thursday voted against a draft
resolution which proposes the extension of the mandate of the
United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP), saying that
the U.N. peacekeeping operations, including the preventive
missions, "should not be open-ended."
</P>
<P>
In explaining the Chinese stand after the vote, Qin Huasun,
Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations, said, "We
have always maintained that U.N. peacekeeping operations,
including preventive deployment missions, should not be open-ended.
"
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to further extend the mandate of UNPREDEP,"
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, also one of the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, abstained from voting on the draft resolution.
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, said that the draft excluded UNPREDEP's such main tasks
as monitoring illegal arms smuggling in the region. (UN-China-

CAIRO -- The Arab League on Thursday condemned the continued

</P>
<P>
Ahmed Ben Hali, the league's assistant secretary general, told
reporters that the Arab League "condemns and denounces the
continued military operations" in Iraq by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Ben Hali made the remarks after a meeting with Iraqi Permanent
Delegate to the Arab League Sultan al Shawy, who briefed the
league official the latest developments in his country.
</P>
<P>
The league official called for the lifting of the no-fly zones
in the north and south of Iraq, arguing that they were "imposed by
a unilateral decision" by the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The two Western powers, supported by France, imposed the no-
fly zones after the 1991 Gulf War, which drove Iraqi troops out of
Kuwait, to allegedly protect the Kurdish ethnic minorities in the
north and the Shiite Muslims in the south. (Arab League-Iraq-US

WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon said on Thursday that the Yugoslav

Yugoslavia may be preparing for a military push against ethnic
Albanian guerrillas before a March 15 deadline for a second round
of talks.
</P>
<P>
Bacon estimated the force on Kosovo's north and northeast
border at 4,500 troops, more than 60 tanks, about 50 armored
personnel carriers and about 60 artillery pieces. He said about 1,
500 border guards with 70 tanks were deployed inside Kosovo now,
with twice that force in garrisons inside the province. (US-

JAKARTA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Bank Indonesia Thursday
announced that its net international reserves dropped by 414.3
million U.S. dollars to 14.84 billion dollars as of February 23
from the February 15 level of 15.25 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decrease was due to the repayment of part of the
government's foreign debt and the payment of a quarterly
contribution to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the central
bank was quoted by the Jakarta Post Friday as saying.
</P>
<P>
It added that net reserves remained above the minimum level of
11.19 billion dollars set by the IMF.
</P>

Bank Indonesia also reported that gross foreign exchange
reserves, which include net foreign exchange reserves plus
outstanding contracts, fell by 416.9 million dollars to 24.36

<HEADLINE> Owen: I'll Stay in Liverpool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Soccer star Michael Owen
insisted Thursday that despite being flattered to be linked with
Italian giants Lazio, he would be staying with Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
The England star believes Anfield boss Gerard Houllier will
bring the good times back to Liverpool, and he ridiculed claims
that he has any interest in a supposed 25 million pounds move to
Italy.
</P>
<P>
Owen, who signed a new contract earlier this season that will
keep him at Anfield until he is 24, said: "Obviously it is
flattering to be linked with a club like Lazio but I'm still very
happy at Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
"The gaffer has got a good thing going at this club. We are
building a lot for the future and I think in the next few years we
will really start challenging for the title. I want to be part of
that, " he said.
</P>
<P>
Liverpool instantly denied that there was any truth in the
rumours when Owen's name was linked with Lazio in the Italian
media on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
And the 19-year-old added: "I'm staying at Anfield. I don't
know where this story came from, I have certainly never heard
anything about it.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously people are going to think there is something in it
because they will have heard stories about Lazio having first
refusal on me. But that's not true either.
</P>
<P>
"I even saw something saying my dad had gone over to Italy. My
dad would never do a deal for me. He just stays in the background
and watches my progress. It wasn't very nice to read that."

<HEADLINE> Bergkamp Joins Chorus for Winter Break Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Dennis Bergkamp joined the
chorus to call for a mid-winter break in the English Premier
League after admitting on Thursday his disappointing form earlier
this season was due to mental and physical exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
The Arsenal striker, who scored an outstanding goal in his side'
s 2-1 win over Sheffield United in their F.A. Cup fifth round
match on Tuesday, has only just started to re-discover the sort of
form that last season earned him the English Footballer of the
Year crown.
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp claimed that the intensity of last season when Arsenal
won the Cup and League double and his exertions for the
Netherlands in the World Cup, followed by just a short break
before this season began, left him physically and mentally
exhausted.
</P>
<P>
"I feel great now. Mentally I am really up for it and
physically, I'm feeling 100 per cent.
</P>
<P>
"But it's been a long time since I've felt like that.
</P>
<P>
"The problem here is that we don't have a break. In every other
country they have a break during the winter for two or three weeks,
but we don't have it here in England.
</P>
<P>
"It's very difficult when you can't reload your batteries for
the second half of the season."
</P>
<P>
Bergkamp's comments echo those made by Arsenal captain Tony
Adams at the beginning of the week and also the feelings expressed
by some of soccer's great former players at a think-tank in
Switzerland on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Adams admitted a Christmas break would benefit English football
while the likes of Michel Platini called for a Europe-wide mid-
winter break to help players recover from the stresses and strains
of the first half of the season.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov Moves Closer to World Top Spot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia is
one match away to take the world top spot with a straight victory
over Byron Black in the London Indoor tennis tournament on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His 6-3, 6-2 victory over the Zimbabwean earned the Australian
Open champion a quarter-final clash with Thomas Johansson, and
victory there will see Kafelnikov topple Pete Sampras from the
number one place in the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
Sampras has spent a total of 260 weeks at number one and is
gunning for Ivan Lendl's record of 270, but Kafelnikov is in
irrepressible form and determined to become Russia's first world
number one tennis player.
</P>
<P>
A break to love in the second game of his second round match
against Black was all he needed as he went on to claim the first
set 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Scorching groundstrokes, especially from the backhand wing,
kept the 31st-ranked Black scurrying around the court and he was
always under pressure to hold his serve in the second set.
</P>
<P>
Taking the returns almost on the half-volley at times,
Kafelnikov exploited the angles leaving Black -- double-fisted on
both sides -- lunging for everything.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov broke in the first game of the second set and again
in the fifth game for 4-1 before comfortable serving out 6-2 after
63 minutes of play.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Greg Rusedski beat former Australian Open champion
Petr Korda for a place in the quarters against Thomas Enqvist.
</P>
<P>
A single break in the first set saw the British world number 10
take the opening set 6-3. Nothing could separate the two in the
second and Rusedski ended up taking it 7-4 in a tie-break.
</P>
<P>
Fifth seed Karol Kucera of Slovakia coasted through his second-
round match against France's Guillaume Raoux 6-2, 6-0. He plays
Dutch fourth seed Richard Krajicek in the quarter-finals.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on the day, eighth-seeded Swede Johansson booked his
quarter-final spot with a 6-0, 6-7, 6-2 victory over Davide
Sanguinetti.
</P>
<P>
The Italian started off very slowly but found his range in the
second set and came back from 3-1 down in the tiebreak to take it
7-3.
</P>
<P>
Johansson hadn't won a match since last November before coming
to London but upped his game in the third.
</P>
<P>
And as soon as Sanguinetti had found his form, it deserted him
as Johansson reeled off the final set 6-2.

<HEADLINE> U.S. White Supremacist Sentenced to Death for Murder of Black </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Jurors Thursday
sentenced John William King to die for dragging a black man to his
death behind a pickup truck, rejecting tearful pleas from the
white racist's sickly father to spare his life.
</P>
<P>
King, 24, was the first man sentenced to die for killing a
black man in Texas State in the U.S. since the death penalty was
reinstated in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
The 11 white jurors and their elected black foreman took just
under three hours to render the decision, about the same time as
they took to find King guilty earlier in the week. They offered a
few clues to their deliberations, sending out notes asking to see
a 20-centimeter shank found in King's cell as well as racist
letters he sent from prison.
</P>
<P>
Jurors convicted King of capital murder Tuesday in the death of
James Byrd Jr. last June. After the sentencing decision was read
Thursday, Byrd's family members wiped their eyes but declined
state District Judge Joe Bob Golden's offer to address King.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors asked for the maximum punishment, saying King would
be a menace even behind bars.
</P>
<P>
"By giving Mr. King a life sentence, you're giving him at least
40 years to catch a black guard, a black nurse, a black doctor, a
Jewish guard, a Jewish nurse, a Jewish doctor, or anybody else,"
prosecutor Pat Hardy told the jury, "You're giving him a chance to
catch anybody... who doesn't believe in his satanic, racist views.
"
</P>
<P>
Only one white man has ever been executed in Texas for killing
a black -- a farmer who killed another white farmer's favorite
slave in the 1850s, according to research by a University of
Florida professor published in The Sociological Quarterly in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, eight whites have been executed for killing blacks
since the resumption of the death penalty more than two decades
ago. Conversely, 124 blacks have been put to death for killing
whites, according to the Death Penalty Information Center in
Washington.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Existing Homes Sales Hit Record High in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes in
the United States climbed to a record level in January despite a
modest rise in mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Realtors said in a survey Thursday
that existing single-family-home sales rose 0.8 percent to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.07 million last month. Sales
had been up 3.1 percent in December, capping the best year in the
resale market in history.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Freddie Mac, the mortgage company, reported 30-year
mortgages averaged 6.79 percent in January, up from a 6.74 percent
average in December but still below the 6.99 average for 30-year
mortgages a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The company said that rates rose again this week, the fourth
consecutive weekly increase. Thirty-year fixed rate mortgages
climbed to 6.89 percent, up from 6.82 percent last week. That was
the highest rate since mid-November of last year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said that rising mortgage rates are likely to put
a crimp in the boom in housing sales but they predicted sales will
remain strong at least for the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Economists said some of the demand in January probably
reflected a carryover of momentum from last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales activity was strong in most regions in January, led by a
5.9 percent surge in the Northeast, which pushed sales to an
annual rate in that region of 720,000 units.
</P>
<P>
In the West, sales climbed 1.9 percent to an annual rate of 1.1
million units, while sales held steady in the South at a high rate
of 1.97 million units.
</P>
<P>
The only region of the country suffering a drop in activity was
the Midwest, where sales edged down 1.5 percent in January to an
annual rate of 1.28 million units.
</P>
<P>
The national median price for a single-family home sold in
January was 131,700, up 4.4 percent from a year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
Thursday for the second day in a row as investors feared a
possible rising in interest rates after the fresh news about
strong U.S. economic performance came in.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 9,366.34, down
33.33, extending a loss of 144.75 points Wednesday. The technology
heavy Nasdaq was down 12.56 at 2,326.82 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was off 8.39 at 1,245.02.
</P>
<P>
The indexes plunged after the U.S. Commerce Department reported
that demand for durable goods shot up at the fastest pace in 14
months and sales of existing homes climbed to an all-time high in
January. The report gave investors more evidence that the Federal
Reserve may soon raise interest rates to slow the economy.
</P>
<P>
Federal Reserve Chairman Allan Greenspan indicated in his two
days of testimony to Congress earlier that the Fed foresees a slow
of the U.S. economic growth to between 2.5 percent and 3 percent
this year from 3.9 percent last year. If the slowdown does not
happen, the Fed will be ready to raise interest rates to cool off
the economy, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
Other major indexes were also lower. The NYSE index was down
4.14 at 587.43 and the American Stock Exchange index was down 2.32
to 693.47.
</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 2.59 at

<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Romania will launch in early
March a program to support small and medium-sized enterprises in
marketing and boosting exports, the national Rompres news agency
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The program, launched under the coordination of the National
Agency for Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises, will partially
finance by non-repayable credits expenditure necessary for the
enterprises to participate in domestic and foreign fairs and
exhibitions, for advertising, marketing training and access to
market information.
</P>
<P>
The uppermost limit of the financial aid granted to a company
is established by adding a co-financing quota of maximum 50
percent of the total costs, but it will not exceed 40 million
lei (about 3,100 U.S. dollars). A company can benefit from such
funds only once.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises that may apply for this program must have fully
private share capital, have been operational for at least two
years, and do not produce or trade products or carry out services
that could endanger the life of consumers or environmental
security.

<HEADLINE> China Votes against Renewal of U.N. Force in Macedonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China on Thursday voted
against a draft resolution which proposes the extension of the mandate
of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP),
saying that the U.N. peacekeeping operations, including the
preventive missions, "should not be open-ended."
</P>
<P>
In explaining the Chinese stand after the vote, Qin Huasun,
Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations, said, "We
have always maintained that U.N. peacekeeping operations,
including preventive deployment missions, should not be
open-ended."
</P>
<P>
"There is no need to further extend the mandate of UNPREDEP,"
Qin said.
</P>
<P>
Russia, also one of the five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council, abstained from voting on the draft resolution.
Sergey Lavrov, Russian permanent representative to the United
Nations, said that the draft excluded UNPREDEP's such main tasks
as monitoring illegal arms smuggling in the region.
</P>
<P>
China sees it unnecessary for the mandate renewal because the
situation in Macedonia "has apparently stabilized in the past few
years, its relations with neighboring countries have been
improved," Qin said, adding that peace and stability in
Macedonia "has not been adversely affected by developments in
that region."
</P>
<P>
Besides, "Africa and some other regions are still plagued by
conflict and instability, and need more attention and
contribution from the U.N.," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the current financial difficulties of the U.N., it
would be neither reasonable nor fair to continue to assess Member
States for UNPREDEP," he said. "The already insufficient resources
of the U.N. should be used where most needed."
</P>
<P>
"UNPREDEP has contributed to the maintenance of a stable
situation in FRYOM (the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia),"
Qin said, "China highly evaluated the contributions by the (U.N.)
Secretary-General and others including troop-contributors of
UNPREDEP."
</P>
<P>
UNPREDEP was sent into Macedonia under a 1992 Security
Council resolution to deter threats and prevent clashes, monitor
the border areas against illegal arms smuggling.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council on the question of
UNPREDEP, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, "It is a matter
of satisfaction that, until now, the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia has not been adversely affected by the conflict in
Kosovo," the Serbian province in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "the bilateral relations of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia with some of its neighbors have
strengthened," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Although smuggling incidents have been observed, UNPREDEP
has so far not detected any direct evidence of arms smuggling
across the borders of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
with Albania or the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," Annan
added.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urged to Upgrade Iraq's Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council was urged Thursday to find new ways to raise
Iraq's oil production to meet the basic humanitarian needs of
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Benon Sevan, U.N. head of the Iraq "oil-for-food" program, told
the Security Council Thursday morning that the program was back to
square one due to low oil prices and the poor state of Iraq's oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for the Council and governments concerned to start
looking for alternative methods of financing the requirements for
the oil industry in Iraq in order to be able to increase their
output and exports as speedily as possible. Otherwise there is no
way this program can continue the way it is," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Council last November allowed Iraq to sell 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars worth of oil over six months to buy food, medicine and
other necessities for its people.
</P>
<P>
Sevan said this sum was supposed to yield some 3.4 billion
dollars for the humanitarian program, and less than 3 billion in
total oil revenues were now expected, which would yield only 1.8
billion for the humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
"We have to take some bold decisions," Sevan said, adding that
was up to the Council to decide.

<HEADLINE> Financial Services Trade Important to U.S. Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The financial services trade
surplus in the United States grew steadily during the last decade,
an industry source said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus reached a record 4.3 billion U.S. dollar level in
1997, said U.S. Securities Industry Association (SIA) President
Mark Lackritz, citing the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
"The international business of American securities firms,
insurance companies, and banks is increasingly important to the
U.S. economy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-based securities firms raised more than 3.4 trillion
dollars in capital for business and government, which roughly
equals 40 percent of the U.S. economy, Lackritz said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. holdings of foreign securities reached a record 1.3
trillion dollars by the third quarter 1998 while foreign holdings
of U.S. securities climbed to a record 3.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
As access to foreign markets grew, so too have financial
services jobs in underwriting, portfolio management, research,
securities trading and technology, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lackritz made the remarks in a letter sent to the U.S. Treasury
Department, appealing for more efforts to gain final commitments
from 17 countries which have yet to sign the world financial
services trade pact before the March 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
The trade agreement was reached in December 1997.

<HEADLINE> UK Cautions U.S. Against Arming Iraqi Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain Thursday cautioned
the United States against giving military backing to the Iraqi
opposition, which, instead, should take the "educative" role to
influence world opinion against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office Minister Derek Fatchett, who was in
Washington for talks with U.S. officials, told reporters that the
Iraqi opposition had a political task, which he said could help
"shape the climate outside and that can possibly play back into
Iraq." But that task did not include "bringing Saddam Hussein down
from outside," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We must be realistic about their ambitions," Fatchett said.
</P>
<P>
He explained what the educative role meant, saying it was to
remind the world constantly of what Saddam has done to his people
and to demonstrate that there is an alternative to his leadership.
</P>
<P>
Britain, the closest U.S. ally in its tough policy toward Iraq,
here was keeping some distance with the United States, which
advocated containment plus regime changes by Iraqi opposition
groups inside or outside Iraq, armed with U.S. military aid.
</P>
<P>
Last October, President Bill Clinton, pressed by Congress,
signed the Iraqi Liberation Act, under which the U.S. government
is authorized, but not obliged, to spend 93 million dollars on
military aid for Saddam's foes with an aim of ousting him.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett's remarks, however, complemented those of some senior
military and diplomatic officials in Washington, who fear direct
military backing for groups inside Iraq would be ineffective and
would alarm other states in the region.
</P>
<P>
Marine Gen. Anthony Zinni, the top U.S. commander in the Gulf,
last month upset many congressional hawks when he told a Senate
hearing: "I don't see an opposition group that has the viability
to overthrow Saddam at this point."
</P>
<P>
Zinni, commander-in-chief of U.S. Central Command, opposed
direct backing for any uprising by the opposition groups inside
Iraq, saying: "I think it would be very difficult and, if not done
properly, would be very dangerous."
</P>
<P>
But Congress, driving the effort to arm the opposition, was
continuing to press the Clinton administration for quicker
action. Ben Gilman, chairman of the House International Relations
Committee, noted Wednesday that of a total of more than 110
million dollar aid authorized to back the Iraqi opposition groups,
only 58,000 dollars had been spent.
</P>
<P>
This "appears to suggest this administration has not been
giving serious attention to replacing Saddam Hussein," he said
during a hearing with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Yugoslav Troops Moving to Kosovo Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon said on
Thursday that the Yugoslav army had moved 4,500 troops, more
than 60 tanks and other heavy equipment to the border of Kosovo,
backing up forces already inside the province.
</P>
<P>
"We don't know why they have moved these troops or exactly
what they plan to do with the troops which they have marshaled
around the border of Kosovo," Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
A senior NATO official at the Hague said on Wednesday that
Yugoslavia may be preparing for a military push against ethnic
Albanian guerrillas before a March 15 deadline for a second
round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Bacon estimated the force on Kosovo's north and northeast
border at 4,500 troops, more than 60 tanks, about 50 armored
personnel carriers and about 60 artillery pieces. He said about
1,500 border guards with 70 tanks were deployed inside Kosovo
now, with twice that force in garrisons inside the province.
</P>
<P>
"What is most important is that the troops show restraint. It
is the conduct of the troops which is much more important than
the number of the troops at this stage," he said.

<HEADLINE> Europe's Largest Money Launderer Sentenced to 14 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A man named Ussama El-Kurd was
sentenced to 14 years in prison and fined 1 million pounds (1.6
million U.S. dollars) Thursday in London for masterminding
Europe's largest money laundering operation.
</P>
<P>
Another middle man in the enterprise, Peter McGuinness, who
disappeared during the trial, was sentenced to 10 years in his
absence.
</P>
<P>
British customs officers said El-Kurd laundered proceeds of
crime worth around 70 million pounds (112 million U.S. dollars)
through a money-changing bureau he owned in west London.
</P>
<P>
Customs said the cash came directly from major organized
criminal activity and was made up of used low-denomination
sterling notes.
</P>
<P>
Many of the notes were issued in Scotland and Northern Ireland,
showing that the money came from organized crime throughout
Britain, customs said.

<HEADLINE> Carter Confident of Nigeria's Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President Jimmy
Carter Thursday predicted that Saturday's presidential election
will be the best of all the elections held so far under Nigeria's
on-going transition program.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Carter who arrived in
capital Abuja Thursday spoke glowingly of a "deep commitment to
the process of democratization" among Nigerians including the
military.
</P>
<P>
"My belief is that the overwhelming number of powerful military
leaders in this country are committed to the process of a transfer
of power to a civilian government," noted the former U.S.
president who is leading a joint U.S. observers team from the
Carter Center and National Democratic Institute.
</P>
<P>
Carter declared total confidence in Nigerian Head of State
General Abdulsalami Abubakar's dedication to the proper conduct of
the Saturday poll.
</P>
<P>
However, he expressed fears of possible voting irregularities
as his observers have witnessed in the National Assembly election
on February 20.
</P>
<P>
He sent a letter to both presidential candidates of the
People's Democratic Party (PDP) and the All People's Party (APP),
urging them to conduct a fair election on February 27.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of the Independent National Electoral
Committee Justice Ephraim Akpata Thursday ordered the cancellation
of Thursday night's presidential debate between General Olusegun
Obasanjo and Chief Olu Falae.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the debate would be wrong at that time as it is
against the electoral law, adding that it is clear one of the
candidates has declined to attend.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that the committee has received 60 million
ballot papers printed in Europe and it will be helpful to the
committee if many voters turn out on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 40 million people are expected to cast their
ballots in the presidential election, the last key poll in the
nation's return to democracy.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday called on the parties in East Timor to
create an environment favorable to talks for the island's
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"He continues to urge peace and calm especially at a time when
the political process is advancing in a positive direction," U.N.
spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General believes that continued violence would be
disruptive to that progress, Manoel said.
</P>
<P>
He said Annan is "very disturbed" by the latest reports of
violence in East Timor. One pro-independence student was reportedly
killed and several others were injured.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with 800,000 inhabitants and an area of 15,000
square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
Indonesia annexed it in 1976. The United Nations has since been
making efforts for a "just and comprehensive" solution to the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mediated talks between Indonesia and Portugal on East
Timor's status are scheduled to resume in New York on March 9-10.
The two parties have recently removed several differences over an
autonomy package.
