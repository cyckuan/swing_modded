 (For use by New York Time News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ Considering what time o year it is, Jeff Bagwell
has been noticeably quiet.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His bat has been doing all the talking instead.
</P>
<P>
   Spring training is generally the worst six weeks of the year for
Bagwell, a habitually slow starter who annually proclaims himself
``the worst player in camp.'' But through the early portion of this
season's exhibition schedule, he would have trouble selling that
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's on hold. Don't count me out yet,'' said Bagwell, who hit
a two-run homer Monday against the Los Angeles Dodgers to raise his
spring batting average to .500. ``It's still early.''
</P>
<P>
   Just why is Bagwell putting up numbers normally reserved for the
year's hotter months?
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell, set to turn 31 in May, said maturity has given him a
better understanding of hitting. The added experience, a lack of
consistency last season and the realization that his crouching,
wide-open, hands-low trademark batting stance is, well, difficult,
led him to the idea of slightly altering his swing.
</P>
<P>
   As the regular season draws nearer, he says it's still a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked a lot harder than I have in a long time at my swing _
not that I didn't work hard before, but I never tried to make a
change, try and do something a little different,'' Bagwell said.
``So I put more time into it. Maybe that's part of the reason (it's
working). Another part is maturity. I'm getting a little older, so
hopefully I understand how to hit a little better each year.''
</P>
<P>
   The stance has been slightly modified, but it remains vintage
Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   He still squats low in a crouch and holds the bat straight up.
The difference is in the location of his hands, which are now held
at about shoulder level rather than around his belt.
</P>
<P>
   But he is still sending baseballs over fences. To wit: his
crushing opposite-field blast off Darren Dreifort during the third
inning Monday, his second homer of the spring. In six spring games,
Bagwell leads the Astros in average, home runs and RBIs (seven). He
has yet to strike out.
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell said the change is something he talked about with
hitting instructor Tom McCraw and decided to implement during the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody that looks at my swing knows it's difficult,'' Bagwell
said. ``Most people stride forward, and their hands go back. I
stride backward, and my hands go down. I understand my swing. I
understand what you're supposed to do when you hit. As I'm getting
older, it's harder and harder to have that same quickness and being
able to get your bat from around your belt up into a hitting
position. The only way to fix that is try and fix your hands a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would suggest Bagwell needed to tinker with anything after
finishing 1998 with a .304 batting average, 34 home runs and 111
RBIs. But being a perfectionist, Bagwell saw reason to work harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is for me to become a better hitter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, Bagwell's emphasis is on consistency. Last
season, the first baseman got off to one of the slowest starts of
his career, hitting .236 with only seven home runs during the first
two months of the season. He rebounded to hit .337 in June but
dipped to .240 in July before ending the season on a tear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't panic when things weren't going well,'' McCraw said.
``He stayed after it. He's not allergic to work. He realized that
was going to get him out of it, and he worked his behind off.''
</P>
<P>
   During the early part of spring training, Bagwell went high-tech
in his crusade to make an adjustment. Second baseman Craig Biggio
filmed Bagwell hitting against live pitching in the batting cage
and during soft-toss. Bagwell then viewed the tape carefully to
pinpoint any adjustments that needed to be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that did for me was it showed me I can do what I set
out to do,'' Bagwell said. ``I can control my hands a little bit,
try and keep them above my belt. That gives me confidence that the
things I'm doing are going to help me succeed. That's the reason
I'm taking so much extra soft-toss. I've never taken soft-toss in
my life. I need that muscle memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Biggio: ``Basically, you want to be swinging the bat well
and get your swing right in the last week of (camp). As long as
you're making solid contact and hitting the ball, the last week is
when you want to be finding your groove and fine-tuning things for
the season.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of outfielder Moises Alou to a torn anterior cruciate
ligament and the resultant pressure to carry a greater load
offensively played no role in his change, Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we're going to have to step it up a little bit,'' he
said. ``I'm doing this for no other reason than my sanity. I'm sure
there are a lot of people that would love to have the problems I
have. That's not good enough for me. I'm always trying to get
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the calendar reads February or July.

SPENDING BY INSURERS PUSHES ALBANY LOBBYING TO RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ An unsuccessful bid by life insurance companies
to loosen regulations on their industry helped to push spending on
lobbying in the Statehouse to another record last year, according
to a report issued on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, expenditures by lobbying clients increased by 7
percent last year over 1997, to $55 million, the report by the
Temporary State Commission on Lobbying said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Life Insurance Co., in what was believed to be a
record for a lobbying campaign in Albany, poured more than $1.8
million into its effort to change state regulations that restrict
the ability of some life insurance companies from selling off a
partial ownership stake to stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. came in fourth in the
commission's rankings, spending more than $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the insurers was in the top 10 in lobbying
expenditures in 1997, the commission's records showed.
</P>
<P>
   The two insurance companies, as well as some smaller rivals and
an industry trade group, were lobbying last year in support of
insurance legislation proposed by Gov. George Pataki. The bill died
after opposition by the Democratic majority in the State Assembly,
which contended that it would allow the life insurance companies to
sell stock without adequately compensating insurance policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Werfelman, a vice president at New York Life, said a
sizable part of its lobbying expenses went for advocacy
advertisements intended to muster public support for the
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safe to assume that this was a special circumstance for
New York Life,'' Werfelman said, noting that the company was no
longer pursuing the legislation and expected its lobbying expenses
to plummet this year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the spurt in spending by the life insurance industry,
the report by the commission showed that health care groups, trade
associations, labor unions and banks continued to dominate spending
on lobbying, which has generally risen at more than the rate of
inflation over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
   The figures without a doubt underestimated the efforts to
influence the state government, largely because the definition of
what constitutes lobbying is hazy. Some clients choose to report
rigorously any spending relating to the state government, including
money allocated for items that might also be considered public
relations or legal work. Others hew to a less strict definition.
Moreover, under the law, clients do not have to report expenditures
for lobbying on state contracts.
</P>
<P>
   And the report on Monday did not mention the other weapon in the
arsenal of interest groups: campaign contributions. For example,
the state teachers' union, which perennially is in the top five in
lobbying expenditures, has given roughly $300,000 a year since 1995
to the campaign committees run by the legislative leaders. That is
on top of an annual average of $650,000 that the union has spent on
lobbying, state records showed.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1997, the top two lobbying firms were Wilson, Elser,
Moskowitz, Edelman &AMP; Dicker, whose chief lobbyist is Kenneth
Shapiro, a former senior aide to the Assembly Democrats, and
Davidoff &AMP; Malito, whose activities in Albany are led by Robert
Malito, who has close ties to the Republican majority in the State
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Both firms are also major campaign contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest increase in business was reported by Albert J. Pirro
Jr., whose lobbying fees rose 53 percent, to more than $550,000.
Pirro, the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County
district attorney, was indicted last month on federal tax charges.
He has pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   As lobbying commission members released the report, they once
again requested that the Legislature tighten the state's lobbying
rules, a call that was echoed by a coalition of advocacy groups.
</P>
<P>
   The law authorizing the commission expires this year, but
lawmakers have repeatedly rebuffed proposals to give the commission
permanent status and more enforcement power, and to require
lobbyists to disclose more information about their activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ask our state leaders to act favorably upon our legislative
proposals,'' said the panel's chairman, Bartley F. Livolsi, ``so
that the commission can cross the bridge into the next millennium
equipped and prepared to monitor 21st-century lobbying.''

AFRICANIZED BEES FOUND IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The killer bees are here.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of a swarm of Africanized honeybees in an oak tree
in Calabasas west of Los Angeles makes it official: The San
Fernando Valley is now officially colonized by the killer bees, Los
Angeles County agriculture officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement means that 40 percent of Los Angeles County _
1,668 miles _ is now colonized by the fierce hybrid bee responsible
for five deaths in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Commissioner Cato Fiksdal said there is no cause for
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual bees are not a problem,'' he said. ``It's only the
hive. They only attack when they've established a hive and you
disturb their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the best defense when attacked by a swarm of
killer bees is a good set of legs. Cover your head, mouth and eyes
and run to the nearest enclosed area where the bees can be locked
out. If there is no cover, be prepared to run for up to a
quarter-mile before the killer bees relent.
</P>
<P>
   African honeybees escaped from a Brazilian agriculture research
station in 1957 and began breeding with more docile European
honeybees. The result: Africanized honeybees, a fierce hybrid that
aggressively defends its territory and spawns new colonies at up to
four times the rate of its European cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The bees were discovered in the south Los Angeles community of
Lawndale on Nov. 28. Since then, agriculture officials have tracked
their rapid advance across the county. Their arrival in the San
Fernando Valley was expected.
</P>
<P>
   On March 5, a gardener found a swarm of bees in an oak tree in
Calabasas and called the Los Angeles County West Vector Control
District. A DNA test confirmed the colony was Africanized
honeybees.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery added an additional 658 miles to the areas of the
county already colonized by killer bees. Fiksdal said he made an
official announcement Monday ``to put residents on a little bit of
heightened awareness.''

KNICKS DEFEAT BUCKS, 108-102 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SELINA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE _ Latrell Sprewell is the new guy. He doesn't have
enough history with Jeff Van Gundy to pour out his soul for his
coach nor enough time with his teammates to understand their bond
with him.
</P>
<P>
   But Sprewell knew the New York Knicks needed this game on Monday
night. They needed it to feel better about themselves after their
image was smeared by a debacle in Chicago on Friday and to rid
themselves of a five-game losing streak on the road.
</P>
<P>
   So Sprewell had the solution. He treated this like a home game.
He woke up in his hometown on Monday and felt comfortable in his
surroundings. Setting out on his smoothest performance yet, he
found partners for his jitterbug style as the Knicks followed his
season-high 28-point lead on their way to a 108-102 victory over
the Milwaukee Bucks at the Bradley Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spree got to sleep in his own bed; that's what it was,'' Chris
Childs said. ``I just want to know when he's going to invite us to
his house to eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever home cooking Sprewell received, it was nourishment for
the whole team. He finally looked to be fitting in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out with the mental intensity, the drive and fire,''
said Larry Johnson, who scored 21 points and hit two clinching free
throws. ``It's something to build on. To be honest, it was the
Chicago game that pushed us. We understand that if we don't come
ready to play what can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the Knicks' franchise-low effort in Chicago
included a televised report that Van Gundy's job was on the line.
But Van Gundy did not seem the slightest bit ruffled, worn or
sleep-deprived from his long Sunday. He had weathered another
unstable day in a market titillated by the drama of a coach's head
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   The same coach who had struggled to motivate his players on the
road looked on as the inspired Knicks responded. There would be no
giving in, giving out or giving up the loose ball. Allan Houston
took to driving toward the basket and found 22 points. Chris Dudley
took over the paint and grabbed 11 rebounds and came up with a tap
or two to keep the ball alive for the Knicks (13-9) as the Bucks
(12-8) were drawing close in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks led, 84-73, at the end of the third quarter. But then
Ray Allen began to take charge and barge through the Knicks'
interior defense, drawing fouls and picking up points. With Allen
leading a 6-0 run, the Knicks' lead was just 84-79 with 9 minutes
56 seconds left in the game. A couple of forceful moves by Houston
and Sprewell, and the Knicks built a 10-point lead again with six
minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   The road issues were behind Van Gundy for a night, and so was
any talk of his imminent doom. It did not matter whether the Knicks
had issued Van Gundy an ultimatum of win or else before the team
played Charlotte on Sunday night. Although team executives
vehemently denied that the report, which was on NBC, had any basis,
the story was out there. And when a coach is coming off the shame
of losing in franchise-low fashion to the dismantled Chicago Bulls,
once the speculation is dangled, it might as well be true.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Van Gundy was still on the job. Those close to
him, however, wondered privately if there will come a time when he
grows weary of the market and the Knicks' corporate team structure
and decides to depart on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a decision Van Gundy is said to be contemplating
now. But he does wonder about the perils of working in New York.
Only there, after three years as the head coach, can a horrific
loss on Friday and an 11-9 record entering Sunday's game become
fodder for his firing. Is it worth it to coach in New York?
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what, that's a great question,'' Van Gundy said
before Monday tonight's game. ``I've thought about that. But you
know what, in some ways, you can always point out the bad in a big
market, in the New York market. Scrutiny is going to be there. But
there are so many more good things about it. I do believe I was
given a lot of credit the last three years. If I'm going to accept
that, then I have to accept the criticism when it's not going as
well. I deserved that and the team deserved criticism after that
Chicago game, and rightfully so. Now, you could then ask yourself
whether that meant my job should be on the line.''

CITYHOOD STUDY A GO FOR L.A.'S SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL COIT and DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The San Fernando Valley cityhood push reached a
major milestone when election officials certified petitions calling
for an unprecedented study of breaking up Los Angeles and creating
an independent Valley city.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County officials reported Monday that Valley Voters
Organized Toward Empowerment's signature tally topped the required
25 percent of registered Valley voters by just 719 votes. Valley
VOTE turned in 202,514 signatures and needed 131,771 to be valid,
said county Registrar-Recorder Conny McCormack.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marks a critical victory for the group that has
gotten state laws changed and overcome other obstacles to get the
Local Agency Formation Commission to conduct the study that could
lead to a citywide vote by November 2000 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Many obstacles remain, particularly whether the city, county and
state will fund the $1.8 million to $2.6 million study to determine
how secession would work and what the assets and liabilities would
be of a Valley city, potentially the nation's sixth-largest with
1.3 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was probably the hardest part. Certainly the vote is
going to be difficult too, but this was monstrous,'' said Jeff
Brain, Valley VOTE president. ``To get 25 percent of the voting
public to sign a petition is incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   The group fell short in a sample count because of 24 duplicate
signatures that penalized it more than 25,000 under election rules.
It was still short when the full count was completed comparing
petition signatures with voter registration records. But a final
review validated enough signatures, although 15,807 duplicates were
found, McCormack said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent a tremendous amount of extra effort on it, as we do
whenever it's close. That's not unusual,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the LAFCO
committee leading the study, said the signature drive's success
goes far beyond the work needed to place a regular initiative, or
even a state constitutional amendment, on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky declined to speculate on the fate of secession, but
said the petition drive validates a widespread desire to bring the
distant workings of government to a neighborhood level.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want safer streets, they want control of parks, of
schools. People are looking for local control, and the secession
movement in the Valley is an answer to this legitimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE leaders took a moment to celebrate during the
group's board meeting Monday and then resumed planning for the
study of city finances and potential obstacles that remain.
</P>
<P>
   LAFCO still has to find the money to pay consultants to complete
the study. Valley VOTE and city representatives are expected to
contest many issues used to determine the impact of secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work has only just begun,'' said Richard Close, Valley
VOTE board chairman. ``We're going to work with LAFCO to make sure
that it's comprehensive and fair and to make sure the Valley gets
its fair share.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the signatures have qualified, public officials are
bound to proceed seriously with the study, Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the dynamic changed as of this morning,'' he said.
``Everyone involved in this process has to step back and make this
process work. It would be folly for any of us, the city, county or
state, to surreptitiously or otherwise try to frustrate the public
will.''
</P>
<P>
   State law requires that the comprehensive analysis identify the
new city's costs of providing public services and facilities, and
its revenues during the three fiscal years following incorporation.
</P>
<P>
   The law grants the commission substantial powers in deciding how
to divide or transfer the city of Los Angeles' assets, bonded
indebtedness, resource rights and employees. The commission might
require that a new city raise additional tax revenues, issue bonds
and make lump-sum payments.
</P>
<P>
   LAFCO officials contend that state law gives little guidance.
They noted that municipal secession has not occurred in California
since Coronado split from San Diego nearly a century ago and said
there is no precedent for such a study.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been done before. Once we decide what process we
use, then we can go forward,'' said Larry Calemine, LAFCO's
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The agency first needs a formal application for detaching the
Valley from Los Angeles and incorporating it as a separate city.
Brain said the application will be submitted within a week by one
or more of Valley VOTE's three ``chief petitioners.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky's committee, however, started preparing for the
study in February. When the committee meets again, likely in April,
it expects Valley VOTE to identify what information from the city
they want analyzed and reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   A critical goal for Yaroslavsky is to get as much cooperation
from the city as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stonewalling strategy by any of us will result in
litigation, which may be inevitable anyway,'' he said. ``Maybe the
public will be best served by having a court, or the Supreme Court,
resolve this.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky said any effort to withhold information also would
further exacerbate the frustrations that led to the secession drive
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more resistance there is, the more it accelerates the
feeling of disenfranchisement that led to this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of voters both in the Valley and the entire city
would have to vote in favor of secession.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread support in the Valley for a cityhood study,
Mayor Richard Riordan remains opposed to secession, said Jessica
Copen, the mayor's senior press deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secession is not the answer. He believes the city can work
together, we can work with the Valley. He's very committed to that,
he feels passionate that the city should remain together,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Valley VOTE leaders remain optimistic that the study can be
completed within about a year, giving LAFCO an opportunity to place
the secession question on the November 2000 ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Calemine cautioned that it likely will take years. ``I think
it's beyond optimism to think it will be on the 2000 ballot.''

   But Tagliabue continues to be wooed by the bright lights and
mega-market value of Los Angeles, bursting his double-breasted coat
with big plans.
</P>
<P>
   McNair continues to hope and impress. Tagliabue and his cronies
continue to try to quash those Houston hopes and move on.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion drama continued Monday, with Tagliabue and a
strong contingent of NFL leaders and owners trying to take that
drama to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   But just as it seemed McNair met his Black Monday when Tagliabue
shot down Houston hopes during a news conference, a glimmer of
light later shined through when some owners refused to fall in line
with the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still alive,'' McNair said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Tagliabue keeps pushing _ and he should as the calls
arrive from Murdoch, the czar of the LA-based Fox network _ it
might be a stay of execution.
</P>
<P>
   When Tagliabue predicted after a noon meeting with the expansion
committee that a recommendation for expansion would be made by
Monday evening, the Houston bid seemed dead. Tagliabue also said
that, no, there would be no such ``win-win'' concession made for
McNair and Houston. There would be no guarantees of a future
franchise relocation to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is to keep teams where they are,'' Tagliabue said.
``I think we would continue to adhere to that policy.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair and Steve Patterson, who also leads the Houston effort,
were numbed by the words.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pretty much knew what that recommendation was going to
be,'' McNair said. ``It was going to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   But shortly after, the owners gathered and debated. Many owners
fell in line with Tagliabue's cause despite the still-unsettled
ownership fight in LA and still-vague support from Los Angeles
civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners defended McNair and the sure thing, including
Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, who previously was considered
an LA proponent but delivered a plea for Houston's cause.
</P>
<P>
   The day ended with questions, uncertainty and no recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't even close,'' said Carolina owner Jerry Richardson,
who co-chairs the expansion committee with New England's Bob Kraft.
``We were split as owners, and we were split on the committee. We
have a difficult situation. We have two good cities, but there's
only one team. We're looking for something that makes sense.''
</P>
<P>
   They should look to the future and look hard again at McNair's
win-win proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They found out there was a lot more support for Houston than
they thought,'' McNair said. ``If our support stays with us, it's
going to be difficult (for Los Angeles) to get the votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a faction of the owners began to realize the potential
damaging consequences of being blinded by LA's glitz: Not only
could there not be a win-win result for the NFL, but it could be
lose-lose.
</P>
<P>
   Award the expansion franchise now to Los Angeles, and there
indeed would be a brilliant marketplace at the league's disposal.
But what if the obvious fears about Los Angeles are realized?
</P>
<P>
   What if the community reacts to the NFL the way it has in the
past, by going surfing or roller-blading and catching the final
score on the news? What if the public money never comes? What if
the stadium is consistently half-empty and that marvelous TV
audience is repeatedly blacked out?
</P>
<P>
   The NFL loses.
</P>
<P>
   The second loss might be even more damaging. Award the expansion
franchise now to Los Angeles without some sort of promise to
relocate an existing team to Houston _ the win-win idea _ and the
Houston market would be gutted.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's stadium would not be built. McNair, a popular man among
NFL owners, would move on. The $195 million allocated by the city
and county would be used to refurbish the Astrodome and for other
projects, making Houston an undesirable NFL destination for years
to come.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue clearly has strung McNair and Houston along for
months, probably only to establish a lucrative standard for LA's
franchise fee. While McNair has done everything asked of him,
Tagliabue and those behind him have been as disingenuous as the
city of angels to which they have sold their votes.
</P>
<P>
   This fight is reeking of Holyfield-Lewis. Only in Tagliabue's
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put a lot of trust in (Tagliabue),'' McNair said. ``I'll
be very disappointed if we don't get some sort of positive
message.''
</P>
<P>
   There is at least one more day to wait and ponder. The owners no
doubt should ponder hard, too.
</P>
<P>
   After all, an expansion team in Los Angeles might be a lot of
things, but it probably will not be Tagliabue's much-hoped-for day
at the beach.

SUPER BOWL PROMISED IF STADIUM BUILT  
 NFL DENIES PLEDGE MEANT TO INFLUENCE VOTE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - If the Rio Salado Crossing stadium project is built,
the Super Bowl will come.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL owners voted unanimously Monday to award Mesa a Super
Bowl in 2004, 2005 or 2006 if voters in Mesa, Gilbert and Queen
Creek approve the $497 million stadium and convention center
project.
</P>
<P>
   Mesa's sales tax would go up a quarter-cent to help pay for the
facility, but backers are promising $1.3 billion in private
investment in the project and a yearly $1.6 billion boost to the
local economy. Now the NFL is promising the Super Bowl, which
supporters say could bring at least $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some might consider the league's action as an attempt to
influence the May 18 election, but Jim Steeg, NFL vice president of
special events, said, ``This is not an ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an offer. The (proposed) facility is so good, we want to
play a Super Bowl there.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the league got involved in Arizona politics,
voters rejected a Martin Luther King Jr. holiday referendum in
November 1990 after the league hinted that the 1993 Super Bowl
would be pulled from the Valley if the holiday were defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Voters passed the King holiday in 1992, and Super Bowl XXX was
played in the Valley in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is pressure on the voters,'' said Cardinals
owner Bill Bidwill, whose team would play in the proposed stadium.
``They're voting on an entire package. This is just part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the Super Bowl awarded by
the owners on Monday likely will be ``the first of many'' if the
Rio Salado Crossing is built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd expect to be in the (Super Bowl) rotation,'' Mesa Mayor
Wayne Brown said. ``We'd expect to have one every five or six
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh Steelers owner Dan Rooney, whose team played Dallas
in the 1996 Super Bowl, said there was no opposition to the
proposal to bring a conditional game in 2004, 2005 or 2006 to Rio
Salado Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great time here,'' Rooney said. ``I couldn't say
enough good things about it. It was perfect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Vice President Michael Bidwill, spearheading the
stadium drive for the team, described the league's action as a
``huge economic carrot.''
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Arizona State Business School for the Arizona
Department of Commerice found that hosting the 1996 Super Bowl
provided a $306 million economic boost for the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presumably, it'll be higher than that the next time,'' Michael
Bidwill said.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Fantozzi, a member of both citizens groups dedicated to
defeating the project, used Michael Bidwill's dangling carrot
analogy, but with a different spin. If voters approve the project,
Fantozzi said his neighborhood south of the site will be ruined by
traffic while taxpayers subsidize a wealthy, privately owned
football team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This further cements the idea that this election is being
bought by the Cardinals and the NFL,'' Fantozzi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cardinals are already paying for the (pro-stadium)
campaign, so they are just dangling another big carrot with the
Super Bowl. It's old-fashioned politics at work.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said the only reason the league hasn't awarded the
Valley a Super Bowl since the 1996 game is because of problems with
Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The team bid for the 2000 and 2001 Super Bowls at Sun Devil
Stadium, but the games were awarded to Atlanta and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we did the play the game here, it was outstanding,''
Tagliabue said. ``We've said many times the community-based events
were precedent-setting. It was the venue that was outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun Devil Stadium is a good college stadium. It's not up to
the standards our members expect for a Super Bowl going into the
next decade. The new stadium is. The bar has been set higher and
higher. We know what our fans expect from a Super Bowl, and this
new facility here will have it.''
</P>
<P>
   NFL officials have frequently said the problems with Sun Devil
Stadium as a Super Bowl site include power capacity at the stadium;
access to the locker rooms; and concession and locker room
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   League spokesman Joe Browne said the owners didn't specify the
year Mesa would get the game to give the league flexibility and
because of considerations to other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit has been promised a Super Bowl after voters approved a
downtown stadium, which won't be completed until at least 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Quentin Smith, vice chairman of the Valley's Super Bowl
Committee, said the league also wasn't specific about the Super
Bowl date because of ``maximum flexibility with the construction
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he preferred to have a Super Bowl in 2004, 2005 or
2006 in Mesa, Bill Bidwill said, ``I'll take any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   However, project backers are focusing campaign efforts on
highlighting the 650-acre project's other aspects, chiefly the
convention center, parks, golf courses and public spaces, said Brad
Wright, executive director of the Yes! on Rio Salado Crossing
political action committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, but we are still much more excited about the 240
to 260 days a year that we will use the facility for things other
than football,'' Wright said. &QL;

GRAND PRIX COURSE COMES TO PASS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach turns
25 next month and to celebrate, the organizers have given the race
course a face-lift. For the first time since 1992, the course will
take on a new look that organizers hope will make the April 18
event the most exciting yet.
</P>
<P>
   Dario Franchitti, last year's runner-up to Alex Zanardi, took a
break from his preparations for the start of the CART season opener
this weekend in Miami, to come to Long Beach and test the new
configuration. He came away impressed after taking a slow-speed
tour _ for him _ at the wheel of the Toyota pace car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a better flow to it,'' said Franchitti, who arrived
Sunday night and left town a couple of hours after his drive.
``Hopefully, there's more passing and certainly there's more
character. I think it's a very positive change.''
</P>
<P>
   The course begins with the Shoreline Drive straightaway as
before, but now the drivers will take a left at the conclusion of
the straight instead of the traditional right turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn 1 is definitely a passing zone,'' Franchitti said.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers then circle the Dolphin Fountain in front of the
Aquarium of the Pacific and the adjacent parking structure before
rejoining Shoreline Drive for a short time. After a left turn at
the previous Turn 1, the remainder of the track will be almost the
same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to work closely with many city entities to decide what
the most challenging, exciting and safest course would be for
all,'' said Chris Pook, president and CEO for the Grand Prix
Association of Long Beach.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of work left to be done before race weekend
begins on April 16. By the time the 11-turn, 1.85 mile course is
complete, there will be 1,800 concrete blocks, each weighing 8,100
pounds and measuring 12 feet in length, plus 250 tire crash
barriers. Not to mention 21 spectator grandstands, 12
television/photo towers, eight vision boards and 61 viewing suites.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're finished, we will have built a city within a
city,'' said Dwight Tanaka, vice president of operations for the
Grand Prix Association.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti said he hopes there's one thing that doesn't change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stands were alive when we finished the race and were going
around (last year),'' Franchitti said. ``I could hear them cheering
(while) in the car, which is very unusual. The fans were just
incredible. I thought, `I like this.' ''

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The 40-point loss didn't really happen, or at least it didn't
matter. The Rockets have dismissed the disaster in Portland as an
anomaly, the inevitable result of back-to-back games mixed with
travel problems and a rested opponent on a roll.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``That was a situation where we had a lot of problems with the
flight,'' forward Charles Barkley said. ``We didn't have a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That game nine days ago, at least its blowout score, was labeled
a fluke. Tonight, the Rockets get a chance to prove it. The Trail
Blazers come to Houston for the second of back-to-back road games,
though traveling only from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   If the Rockets' 111-71 crash was the result of mitigating
circumstances, most of them have changed. New circumstances and
problems, however, have cropped up in their place, starting with
Scottie Pippen's public disclosure of his frustrations with the
Rockets' offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets insist they are not as poor a team as they appeared
March 7 in Portland. But Pippen left little question that he
believes there are real problems with the team's offense.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich would not publicly discuss Pippen's
complaints but said they would be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I would say is I'm going to do my work in the
locker room,'' Tomjanovich said. ``That's just my way. I'm not
going to publicly debate the things that have to be ironed out.''
</P>
<P>
   He did say, however, that the problems could be solved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always be confident unless guys give up,'' Tomjanovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   All season long, Pippen has described himself as frustrated. He
said Sunday that considering his role in the offense, he didn't
know why the Rockets even wanted him.
</P>
<P>
   But even before Pippen made his frustration public, Tomjanovich
warned that teams could not let 1999's grueling, rushed schedule
cloud their perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding what a different deal this year is is
important,'' Tomjanovich said. ``The regular season is tough. You
cram all these things together, the extra game a week and travel,
and you've got to be mentally tough to keep a positive attitude and
not say this team is 40 points better than us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have veterans that will get that message across.''
</P>
<P>
   The message the Rockets seem most intent on delivering is that
the 111-71 final was misleading and that they are a better team
since then anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't put a lot of stock in our last game
(against Portland) because of what happened with our travel,'' said
forward Matt Bullard, referring to an overnight delay in Vancouver.
``With the plane broken down, we had to stay in Vancouver an extra
night. Nobody got any sleep. If we would have beaten them out
there, it would have been quite an accomplishment to overcome all
those situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game will be a more accurate test. I think it will be
more indicative of what our team is like. I guess it could be a
measuring stick, not because of the way last game was but just
where we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they come in off a loss in Phoenix in which Tomjanovich
said they were ``out-energied'' down the stretch, the Rockets used
last week's three home games and two practices to shore up areas
that had been shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped,'' Tomjanovich said. ``This thing is like the guy at
the dike. You fix this (hole), and all of a sudden there's another
one there. As a coach, that's how you live your life during the
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets' problems have not come in torrents. But the time at
home allowed them to address problems large (turnovers and
free-throw shooting) and small (sideline inbounds plays and
pick-and-roll defensive support).
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you get to spend a few days in the gym together,
review things, watch video, it helps,'' guard Brent Price said.
``It wasn't like we went at it two hours full-speed. We went short.
But we had certain things we wanted to work on. From a learning
standpoint, it was very valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the Rockets made those improvements and beat each of
the teams to come into Compaq Center, none could be considered an
especially difficult test. They have beaten just two teams with
winning records: the Suns on Feb. 16 and the SuperSonics on Feb.
23. And other than Utah, nobody has a better record than Portland's
17-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a test for us,'' Rockets forward Othella Harrington said.
``They do have a good team. They have great starters and great
backups. They are one of the top teams in the West and in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not more meaningful because of the loss. We did lose by
40 points, but a loss is a loss. But playing them again, we want to
have a better showing than last time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have enough reasons to need a better performance
without having to reconsider the night in Portland. Pippen's
dissatisfaction is only the most recent sore, or even open wound, a
victory can heal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the way we lost has any effect on the game and
playing them again,'' Price said. ``We're a much better team than
we showed. A lot had to do with our schedule. There's no question
we were fatigued and road-weary, and it showed. There's no question
we look forward to playing them on our court and in a fresh
setting. We'll have a day off. But I don't think the blowout puts
any extra eagerness to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   There's enough eagerness there already.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
For the first time in quite a while, I really, really missed Howard
Cosell this week. I find myself mentally reaching for the earplugs,
trying to imagine how the man who considered himself the conscience
of sport would have reacted to the latest atrocity in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   True, Jim Lampley fairly well summed up the mood of those at the
scene, and those who paid to watch at home, when he denounced the
decision that gave Evander Holyfield a draw with Lennox Lewis on
Saturday as ``fraudulent.'' His reference to boxing as a
``cesspool'' was a nice touch of color, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Steward, the trainer for the British import, even went a
step beyond that judgment. ``It looked,'' he said, in a hopeless
tone of voice, ``as if (the outcome) was rigged.''
</P>
<P>
   The only opinion that could have overshadowed those would have
been Cosell's, who used words like a dagger. At the least, Howard
would have thrown an entire thesaurus at them. He would have
labeled the verdict ``a sham of a mockery of a fraud'' and demanded
an investigation by Kenneth Starr or the FBI or the Supreme Court _
or, barring that, a Certified Public Accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Just when you think boxing can't sink any lower, the sport
plunges to another depth. It is down there now where only Jacques
Cousteau and Capt. Nemo dared to go.
</P>
<P>
   Some laughed, and some cheered, when Cosell walked away from the
microphone after Larry Holmes turned the face of Tex Cobb into
grade-A ground beef in a fiasco at the Astrodome. Howard never
called another fight, an action Cobb would later proudly claim as
``my gift to mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   So let us say this as delicately as we can. Evander Holyfield is
a fine fellow, who was driven by a sincere desire to prove himself
one of the great heavyweights of all time. But on Saturday night in
New York, he was beaten by Lennox Lewis, over 12 rounds, as
decisively as the loser of any title fight in memory. Lewis
dominated him, at times toyed with him, and in punches thrown and
landed held a more than 2-1 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   At the finish, there seemed little doubt Holyfield knew he lost
the fight. To the extent that his bruised and swollen face
permitted, his expression and his body language gave it away. He
put an arm lightly around Lewis' shoulder and congratulated him,
the act of a gentleman. Later, he would say that he couldn't
comment on the judges' cards ``because I was fighting it, not
scoring it. I gave my best, but it wasn't my best fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one could hardly have expected even the decent and
usually straight-talking Holyfield to yelp, ``Hey, I can't accept
this decision. I got stomped. Who were the judges _ Ray Charles,
Jose Feliciano and Helen Keller?''
</P>
<P>
   But the pain, shock and disbelief of Lewis were unmistakable,
packed into two words you could not hear but clearly saw his lips
form: ``Oh, mann

WEST REGIONAL: THAT'S THE TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - March Madness is coming to town this week.
</P>
<P>
   Will ticket madness follow?
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA West Regional at America West Arena featuring Gonzaga,
Florida, Connecticut and Iowa has been sold out since January. Word
among ticket brokers is that demand for tickets to the doubleheader
on Thursday and the regional championship Saturday is steady but
not spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials advise the best way to get tickets is through the
universities that reached the regional round.
</P>
<P>
   Each school must purchase 500 seats to the Thursday and Saturday
sessions and has the option of buying 750 more. If any of those are
returned, they would then be offered to the other schools, and only
if they aren't bought then would any more be available to the
general public.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa, with a large contingent of transplants, vacationers and
snowbirds in the Valley, could have the biggest local fan base.
</P>
<P>
   And at the Iowa Cafe in Mesa, excitement is building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you betcha it is,'' said Ruth Cavender, who runs the
restaurant with her sister, Shirley Woolums.
</P>
<P>
   Cavender, who ran a cafe in Mount Ayr, Iowa, for 35 years, would
like to go herself but doubts she will.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so darned busy at this time of year I don't have time to
do anything else, but I'd like to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Muir, a director of the NCAA men's tournament, said that
tickets in Phoenix had sold out quickly and that he expected teams
such as Iowa and Connecticut with long basketball traditions and
loyal fans to heighten demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely going to be a tough ticket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Muir said the NCAA did not condone fans buying tickets from
brokers. But brokers will have them available.
</P>
<P>
   The face value of a ticket to the three games _ two Thursday and
the regional championship Saturday _ is $90. They are originally
sold that way, as a three-game package.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers on Monday said prices ranged from $225-$275 for the
three-game package in the lower bowl at the arena to $125-$150 in
the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   And they said that although there was a steady stream of callers
both buying and selling tickets, it was far from the hottest ticket
ever to hit town. It's not a Super Bowl, for example.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change, especially if enough fans can find their
way to Phoenix, a hot ticket itself in the month of March.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's spring break for many students in the Valley and
elsewhere in the Southwest, there could be a run on tickets from
people who just want to see an NCAA tournament in person and be a
part of the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge interest, but it's a little tough to arrange,''
said Geno Bronchetti of All World Travel in Spokane, Wash., home of
Gonzaga (that's Gone-ZAG-uh), which plays Florida in Thursday's
first game.
</P>
<P>
   At Hawkeye World Travel in Iowa City, Iowa, Annette Reed agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge demand, but not much availability,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And short-notice flights to Phoenix are averaging about $1,500
round-trip, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The regional is being run by Arizona State University, which is
the host school.
</P>
<P>
   Capacity for the event is being listed at 18,500, rather than
the usual 19,023 for basketball at America West Arena, because of
the large media contingent.
</P>
<P>
   And once tickets were distributed to the teams, the NCAA, CBS,
ESPN, the NCAA's corporate sponsors, officials and other working
parties, there wasn't a tremendous number left for the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   As the host school, ASU first offers tickets to Sun Devil
basketball season-ticket holders, said Tom Sadler, ASU assistant
athletic director and tournament manager at America West.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA really wants to make sure that college basketball
fans are in attendance,'' Sadler said.
</P>
<P>
   America West Arena also received tickets for some of its
constituents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't track down those relatives in Iowa with tickets, or
if you're unfamiliar with the Phoenix ticket scene, scalping is
legal. Phoenix cordones off the downtown scalpers in a specific
area and has been regularly moving the location around.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to give it a shot, the current scalping area is on
the north side of Jackson Street between Third and Fourth streets.
</P>
<P>
   The price will depend on demand and supply _ and, of course, on
the level of Madness reaching the Valley.

FINAL FOUR FAITH  
 UCONN COACH KNOWS IT'LL HAPPEN _ SOMEDAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Whenever a Connecticut basketball fan reminds him the
Huskies have never played in the NCAA Tournament's Final Four,
Coach Jim Calhoun has a pat answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday,'' Calhoun says, ``we'll get Connecticut back to where
it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always kind of a stopper to the question.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years ago, Calhoun took over a Connecticut program that
hadn't been to the NCAA Tournament since the late 1970s and was
unknown to most people outside the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   He has built it into a national power. Since 1989-90, the
Huskies have won 30 or more games four times, including this
season's 30-2 mark. They have won more games in the 1990s than all
but six other Division I teams.
</P>
<P>
   They are a No. 1 seed for the third time in the 1990s, and their
game Thursday against Iowa in the semifinals of the West Region at
America West Arena marks their seventh Sweet 16 appearance this
decade.
</P>
<P>
   All wonderful accomplishments. Still, the question that dogs
Calhoun and the Huskies is about what they haven't accomplished.
Calhoun handles the issue well, although he thinks it's unfair to
define his program by its lack of a Final Four appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coach wants to go to a Final Four and win a national
championship, too,'' he said. ``If you look what we've done over
the past 13 years, we've done OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Things appear to be set up perfectly this season for UConn, the
No. 1 seed in the West Region of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   To advance to the Final Four in St. Petersburg, Fla., all the
Huskies have to do is win Thursday over fifth-seeded Iowa and
Saturday over either 10th-seeded Gonzaga or sixth-seeded Florida in
the region finals.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun knows there are inherent dangers in that logic. The
first two rounds of the tournament were filled with upsets.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top four seeds in the West, only UConn made it out of the
second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to make sure you don't have a poor or bad game,
or the other team doesn't throw an `A' game at you,'' Calhoun said.
``It's not much more complicated than that.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the sixth time since 1990 that Connecticut has been
seeded first or second. The Huskies have advanced to the region
finals three times with the first coming in 1990, when Duke's
Christian Laettner hit a jump shot with one second left to win it
for the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Duke is the overwhelming favorite to win this year's title, with
UConn perhaps having the best chance of upsetting the Blue Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun will have none of that, and he does his best to keep
Duke out of his players' minds.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference last week, point guard Khalid El-Amin was
asked whether the 22-point victory over New Mexico in the second
round was meant to send Duke a message.
</P>
<P>
   Before El-Amin could answer, Calhoun whispered a word of
caution. El-Amin then provided a stock response, saying the Huskies
weren't thinking of the Blue Devils at all.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut's players have been constantly reminded of the
school's failure to get to the Final Four, but they seem unaffected
by it and by the pressure of being a No. 1 seed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we like being the No. 1 seed,'' El-Amin said. ``We
worked so hard all year to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   That the program's success is defined by making the Final Four
is testament to the job Calhoun had done in his 13 years. Before
arriving at Connecticut, Calhoun was successful at Northeastern
University in Boston, and he turned down a couple of offers before
accepting the Huskies' job.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Coach Bobby Knight gave Calhoun some pointed advice when
the Connecticut job opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `If you don't take this one, I'll give you a really
good kick in the ass,' '' Calhoun said. ``One thing about Bob is
he's usually true to his word, and I didn't feel like a kick in the
ass. He knew that things were lined up (at UConn).''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun initially struggled to recruit players to Connecticut,
but as the program improved, so did the quality of recruits. The
Huskies will go anywhere for players. Forward Richard Hamilton is
from Pennsylvania. El-Amin is from Minneapolis. Center Jake Voskuhl
is from Texas. Former Husky Brian Fair was from Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   By Calhoun's second year, the Huskies were playing in the NIT.
By his third season, they were a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a place that really loved basketball,'' he said. ``It's
gone from a good regional program to a national program. We've had
good players, and we're at a place that cares about basketball.
That helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Their problems this season, however small, were caused primarily
by injuries. Hamilton struggled through a thigh injury, and Voskuhl
was hampered by a sore left foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty evident we went into a lull toward the end of the
season,'' Voskuhl said. ``We're starting to get our rhythm back.''
</P>
<P>
   They are healthy now and, like Duke, they are deep and talented.
Hamilton and El-Amin can not only score, but along with guard Ricky
Moore, can defend the perimeter as well as any trio in the country.
Voskuhl is an effective rebounder and defender, as is forward Kevin
Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies love to use pressure defense and to play up-tempo.
The press makes it difficult for teams to get into their offensive
sets, and it forces turnovers. With El-Amin and Hamilton, UConn
usually converts those turnovers into points and impressive runs.
</P>
<P>
   In their past four games, the Huskies have enjoyed streaks in
which they've outscored opponents, 22-5, 13-0, 11-0, 20-7, 17-0 and
11-0. They've won each game by at least 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on a mission,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, UConn is vulnerable. The Huskies were nearly upset by
Seton Hall in the Big East Tournament, and Calhoun has emphasized
to his team just how fragile tournament success is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it all along,'' Calhoun said. ``We are good enough
to make a ride, and at 30-2, I think we have made a pretty good
ride already.''

PREGNANT PAUSE ISN'T IN CARDS YET FOR HURST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Excuse Pat Hurst if her mind is not fully focused on
this week's Standard Register PING golf tournament at Moon Valley
Country Club. Distractions such as defending a major championship,
which Hurst will do next week at the Dinah Shore, can do that to
you.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, there is one other. The Phoenix pro is six months
pregnant. She is one of three LPGA players who live in the Valley _
along with Barb Whitehead and Caroline McMillan _ who are expecting
their first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being pregnant really doesn't affect my swing that much,''
said Hurst, who has established herself over the past four years as
one of the better players in women's golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess, if anything, I have to pace myself a little bit more
because I tend to get tired. But mostly, it's the usual things you
would expect when you're pregnant: I go through cravings, and my
body reminds me of that. I definitely eat breakfast, lunch and
dinner now, whereas I never ate breakfast before.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Hurst is taking pretty good care of herself and her
baby boy, Jackson Jeffrey, who is projected to arrive on June 28.
She has not missed a cut in six tournaments this season, with her
best effort being a tie for fifth in the Hawaiian Open.
</P>
<P>
   That Hurst has been so consistent is no surprise, really. Her
five-year career on the LPGA has been a steady growth process. It
began in 1995, when she captured Rookie of the Year honors, and was
cemented last year with a victory in the Dinah Shore. She has one
other victory _ the 1997 Oldsmobile Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Last year she finished eighth on the money list, finished fourth
at the U.S. Open, and helped fuel the U.S. team's victory in the
Solheim Cup with a 3-1 individual record.
</P>
<P>
   But what most people don't know about Hurst, whose earlier
accolades include two U.S. Golf Association titles and an NCAA
crown, is that from 1992 to '94, she actually gave up her childhood
dream of playing on the LPGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed two years in a row at (LPGA Qualifying School), and I
decided to quit and take a job as a teaching pro at LaQuinta
(Calif.),'' said Hurst, 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I enjoyed teaching, and I didn't think
about playing (professionally), because I hadn't been enjoying golf
for a while. I had never taken a break from golf since I started
playing (at age 11). I just thought to myself, `Hey, it's OK to
take some time off.' ''
</P>
<P>
   To fully understand Hurst's sabbatical, it is important to go
back to her childhood. She spent nearly every day at a course
called Skywood near San Leandro, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad passed away when I was 4, and my mom's boyfriend of 20
years, Frank _ I call him my `common-law stepdad' _ got me
interested in the game. I'd spend every day at the golf course
until my mom would pick me up in the evening.''
</P>
<P>
   There never was a doubt in Hurst's mind what she wanted to do
when she grew up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Playing professionally was my dream,'' she confessed. ``Every
time the LPGA came around to play in the San Jose Classic, my mom
would let me take the whole week off from school. I'd stay out
there all day long, and I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   As a top junior player, Hurst captured the 1986 U.S. Junior
Championship. As an All-American at San Jose State, she added the
1989 NCAA and U.S. Women's Amateur Championships to her re sume.
</P>
<P>
   So it was somewhat, well, shocking that Hurst's career path took
a detour after two unsuccessful bids to get her LPGA card. Then
again, maybe not considering Hurst is known as gracious,
introspective woman by her peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times, I guess I'm mellow, but there are other times when
the game can get to you,'' Hurst conceded. ``I just always make it
a point to tell the other person `good shot' because that's what
I'd hope they would do towards me.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that Hurst is a mamby-pamby. Just ask her
husband, Jeff Heitt, who caddied for Hurst for three seasons before
they ended up at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very competitive, like at the Solheim Cup last year,''
Heitt said. ``Some were comparing her to Dottie Pepper, but she
just doesn't wear it on the outside like Dottie does.''
</P>
<P>
   Heitt, who is the LPGA Tour representative for PING, said he
knows his wife is looking forward to the baby, ``but I think Pat
will really miss not playing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's planning on taking four months off (after the baby), and
that will be a long time for Pat,'' Heitt added.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst admits that juggling her career and motherhood will be
challenging, ``but fortunately the LPGA now has a great day-care
program.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst said she plans to play until the Titleholders (May 6-9),
and will take maternity leave until sometime in September. But in
the meantime, there is her defense in the Dinah Shore to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I'm at a disadvantage (being pregnant),'' she
said of her chances in the first major of 1999. ``But I'm not
practicing as much. Sometimes that's a good thing. If you don't put
pressure on yourself, you tend to play better, at least I do.''

SABRES BEAT ISLANDERS, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Since Bill Stewart took over behind the New York
Islanders' bench nearly two months ago, an uninspiring performance
by his team had become so rare that it was difficult to remember a
time when it did not work hard in a game.
</P>
<P>
   Let Monday night's game against the Buffalo Sabres, a 2-1 loss,
serve as a refresher. One day after they were stung by an overtime
loss to the New York Rangers, the drained Islanders appeared to
avoid physical contact and rarely mustered an even-strength scoring
chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders went down quietly to the Sabres before 18,105 fans
at Marine Midland Arena. The loss extended the Islanders' streak to
eight games without a victory (0-6-2), and it prompted Stewart to
conduct a 15-minute team meeting afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting very discouraging,'' said Stewart, referring to
his team's inability to finish off good scoring chances around the
net. ``I'm getting a little annoyed. I'm very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Zigmund Palffy, the Islanders' sniper, finished without a shot
on goal. His linemate Robert Reichel had four shots but could not
put the puck in the net, not even on a first-period breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders fell behind by 2-0 on goals by Miroslav Satan in
the first and third periods. Bryan Smolinski scored late in the
game, and Wade Flaherty made 22 saves to keep the Islanders close.
But close was not enough to end the team's dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our opportunities,'' Flaherty said. ``I made some big
saves but we didn't score enough goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty made his first start in the Islanders' net since Dec.
28. He was the Islanders' most consistent player, making several
important saves. Flaherty's counterpart, Dwayne Roloson, stopped 21
shots.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period on Monday night, the Islanders witnessed a
fight, something they had not seen since Feb. 4. Defenseman Eric
Cairns, whom the Islanders recently recalled, squared off with Paul
Kruse, whom the Islanders traded last season.
</P>
<P>
   The fight momentarily invigorated the Islanders, who were behind
by 1-0 because of a Cairns turnover on a Sabres power play. After
Cairns lost control of the puck in front of the Islanders' net, it
landed on the stick of Michael Peca, who made a cross-ice pass to
Satan. He buried the puck behind Flaherty, who was leaning the
wrong way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we just started slow,'' said Trevor Linden, the
Islanders' captain. ``We came on there at the end. It's too bad we
couldn't score another goal or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Satan tallied his second goal of the game, and 31st of the
season, while his team was short-handed. It came at 7:40 of the
third period on a two-on-one rush. Thirty-one seconds later,
Smolinski banged in a rebound of Eric Brewer's shot from the point
on the same power play. &QL;

LIONS AIM TO KEEP TURKEY DAY GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Here's how serious the Detroit Lions are to keep their
annual Thanksgiving Day game:
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive officers of Ford, General Motors, Chrysler
and Kmart sent NFL owners a letter in which they strongly urged
them not to change a 65-year tradition.
</P>
<P>
   It helps the cause of the Lions and the Dallas Cowboys, the
other team that hosts a Thanksgiving Day game each season, that
those companies are among the league's biggest advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of rotating the Thanksgiving Day game among all
franchises is expected to be discussed today at the NFL meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Lions Vice Chairman Bill Ford Jr. is hopeful that the issue will
come to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to do this year after year,'' Ford said. ``It's
becoming an annual event.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt proposed the
Thanksgiving games rotate, maintaining the Lions and Cowboys have
competitive advantages by hosting the Thanksgiving games each year.
A vote wasn't taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there should be a situation where one team has
an every-year advantage,'' Hunt said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion update &QL; 
The NFL'S expansion committee met with the general membership for
about an hour Monday but did not make a recommendation on a 32nd
team.
</P>
<P>
   The owners are expected to again address the issue today with a
recommendation likely to come.
</P>
<P>
   Houston and Los Angeles are the contending cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sign of the times
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tom Donahoe, director of football operations for the Pittsburgh
Steelers, doesn't think the Cardinals' plan to possibly play a
rookie left tackle is surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're probably forced to do it now,'' he said of teams losing
players in free agency. ``It helps when you have a pretty high
draft pick, which they do (eighth overall). Sometimes needs dictate
what you do in the draft. You can't answer every problem in free
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals lost starting left tackle &UR; Lomas Brown to the
expansion Cleveland Browns in free agency. Instead of going after a
replacement in free agency, they said they would take an offensive
pick early in next month's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago I would have agreed with the notion that you don't
want a rookie protecting the quarterback's backside,'' Donahoe
said. ``Today, you're seeing teams play rookie linemen all the
time. It's not an ideal situation. It's probably not your best
option, but you do what you have to do.'' &QL; 
Negotiations on hold &QL; 
 &UR; Gary Wichard, agent for Cardinals wide receiver  &UR; Rob Moore, said he
didn't expect to resume talks with the Cardinals until summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals placed the franchise tag on Moore after not being
able to sign him to a multi-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was upset with the designation, but Wichard said he was
confident the two sides could reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK with me that nothing is going on,'' Wichard said.
``There's no sense having aggravation in March, April and May.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will all work out. We'll get it done. He wants to
play with the Cardinals. They want him.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Cardinals sign Moore after July 15, they will get their
franchise designation back.
</P>
<P>
   Risky proposition &QL; 
Dallas Cowboys Coach &UR; Chan Gailey said he opposed changing the
touchback rule following kickoffs to the 25-yard line from the 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It penalizes somebody who works hardest at being good at
something,'' Gailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Some coaches think the proposed rule would reward teams with
poor kickoff-return teams and penalizes teams with strong-legged
kickers. &QL; 
DeBartolo punishment &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Edward DeBartolo Jr., already barred from running the San
Francisco 49ers for his part in a gambling scandal, is expected to
be fined $1 million and be suspended from the NFL for a year.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo pleaded guilty last year to one felony charge of
failing to report an alleged extortion attempt by former Louisiana
Gov.  &UR; Edwin
 &UR; Edwards in connection with DeBartolo's bid for a riverboat gambling
license.

   PHOENIX - The Cardinals have been awarded four compensatory
picks in next month's NFL draft, giving them 11 choices overall.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Green Bay Packers were awarded as many picks.
</P>
<P>
   None of the picks is in the first day of the draft, which
disappointed team officials when the announcement was made at the
NFL meetings Monday in Phoenix. The Cardinals thought they would
get higher compensatory picks after losing five players to free
agency before the 1998 season: middle linebacker Eric Hill (St.
Louis), wide receiver Kevin Williams (Buffalo), defensive end
Michael Bankston (Cincinnati), free safety Brent Alexander
(Carolina) and punter Jeff Feagles (Seattle).
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals were given a pick in the fifth round (No. 170
overall), two in the sixth (Nos. 204 and 207) and one in the
seventh (No. 241).
</P>
<P>
   They will have two first-round picks, one pick in the second,
third, fourth and seventh rounds, two picks in the fifth round and
three in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals earlier forfeited their own seventh-round pick in
an August trade with Pittsburgh for cornerback J.B. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams were given compensatory picks on the first day of
the draft. Green Bay and Pittsburgh were given third-round
choices. &QL;

AFRICANIZED BEES FOUND IN SAN FERNANDO VALLEY
</HEADLINE>

(EDITORS: CORRECTING BYLINE)

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The killer bees are here.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of a swarm of Africanized honeybees in an oak tree
in Calabasas west of Los Angeles makes it official: The San
Fernando Valley is now officially colonized by the killer bees, Los
Angeles County agriculture officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement means that 40 percent of Los Angeles County _
1,668 miles _ is now colonized by the fierce hybrid bee responsible
for five deaths in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Commissioner Cato Fiksdal said there is no cause for
alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Individual bees are not a problem,'' he said. ``It's only the
hive. They only attack when they've established a hive and you
disturb their home.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the best defense when attacked by a swarm of
killer bees is a good set of legs. Cover your head, mouth and eyes
and run to the nearest enclosed area where the bees can be locked
out. If there is no cover, be prepared to run for up to a
quarter-mile before the killer bees relent.
</P>
<P>
   African honeybees escaped from a Brazilian agriculture research
station in 1957 and began breeding with more docile European
honeybees. The result: Africanized honeybees, a fierce hybrid that
aggressively defends its territory and spawns new colonies at up to
four times the rate of its European cousins.
</P>
<P>
   The bees were discovered in the south Los Angeles community of
Lawndale on Nov. 28. Since then, agriculture officials have tracked
their rapid advance across the county. Their arrival in the San
Fernando Valley was expected.
</P>
<P>
   On March 5, a gardener found a swarm of bees in an oak tree in
Calabasas and called the Los Angeles County West Vector Control
District. A DNA test confirmed the colony was Africanized
honeybees.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery added an additional 658 miles to the areas of the
county already colonized by killer bees. Fiksdal said he made an
official announcement Monday ``to put residents on a little bit of
heightened awareness.''

WOMACK'S RECOVERY ON SCHEDULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ Diamondbacks officials breathed a sigh of relief Monday
regarding a couple of medical fronts they had been monitoring and a
new one that had surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   X-rays of outfielder  &UR; Tony Womack's &UR; fractured right wrist
revealed that the healing process was on schedule.
</P>
<P>
   He had a full-length cast removed for the evaluation, and
another was put on after. That will remain for another week, when a
smaller one will replace it. He continues to have a target date of
mid-April for his return and likely would begin the season on the
15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Amaury Telemaco had a magnetic resonance imaging
test on his ailing shoulder, but no damage was found. There appears
to be slight evidence of tendinitis, which will be treated with
rest and anti-inflammatory medication. He likely will be sidelined
for a minimum of three to five days.
</P>
<P>
   The new medical case involves outfielder  &UR; David Dellucci. He
experienced pain in his left wrist during Sunday's game against the
San Francisco Giants in Scottsdale and had an X-ray on Monday. The
results were negative.
</P>
<P>
   One theory was that a cyst had formed on the back of his hand
and that it had some dissipation, causing the soreness.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (cyst) is something that's been with me for a while, but
this is the first time it's really bothered me,'' Dellucci said.
``It's not that big of a deal. I just had it checked. It's
something I'll deal with. I want to play, and I'll play with the
pain.'' &QL; 
Kim on the way &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Korean right-hander  &UR; Byung-Hyun Kim, who on Feb. 19 signed a
four-year deal for about $2 million, will arrive in camp later this
week or early next week and will be placed on the 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Kim, the club is scheduled to remove a player
from the 40-man roster either today or Wednesday. &QL; 
Standing tall in left &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Desi Wilson continues to impress club officials, although he
has an uphill battle for a roster spot because of the sheer numbers
at his two positions.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 former Phoenix Firebird came into camp as a first
baseman but also can play the outfield. Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter put
him in left in the late stages of Arizona's 11-2 victory over San
Diego on Monday. Wilson had two hits to raise his spring average to
.285.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played right, left and even center last year in Japan, and
I've been taking fly balls during practice out there,'' Wilson
said. ``It's actually fun out there. I think I'm a versatile
player, and I hope they think the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have  &UR; Travis Lee at first base and  &UR; Greg
Colbrunn as the backup. Utility men  &UR; Andy Fox and  &UR; Dale Sveum also
can play first, and the club is overloaded in the outfield at the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   In all likelihood, Wilson will start the season at first base
for Triple-A Tucson. &QL; 
Short stops &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander  &UR; Armando Reynoso continued to make steady progress,
earning the victory Monday. In four innings, he gave up four hits
and struck out three. One of the hits was a second-inning solo
homer by third baseman  &UR; George Arias, who played at Tucson Pueblo
High, Pima Community College and the University of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Reynoso's command of his pitches wasn't as sharp
as it had been, but he doesn't appear concerned. Reynoso's next
start is expected to be when the Diamondbacks play the Milwaukee
Brewers on Saturday in his native Mexico, at Hector Espino Stadium
in Hermosillo.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder  &UR; Pete Incaviglia was hit in the left forearm by a
pitch from San Diego's  &UR; Salvador Rodriguez, but he did not appear
to have any damage.
</P>
<P>
   The club is expected to bring up 11 players from its
minor-league camp today to play in the two split-squad games at Hi
Corbett Field and Tucson Electric Park. Among them are outfielder
 &UR; Garry Maddox, infielder  &UR; Scott Coolbaugh and pitchers  &UR; Don Peters,
Ben
 &UR; Norris and  &UR; Jason Crews. &QL;

BAILEY ANSWERS AINGE'S CALL FOR ENERGY  
 ROOKIE APPRECIATES CHANCE TO START 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sacramento's Jason Williams, Boston's Paul Pierce, Toronto's
Vince Carter and Vancouver's Mike Bibby are the best-known. They
are the contenders. One figures to be NBA Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   No surprises there.
</P>
<P>
   But every draft class has at least one surprise. There's no
award for the player who springs it. But if there were a Rookie
Surprise of the Year, Toby Bailey of the Suns would be an early
leader in the race.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares to make his third straight start tonight in
Milwaukee, Bailey is the latest draft pick, No. 45 overall, with a
starting job.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey is one of eight active rookies with starting jobs. In
addition to Williams, Pierce, Carter and Bibby, the starters are
Robert Traylor of Milwaukee and Houston's backcourt of Michael
Dickerson and Cuttino Mobley. A ninth rookie starter, Denver center
Raef LaFrentz, was lost for the season a few weeks ago because of a
knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great opportunity,'' Bailey said. ``I'm just there
to do whatever I can. I want to keep the ball alive, dive for loose
balls, play defense. That kind of thing. Mostly, I'm just trying to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting lineup is a complete reversal from the situation in
which Bailey found himself a couple of weeks ago. He had been
placed on the injured list, which is a common NBA dumping ground
for mid- to late second-round picks who spend most of their
apprentice seasons as practice players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frustrating at the time,'' Bailey said. ``But it also
was an opportunity. I was still learning in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bailey and undrafted playmaker Gerald Brown came off the
list at about the time that Coach Danny Ainge was struggling to
overcome inconsistent, sluggish play. With Rex Chapman sidelined
because of a calf injury, Ainge gave Bailey a chance.
</P>
<P>
   The result? Instant energy.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns are 1-1 with Bailey starting at shooting guard. There
was a narrow loss to San Antonio and Sunday's 14-point victory over
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Ainge said he plans to continue with Bailey as the
starter. Chapman is back, but his jump shot is not. After missing
three straight games, Chapman come off the bench against Houston
and shot 1 for 10.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Ainge will face a dilemma. Chapman appears uncomfortable
as a reserve. He has yet to find his range. Over 16 games, he's
shooting 31.3 percent. In a compressed season, he might be able to
find it only by playing. There isn't much much practice time.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's beginning to look as if Ainge has found
much-needed youth and athletic talent in Bailey, a 6-foot-5
swingman from UCLA. He's a good defender and he has been an active
rebounder. Against Houston, he grabbed five of his six rebounds in
the first seven minutes. His presence helped jump-start a team that
has been a slow starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of veterans who tend to take those first 12
minutes off,'' Ainge said. ``I think Rex would rather start. But
Toby has started in the last two, and we've played a lot better. So
that's the way we're going to continue, for now at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we have a lot of big game players on this team. But
there are times when it just seems harder to light the fire with
Tom Gugliotta, Danny Manning, Jason Kidd and Rex. They've all
talked about it. And we all know that these guys compete,
especially with their backs to the wall. But as a team, we don't
have enough athletic ability to go on cruise control.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we inserted Toby in the starting lineup. He won't
take those minutes for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Ainge lobbied hard and long for a deal that allowed
the Suns to acquire Bailey. The Suns gave the Los Angles Lakers
cash and the option to purchase second-round picks in 1999 and 2000
for the rights to Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Bailey was an uncertain quantity among scouts. He
was a sensational UCLA freshman. But during the next three years,
there was no apparent development as he struggled with position
changes and through a program that was rocked by a coaching change.
But Ainge remembered the dynamic skills of a freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always loved his athleticism,'' said Ainge, who never could
have guessed that he would see so much of it so soon. &QL;

`MOON' SCAPE GETTING THUMBS DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PH0ENIX - One of the hottest topics of conversation at the LPGA
tournament in Tucson last week was the abysmal condition of the
greens at Moon Valley Country Club, which this week will host the
$850,000 Standard Register PING.
</P>
<P>
   But not all the pros were complaining, especially one who has
had a major impact on the Phoenix tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is moaning, and I'm thinking secretly, `That's good
for me,' '' said  &UR; Laura Davies, who had her string of Standard
Register PING titles snapped at four in a row last year by
 &UR; Liselotte Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hitting it so well, but I'm just not putting that good, as
always. So I think it's only going to help me if it doesn't turn
into a putting contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Most players who attended last week's Welch's/Circle K
Championship conceded that the Standard Register PING could be
settled by the tour's big hitters. One of those was  &UR; Wendy Ward,
the former All-American at Arizona State who finished third at the
1995 tournament as an amateur.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I heard (the greens) were not very good,'' Ward said.
``At the same time, I really enjoy Moon Valley. I've had some good
experiences there in the past, so I'm looking forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, 15 greens are in average to below-average shape,
while three new ones _ Nos. 14, 15 and 18 _ are young and a little
bumpy from being redone this past year by Tempe architect  &UR; Bill
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Problems with the surface of ``the Moon'' should clear up for
future tournaments. The Solheim family, which owns PING as well as
the golf course, is committed to a multimillion renovation, with
Atlanta architect  &UR; Bob Cupp redoing the other 15 greens.
</P>
<P>
   The project will move the tournament to new course next year,
before it returns to Moon Valley in 2001. An announcement regarding
the site for the 2000 tournament may come this week. &QL; 
Star gazing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some of the LPGA's biggest names will show up this afternoon for
pre-tournament activities that include the Hewlett-Packard Putting
Contest, the LPGA Long-Drive Competition and the ``Golf Southwest''
``Magazine'' Celebrity Skills Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The putting contest kicks things off at 2:30 p.m. on the
practice green near the clubhouse. Among the pros competing are
 &UR; Patty Sheehan,
 &UR; Nancy Harvey, Danielle Ammaccapane, Amy Fruwirth, Jenny Lidback,
 &UR; Shirley Furlong, Jody Anschutz, Pam Wright and  &UR; Robin Walton. The
winner already has been determined, as Hewlett-Packard will present
a check for $10,000 to officials from the Joanne Winter/Silver
Belle Championship.
</P>
<P>
   The long-drive competition, which is just for fun, follows at 3
p.m. on the 10th hole. It matches three LPGA pros _ Rookie of the
Year  &UR; Se
 &UR; Ri Pak, Michelle McGann and Davies _ with three top junior players
_
 &UR; Kristi Larson of Scottsdale Chaparral High School,  &UR; Erin Tone of
Gilbert High and Xavier's  &UR; Alissa Kuczka.
</P>
<P>
   The skills challenge starts at 3:30 p.m. on the 18th green. The
$12,000 event matches eight pros with seven local media types.
Clearly the better players are defending champ Neumann, Pak,
Davies, McGann,
 &UR; Meg Mallon, Beth Daniel and  &UR; Juli Inkster, the winner of last
week's Welch's/Circle K Championship. The winning team earns
$5,000, with the money split between the pro and a charity
represented by the media member. &QL;

SMITH ENDORSES SCHOENFELD, RIPS COACHING CHANGE RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - On a day when Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld broke his
silence regarding his job security, General Manager Bobby Smith
snuffed a week of speculation with a declarative statement before
Monday night's game with Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things (rumors of a coaching change) take on a life of
their own and undermine the coach and the team,'' Smith said. ``Jim
Schoenfeld is our coach. There will be no coaching change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why I'm so irate and embarrassed. If I knew there was
someone in our organization who played a role in what I think was
pure fabrication and rumor, they would be ex-Coyotes today. It's
not how I run shop.''
</P>
<P>
   A reason the rumors gained momentum is that management didn't
squelch them from the start, which led to ``sourced reports'' that
the 1-0 victory over Anaheim, saved Schoenfeld's job. It was
thought that Schoenfeld would receive an extension of his contract
that has one year remaining after the team bolted to the league's
best start at 17-3-3, but it has not been offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all judged every day, myself included, but I'm telling
you we're not changing coaches,'' Smith said. ``If we continued not
playing well, there were all sorts of things I would have had to
consider.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I want and that's to play well and be one of eight
teams playing in the second round of the playoffs. One of the teams
grouped in there trying to win it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we haven't done since 1987 and it's where our
focus is.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld laughed at the theory that one game saved him, as did
Smith, who said, ``You don't make a major change based on something
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's look at that logically,'' Schoenfeld said Monday morning
before Smith's announcement. ``If the coach is good, you don't say,
`Oh boy, if you lose this one, you're toast.' If a coach is bad and
wins three in a row, you should still replace him. To me, the whole
thing about one game is moronic, really.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm wrong for the job and the team has won five in a row,
get the guy who's right. Have the guts to make a decision. Change
the coach, or change the tune, because I'm tired of hearing the
same old song.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said he doesn't think a member of the organization is
the source of such speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a hard time believing a responsible member of our
organization, who would be privy to that stuff, would be that
irresponsible _ actually, hockey-ignorant _ because it can only
hurt our team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if I win? Does that mean I get two games? What does that
do to the players as far as their responsibility goes? It gives
them an out. Even if they don't want it, it's there subconsciously.
That's the battle we face: `Guys, you've been given an out, it's up
to you whether you want to take it or not.' Hey, it might be the
kiss of death after all, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Schoenfeld said he saw no need to apologize for his team's
owning the third-best record in the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely satisfied because my best is given for the team
every day,'' he said. ``Frankly, that's all that matters. Where I
get my joy is when I'm on the ice with the players and when I'm
behind the bench with those guys. That's why I can take all this
other nonsense, put it where it belongs and do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   The players say they are solidly in Schoenfeld's camp. Smith
said the performance in the win over Anaheim demonstrated those
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our play impressed me,'' Smith said. ``With the rumors out
there, the players screamed out that they wanted to play for Jim
Schoenfeld. It was a good effort in a very emotional game.''

RANGERS TIE CAPITALS, 1-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All things considered, the Rangers probably got about
what they deserved on Monday night at Madison Square Garden when
they tied the Washington Capitals, 1-1. Weary from a busy schedule,
New York failed to hold a lead, but survived to gain 1 point in the
standings in the race for the final playoff berth in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, it was a forgettable game with a frantic overtime
period and a few memorable moments before it. One was the first
National Hockey League goal for Rumun Ndur, a Ranger rookie
defenseman. Another was what might be the final Garden appearance
for Washington's Dale Hunter, a veteran bully-boy who played the
villain's role as usual in a scrappy performance. And the Rangers
got another sharp performance from goalie Mike Richter, who stopped
33 of 34 shots.
</P>
<P>
   With 14 games remaining in their 82-game regular season
schedule, the Rangers have 67 points, tying them with Florida for
ninth place. Both teams trail Boston by 1 point in the battle for
the final playoff berth. But the Rangers have played two more games
than both the Bruins and the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who were playing their sixth game in nine days,
won't have to play again until Friday night, when they host
Buffalo. Coach John Muckler is happy for the break.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the worst schedule I've ever seen in my
life,'' Muckler said. ``Not only six games in nine nights, you're
playing twice back-to-back games. That's impossible. The team was
just dog tired. It's not fair to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Ndur was not complaining. His goal came in the first period, at
14 minutes and 33 seconds, when he slapped the puck past goalie
Olaf Kolzig. Ndur then went into a victory dance that deserves
inclusion on the season highlight reel. In his energetic jumping,
he almost landed on top of Gerard Gautheir, the linesman, who
avoided most contact by ducking out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't see me, he was so excited,'' Gauthier said. ``I
told him `I don't know if you will remember your first goal, but I
sure will.' No way I was going to stay there. He's a big guy.''
Ndur is 6 feet 2 inches and 222 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who has been playing for 19 seasons, sparked his team by
roughing up various Rangers. He exchanged shoves with Niklas
Sundstrom, a clean player. Later, he started a ruckus by coming to
an abrupt stop in front of Richter and spraying him with ice chips.
When other players joined the confrontation, Hunter located Brian
Leetch, the Ranger captain, and shoved a glove in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played against him for 12 years,'' Leetch said of Hunter,
``and, at least once a game, I've eaten his glove at some point.''
At the end of the period, Hunter roughed with Adam Graves but
declined an invitation to fight Darren Langdon. This led to an
exchange of angry words between the coaches behind the benches and
down the corridor they share at intermission.
</P>
<P>
   It also seemed to spark the Capitals. They tied the game at 1-1
at 11:44 of the third period on a goal by Enrico Ciccone, who shot
through traffic from the blue line to beat Richter after Washington
won a faceoff in the Ranger end.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitals made it to the Stanley Cup finals last spring, but
lost four consecutive games to the Detroit Red Wings. Washington
has been in a slump ever since, and is unlikely to make even the
first round of the tournament this season. Coming into the game,
the Capitals were nine points behind Boston. Several of their
players could be traded by next Tuesday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are undefeated in their last two games, 4-2-1 in
their last seven and 9-4-2 in their last 15. Richter said the best
might be yet to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to keep getting better,'' he said. As for
losing the lead, he was not discouraged. ``We were good enough to
re-group and not let that beat us,'' Richter said. ``One point is
better than none. We'll take the tie.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ They've pretty much heard all the names.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Portland Jail Blazers. The Trial Blazers. The Bail Raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Most anything negative that can be written or said about a team
of precocious young NBA players with problems, both off the court
and on, had been written and said about the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   These post-Clyde Drexler Blazers were the gangstas of the NBA,
the traveling road show of Hoodstock, and they seemed to enjoy that
image.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blazers are now being described another way _ the best
team in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Most point to the Utah Jazz as the league's top team, but an
argument could easily be made for Portland. And you wouldn't _ or
couldn't _ get much of argument on that point from the Rockets, who
were flogged 111-71 by the Blazers on March 7 and are seeking
revenge in tonight's rematch at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   But these Blazers aren't dwelling on that game as any indication
of what will happen tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, man, the one thing I've learned in my little short stint
in the league is that you have Scottie Pippen, you have Charles
Barkley, you have Dream (Hakeem Olajuwon), and you have a coach in
Rudy T who are up there (among the best in the league),'' said
Portland point guard Damon Stoudamire. ``All that psyching and
stuff, that won't work. I know they're probably sitting at home
getting ready to play. They're going to be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a dogfight, because they haven't forgotten
what happened. We're going to have to be ready to play, because
they're going to come at us with all they've got.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, so the Blazers are maturing. But what makes them so good?
</P>
<P>
   Depth, versatility and a willingness to sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that it's easy, and the bottom line is that it's
not over, but for the first 20 games, we've done a good job of
(juggling lineups and egos),'' said Portland coach Mike Dunleavy.
``Our guys have embraced the idea of winning. And the fact is that
because we have a lot of depth on our team, there are going to be
given nights, because guys are playing well, (somebody) may get
more minutes than usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if it happens to be at your position, you just have to
check your ego at the door and be satisfied with the fact that we
are winning, and that's what it takes to win. So far, it's worked
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   After letting Dallas hang around awhile, the Blazers
steamrollered the hapless Mavericks 106-91 Monday night for their
17th win in 21 games. Only Utah at 18-4 has a better record.
</P>
<P>
   It's how the Blazers are doing it that has teams around the
league casting a wary eye toward the Pacific Northwest. In a year
when teams are scrambling to find enough legitimate talent to stock
the roster, the Blazers come at you 11 deep. The members of their
second team _ Walt Williams, Jim Jackson, Greg Anthony, Stacey
Augmon and Kelvin Cato _ could all start most anywhere else in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do the Blazers have a lot of talent, but they have
lotto talent as well. Even though general manager Bob Whitsitt has
not had a lottery pick of his own to use in the draft, the Blazers
have either traded for or signed as free agents 10 players who were
taken in the lottery by other teams: Stoudamire, Isaiah Rider,
Brian Grant, Rasheed Wallace, Williams, Jackson, Augmon, Anthony,
Carlos Rogers and Bonzi Wells.
</P>
<P>
   And while that kind of depth is rare, the versatility the
Blazers possess is even more so. They can go big, running out a
front line that averages almost 7 feet across, or they can go small
and quick. That means a fast-breaking team, or a bunch that can
hammer you in the half-court set. Pick your poison.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, who sprained his ankle against the Mavericks on Monday,
can play all three frontcourt positions, and Jackson and Williams
can play point guard, shooting guard or small forward. Rider can
play small forward in a pinch, and Augmon can play shooting guard,
small forward or power forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Portland's strengths are) the chemistry and the different
combinations we can use,'' said Grant, the league's fifth-best
rebounder at 10.9 boards per game. ``Maybe one or two combinations
aren't working, but we can go with so many.''
</P>
<P>
   Depth like that can create problems, especially in this
stat-conscious, I-need-my-minutes NBA. But Dunleavy has managed to
defuse any problems, like when he sat down Stoudamire during the
fourth quarter in a recent string of games. Stoudamire, however,
said nothing, content that Portland was winning all those games
while Anthony ran the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, to me, is a very big step for us,'' Dunleavy said. ``It
doesn't matter who plays as long as we're winning, and I think that
is starting to sink in with our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other real problem facing the Blazers is the same one
that plagues most young teams _ complacency. They know they're
better than most teams and wind up playing at something less than
full effort.
</P>
<P>
   Like against Dallas on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a good attitude to have, because we're not that
good,'' Stoudamire said. ``We're not the old (Chicago) Bulls. But
we're human, and you tend to think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   They may not be the old Bulls, but they sure look like the
league's newest young bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning, and our losses have all been close (with the
exception of a 14-point setback to the Jazz),'' Wallace said. ``I
love the way we're playing.''

SALMON TO GO ON THREATENED LIST IN NORTHWEST
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Federal officials will formally declare on Tuesday
that nine wild salmon species in the Pacific Northwest are
threatened with extinction, the first listing under the 26-year-old
Endangered Species Act that affects an entire urban region, a
government official said.
</P>
<P>
   But while that announcement deals with fish, it is people _
especially the three million in the greater Seattle area _ who will
have to face the consequences of halting the decline of these once
mighty salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   They will almost surely pay more in taxes, to acquire land
around waterways and to buy out floodplains so rivers can reclaim
areas where the salmon once spawned. They are already being urged
by their local leaders to stop using fertilizers and pesticides,
voluntary efforts that may eventually become mandatory, county
officials said on Monday. They will probably face sharp new
restrictions on building, especially near streams and other
waterways.
</P>
<P>
   And at the heart of all these measures will be these questions:
Will people decide that these are all steps toward a better quality
of life in a region already consumed with worry that its lavish
natural splendor is under attack? Will they find, as Mayor Paul
Schell of Seattle likes to put it, that ``in working together to
save the salmon, it may turn out that the salmon saves us''? Or
will listing the salmon as threatened species, which in many ways
dwarfs the impact of the 1990 listing of the northern spotted owl
that set off its own environmental controversy, provoke a backlash
against the Endangered Species Act?
</P>
<P>
   The law allows officials more time to develop protections for
species listed as ``threatened'' than it does for those with the
even more serious classification of ``endangered.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Officials from Gov. Gary Locke on down have been formulating
plans for months in anticipation of the announcement, and they will
now be forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Endangered Species Act, unless steps are taken to
protect the affected species, governments and even private citizens
can face criminal penalties. But so far, unlike the spotted owl
fight, in which many leaders in logging and timber towns bitterly
opposed the listing and even mocked the owl, there has been little
opposition to the proposed listing. And no one is belittling the
salmon, a symbol of the region.
</P>
<P>
   The salmon species, including the Puget Sound chinook, or king
salmon, have been hurt in all ways by human development in recent
decades, by pollution and runoff that includes sewage and chemicals
from fertilizers and by construction that in many cases has simply
closed off waterways. Farther inland, their runs have been
significantly reduced by the huge dams that provide the region's
famously cheap and abundant hydropower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is recovery of the salmon,'' said Ron Sims, the King
County executive, who oversees an area that includes the city of
Seattle and who has repeatedly said that he believed residents here
were willing to pay more and take other steps to protect the fish.
``However, our ultimate purpose is to restore our environment so
that we may provide for the coexistence of people and fish in the
Pacific Northwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement on Tuesday, by the National Marine Fisheries
Service, will extend Endangered Species Act protections on wild
salmon found in nearly every watershed in Washington state, as well
as in parts of the Willamette Valley in Oregon. The fish include
the Puget Sound chinook, the Lower Columbia River chinook, Upper
Columbia spring chinook, Lake Ozette sockeye, Hood Canal summer
chum, Lower Columbia chum and the mid-Columbia steelhead. Decisions
were delayed for six months on four other salmon runs in California
and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said on Monday that they believed that salmon
restoration could amount to ``life by a thousand stitches instead
of death by a thousand cuts.'' But the devil will be in the
details, and some political and business leaders have said some
contemplated steps were far too Draconian to pass public muster.
</P>
<P>
   The state agriculture commissioner, Jim Jesernig, said recently
that state officials were already getting ``beaten up by all
sides,'' by Indian leaders and environmental groups who believe
that the most likely measures will not do enough to protect the
salmon and by homebuilders and farmers, some of whom, Jesernig
said, were already calling state officials ``jack-booted Nazis.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, many local officials here said they were convinced that
there was a way to help the salmon and help people at the same
time, especially since many people here list ``runaway growth'' or
``sprawl'' as one of their dominant concerns. And the officials
think there is a way to do it without the legal rancor that has
attended species listings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've looked very hard at many of those cases,'' Tim Ceis,
director of the Endangered Species Act policy coordination office
for King County, said on Monday. ``The lawyers were the ones making
the money. Nobody was spending any money on the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   But lawsuits may be inevitable, from both sides. The state's
Building Industry Association, representing developers, says the
salmon issue is being used to stop growth and that the most likely
proposals for building restrictions show that local regulators have
``lost all common sense.'' With the Seattle metropolitan area
projected to add as many as one million people in the next 25
years, some skeptics say the fish do not stand a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups, on the other hand, say the issue can be a
winner for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Special-interest defenders of the status quo who oppose real
action to save salmon would have you believe the listings will
produce a shattered economy, a Cuba-on-the-Sound,'' said Tim
Stearns, executive director of Save our Wild Salmon, an
environmental group. ``That kind of thinking is laughable, and in
fact, the opposite is true. If our governor and state Legislature
get serious about salmon restoration, we would see enormous gains
in our quality of life and real economic benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   While the restrictions are likely to place new limits on fish
catches in many Washington rivers, they are not likely to change
the diets of Pacific Northwesterners or anyone else in the United
States who fancies the taste of salmon: most salmon eaten in this
country is flown in from Alaska, or raised in domestic pens here,
or in Canada and South America.

IT'S NOW OFFICIAL _ L.A. WILL HOST Y2K CONVENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With four simple words _ ``the Democrats are
coming'' _ Los Angeles won the competition to host the Democratic
National Convention in August 2000 when the party's presidential
ticket will be picked.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Committee chairman-designate Joe Andrew made
the announcement Monday at a politically star-studded ceremony at
the Convention Center where he used the city's unique bid, which
was put together by private groups rather than government, as a
campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the Republicans, the 2000 Democratic convention will be
sponsored by the private sector with the cooperation of the public
sector, not the other way around,'' Andrew said from beneath an
arch of red, white and blue balloons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citizens of California will get the benefit and not the
burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Final action is expected Friday when the City Council meets to
approve the contracts. City approval is needed because Los Angeles
will be responsible for traffic and security at the event _
estimated at about $6 million of the $34.5 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   For Mayor Richard Riordan, virtually the only Republican in a
sea of Democrats in local politics, winning the convention
competition over Boston and Denver made him ``the proudest mayor in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the gateway to the world and the world's gateway to
America,'' Riordan said. ``Los Angeles is not just back, it's
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis, whose election in November was credited with
being one of the points cited in the selection of Los Angeles,
praised the choice and offered his own vision of how to begin the
event.
</P>
<P>
   ``In choosing this city, the DNC has affirmed that Los Angeles
is back,'' Davis said. ``Having weathered riots and recessions,
floods and fires, Los Angeles is prepared to resume its role as one
of the world's great urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the 1984 Olympics, there was a torch relay across the
country. I would like to see the nominee do the same thing as we
prepare to open this convention. The nominee should campaign in
Arizona and Nevada, Washington and Oregon. He or she should go to
Northern California, the Silicon Valley to the San Fernando Valley,
to make this a convention that involves people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles bid was unique for a political convention in
that most of the cost is being borne by the LA Convention 2000
committee of business and civic leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The committee is co-chaired by billionaire Eli Broad, Democratic
activist Bill Wardlaw, grocery magnate Ron Burkle and DreamWorks
SKG executive David Geffen. Burkle recently joined the committee in
its efforts. All four are major contributors to Democratic
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Broad said the DNC decision reaffirms the role Los Angeles plays
in the nation as it prepares for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the millennium city,'' Broad said. ``We are in the
middle of a renaissance and we can't wait to showcase the city and
its people.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad cited the work on the Staples Center, which will be the
main site of the convention, as well as the other projects under
way in downtown, such as the Disney Concert Hall, the new Cathedral
of Our Lady of Angels and possibly on the Coliseum for a new
professional football team he is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The return on the investment is expected to be between $137
million and $150 million in tax revenues from the 30,000 visitors
the convention will draw and neighboring areas also are expected to
benefit from increased tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said the dates of the convention have yet to be set, but
that he is looking at either the week of Aug. 14 or Aug. 21, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew had served as head of the site selection committee that
visited Los Angeles last year and recently was named to become the
party's next chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it odd to be making recommendations to myself,''
Andrew said. ``But I was convinced early on that the convention
should come here.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been some speculation in recent months the city's bid
was in trouble because of the way it was being financed as well as
the arrogance many DNC members perceived from Californians _
particularly over their emphasis on the state's political power
with its 54 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew dismissed some of those concerns as ``mere speculation
and rumor'' that occurs around every convention bid.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since Los Angeles served as a host city.
Its first, and last, political convention was in 1960 when
Democrats nominated John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the city had been asked by both parties to bid
for their 1996 conventions. However, Riordan declined, saying the
city had not fully recovered from the Northridge Earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Both Democrats and Republicans have fared poorly in carrying the
state when conventions were held here.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats nominated James Cox in San Francisco in 1920 but he
lost to Republican Warren G. Harding. In 1960, Kennedy won the
nomination in Los Angeles but lost the state to Richard Nixon. In
1984, Walter Mondale was nominated in San Francisco but lost
California to Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Eisenhower carried California in 1956 after being
nominated in San Francisco. Barry Goldwater, also nominated in San
Francisco, lost the state to Lyndon Johnson in 1964 and Bob Dole
lost California in 1996 after being nominated in San Diego.

NO ANSWERS FROM PHOENIX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; PHOENIX _ The NFL might someday expand to Los Angeles or
Houston, but it is becoming increasingly clear that a decision here
at the league's winter meetings this week is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of a late rally of support for Houston and owner
trepidation over the league's suggested L.A. solution has created a
stalemate. The expansion committee adjourned again Monday without
recommending membership. It will convene again this morning in
search of a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have 24 votes for Los Angeles, We don't have 24 votes
for Houston. We don't have 24 votes to expand,'' said Carolina
owner Jerry Richardson, the co-chair of the expansion committee.
``What we've got are problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member expansion committee can recommend a franchise be
granted to either city, but a 24-vote majority of the league owners
is required before the franchise is awarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a consensus,'' said Buffalo owner Ralph Wilson.
``We go round and round. Houston has a stadium. L.A. is a key
market, but its bids are nebulous. I don't think we'll even take a
vote on it before these meetings are done.
</P>
<P>
   ``But who knows? Things can happen fast around here. Nothing
ever surprises me.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. A few weeks ago, key players at the highest
level of the NFL had devised a scenario to give L.A. a tenuous bid
that would attract other bidders besides Michael Ovitz (Carson) and
Ed Roski (New Coliseum) and keep Houston as a backup.
</P>
<P>
   That idea is still being advanced. But its backers didn't count
on the reticence of several owners to expansion in general and
Houston businessman Robert McNair's aggressive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McNair's campaign had the advantage of a face, plus a committed
wallet, to go with the name. While the league kept the Ovitz and
Roski bids somewhat at bay, McNair rounded up support, so much so
that he believes he has a majority of the 12 votes on the expansion
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever comes up and says, `We'll vote for you,' '' said
McNair. ``But based on what they say, I think I have a majority.
Someone said the committee took a straw vote Sunday and it was 12-0
in favor of L.A. I think that was the vote to adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult issue to begin with. Owners come knowing
they have a decision to make on expansion, but they really don't
get the chance to look at the proposals until they get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that they have, some owners favor Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh owner Dan Rooney spoke on Houston's behalf Monday
during the general session, Kansas City owner Lamar Hunt said he
personally favors Houston, and Dallas owner Jerry Jones conceded
Houston has a good case.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego owner Alex Spanos emphatically supported Houston, in
part because it has a firm commitment from local politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me what Los Angeles has got?'' asked Spanos. ``I've said
100 times that I want a team in L.A., but they have to want it,
too. I want L.A. (politicians) to come to me and say, `Here's what
we'll do,' just as Houston has.
</P>
<P>
   ``It unfortunately took Bud Adams leaving to get Houston where
it is today. It took Baltimore 10 years and St. Louis seven to
learn the lesson. It took Cleveland six months.''
</P>
<P>
   Carson mayor Peter Fajardo, whose city is committed to a $180
million investment, said, ``We're still hopeful,'' despite Monday's
lack of a decision. A spokesman for Ovitz did not return phone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Roski, the Kings owner and industrial real estate baron, took
the news in stride and thinks L.A. is in the lead of this race. ``I
don't think they ever promised us a decision (here). Their intent
was to find some direction,'' he said. He said no one from the
league has handed him a list of conditions he has to meet or even
mentioned what the franchise fee will be. But he's prepared to
follow through if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably would respond like we have from the start,'' he
said. ``They suggested we redesign the stadium; we did. They
suggested we add to the ownership group, and we did. We're open to
anything they might say.''
</P>
<P>
   That would include a private response to any league request for
more public money, as Spanos indicated. The New Coliseum proposal
includes more than $300 million in public investment, but most of
it is in the form of already completed infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very clear on this,'' Roski said. ``Los Angeles
does not have the ability to do any (more public financing) than it
has. And what they've done is significant. If there's something
else they want, we can deal with it privately.''
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said he is hopeful that the meeting
will produce some kind of decision. He said the best possible
situation in L.A. would be for all interested parties to unify
themselves. At this stage of things, something like that might have
to take place before the owners are ready to return to L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Bowlen, who is pro-L.A., said the league might need to look
at this as a two-part process _ give one city an expansion team and
work with the other as a future home for an existing team with
stadium concerns.
</P>
<P>
   McNair wrote letters to eight owners saying he'd like to buy
their teams and move them to Houston if he doesn't get an expansion
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we can wait forever,'' Roski said. `` Our facility isn't
going away.''
</P>
<P>
   The league meetings adjourn Wednesday and the owners will meet
again in May.

TCU, NIT MAKING GOOD OL' PARDNERS
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fort Worth tilted its Stetson back, propped
its boots on the back of a purple seat and sent the NIT a message
at Daniel-Meyer Coliseum Monday night _ ``Y'all come on back now,
ya' hear?''
</P>
<P>
   It was an offer a tournament desperate for dynamic energy and
attention couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   TCU and Fort Worth put on an impressive and powerful show for
the NIT folks. The Frogs rocked Nebraska, 101-89, in a second-round
game and a boisterous sellout crowd rocked the roof at
Daniel-Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   The victory earned the Frogs a third-round home game against
Oregon on Wednesday night. Tipoff will be at 8:30 as the second
half of an ESPN doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great win for us and the crowd was awesome,'' TCU
coach Billy Tubbs said. ``We've had great crowds before, but I
don't know that we've had a better one than the one that was here
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a slogan Milwaukee once used during a World Series,
``What a time, what a team, what a town!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, it is just the National Invitation Tournament, not the Big
Dance, and maybe you had to be there to appreciate the excitement
Monday night. But by the look and the sound of the crowd, you
probably were. They said 7,166 fans were in the place. It sounded
more like 71,166.
</P>
<P>
   This, on a night when TCU students were on spring break.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-10 Frogs, who bounced the Cornhuskers out of the
tournament despite playing without star center Lee Nailon for most
of the second half, looked more like the Purple Horde of the first
half of the season than the team that lost six of its last 10 games
in the regular season and totally collapsed against BYU in the
opening round of the WAC tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``We probably played better in the second half tonight,'' Tubbs
said, ``than we have all season.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Tubbs had his best player _ Nailon _ sitting beside him on
the bench for a 12-minute stretch while the Frogs were taking
control of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous about the team keeping it up when I came out,''
admitted Nailon, who picked up his fourth foul with 15:03 to play
and left with the scored tied at 55. ``But they stayed into it. At
first I was anxious to get back in, but after a while I just said,
`Hey, they've got it going good. I'll just stay right where I'm
at.'''
</P>
<P>
   Marquise Gainous, who elected not to play in that critical loss
to BYU because of a hand bruise (doctors had cleared him), was
magnificent, pounding home a game-high 30 points, pulling down nine
rebounds and stepping in to defend against Big 12 player of the
year Venson Hamilton when Nailon sat down.
</P>
<P>
   When Nailon checked back into the game with 3:25 to play, the
Frogs led by 11, 88-77.
</P>
<P>
   All five Frogs starters hit double figures, including 20 for
Nailon, who played only 28 minutes but hit seven of nine from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   It was TCU's second NIT victory, following Wednesday night's
72-71 win at Kansas State, and the first time the Frogs have broken
the 80-point barrier in their past seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tweaked things a little bit,'' Tubbs admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Tubbs may have finally understood that he couldn't will this
team to be something it's not. From his playbook of 24 defensive
schemes, Tubbs threw out all but two: the man-to-man and a tricky
1-3-1 zone ``we're just now beginning to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of asking his players to operate 10 different offensive
attacks, they now use two or three.
</P>
<P>
   He has gone to a six-man rotation, using Shannon Long as his
only sub whenever possible. He lets Nailon slip out on the
perimeter now and then and the big man has responded with some
surprising 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having fun again,'' Tubbs said. ``We're having fun at
practice and carrying that over into the games. The loss to BYU
took a lot of pressure off.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly took the Frogs, who began the season ranked 24th in
the country, right out of the NCAA Tournament, which might not be
so bad after all. Instead of a soundly squashed toad in the NCAA
sea, they're suddenly beginning to look like a mighty big Frog in
the NIT pond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have been in Milwaukee \Rfor an NCAA subregional\S,''
Tubbs sniffed, ``talking about getting our butts beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they're one victory away from a trip to the NIT final
four in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lee Nailon would be great \Rfor the NIT\S in New
York,'' Tubbs said, turning politician. ``Heck, I think we'd be
great in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The NIT could certainly use the personality and Tubbs' array of
one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating Nebraska is a lot like beating Southern Cal,'' Tubbs
said. ``They both have great football programs.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a message in there somewhere, I think.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NIT does want it wants to,'' Tubbs said before learning
that TCU would be awarded the home court Wednesday. ``They can send
us to Afghanistan if they want to.''
</P>
<P>
   No way. Fort Worth and the Frogs made a point Monday night, and
they made it loud and clear. The NIT, to its credit, was too smart
and too desperate for a little pizzazz to ignore it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Afghanistan lost in the first round. nn

PULSE REMAINS STRONG FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It has gone from a flicker to a flame.
</P>
<P>
   Given up for dead a week ago, the Kings suddenly are very much
alive.
</P>
<P>
   With their third consecutive strong effort, this one against one
of the best teams in the National Hockey League, the Kings took
another big step in their late-season bid to get back in the
playoff race. They defeated the Eastern Conference-leading Ottawa
Senators on Monday night by a 4-0 margin before a Forum crowd of
12,640.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake and Philippe Boucher scored late in the second period
to break up a scoreless tie, and Donald Audette and Sean O'Donnell
provided third-period insurance goals. It paved the way for the
Kings to put together a three-game winning streak, their longest
since they won five straight in late December and early January.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Fiset stopped 29 shots to record his second shutout
this season and the 14th of his career. Fiset has allowed only
three goals during the winning streak, stopping 87 of 89 shots on
goal.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 games remaining, the Kings (26-36-5) moved to within
three points of idle Calgary and Edmonton, which share the final
Western Conference playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators (38-20-8) lost their second straight following a
five-game winning streak, and fell to 0-6 at the Forum, an arena
they will not be visiting again.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, the Kings outshot Ottawa by a meager 5-4
margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play the trap so well,'' Audette said. ``Everything is
clogged up in the middle and it is so hard to get something going,
so that is why you have to get your speed from down low and come
with speed and one guy late. If we do that, we have a good chance
to enter the zone pretty easy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second period, the Kings heeded Audette's game plan and
outshot the Senators 17-10. Again and again, a King would join the
play late to receive a pass and take a shot. But for most of the
second period, the outstanding play of Senators goalie Ron Tugnutt
_ who began the night with a microscopic 1.60 goals-against average
_ negated the Kings' opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 6:07 to play in the period, Ian Laperriere drew a
roughing penalty from Senators defenseman Lance Pitlick, giving the
Kings their second power play of the game. They wasted little time
capitalizing. The Kings gained control of the puck, moving it
around until it finally landed on Blake's stick at the left boards.
With Ray Ferraro in front of the net, Blake fired a slap shot that
beat Tugnutt to the short side at 14:38. It was Blake's ninth goal
this season, his fifth in the last nine games, and the 100th of his
nine-year NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes later, Boucher scored his second goal of
the season, a shot off a pass from Ferraro that banked off two
Senators in front, then off the right goal post, and finally past
Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings broke the game open early in the third, Audette and
O'Donnell scoring 44 seconds apart. Audette scored when he got
behind the Senators' defense and held off Pitlick with one arm
while knocking the puck in with the other. O'Donnell's goal was
just his second this season.

   MEXICO-CORRUPTION (Washington) _ Tale of a Mexican Drug Case
That Might Have Been: Early last year, as undercover U.S. Customs
agents neared the end of the biggest investigation ever conducted
into the illegal movement of drug money, money men working with
Mexico's most powerful cocaine cartel said they had clients,
including Mexico's powerful defense minister, who needed to launder
$1.15 billion. But rather than continue the undercover operation,
Clinton administration officials ordered it shut down. Senior
administration officials denied that foreign policy influenced
their decision, saying they were moved primarily by concerns for
its security. By Tim Golden.

stand waiting for a bus outside the village of Stanovac. As they

   SEATTLE _ Think of it this way, Milwaukee Bucks: The $25,000
fine that you must pay on behalf of George Karl is merely a down
payment on trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to know when the full bill will come due. But it will be as

</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I enjoy George. Upon his departure from the

   Karl will wear out the Bucks, as he did the Sonics, as he did
the Warriors, as he did the Cavaliers. It's his nature.
</P>
<P>
   Because he's a good coach, he will rack up W's. He just can't do
it without a hard price. He's not alone in that _ see Billy Martin,
Jimmy Johnson, Red Auerbach, Vince Lombardi, Pat Riley.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Karl doesn't burn out his players; he
blows himself up. And over such stupid stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's whopper fine from the NBA is a good example. Karl was
nailed for something that had nothing to do with a game, a bad
call, a league ruling or a civil or criminal action.
</P>
<P>
   The fine was because Karl, who had been warned by the NBA to
stop, continued his petty selfishness toward another franchise in
an embarrassing, public way. In other professions, it falls into
the category of ``conduct unbecoming ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Karl's words certainly weren't a firable offense, but players
and coaches are bound by NBA contracts to refrain from excessive
disparagement of teams and the league.
</P>
<P>
   I guarantee he won't get it.
</P>
<P>
   Even if what Karl said was accurate _ and a lot of it isn't _
his day and his rhetoric as Sonic coach are so over in Seattle that
he might as well be peddling 1962 World's Fair programs.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, still a good coach with a good team and a
Seattle newsmaker when his new club meets his old club. That's why
the P-I sent reporter Ronald Tillery to Milwaukee ahead of last
Wednesday's Sonics-Bucks contest.
</P>
<P>
   The story plan was to go easy on the stale Walker-bashing and
heavy on the good start with the new team. Instead, Karl directed
the interview back to his vendetta, which was cited as the basis
for the fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wally totally discontinued the communication,'' Karl was
quoted as saying. ``He said it's because I talk too much. I say
it's because he's incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were very few negative things about Seattle outside of
Wally. I believe in doing the right things and I don't think he
does. He's a politician. He's a trickster. And that's the opposite
of how I handle my life.''
</P>
<P>
   That, in brief, is the kind of rhetoric that ended Karl's tenure
in Seattle. It's not so much that Karl was leaking sensitive
information; it's the unrelenting criticism he was passing about
his bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the degree of truth in Karl's diatribes, and whatever
protections are offered by the First Amendment, anyone who's ever
had to work for a living knows that one publicly trashes a boss at
some peril to one's continued employment.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a scoop, eh?
</P>
<P>
   Yet nearly everyone around Karl during his tenure, including his
assistants, felt compelled to make the point again and again,
because he equated stifling his criticism with the despised word
``politics.''
</P>
<P>
   They begged him to shut up, not because they didn't necessarily
agree with him, but because the campaign helped no one but the
newspapers. The truth of that contention was right in front of
Karl: Shawn Kemp's pouts over money helped put an end to the
1996-97 Sonic season.
</P>
<P>
   The Karl-Walker tiff wasn't merely the inevitable basketball
disagreements between ownership and staff. Karl disliked Walker
from his roots (a Virginia Cavalier instead of a Carolina Tar Heel)
to his suits (Armani instead of sweats).
</P>
<P>
   He also never liked Walker's style: A by-the-book operation that
conflicted with Karl's stretch-the-rules methodology. Which makes
even more hilarious Karl's claim that Walker is a trickster. If
Karl were unleashed, he would make Rick Neuheisel and the
University of Minnesota's academic support staff look papal.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the hypocrisy, Karl's ultimate betrayal of his allies and
his own words _ never mind his bosses _ is that he could never
subsume his visceral dislike for the greater good of the team and
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   I'm almost always a fan of those who question authority. But in
the context of team sports where the primary goal of all employees
is to win championships, the boat-rocker can go only so far before
all rowers get wet.
</P>
<P>
   The option always exists to leave the boat, but Karl found 3
million reasons to stay to the end of his Seattle contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has a better deal in what he claims is a better
situation. But that situation finds itself $25,000 lighter for no
valid reason whatsoever other than Karl's lack of maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, for an NBA franchise, $25,000 is chump change. Just as
assuredly for Milwaukee, it's only the beginning.

MARINERS CAN COUNT ON ALEX RODRIGUEZ _ FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ His team was still over at the ballpark, putting
together a comeback win over the Brewers on Monday. Alex Rodriguez
was in the clubhouse, changing from his uniform into his workout
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   That's what an 0-for-3 day in the Cactus League will do for you.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez left the game in the sixth inning, but instead of
hitting the showers, Rodriguez the major league shortstop
transformed himself into Rodriguez the 23-year-old in need of extra
batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up one of his signature black bats, the kind he has
specially made for him _ just like Ken Griffey Jr. does. Then
Rodriguez picked up another, far less glamorous number _ a
big-barreled piece of hickory all yucked up with pine tar, dirt and
goodness knows what else.
</P>
<P>
   With his choice weapons in hand, Rodriguez strode deliberately
out of the clubhouse and headed toward a bay of batting cages about
100 yards in back of the Mariners' spring training facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was horse(expletive) today,'' Rodriguez said in an
exaggerated monotone, just to make sure no one missed the point
that he was fabulously unhappy with his day's work at the plate.
``Can't swing the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   When a lone passerby suggested that things would probably come
around for the former American League batting champion who plays as
if he refuses to be anything less than MVP material, Rodriguez
nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hope so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there he stood, in a cutoff T-shirt and dark blue
compression shorts with a rip across the back of one leg, swinging
again and again at balls sent flying toward him by the pitching
machine.
</P>
<P>
   In the shaded cage, with not a soul around except a buddy
feeding the balls into the chute, the whirring sound of the
pitching-machine motor was broken only by the crack of Rodriguez's
bat.
</P>
<P>
   He smacked about 50 or 60 pitches into the netting. Then, his
arms tiring, Rodriguez declared the count to be at 3-2. He then
proceeded to ``foul off'' three more pitches before declaring the
final ball he hit to be, you got it, a home run.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single. Not a double. Not a foul ball, but a homer,
meaning that the pride of the Mariners _ or at least one of them _
had turned a negative situation into a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring is for work,'' Rodriguez said later, after he was
satisfied his timing and bat speed were now sufficiently up to
snuff.
</P>
<P>
   There is something intensely deliberate and determined about
Rodriguez, traits that have not wavered in his four seasons with
the Mariners, and already have led him to AL Player of the Year,
the 40/40 club and batting champ honors.
</P>
<P>
   What has wavered, however, is Rodriguez's faith in his future
with the M's _ a topic that has been, and will be, beaten to death
from now until the day Rodriguez, like Griffey, is either signed,
traded or whatever by the sticker-shocked Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, in the middle of spring training for a season Rodriguez
said the M's will have to overachieve in to succeed (``But, hey,
we're definitely due to overachieve. We've underachieved so much
the past couple of years.''), Rodriguez was again asked about his
future.
</P>
<P>
   Waves of TV, radio and print reporters feel obliged to ask it
and, frankly, Rodriguez is not at all shy about answering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see. We're still some players away from where we want to
be,'' Rodriguez said about Topic No. 1, which still eclipses talk
about where the M's will finish in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to win. I'll be better able to answer that
question in about 18 months,'' said Rodriguez, whose four-year deal
(a steal considering the Nomar Garciaparra and Derek Jeter
contracts) expires after the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez signed that deal two years ago for security, since he
wanted to ensure that his mother and family would never be without
money. But at the time he signed his extension, Rodriguez did joke
that the next deal he signs will not be for security.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain: Rodriguez said Monday he is completely
open-minded about remaining a Mariner.
</P>
<P>
   He is not automatically out of here, he said. He still loves the
fans and city of Seattle, which is a good endorsement from a very
poised, slick Miami native who would certainly thrive in the bright
lights of New York or Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez still is not far enough removed _ time-wise,
emotionally or competitively _ from the magic of '95. There seems a
part of him that still hopes Mariner ownership and the front office
again can put a winner on the field and restore that level of
competitiveness to the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we had Randy Johnson, Jeff Nelson and Norm Charlton
that year,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez also gave some indication that his situation, no
matter what happens, will never get as ugly as what happened with
Johnson _ though with a shark of an agent like Scott Boras, it is
tough to imagine hardball not being played on Rodriguez's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Rodriguez is not shying away from opportunities to
gently remind the Mariners that he is definitely looking for them
to make a commitment to fielding a winner. Like Griffey said this
winter, the ball is in their hand.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rodriguez likes the new kid playing second base
next to him. Carlos Guillen, who arrived from Houston in the
Johnson trade, should make a difference, and not just defensively,
where the M's were miserable last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say he's going to have a very productive offensive year. I
say he hits .280, 15 homers and 60 RBIs. Write that down and you'll
be a genius, I guarantee,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Which was about one of the only things Rodriguez would
guarantee.

OFFEAT OR BASIC: 10 NYC GUIDES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The only thing spinning faster than the machines turning out New
York guidebooks is the city itself. Publishers cannot possibly keep
up with the construction crews and busy chefs, but they sure try.
</P>
<P>
   I have been accumulating paperbacks, and in just a few weeks
gathered a stack of 23, not counting ones for people who live in
the city, like ``Short Bicycle Rides.''
</P>
<P>
   For this column, I've winnowed the list to those that appear of
widest use to Americans who are going to visit New York, and three
guides for specialized audiences: parents with young children and
nature lovers.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a word of advice: When shopping for a guide, do not
be persuaded by the 1999 on the cover, or copyright date. Most
guides are researched more than a year in advance. The easiest way
to carbon-date an edition is to check entries on the American
Museum of Natural History. If it does not say that the Hayden
Planetarium is shut, in renovation or otherwise inaccessible, it
was written before January 1997, or, worse, in ignorance of an
important change in a major attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Do not select a guidebook for maps: the free subway, bus and
combination transit maps are constantly updated, and there are
commercial maps, like Zagat's restaurant map, for special purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The two standard guidebooks first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fodor's 99 New York City'' credits a list of 14 authors and is
$14.50. There is lots of condensed information organized for
walking and sightseeing by area, with restaurants by type. Although
the restaurant listings identify the cross streets for addresses,
an essential, the copious bar listings do not. Two pages in the
back with books and videos may not belong in a guidebook, but they
are eclectic fun: the city sits for its portrait in ``The Invisible
Man'' by Ralph Ellison as well as ``The Thin Man'' by Dashiell
Hammett, and lots of others. A Rand McNally map can be detached;
others are in the text.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frommer's 99 New York City'' by David Doty with Cynthia S.
Baker (Macmillan U.S.A., $14.95) contains many odd things; for
example, that the subway ``stinks,'' which is not normally the
case, and is ``scary.'' Doty is an authority on Paris, and it may
be that New York runs a poor second in his affections. The book is
strong on ``cultural icons'' like Grand Central Terminal, and other
architecture. Hotels and restaurants are organized by area. I noted
errors in the ``medical requirement'' section for foreigners, but
this may not have wide implications. A Frommer's map may be
detached, and there are two-color maps.
</P>
<P>
   Next come two with a slightly oblique approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Unofficial Guide to New York City'' by Eve Zibart and Bob
Sehlinger with Jim Leff (Macmillan U.S.A., $15.95) is the first try
at New York for the ``unofficial'' writers, who began their travels
in Orlando at least 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This one must have taken a long time because the book flunks the
Planetarium test, saying it will be shut ``until at least 1998''
(it is due to reopen in 2000). But the book has a nice outspoken
tone; for example, ``learn the New York street walk: fast and
confident ... avoid the telltale clenched, fearful rush.''
</P>
<P>
   Full restaurant reviews rate the food quality on a scale of 0 to
100; the attractions get stars, and pointers to important parts of
the attraction. The safety chapter is tops, both for information
and attitude. No pictures, no maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Complete Idiot's Travel Guide to New York City'' by Bruce
Murphy and Alessandra de Rosa (Macmillan U.S.A., $15.95) is one of
10 cities in the Complete Idiot series, but I still cannot picture
myself in the street reading one.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, a good job. It uses icons to point up important or
curious facts. It includes the usual features: safety, getting
around, hotels, restaurants, major sights. The list of bars and
clubs is short enough to show that this is not a major fixation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Despite niggling errors, the authors have it right on a number
of things, such as tipping in restaurants _ double the tax _ and
how to get a good Sunday brunch _ go early. Lots of graphics and
maps.
</P>
<P>
   Here are three that are useful as supplements to more basic
texts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Out New York,'' published by Penguin Books, was produced
in its sixth edition by a cast of hundreds ($14.95). Replete with
ads, pictures and a lorryful of attitude, this is the
British-derived guide to hipness. A picture of people gazing at
fish displays in Chinatown bears this caption: ``Chinese
checker-outers: Local residents shop for raw deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Not strong on architecture, but with lots of scene, this guide
is popular with young people. Older travelers might find the
typefaces minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frommer's Irreverent Guide to Manhattan'' by Ian McMahan and
Jordan Simon is in its second edition (Macmillan U.S.A., $12.95).
The sections start out with ``The Lowdown,'' but the slapdash
snobbery does not always work. ``Must-sees for second-time visitors
from Peoria'' is a sample. The research needs updating, too:
Brendan Byrne Arena is now Continental Airlines Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mad Monks' Guide to New York City'' by James Crotty and
Michael Lane (the Monks), published by Macmillan U.S.A. ($15.95),
will probably offend everyone, but has moments of high hilarity. In
a list of ``What We Hate About New York 1999'' is the following:
``Frat boy cum stockbroker cum bridge-and-tunnel weekend hangouts
that line the Upper East Side.''
</P>
<P>
   It includes interviews, photographs with a Weegee squint and a
list of songs about New York. The information is up to date, but
this is not a basic guidebook, and it is not for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   And the three narrow-focus guides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frommer's New York City With Kids,'' sixth edition, by Holly
Hughes (Macmillan U.S.A., $15.95) had its origins in ``The Candy
Apple: New York With Kids'' by Bubbles Fisher. Ms. Hughes, a worth
successor, has three young children and, as would be expected from
a West Sider, knows that the word to apply to the Hayden
Planetarium is ``razed.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a wonderful ``treasure hunt'' for the American Museum of
Natural History and a list of books to prepare children of almost
any age. Restaurants with more than one branch are listed under
``The Chain Gang.''
</P>
<P>
   ``New York's 50 Best Places to Go Birding in and Around the Big
Apple'' by John Thaxton (City &AMP; Company, $15). The first 82 pages
in this pocket guide concern places in the city. Thaxton's paean to
the Jamaica Wildlife Refuge will guide out-of-towners to pure joy:
``And in winter, owls roost in the woodland gardens and hawks and
falcons cruise over the ponds, sometimes scaring thousands of ducks
into flight.'' It includes pen-and-ink sketches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nature Walks in and Around New York City'' by Sheila Buff
(Appalachian Mountain Club, $12.95). A hundred of this book's 350
pages concern New York City. It is complete with maps, trail
guides, phone numbers, distances, some small photographs and other
data usually found in a.m.C. guides.
</P>
<P>
   This is not poetry, but it's packed with facts. The entry on
Inwood Hill Park has geological information, though the book
virtually bypasses the Reservoir in Central Park, saying it's for
joggers. Clay Pits Pond State Park on Staten Island, one of the few
state parks in the city, gets a good entry, including how to get
there by mass transit.

VISITING CARNAC  
 DUBLIN LITERARY TOURS  
 JAPANESE RAIL PASSES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 21) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE MacNEILLE (af)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Can you tell me when Carnac, the French
archeological park, is open to the public? I have heard that access
is restricted. _ Lionel P. Herd, Seattle(end italics) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In recent years, the trampling of vegetation caused by the
sheer volume of visitors has prompted French park officials to
limit access to Carnac to the summer. But this year there are plans
to open the prehistoric site during the 1999-2000 off-season as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Carnac, near the Breton coast, and just north of the town of
Carnac, is the name given to the barren countryside that is strewn
with thousands of enigmatically placed stones dating from Neolithic
times. Many of these huge stones are arranged in parallel rows;
some mark dolmens, or ancient burial sites.
</P>
<P>
   The meaning of the menhirs, or standing stones _ some as high as
60 feet _ has been endlessly debated. The most popular theories
assign them religious or astronomical significance.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1991, the site attracted 800,000 visitors a year. But then
the ministry of culture, which oversees the site, discovered that
the damage caused by thousands of tourists walking on the heather,
prickly juniper and other delicate vegetation that helped anchor
the stones to the ground was causing some of the menhirs to be
displaced. As a result, visits to the site were limited to small
groups during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Plans now call for opening the park to individual, unguided
visits in the off-season from Oct. 1 to April 1, 2000. Admission
will be free.
</P>
<P>
   During the busier summer months, the park will continue to be
open to groups of 25 for guided tours only, with a limit of 180
people a day. The tours, which are offered by the site's visitor
center, cost $5.50, and last an hour and a half.
</P>
<P>
   By calling the center in advance, it is possible to find out
when a group visit is scheduled for the day you're visiting and if
the quota of visitors has been filled. The number is (33-2)
97.52.89.99.
</P>
<P>
   BLB Tourisme, based in nearby Auray, offers tours to the site,
including a half-day trip. The total cost is $150, regardless of
group size. Information: (33-2) 97.56.60.86.
</P>
<P>
   You may also be interested in stopping at the Prehistoric
Museum, in the center of the town of Carnac, near the mayor's
office. The museum contains numerous Carnac artifacts, including
pottery, tools and weapons. It is open Wednesdays to Mondays, from
10 a.m. to noon and from 2 to 5 p.m. In July and August, the museum
is open daily, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Admission is $5.50.
Information: (33-2) 97.52.22.04. &QL;

<P>
   Q. (italics)Can you give me some suggestions for guided literary
tours in Dublin? I'm especially interested in James Joyce. _ Mary
Lynn Mercer, Tampa, Fla.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. You won't have a hard time finding literary tours in Dublin,
a city linked to such writers as Bram Stoker, Jonathan Swift, J. M.
Synge, William Butler Yeats, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett, Oscar
Wilde and James Joyce, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few possibilities:
</P>
<P>
   The Literary Pub Crawl is a two-and-a-half hour tour led by
professional actors who perform work by some of Dublin's writers
while guiding you around the city's most famous literary haunts. It
starts on Duke Street, where that street's many connections with
Joyce and his novel ``Ulysses'' are discussed.
</P>
<P>
   The route passes by Trinity College, associated with writers
such as Synge, Bram Stoker and Swift, and includes stops such as
The Old Stand, a former haunt of Brendan Behan's. Among the works
performed and discussed are excerpts from Beckett's ``Waiting for
Godot'' and O'Casey's ``Juno and the Paycock.''
</P>
<P>
   Tours, which cost $9, are conducted Thursday to Sunday at 7:30
p.m., with an additional tour on Sunday at noon; from April 5 to
Oct. 31, tours are at 7:30 p.m. daily. Information: (353-1) 670
5602, fax (353-1) 4545 680.
</P>
<P>
   A tour that focuses solely on James Joyce is offered by the
James Joyce Center at 35 Great George's Street North. Among the
places visited are the Jesuit-run Belvedere College, where Joyce
was a student; 5 Parnell Square, former home of Oliver St. John
Gogarty, the poet, politician, athlete, surgeon and writer who was
the model for Buck Mulligan in ``Ulysses;'' and 44 Fontenoy Street,
the last home in which the Joyce family lived in Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   The 90-minute tour, which starts at 2:30 and costs $9 is offered
on Mondays to Fridays until June. From June through September it is
offered daily. Information: (353-1) 8788 547.
</P>
<P>
   Dara Nolan, who represents the Association of Approved Tour
Guides, can put you in touch with guides who specialize in private
literary tours. A half-day tour costs $72. Her telephone and fax
number is (353-1) 278 1626.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to explore independently, the Dublin Tourism Center
on Suffolk Street publishes a number of booklets, maps and leaflets
that include information about the city's literary sites. For more
information call the Irish Tourist Board in New York (800)
742-6765. &QL;

   Q. (italics)Do you have information on Japan Rail Passes? _
Ingrid Salzmann, New York, N.Y.(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   A. Foreign tourists visiting Japan may purchase special passes
that can be used on most of Japan Rail trains (exceptions include
the Nozomi Super Express), as well as on many buses and ferries.
The pass must be purchased through travel agents before arriving in
Japan. The Japan Rail West passes for travel in the Sanyo and
Kansai areas are the only passes that can be purchased in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The standard, countrywide passes allow unlimited travel for 7,
14 and 21 days. While the prices are set by Japan Rail, authorized
travel companies that sell the passes in the United States (either
directly to the traveler, or through your personal travel agent)
may use different exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   For example, earlier this month, Kinetsu International Express,
(800) 422-3481, sold the passes at a rate of 118 yen to the dollar,
resulting in these coach fares: $240 (28,300 yen) for 7 days, $382
(45,100) yen for 14 days and $489 (57,700 yen) for 21 days.
First-class rates, student and children's fares are also available.
</P>
<P>
   Among the regional passes are the JR East Pass (includes Tokyo
and Nagano ski areas), the JR Kyushu Pass (in and around Kyushu
Island) and the JR West passes mentioned above.

   Win One, Lose One: Michelin Unveils 3-Stars &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 90th edition of the Michelin Red Guide to France was
released March 3, bestowing one new three-star rating, on the chef
Michel Bras, for the restaurant that bears his name in Laguiole
(pronounced Lie-OLE) in the Auvergne region of south-central
France.
</P>
<P>
   One restaurant, Marc Meneau's Esperance in the Burgundian
village of Vezelay, was demoted from three stars to two. Thus the
number of three-star restaurants remains unchanged at 21, with 6 in
Paris and 15 in the provinces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The French guide was particularly generous this year, adding
nine restaurants to the two-star roster. Frederic Anton, who
studied under Joel Robuchon, won two stars at the Pre Catelan in
the Bois de Boulogne, in Paris, and Eric Lecerf was elevated from
one star to two at the Astor in the Hotel Astor in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Le Squer, who has been at the restaurant Ledoyen in
Paris only six months, managed to retain the two stars won by
Ledoyen's former chef, Ghislaine Arabian. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Other new two-stars include Christian Constant's Violon d'Ingres
in Paris, Clos de la Violette in Aix-en-Provence, and Moulin de
Lourmarin in Lourmarin, in the Luberon.
</P>
<P>
   With guides published earlier this year elsewhere in Europe,
there were no changes in three-star lineups. Italy now boasts two
new two-stars: Da Caino in Montemerano and Dolada in Pieve
D'Alpago.
</P>
<P>
   Significant changes took place in Britain, with three new
two-stars, including the Gidleigh Park in Chagford, Devon, and 14
new one-stars, including the Fat Duck in Bray on Thames.
</P>
<P>
   In Portugal, the Vila Joya in Albufeira has been upgraded to two
stars, and in Spain, the popular Madrid restaurant Viridiana lost
its single star. New two-stars in Germany include La Table in
Dortmund-Syburg and Steinheuers Restaurant Zur Alten Post in
Neuenahr-Ahrweiler.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland claims two new two-stars: Cerf in Cossonay and Haus
Paradies in Ftan. The longtime traditional Swiss restaurant
Bruderholz (formerly known as Stucki) in Basel lost one of its two
stars. In the Benelux countries, new two-stars include De
Bellefleur in Antwerp, Belgium; and in the Netherlands, Oud Sluis
in Sluis and De Librije in Zwolle.

   Jamaica Takes Steps To Protect Tourists &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica is putting soldiers in tourist areas to prevent thefts
and harassment of visitors. The new policy of using members of the
country's military, mostly in plainclothes and some armed with
pistols, to augment police protection was announced in January by
Francis Tulloch, the minister of tourism, with the strong support
of the island's hotel association. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jamaican officials say crimes against tourists have dropped 50
percent in the last 10 years, but harassment of visitors from
cruise ships received extensive publicity last winter, as did three
recent armed attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Martin, a spokesman for the Jamaica Tourist Board in New
York, said that although the tourist total had risen substantially
over 10 years _ the level is now 1.9 million a year, including
nearly 700,000 cruise passengers, Martin said _ the police force
had not grown commensurately. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This reinforcing presence is unobtrusive,'' Martin said, ``but
obvious to those that count.'' These include local hawkers, he
said, ``and other antisocial elements.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rooms and Tickets For Sydney Olympics &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next Olympic Summer Games, to be held in Sydney, are a
little less than 18 months away, but it's not too early to order
hotel accommodations and tickets. Cartan Tours, the company chosen
by the organizers of the Sydney games as the official United States
sales agent for Olympics tickets and tours, began taking orders
last week for the Games, scheduled for Sept. 15 to Oct. 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Don Williams, Cartan's vice president, said that Olympic tickets
will range from $8 for early-round soccer games to $1,054 for top
seats at the opening and closing ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball preliminaries are $42, the finals $248 to $347;
gymnastics start at $65 for opening rounds and go up to $217 to
$271 for finals. Customers will know by Sept. 30 if their orders
can be filled for the events they requested.
</P>
<P>
   Cartan has a choice of hotels in Sydney or in the Blue
Mountains, a region of spectacular natural beauty about 90 minutes
from the city, or the Central Coast, an area just north of the city
that is famous for its beaches and headlands.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Train service _ free to Olympic ticket holders on the day of the
event they attend _ is available to the Blue Mountains and Central
Coast. Cartan's packages will include transportation to the events,
most of which will take place in Homebush Bay, nine miles west of
downtown Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   Six-night accommodation packages _ including round-trip air fare
from Los Angeles, airport transfers and full breakfast daily _
start at $4,990 a person, double occupancy, for rooms with private
homeowners. For rooms in pubs (the equivalent of a small hotel in
the United States), rates start at $5,190; the hotel packages start
at $5,490. Olympic tickets are extra.
</P>
<P>
   Top-category hotels include the Avillion and the Radisson Plaza.
For families, the Metro Inn and Apartments or Pacific International
are recommended. Suburban hotels include the Hawkesbury Lodge in
Windsor, a resort not far from the rowing events.
</P>
<P>
   Cartan is also selling pre- or post-Olympic visits to the Hunter
Valley wine-growing region, two hours north of Sydney. For a
48-page brochure, call (800) 841-1994 or www.cartan.com on the Web.

   In Atlanta, a Case of Impressionist Fever &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The High Museum of Art in Atlanta is destined to be a popular
place for the next few months: Not one, but two exhibitions of
Impressionism _ the museum world's biggest crowd-pleaser _ have
taken over its fourth floor until May 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressionism: Paintings Collected by European Museums,''
which retells the story of Impressionism's development and initial
rejection by the establishment, brings together 60 works by
Cezanne, van Gogh, Manet, Renoir, Cassatt, Sisley and others.
</P>
<P>
   They are drawn from 39 collections in 13 countries, including
those of the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, the National Gallery in London
and the National Gallery of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   Such renowned works as Monet's ``Port at Argenteuil,''
Pissarro's ``Avenue de l'Opera: Sunshine, Winter Morning'' and van
Gogh's ``Portrait of Armand Roulin'' are on view; and so are works
by several lesser-known Impressionists like Marie Bracquemond,
Jean-Baptiste Armand Guillaumin and Jean-Francois Raffaelli.
</P>
<P>
   The High's other show, ``Monet and Bazille: A Collaboration'' is
the first exhibition to examine the relationship between two
founding members of Impressionism. The duo met as art students in
1863, shared a succession of studios and traveled together to paint
the coast of Normandy and the countryside near Fontainebleau.
</P>
<P>
   Bazille's career ended tragically when he died in 1870, at the
age of 28, in the Franco-Prussian War. He did many figure paintings
and landscapes, but is perhaps best known for his series of
paintings of his friends' studios, with identifiable paintings in
view, such as the two in this exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 20 paintings in ``Monet and Bazille'' are Monet's
``Strollers,'' Bazille's ``View of the Village'' and, for direct
comparison, scenes of the seaside at Ste.-Adresse by each artist.
</P>
<P>
   Other Atlanta institutions have also caught Impressionist fever.
The Atlanta Botanical Garden is offering self-guided tours
highlighting ``Plants of Monet's Garden.'' The Atlanta Ballet, the
Atlanta Symphony and two theaters are offering discounts to museum
ticket-holders.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven hotels have one-night package deals that include two
tickets to the museum and breakfast for two. Prices range from $125
at the Georgian Terrace Hotel to $195 at the Four Seasons Hotel.
Information: the Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau, (800)
285-2682.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impressionism: Paintings Collected by European Museums'' will
travel to the Seattle Art Museum (June 12 through Aug. 29) and to
the Denver Art Museum (Oct. 2 through Dec. 12). ``Monet and
Bazille'' will not travel.
</P>
<P>
   The High Museum, at 1280 Peachtree Street, N.E., is open daily
during these exhibitions. (It is normally closed on Mondays.)
Tickets, which are dated and timed, cost $13 for adults on weekdays
and $15 on weekends and are available at the museum box office,
(404) 733-5000, or through Ticketmaster, (404) 817-8700. Judith H.

EAGLES BOW TO VOLUNTEERS 
</HEADLINE>
 BKW-BOSTON COLLEGE-TENNESSEE-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. _ The Boston College women's basketball team,
coming off of its best season, tried to prove to itself and to a
national television audience that it could play with the best. It
wanted to prove that it could do battle with the Tennessee Lady
Vols. And it did _ for half a game.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Tennessee showed why it is ranked second in the
country, seeded first in the region, and a three-time defending
NCAA champion. The Lady Vols rolled over the Eagles, 89-62, before
9,907 at Thompson-Boling Arena Monday night in the second round of
the NCAA Tournament. Tennessee (30-2) will go on to face Virginia
Tech in Saturday's East Regional semifinals in Greensboro, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   BC freshman guard Brianne Stepherson said, ``We did show people
in the first half that we have the ability to play with a team like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``A game's not 20 minutes, it's a full 40
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't seem to affect Tennessee to be playing without guard
Semeka Randall, who sprained her ankle Saturday. Forward Chamique
Holdsclaw, one of three Lady Vols named All-American last week,
almost singlehandedly destroyed the Eagles with 39 points, tying
her career high. Sophomore forward Tamika Catchings scored 13
points, and center Michelle Snow added 12.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-seeded Eagles (22-8) seemed ready to stand up to
Tennessee and write another chapter in their history book. After
Tennessee missed its first two shots, BC freshman Nicole Conway
fired up a 3-pointer, and the Eagles were on their way. Holdsclaw
hit a basket, but Stepherson sank another 3-pointer, and BC had a
6-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   BC led for the first eight minutes, until Tennessee tied it at
14-14. Even when the Lady Vols took a 25-19 lead, BC refused to get
rattled. The Eagles came back behind two 3-pointers by Alissa
Murphy and regained the lead at 29-27.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee kept trying to establish its dominance, as Holdsclaw
hit on 9 of 12 field goal attempts and finished the half with 23
points.
</P>
<P>
   But 6-foot-3-inch BC center Jamie Cournoyer, who had been
averaging only 4.5 points per game, had a perfect half, going 5 for
5 on field goals and hitting all three free throws.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, looking nothing like the underdogs they were
supposed to be, trailed by only 1 at the half, 42-41.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee coach Pat Summitt let her team know that she was not
happy with the first-half performance. So when the second half
began, the Lady Vols starting putting pressure on BC, starting with
a 6-0 run and holding both Stepherson and Murphy scoreless the rest
of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made sure Murphy didn't get the basketball,'' said Summitt.
``We made other people handle the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy was held to 12 points, while Stepherson's scoring was
limited to her one 3-pointer. Tennessee also started pulling down
rebounds, grabbing 35 in the game to BC's 23.
</P>
<P>
   As the Eagles ran into foul trouble, Stepherson, then Becky
Gottstein, then Murphy took seats on the bench. The brightest spot
for the Eagles was Cournoyer, who had a career-high 16 points.
Conway added another 16 and grabbed 8 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   A somber BC coach Cathy Inglese said, ``I was pleased with our
first-half efforts, but Tennessee did a great job defensively in
the second half, and our fouls got us into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Eagles head back home after their first NCAA appearance,
Inglese said she was proud of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This showed a heck of a lot of character,'' she said. ``I
can't have been more proud of our freshman class.''

FORMER `NATURAL' BRIEN TAYLOR WORKING TO REGAIN HIS FORM, THIS TIME
WITH M'S 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ The 3,000 fans and several dozen players at Fort
Lauderdale Stadium thought they were seeing the future. The energy
of March 4, 1993 still reverberates within Brien Taylor, who can
call it up on command. It is proof, in a way, of who he once was.
</P>
<P>
   It was a New York Yankees intrasquad game, and the 21-year-old
Taylor was facing major league hitters for the first time. He would
no doubt be doing so for many years, and was ticketed to start for
real sometime in '94.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor heard it all: This kid throws bullets. How can he pitch
in the mid-90s with a motion so easy and smooth? With that
fastball, he can be as dominant as anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The last endorsement came from Bernie Williams. Taylor retired
him that day, he remembers, with fastballs at the knees. Two
shutout innings, and the quiet, proud kid from rural North Carolina
was the toast of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a guy asking me, Don't you think you're better than
everybody here?'' Taylor said the other day, shaking his head.
``Out of the blue, first question. I said, no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the question was not so unreasonable. Taylor had been the
No. 1 pick in the country in 1991, four years after Ken Griffey
Jr., two years before Alex Rodriguez. His first two minor league
seasons, he averaged more than a strikeout per inning. Greatness
was all but guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   And then he nearly lost it all.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the 27-year-old Taylor rises at 6:30 a.m. from his
room at the local Comfort Inn. He catches the early bus to the
Peoria Sports Complex, and arrives before 7 every morning. Griffey
and Rodriguez have lockers in the same building, but in a very
different room.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is a Mariner farmhand, signed by Seattle as a minor
league free agent in January. He spent seven years with the
Yankees, but never made it past Class A after injuring his shoulder
defending his brother in a fight in December 1993. No other player
picked No. 1 overall from 1967-95 has failed to make the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have a year to see if Taylor can. He signed a
one-year contract, and must be put on the 40-man roster after this
season or he becomes a free agent. If Taylor's arm strength is
where it was last year, when the M's clocked him at 94 mph, he
could be a starter someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not the 98-99 mph fastball guy (anymore), but he doesn't
need to apologize for his fastball, either,'' said Bryan Price, the
Mariners' minor league pitching coordinator. ``He still throws the
ball pretty darn good. Maybe he's not going to be the overpowering
No. 1 starter for the New York Yankees, but he could very easily be
maybe a No. 4 or 5 starter or a top left-handed relief pitcher with
the Seattle Mariners. And that I think would be probably just fine
with him. It certainly would be fine with us.''
</P>
<P>
   For Taylor, it is less a chance to start over than a chance to
continue his progress. But that progress has not been evident in
his statistics. After missing all of 1994, Taylor has gone 3-15
with a 10.85 earned run average. In 1082/3 innings, he has walked
175 and struck out 86.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that time has been spent simply building back strength
or working on mechanics in extended spring training. Taylor has
pitched only 21 games the past two years, but he said he hasn't
been hurt. His problem has been control, not velocity, but Taylor
said he has seen subtle improvements each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as getting a feel for the game, going there every day,
getting into a rhythm, that's never happened,'' he said. ``But now
I feel confident because my arm strength's there and I've got an
idea of where the zone is again. But still, from there, I've got to
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are giving Taylor extra attention. One of the main
reasons they've brought former St. Louis Cardinals pitching coach
Hub Kittle to camp is to tutor Taylor. Farm director Benny Looper
considers Kittle an expert on correcting control problems of young
pitchers, pointing to Ken Hill and Todd Worrell as examples.
</P>
<P>
   Kittle traces Taylor's control problems to ``long-arming'' the
ball and striding too far toward first base in his delivery. Price
has detected a hitch in Taylor's arm swing in which he pauses for
an instant, throwing off his timing and making it hard to find a
consistent release point.
</P>
<P>
   There are bound to be more suggestions, and Taylor also is
trying to develop a slider. It's a lot to digest, and the Mariners
acknowledge they might need to put Taylor in extended spring
training as they introduce new ideas to him. If those ideas take,
Taylor likely will start at Class AA New Haven or Class AAA Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly didn't sign him to bring him along step by step,
A-ball to double-A to triple-A,'' Price said. ``We want to put him
in a situation where we can start thinking about him as a major
league pitcher. If we're doing that down here, fine. But if he's
throwing the ball the way he's capable of, I don't think he'll be
pitching in A-ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing for Taylor, Looper said, is re-gaining
his confidence. He will pitch consistently when he's ready, he
said, and it doesn't matter if that comes at the lowest level or
Class AAA.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said he's never lacked confidence. When the Yankees tried
to wow the small-town kid with a $300,000 bonus, he and his family
called their bluff and got a record $1.55 million. When Yankees
manager Buck Showalter asked if he was nervous before that
intrasquad game in '93, Taylor replied, ``Why should I be? They
should be nervous.'' It's no different now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never have thrown that hard forever anyway,'' Taylor
said. ``I look at it as, I've still got a great arm, throw with
good velocity, get them out. I can still be a great pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   If he was going to quit, Taylor said, he would have done it his
first year after shoulder surgery, when he realized he would never
again be a natural. He would feel fine one day, then be unable to
lift his arm the next two or three days. He was physically
incapable of being who he was supposed to be, yet unable to escape
his own shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me,'' Taylor said, ``it was more like, OK, this is Brien
Taylor, good is not good. You've got to be awesome. So then you're
so far away in your mind from where you had been, but you've got to
go back there. But I loved it, and I didn't want to walk away.''
</P>
<P>
   If he weren't playing, Taylor said, he probably would go to
college and become an electrician. For Sunday dinners, he would do
what he does now in the offseason, driving from his home in
Raleigh, N.C., to his parents' home in Beaufort, the one his bonus
money helped build.
</P>
<P>
   But the part about fading away and becoming a regular guy? That
happened long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the bigger cities, it's like nobody knows you,'' Taylor
said. ``Once you're not a great pitcher, a lot of people don't have
a clue who you are. You can disappear just that fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, I'm glad all the other stuff went away, like the
fame and the people around me all the time. That was the external
stuff that comes with it when you're great, but it can be a burden.
When it disappeared, it really didn't bother me. But losing my
talent bothered me. You can't have it two ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor paused. Yes, the talent he once had is gone. But to him,
and the Mariners, the story isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got a (bad) break, but the most important thing is, Can
you get it back again?'' Taylor said. ``I'm still here.''

COMMENTS PROVE COSTLY FOR GEORGE KARL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Former Sonics coach George Karl had a mouthful of
comments about his old bosses last week.
</P>
<P>
   Now Karl, who coaches the Milwaukee Bucks, has his hands full.
</P>
<P>
   On the day that the NBA fined the Bucks $25,000 for bitter
remarks Karl made about Sonics president Wally Walker, the
Post-Intelligencer learned that Karl is going through a divorce.
Cathy Karl, his wife of 21{ years, petitioned for a divorce Feb. 5
in King County Superior Court. In court records, the reason for
dissolution is that the marriage had been ``irretrievably broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl, whose contract was not renewed by the Sonics after last
season, has lived in a Milwaukee hotel since he signed a four-year,
$20 million deal with the Bucks last August. Cathy Karl has
remained in Seattle and maintains the couple's Bellevue home.
</P>
<P>
   Though the NBA repeatedly had warned Karl about criticizing the
Sonics, Karl called Walker ``incompetent'' in a story that appeared
in the P-I last Wednesday. Karl's team then beat the Sonics that
night.
</P>
<P>
   Karl and Walker often feuded during their time together in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   John Calipari, who was fired by the New Jersey Nets on Monday,
is the only other coach to receive such a hefty fine for comments
directed toward anyone other than league officials. Calipari was
fined $25,000 for offensive comments made toward a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they felt I was hurting the league, I'm sorry that they
felt that way,'' Karl told reporters before Monday night's game
between the Bucks and the New York Knicks in Milwaukee. ``The thing
that makes me sad is that I think I said 90 percent awful positive
things about my time in Seattle and about the team there because I
have a lot of love for the team,'' Karl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one human being there that I have problems with,'' he
said. ``I guess they don't want me talking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Karl has not talked publicly about his impending divorce. The
court documents had just one signature: Cathy Karl's.
</P>
<P>
   A trial date is set for Dec. 27 if a settlement isn't reached by
then. Cathy Karl is seeking alimony, child support and equitable
division of property. She refused comment Monday and her attorney,
Evan Schwab, did not return phone messages.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy and George Karl were married Aug. 5, 1977 in Nampa, Idaho.
They have two children _ Kelci, 19, and Coby, 15.

UCLA ADVANCES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This time, there were no last-second shot-clock
problems, no eight-tenths of a second that lasted forever.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was time for the UCLA players to savor a 87-63
run-away second-round victory over the Kentucky Wildcats on Monday
night in an NCAA Women's Tournament game at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA advances to the West Regional Saturday at the Sports Arena
against second-seeded Colorado State.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's second round at Alabama, UCLA fell victim to a
scorekeeper who failed to restart the clock on time, giving Alabama
more than the .8 that remained to sink its winning jumper.
</P>
<P>
   There would be nothing to worry about this time in the second
meeting this season between the two teams. UCLA won 64-54 on Nov.
29 in the finals of the Rainbow Wahine Classic in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins led 34-24 at the half, but Kentucky came out strongly
from the opening tip, going on a 12-2 run in the first 6{ minutes,
helped by Hubbard and Gomez, who each picked up two fouls in that
span. Hubbard never returned in the half, and Gomez didn't come
back until there were about six minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Foul trouble usually means big trouble for UCLA, but the Bruins
slowly came back, thanks in part to Kentucky's similar predicament.
The Wildcats had 15 fouls, compared to UCLA's eight.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA only made seven field goals, failing to sink even one for a
stretch of 4:55 at one point but converted 17 of 18 free throws.
Martin made 10 by herself, which came in handy because she didn't
attempt a field goal until 10:13 remained in the half. She was just
1 of 3.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went on a 16-3 run in 3:36 to turn the 12-2 deficit
into an 18-15 lead with 7:26 to play in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the Wildcats scored four straight points, UCLA
scored 14 in a row in 3:32 to build its lead to 32-19.

KINGS' PULSE REMAINS STRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ It has gone from a flicker to a flame.
</P>
<P>
   Given up for dead a week ago, the Los Angeles Kings suddenly are
very much alive.
</P>
<P>
   With their third consecutive strong effort, this one against one
of the best teams in the National Hockey League, the Kings took
another big step in their late-season bid to get back in the
playoff race. They defeated the Eastern Conference-leading Ottawa
Senators on Monday night by a 4-0 margin before a Forum crowd of
12,640.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play like that,'' center Ian Laperriere said, ``we're
going to win more games than we lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Blake and Philippe Boucher scored late in the second period
to break up a scoreless tie, and Donald Audette and Glen Murray
provided third-period insurance goals. That paved the way for the
Kings to put together a three-game winning streak, their longest
since they won five straight in late December and early January.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Fiset stopped 29 shots to record his second shutout
this season and the 14th of his career. Fiset has allowed only
three goals during the winning streak, stopping 87 of 89 shots on
goal.
</P>
<P>
   With 15 games remaining, the Kings (26-36-5) moved to within
three points of idle Calgary and Edmonton, which share the final
Western Conference playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   The Senators (38-20-8) lost their second straight following a
five-game winning streak, and fell to 0-6 at the Forum, an arena
they will not be visiting again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to play patient,'' coach Larry Robinson said. ``They
are in some ways a very frustrating team to play against. They've
got a lot of speed and they come at you in waves and finish their
checks. If you stray from your game plan, you give them chances and
they are very scary team to play against.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Kings stuck with their game plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the first period, the Kings outshot Ottawa by a meager 5-4
margin, but in the second, they stepped up their forechecking and
outshot the Senators 17-10. Again and again, Kings players would
join the play late to receive a pass and take a shot.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the second period, the outstanding play of
Senators goalie Ron Tugnutt _ who began the night with a
microscopic 1.60 goals-against average _ negated the Kings'
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with 6:07 to play in the period, Laperriere drew a
roughing penalty from Senators defenseman Lance Pitlick, giving the
Kings their second power play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had punched him before,'' Laperriere said. ``(The referee)
never calls the first punch. He always calls the second, and
(Pitlick) punched me back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings wasted little time capitalizing on their power play.
They gained control of the puck, moving it around until it finally
landed on Blake's stick at the left boards.
</P>
<P>
   With Ray Ferraro in front of the net, Blake fired a slap shot
that beat Tugnutt to the short side at 14:38. It was Blake's ninth
goal this season, his fifth in the last nine games, and the 100th
of his nine-year NHL career.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three minutes later, Boucher scored his second goal of
the season, a shot off a pass from Ferraro that banked off two
Senators in front, then off the right goal post and finally past
Tugnutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must be in a vacation mode or something out here, losing
these last two games,'' Tugnutt said. ``The first 10 minutes in San
Jose and most of the night tonight, we really weren't there. We let
them control the game all night long. It's not so much losing
back-to-back as it is how you lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings broke the game open early in the third, Audette and
Murray scoring 44 seconds apart. It was the first goal since Dec.
30 for Murray, who missed 19 games with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the Kings are doing all the things they hadn't been
doing all season. Suddenly, a playoff berth is in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can control one thing,'' Blake said, ``and that's how we
play.''

SWEET 16 FOR BRUINS THIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 ...WRITETHRU (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was no last-second shot-clock glitches or
any second-half defensive letdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Just the kind of game the UCLA women's basketball team needed to
play to beat Kentucky and reach the the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16
for the first time since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The third-seeded Bruins overcame early foul trouble, made 32 of
35 free throws and didn't let up defensively and forced Kentucky
into a 33-percent shooting night in securing an 87-63 rout of the
sixth-seeded Wildcats Monday night before 2,604 at Pauley Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Maylana Martin scored 21 points, including 15 of 15 free throws,
and grabbed 12 rebounds as the Bruins (25-7) advanced to the West
Regional Saturday at the Sports Arena against second-seeded
Colorado State. Kentucky finished 21-11.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Philman scored 16 points and had 10 rebounds for the
Bruins, and Janae Hubbard scored all 13 of her points in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
   In last year's second round at Alabama, a slow-to-start shot
clock gave Alabama more than eight-tenths of a second left to get
off the final shot and steal a victory. Monday night, UCLA never
let Kentucky get that close.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was on our mind,'' said Melanie Pearson, who scored
13 points. ``We know we can go farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, as often is the case, was a main reason why. She usually
doesn't play the entire first half but had to when Hubbard picked
up her second foul with just two and a half minutes gone.
</P>
<P>
   She also usually gets more than three shots in the first half,
but Kentucky keyed on her defensively. She didn't get her first
attempt until there was 10:13 left in the first half. Her one field
goal came with 3:29 to play.
</P>
<P>
   So Martin hurt the Wildcats in other ways. She sank 11 of 11
free throws and took six rebounds in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her back was bothering her (Sunday), so we told her, `For 10
minutes, you go work on free throws while the team does other
stuff,' '' UCLA coach Kathy Olivier said. ``It paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the second meeting between the two teams. UCLA won
64-54 on Nov. 29 in the final of the Rainbow Wahine Classic in
Hawaii. In that game, Martin had 11 points and 14 rebounds, and
Philman had 19 points but just three rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shot hasn't been on for the past 10 games,'' Philman said.
``I had to pick it up defensively, and I could do that by
rebounding.''
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky came out strongly, going on a 12-2 run in the first 6{
minutes, helped by Hubbard and Erica Gomez each picking up two
fouls in that span. Hubbard never returned in the half and Gomez
didn't come back until there were about six minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, foul trouble means big trouble for UCLA, but the Bruins
slowly came back, thanks in part to Kentucky's similar foul
troubles. The Wildcats committed 15 fouls, compared to UCLA's
eight.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA only made seven field goals (and didn't sink one for one
stretch of 4:55) but converted 17 of 18 free throws. The Bruins
also went on a 16-3 run in 3:36 to turn the 12-2 deficit into an
18-15 lead with 7:26 to play in the half. Then, after the Wildcats
scored four straight points, UCLA scored 14 in a row in 3:32 to
build its lead to 32-19.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins led 34-24 at the half, but Kentucky cut it to six
points early on. It appeared another defensive lapse was imminent,
similar to the one Saturday, when Wisconsin-Green Bay ran off 22 of
31 points.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the Bruins who turned it up. A 19-8 run in 5:41
put UCLA ahead 63-40. Everybody got involved in that run; five
players scored.
</P>
<P>
   Forward LaTonya NcDole led the Wildcats with 16 points and for
Laura Meadows.

 REPUBLICAN TAKES LEAP WITH HIGH-TECH PRESIDENTIAL BID  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON _ Steve Forbes, whose family made millions of dollars
with the printed word, will announce his candidacy for the
Republican presidential nomination Tuesday in cyberspace.
<P>
   ``You and I are entering the information age _ and the
Washington politicians are stuck in the Stone Age,'' Forbes said in
a statement to be posted on his Web site (www.forbes2000.com) by 5
a.m. PST.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a new, information-age campaign about
great ideas and enduring values,'' Forbes said. ``Today marks the
beginning of a national crusade to restore Ronald Reagan's vision
of hope and prosperity for all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes joins a growing field of Republican hopefuls, currently
led by Texas Governor George W. Bush and former Cabinet secretary
Elizabeth Dole. In hundreds of appearances over the past several
years, Forbes has tried to win over fiscal and social conservatives
by championing both tax reform and the rights of the unborn.
</P>
<P>
   It may be harder for him to assume the mantle of darling of the
high-tech community. Bush already has the support of many
Republicans in Silicon Valley, and Vice President Al Gore is
counting on high-tech Democrats to help finance his campaign. Gore
is so comfortable with his cutting-edge credentials that he even
claimed during a television interview last week to have helped
invent the Internet, prompting former Vice President Dan Quayle to
quip Monday that ``If Gore invented the Internet, I invented
spell-check.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the heir to the Forbes publishing fortune says he
will ``run the first full-scale presidential campaign in American
history on the Internet _ because I want you to be involved every
step of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Every major presidential candidate boasts a Web site, although
their value has been largely confined to providing information to
volunteers, curiosity seekers and news reporters. Rep. John Kasich,
an Ohio Republican running for president, even sent reporters a
printed news release when his web site (www.k2k.org) was named
``Political Web Site of the Day'' by one reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who spent about $35 million of his own money on his
failed 1996 presidential bid, is expected to spend most of his
money on a more traditional form of communication _ television. His
advertisements in the last election focused on his plan to replace
the current tax code with a flat-tax plan, which he said would
permit most Americans to fill out their returns in less than three
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-year-old New Jersey native, who has never held elective
office, still talks about ``driving a stake'' through the tax code
and offering ``job retraining'' for laid-off workers at the
Internal Revenue Service. But he has also broadened his message,
speaking out against legal abortions and on other issues that
appeal to the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   A text of his Internet announcement released to reporters makes
clear that he will continue to run as a nonpolitician, and try to
draw Gore into the Clinton administration's ethical morass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you trust other politicians to clean out the corruption and
sleaze of the Clinton-Gore administration?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   After his message is distributed through cyberspace, Forbes will
take a more traditional route to announce his candidacy. He plans
campaign events Tuesday and Wednesday in New Hampshire and Thursday
in Iowa, the sites of the nation's first primary and caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes joins Quayle, former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Sen.
Bob Smith, R-N.H., journalists Pat Buchanan and Family Research
Council president Gary Bauer among Republicans who have announced
their candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, Dole, Kasich and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., have all
announced the formation of exploratory committees and are expected
to make final decisions by the summer. Gore and former Sen. Bill
Bradley, D-N.J., are the only announced Democratic candidates.

 (editors: rewrites, adds new graphs)   Kaiser Faces Lawsuit Over Ad Campaign 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Tom Abate &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
A consumer group backed by Ralph Nader is filing a novel lawsuit
today that alleges Kaiser Permanente made false advertising claims
about its quality of care to recruit new members.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, which will be filed in California Superior Court in
San Francisco, alleges that Kaiser was supposedly forcing doctors
to cut costs at the same it was spending $60 million a year to
attract new members with ads claiming that doctors, not
administrators, were in charge of care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's not a lie, I don't know what is,'' said Jamie Court,
with Consumer's for Quality Care, a Santa Monica group that is
affiliated with Nader. The case is being handled by the San Diego
law firm of Milberg Weiss, which has specialized in filing class
action lawsuits against high-tech firms for alleged stock fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser officials, who have not yet seen the suit, reacted
angrily to the charges. ``Anyone can file a lawsuit,'' said Francis
J. Crosson, executive director of the Permanente Federation, the
partnership that governs the 10,000 doctors who practice at Kaiser
facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, doctors are in charge of care at Kaiser Permanente,''
Crosson said. ``This outrageous lawsuit attacks the hard-earned
reputation of thousands of Kaiser Permanente physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   According to consumer and health industry groups, the lawsuit is
apparently the first of its kind involving allegations of
misleading advertising by an HMO in a membership drive. In this
case, the suit charges that Kaiser has recruited 500,000 new
members since it launched its $60-million-a-year ad campaign in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign, which allegedly represented a 700 percent increase
over Kaiser's 1992 ad spending, used television and other media to
get across the message that, as one ad said: ``At Kaiser Permanente
your medical care is between you and your doctor, with no
interference from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   But, the suit will allege, while Kaiser was advertising
noninterference, its administrators were reducing the HMO's medical
budget and talking about other cost-cutting steps.
</P>
<P>
   The suit cites two incidents to support the allegations. The
first is a December 1995 budget-cutting speech given by Kaiser
official Dr. John Vogt.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Vogt allegedly implied that Kaiser had
changed the protocol that doctors follow when deciding when to send
a patient to the hospital after complaints about chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit quotes Vogt as saying ``The reason we're revising
that protocol now is because our (hospital) utilization exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanate's Crosson called Vogt's comments ``stupid
remarks'' made by a low-level employee who did not represent Kaiser
policy. ``They have been taken out context time and again to make
the organization look bad,'' Crosson said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also cites a Jan. 29, 1996, e-mail from 56 Kaiser
doctors who allegedly complained about ``drastic cost-cutting and
sweeping changes ... that negatively affect patients and staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Crosson said he was unfamiliar with the e-mail and couldn't
respond to its charges. He characterized the lawsuit as a ``big
lie'' meant to embarrass Kaiser at a time when the state
Legislature is considering new HMO legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Court said attorneys are also prepared to call several unnamed
Kaiser doctors as ``expert witnesses'' to substantiate allegations
that executives interfered with patient-care decisions by doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit is filed on behalf of new Kaiser members who were
supposedly wronged by the allegedly misleading ads. It seeks
unspecified compensatory and punitive damages, an immediate halt to
Kaiser's current ad campaign and corrective advertising to set the
record straight.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: Big night at the honky-tonk
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Jane Brooking
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   Of all the ``Dreamsvilles'' of my youth, the one I remember most
clearly is Paris, Texas, the summer I was 14.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite job that summer was babysitting with the children of
the owners of Paris's most popular honky-tonk. It wasn't your
average summer job.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday night I'll never forget started like any other,
with the children and me, noses pressed to the window, watching the
cars and pickup trucks arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the music started, we could sense the happy mood of
the couples coming to hear (and, of course, dance to) the music of
that week's headliner.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we could see, tucked into a corner behind the dance
hall, a shiny silver-colored tour bus with the performer's name in
big bright letters splashed across the sides and front.
</P>
<P>
   Each Saturday night, as the children's parents left to walk
across the wide parking lot that separated home from business, they
would remind me to lock the door and not to unlock it until one of
them called to say they were on their way to the house.
</P>
<P>
   This night when the phone rang, it was different.
</P>
<P>
   It seems Bob Wills, this week's star, wasn't feeling well and
needed a glass of milk. Would I let him in and pour him a glass of
cold milk?
</P>
<P>
   Bob Wills! My favorite of favorites, and I was going to pour him
a glass of cold milk.
</P>
<P>
   I would have gladly run out and milked a cow if they had asked
me to.
</P>
<P>
   Gathering all the poise and charm of my 14 years, I opened the
door and invited my hero into the living room.
</P>
<P>
   I remember perching on the edge of my chair, trying to act very
sophisticated but not having the vaguest idea of what sophisticated
was.
</P>
<P>
   He sat on the sofa, sipping his milk and talking to me as if I
were an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen-year-olds of that time, at least in Paris, Texas,
weren't as worldly as they are in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't occur to me to wonder about the cause of his upset
stomach or to connect it with stories in the fan magazines.
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember a word he said, just how grown up I felt to be
in the same room with this famous man and how kind he was to me.
</P>
<P>
   I've lived through many years of Saturday nights, but not one
can compare to the night I met Bob Wills.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Enter, the Tepid War
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time in America when it was easy to tell good from
bad. World War II is the best example. Allies good. Axis bad.
Events were to prove the labels were on the mark. Then we segued
into the Cold War. Despite some confusion, you could still tell the
good guys from the bad.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Cold War ended. Communism cratered. Americans became
fretful, peevish. Someone had a brilliant idea. We could hate each
other. Conservatives. Liberals. Americans went for the gusto. It
was suddenly OK to hate democracy, your own government, the woman
next door who didn't use the precise words you would use to
denounce something or someone.
</P>
<P>
   So it felt comfy the other day to hear the Cold War is back,
sort of. The Tepid War. Espionage. Stolen atomic secrets. Perhaps
even _ two cheers _ a whiff of treason. Republicans demanding
investigation. Democrats saying what's the big deal, everyone
spies.
</P>
<P>
   So, here we are. The Chinese have stolen nuclear secrets, a
hideously dangerous thing to do. What will probably count most in
the longest run is what that will make of us as a people.

   AFFIRMATIVE-ACTION (San Francisco) _ The number of blacks and
Latinos accepted to prestigious Lowell High School next fall has
plummeted by 50 percent, raising questions about how to maintain
diversity without using race in admissions. At the same time,
offers to Chinese American and white students has jumped
considerably at Lowell, one of the top public schools in
California. By JULIAN GUTHRIE.
</P>
<P>
   MARINES-CITIES (Alaeda, Calif.) _ The Marines, computers and
high-tech weapons at the ready, landed in the East Bay amid a war
of words and not much else. The troops who came ashore in the
Marines' urban warfare rehearsal were greeted by about 100
protesters. There were sharp words but no incidents. By ERIC BRAZIL

   CIRCUMCISION (Albany, N.Y.) _ Deyva Arthur's decision not to
circumcise her newborn boy last month created quite a stir among
her relatives. But she feels better about defying family tradition
since the American Academy of Pediatrics stated in a new policy on
March 1 that the potential medical benefits of circumcision are not
sufficient to recommend it as a routine medical procedure. By
SYLVIA WOOD.
</P>
<P>
   COLON-CANCER (Albany, N.Y.) _ It is an irony of our times that
the second-largest cancer killer _ colon cancer _ has a 90 percent
survival rate if detected early, yet almost two-thirds of new cases
aren't discovered until the cancer has headed out to other parts of
the body. By BRUCE A. SCRUTON.

   ROBERTSON-STEPHENS (San Francisco) _ It's been a wild ride for
Robertson Stephens, the San Francisco investment bank that helped
build the high-tech economy. Two years ago, the firm was bought by
BankAmerica Corp. for $540 million. Then last year, BankAmerica
sold Robertson Stephens for $800 million to BankBoston Corp. Now
BankBoston has been snapped up by Fleet Financial Group Inc. By

   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Probably it's just a coincidence
that I got the worst flu I've had in at least a decade at the very
same time I was murdering mice. After all, what tangible
correlation could there be between some flu virus that invaded my
body (even though I had a flu shot) and the murder of a bunch of
mice who've been living in my walls? By STEPHANIE SALTER.

   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ The fight between Evander

 &HT;    Women's groups join forces for clearer voice on issues
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Maybe the new organization Women Leaders Online
(http://www.wlo.org) will help destroy the notion _ and the
reality, according to recent studies _ that women have been slow to
pick up on the advantages of high tech. I hope the ``leaders'' part
of the title isn't a signal that it's only for women with
high-powered careers.
</P>
<P>
   The new group is one of 120 women's organizations sponsoring
this week's `` Women's Equality Summit'' in Washington. Other
groups include the bipartisan Women's Campaign Fund and the Women's
Political Caucus, which has chapters in every state. Altogether the
summit sponsors represent 5 million women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Though women's groups have agitated too much about the ``glass
ceiling'' issues for women at the top and too little about housing
and child care for working women, the summit agenda sounds
down-to-earth enough. Women will talk to lawmakers about Social
Security reform and about ridding it of some of its built-in
disadvantages for women. They'll suggest ways to make quality child
care and family health care more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Too often such one-shot Washington gatherings turn out to be
little more than single-interest sound and fury that soon
evaporates. But the national political backdrop for the women's
foray and the alliances women's groups are forming at the state
level may mean it's something more.
</P>
<P>
   Central to that backdrop are two women _ cast for decades as
political wives standing by their men. In 2000, Elizabeth Dole will
seek the presidential nomination; Hillary Clinton, perhaps, a U.S.
Senate seat. The political message of the post-impeachment era is
that extremism is out and moderation in. That gives women,
especially pragmatic ones such as Dole and Clinton, an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If GOP candidates for the presidency, especially George W. Bush
and Elizabeth Dole, can move the party back to the mainstream,
where most women voters are, the country and the two-party system
will be better off. The early signs are good.
</P>
<P>
   Indications that this week's Washington summit is more than a
simplistic tribute to ``Women's History Month'' are reinforced by
the grassroots activities of coalition building that are bubbling
up at the state level among women's groups. Those efforts may
signal the disintegration of the backlash to the women's movement
that started in the 1980s. I hope so.
</P>
<P>
   As the hard-core right wing of the GOP embraced the backlash,
pushing its socially conservative agenda, women's organizations
lurched to the left. That has to change if feminism is to retrieve
its original focus on mainstream issues such as equal pay,
education and legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia women's groups have also formed a coalition, the Georgia
Women's Alliance, made up of 30 organizations across the state.
That group will soon suggest to Gov. Roy Barnes some strong women
candidates for appointment to several key posts _ the Public
Service Commission, the state board of education and the governor's
powerful new regional transportation authority. If any governor in
the country understands the significance of the women's vote,
Barnes does. Women accounted for much of his margin of victory last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope Barnes' lesson will be the lesson for all politicians
in 2000, when women will turn out in record numbers to vote. Groups
such as Women Online can contact a million women in a heartbeat.
The suffragettes would be proud.

 &HT;    Controlling Florida's illegal workers a tricky business
 &HT;    By Gary Kane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The promise of jobs fuels the business
of migrant smuggling, and Florida offers a land of opportunity for
those who sneak across its borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I believe that, if you focused on employees and
contractors and take away all sources of employment . . . you can
literally turn your back on the borders,'' said Billy Kring, former
chief of the U.S. Border Patrol in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service, which oversees the
Border Patrol, does just the opposite. It focuses on border
security.
</P>
<P>
   An illegal job market flourishes in Florida, prompting growing
numbers of migrants to turn to smugglers. And smugglers operate in
a climate of acceptable risk: a Border Patrol in Florida that
hasn't seen an increase in manpower in 10 years, a Coast Guard
patrolling a region strewn with islands of safe havens, courts
wrestling with complex immigration law and juries sympathetic
toward refugees.
</P>
<P>
   About 350,000 illegal immigrants live in Florida, according to a
1997 INS estimate.
</P>
<P>
   During the years immediately following Congress' decision in
1986 to outlaw hiring illegal aliens, the Miami INS office opened
hundreds of cases against employers. In 1988, the agency
investigated 711 employers.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, the caseload had dropped dramatically.
Agents were handling fewer than 50 investigations a year. It was
during that period that the Border Patrol was instructed to
concentrate on immigrants, not employers, Kring said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the late 1980s we focused on the work site and it made a
huge difference,'' Kring said. ``We'd go to work site and maybe 80
percent would be illegals. We'd go back and they'd be a lot less,
and the third time you'd be lucky to find one or two. Now, we just
don't have the manpower to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The INS in Miami opened 126 cases last year against employers
statewide. Many involve employers' failure to keep decent records
showing whether their workers are here legally.
</P>
<P>
   The agency removed 133 illegal workers from their jobs last year
in South Florida. Offending employers were fined a total of
$28,650.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions work, said Thomas Danter, supervisor of the
investigations unit in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we would remove unauthorized workers and nothing
happened to the employers,'' he said. ``They would just go out and
hire more.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, employers can be fined up to $3,000 per worker and
sentenced to six months in prison. Danter said he's never seen an
employer sentenced to prison in Florida. He's been an agent since
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Inspection turns into melee
</P>
<P>
   Local INS officials hesitate to even talk about work site
inspections. Their reluctance might be traced to an April 23 raid
at a flower wholesaler in West Dade, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A melee erupted while armed agents rounded up 23 workers at
First Paragon Floral. Workers complained that agents pushed them
around, forced them to sit on wet floors, confined them in a cold
storage area and shouted at them to produce their papers. Some
employees insisted they were legal residents or green-card workers
and resisted the agents, prompting a call to Miami-Dade police.
</P>
<P>
   Community leaders, including Miami-Dade County Mayor Alex
Penelas, lambasted the INS. It turned out that three of the
arrested workers were permanent residents and eight others were
eligible for work permits.
</P>
<P>
   The raid was mentioned in a report issued by the National
Network for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, which accused INS agents
nationwide of using terror tactics. The report, called ``Portrait
of Injustice'' documented abuses in 235 INS raids.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a month after the West Dade incident, the INS directed
its agents to have a written plan for every ``work site
enforcement'' and to bring a liaison officer with them. The agency
also told inspectors to focus on employers who hire smuggled
immigrants or abuse their workers.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what the Miami office is doing, which explains
why investigators have opened only eight cases against employers
since last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do area-control operations,'' which is Danter's way
of saying there are no surprise raids at job sites.
</P>
<P>
   That means INS agents rarely investigate the largest employer of
unauthorized workers _ the state's fruit and vegetable growers.
</P>
<P>
   Farms not investigated
</P>
<P>
   No farm owner in Florida has been sanctioned for hiring illegal
workers during the past three years, according to data compiled by
the Center for Immigration Studies. Instead, the INS has fined
restaurants, landscapers, nurseries and other small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get a lead (about a farm employing illegal workers), it
does get investigated,'' Danter said. ``I haven't seen any types of
leads recently come in on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, even advocates for the growers say it's no secret
that large numbers of illegal employees are working the fruit and
vegetable fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen estimates as high as 80 percent. There's no question
it's significant,'' said Walter Kates, a labor specialist with the
Florida Fruit &AMP; Vegetable Association in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Growers can do little to weed out unauthorized workers, he said.
Field hands are getting jobs with counterfeit identification and
immigration documents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the law is written, the employer cannot second-guess
or ask for additional documents,'' Kates said. ``That becomes a
form of discrimination and the farmer would be subject to fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Counterfeit immigrant registration receipt cards, the new
version of what used to be called green cards, are widespread, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been the Achilles' heel of verification.''
</P>
<P>
   Danter added that the INS doesn't expect farmers to be able to
spot phony documents. The INS operates a separate unit dedicated to
chasing bogus document suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the INS raided a counterfeiting ring in Los Angeles
that produced phony documents, some of which turned up in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Farm worker advocates charge that counterfeit documents offer a
convenient excuse for growers. Growers could check workers' records
electronically through a voluntary INS program being tested in
Florida. But none is participating.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are powerful interests, fruit and vegetable growers
among them, who want to make sure a system like this is not
implemented nationwide,'' said Mark Krikorian, executive director
of the Center for Immigration Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Growers dodge the verification problem by hiring their field
hands from farm labor contractors, say migrant worker advocates.
Contractors function like independent foremen. Growers pay them to
deliver work crews. The contractors hire pickers, and it's their
responsibility to check each worker's papers.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers expect contractors to follow the law, said Gary Smigiel,
general counsel for Mecca Farms of Lantana. ``We require
contractors to hire legal help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No contractor in Florida has been fined for hiring illegal
workers during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Labor &AMP; Employment Security has no
record of ever revoking or suspending the license of a contractor
for hiring undocumented workers, said an agency spokesman. The
department, which licenses contractors for the federal government,
refers any matters involving illegal workers to the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal workers don't complain
</P>
<P>
   ``Regulating contractors has done nothing,'' said attorney
Gregory Schell of the Migrant Farmworkers Justice Project in Belle
Glade.
</P>
<P>
   Farms are the ``sweatshops in the sun,'' he said. Farmers
treasure illegal workers because they don't complain and work for
low wages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmhands arrive in Florida owing $800 to $1,200 to smugglers,
Schell said. Their debts often are deducted from their wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smuggling fees take about 50 percent of what's earned, so we
see people crying about not being able to send money home,'' Schell
said.
</P>
<P>
   A contractor in western Palm Beach County, who asked that his
identity be protected, said harvests are done almost exclusively by
illegal workers from Mexico. No one else will accept the jobs, the
contractor said.
</P>
<P>
   Growers also argue that migrant workers are the only people
willing to work the farms. Removing illegal workers would only
create a worker shortage, they say.
</P>
<P>
   However, a 1997 federal report indicated that farmers need not
worry. Less than 5 percent of the INS work-site investigations
involved agriculture. Furthermore, INS officials quoted in the
report said they were ill-equipped to significantly reduce
unauthorized farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hancock, director of the Department of Labor's farm workers
division in Washington, D.C., sees another force blocking an INS
crackdown on employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not going to happen because of the politics.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, several congressmen, led by Sen. Paul Coverdell,
R.-Ga., halted a massive INS raid in May on onion farms in Vidalia,
Ga. Farmers bitterly complained that their harvest would be ruined
without the 4,000 to 5,000 Mexicans they hire each year.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented move, the INS agreed to look the other way
while scores of illegal workers harvested the onions. In exchange,
farmers agreed to do more to comply with migrant labor laws.
</P>
<P>
   Workers move to other jobs
</P>
<P>
   Farms are the entry-level workplaces for many illegal migrants.
From there, they move to poultry farms, restaurants and lumber
yards. Others find jobs in tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see most unauthorized workers in hotels and restaurants,``
said INS investigator Danter.
</P>
<P>
   The state's booming construction industry is another source of
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hear from people who can't get jobs because they're being
displaced by illegal workers,'' said Rick Grennier, chief of the
Border Patrol in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Subcontractors who hire illegal workers save money and are able
to underbid competitors, he explained. For example, agents arrested
about 40 illegal workers at Celebration, Disney's upscale housing
development.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress pumped up the INS budget in 1996, it added money
for new work-site inspectors. But it hasn't added money for more
inspectors since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got nothing,'' recalled Russell Bergeron, an INS spokesman
in Washington. ``The critics who complain about the lack of
interior enforcement are the same ones who vote against the
resources to accomplish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the INS seems more vigilant in other states.
</P>
<P>
   During the first nine months of 1997, the INS cited 23 employers
in Florida for hiring illegal aliens, according to the Center for
Immigration Studies. Incomplete 1997 figures were the most recent
data available.
</P>
<P>
   But in the same period, the INS sanctioned 89 employers in New
York, 57 in Texas, 27 in New Jersey, 28 in Pennsylvania and 30 in
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The INS is expected to soon unveil a five-year plan that focuses
on illegal workers, document fraud and smuggling within the United
States, Bergeron said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is long overdue, say critics. And until it is
implemented, immigrants will continue to pay smugglers to bring
them to the farms, the restaurants, the hotels and construction
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is telling aliens that, if they can run the gantlet,
then they can work here,'' said Krikorian, of the Center for
Immigration Studies. ``It's a moral issue. The nation is provoking
illegal immigration, but making that immigration dangerous.''
</P>

 &HT;    Smugglers face few risks in federal courts
 &HT;    By Gary Kane
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It's a crime with built-in deniability.
</P>
<P>
   This is how it plays out: A U.S. Coast Guard patrol stops a
high-speed boat off the Florida Keys. It finds a dozen Cuban
passengers aboard. The boat's captain explains that he happened to
be fishing when he spotted the Cubans struggling in a sinking raft.
Though the passengers show no signs of fatigue, dehydration or
injury, they confirm the story and insist the captain be treated as
a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling cases are difficult to prosecute because often the
only witness to the crime is the smuggled human cargo. And people
who spend their life savings in a desperate bid to get into the
United States make reluctant witnesses, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of building a case becomes particularly acute when
it involves Cubans, said one Justice Department source who traded
his candid remarks for anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're dealing with a Cuban boat captain and Cuban
passengers, invariably, everyone denies that smuggling is taking
place,'' he said. ``It's always a rescue at sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The business of immigrant smuggling prospers. Demand is high.
Cuban, Haitian and other economic and political refugees eagerly
hire entrepreneurs with fast boats capable of dodging Coast Guard
patrols. The risks of capture and punishment are low. The Border
Patrol in Florida hasn't seen an increase in manpower in 10 years.
Convicted smugglers seldom spend much time in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Built-in deniability is one reason South Florida's federal
prosecutors historically have been reluctant to drag suspected
smugglers into court. They filed only 101 cases of smuggling or
harboring illegal aliens during a five-year period ending September
1998, according to Justice Department records. They declined to
prosecute another 47 cases referred to them by immigration and
other law enforcement officials during that period.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Thomas Scott, who assumed office in mid-1997,
declined to discuss the past performance of federal prosecutors in
South Florida. His policy is to prosecute smugglers aggressively,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His prosecutors filed 21 alien smuggling cases during the past
six months.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen prosecutors are available for smuggling cases, said John
Schlesinger, Scott's special counsel. The office also acquired
three attorneys on loan from the Immigration and Naturalization
Service to help deal with immigration cases. At this point,
however, there are no plans to create a special smuggling unit as
there are for drugs and white collar crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Williams, the federal public defender in Miami, said
she hasn't noticed a sharp increase in smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly has been an appreciable increase in the number
of press conferences on the subject,'' she said. ``It could be
they're being more aggressive or it could be they're making a lot
of noise about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams suggested to Scott that federal prosecutors and public
defenders work together to expedite smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rebuffed,'' she said. ``I was told they didn't have
enough cases to warrant that.''
</P>
<P>
   The punishment is light
</P>
<P>
   Historically, smugglers faced little or no prison time if
caught. Prosecutors suffered a frustrating irony: On average, they
spent more time preparing a case _ roughly six months _ than the
smuggler spent in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, punishment was light even when smuggled people
died. For example, last year three Cubans drowned during a
smuggling trip. Two brothers pleaded guilty and were sentenced to
fewer than four years in prison. In 1994, four Haitians _ two
adults and two children _ drowned off Jensen Beach in a smuggling
attempt. The boat's captain was sentenced to less than four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, the penalty for getting caught smuggling aliens
is just not the same as for someone caught carrying a load of
drugs,'' said Mark Briesemeister, who supervises an anti-smuggling
unit for the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Miami. ``To
the smuggler, the risks are minimal and the profit potential is
high.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress upped the stakes two years ago when it toughened the
penalties for the crime. The maximum penalty for alien smuggling
doubled to 10 years. Federal judges must sentence smugglers to a
minimum of three years now if prosecutors prove the crime was
committed for profit. And prosecutors can now seek the death
penalty for smugglers who cause deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes changing
</P>
<P>
   Cuban smugglers have operated with near impunity. For years,
federal prosecutors hesitated to take smuggling cases to trial in
Miami, where juries could easily include exiles and immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach Post examined the cases of 21 defendants who
pleaded guilty to smuggling and four who were convicted during 1996
and 1997. None involved Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   That's beginning to change. In 1998 South Florida prosecutors
filed alien smuggling charges in six incidents involving Cubans.
Nine Cubans were charged.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants drowned in two of those episodes. In the most
dramatic, a boat packed with 23 Cubans capsized on Dec. 17 south of
Miami. Officials believe 14 people drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Such tragedies are altering South Florida's attitudes toward
smugglers, the U.S. attorney said. The Cuban community now supports
a crackdown, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they recognize that many of these cases are strictly
about money and may involve death,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors secure guilty pleas or verdicts in more than
80 percent of the smuggling cases in South Florida, according to
Justice Department records. Prosecutors in the Southwest boast the
same success rate.
</P>
<P>
   However, South Florida prosecutors historically have dropped the
charges in smuggling cases more often than their colleagues in the
Southwest _ and prosecutors there handle far more cases.
</P>
<P>
   South Florida prosecutors declined 48.8 percent of the smuggling
cases referred to them by law enforcement during a five-year period
ending Sept. 30, 1997. Prosecutors in Arizona declined 6.4 percent
during that period. Prosecutors in South Texas and Southern
California dropped only 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Regional comparisons are misleading, cautions Assistant U.S.
Attorney John Schlesinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no plausible deniability in the Southwest,'' he said.
``For example, if the Border Patrol stops a car crossing the
Mexican border and finds a few aliens in the trunk, what can the
driver say?''
</P>
<P>
   Weak evidence prompted prosecutors in South Florida to drop 16
smuggling cases during the five-year period examined by The Post.
They declined to prosecute 18 others because of a ``lack of
investigative or prosecutorial resources,'' according to Justice
Department records.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony unreliable
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to prosecute cases that rely on the testimony of
smuggled immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators often must decide at sea whether to hold smuggled
immigrants as witnesses or send them back to their homeland.
Repatriation usually means forfeiting their testimony, though
prosecutors have in rare instances taken depositions on foreign
soil. However, that approach raises a Sixth Amendment issue of the
accused smuggler's right to confront all witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   A boatload of Cubans interdicted at sea might be eager to be
brought to shore to testify in a smuggling case. Once in the
country, the Cuban Refugee Readjustment Act kicks in, allowing them
to remain in the country and become eligible for citizenship after
five years. In effect, prosecutors who bring witnesses ashore are
finishing the smuggler's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing Cuban aliens into Miami to be witnesses is shooting
the anti-smuggling effort in the foot,'' said a Justice Department
source.
</P>
<P>
   Also, defense attorneys are quick to attack the credibility of
migrant witnesses. They trade their testimony for promises of work
permits and citizenship, attorneys argue.
</P>
<P>
   Often, smuggled individuals refuse to become witnesses. Two
Bahamian men suspected of smuggling 15 Haitians into Broward County
were deported to Freeport in January after Border Patrol agents
failed to persuade any of the refugees to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say that 80 percent of people don't want to cooperate,''
said Steve Quinones, head of the Border Patrol's anti-smuggling
unit in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Without believable witnesses, prosecutors usually must rely on
circumstantial evidence. They cite the cash, cell phone numbers and
the boat's high-tech navigational gear that pinpoints the migrants'
destination.
</P>
<P>
   Many open-and-shut cases
</P>
<P>
   Most smuggling convictions are open-and-shut cases: a rental van
packed with Mexicans stopped on Interstate 95, Ecuadorans arriving
at Miami International Airport with fake passports, Dominicans
stowed away in a cruise ship cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors convicted 61 people of smuggling or harboring aliens
during the five-year period ending in September 1997. Most were
guilty pleas.
</P>
<P>
   But most of those smugglers didn't go to prison. About one in
four was sentenced to prison during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Courts in the Southwest seem tougher. Judges in Arizona
sentenced 30.5 percent to prison. Southern California judges sent
45 percent to prison and South Texas judges imprisoned slightly
more than half.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were sentenced to prison haven't done much time. The
median prison term in 1997, what the majority of smugglers
convicted in South Florida faced, was five months.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have managed to send smugglers away for longer
prison terms by charging them with other crimes. For example, if a
deported smuggler comes back to the United States, just walking the
streets is evidence of a new crime: reentering the country.
</P>
<P>
   The charge, dubbed ``felony walking,'' is virtually
indefensible.

 &HT;    Bush-Clinton in '00: For candidate trying to please all, this is
the ticket
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ George W. Bush went out on a limb last week and
may have blown a calculated quest to please everyone. He aligned
himself with a noted Republican who, though a war hawk, was squishy
soft on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   It happened when, announcing a presidential exploratory
committee, Bush gave an apparent blanket endorsement of Abraham
Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   The extent to which this has damaged him remains to be seen.
Strategists differ. Bush's invoking the image of a tall
Midwesterner is seen by some as infuriating small Northeasterners.
Aligning himself with Lincoln makes him persona non grata with
certain influential southern PACs, including the Committee to
Deconstruct Reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   Can a campaign so wounded survive?
</P>
<P>
   Strategists differ. But clearly, if Bush is serious about
pleasing enough people to become president, and I think he is, he
has but one choice now: announce tomorrow his running mate, William
Jefferson Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, Elizabeth Dole will.
</P>
<P>
   What's in a name? The names Dole and Bush are to politics what
Hellman's and Kraft are to sandwich spread. But in packaging and
poll numbers, Clinton has established himself as a bona fide
Miracle Whip.
</P>
<P>
   Out-Dukakising the field
</P>
<P>
   You don't need to see poll numbers to know who the front-runners
are anymore in presidential races. They are the candidates being
the most vague.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, Dole and Bush already are in a death struggle.
When asked for specific issue stances, they cover their ears and
hum loudly.
</P>
<P>
   Dole thus far has put the fear of the Lord into Bush with her
oblique tenacity. She's taken care to distance herself from all
telling allegiances. Not only has she left husband Bob at home to
show that he wouldn't call the shots in her presidency, but to
avoid being seen as beholden to former employer American Red Cross,
she has yet to state definitively whether she's for disaster or
against it.
</P>
<P>
   You might say these two front-runners are following in the
footsteps of the vague campaigners whose last names they share.
Wrong. Actually they are applying the lessons learned from the
nominating-process success of a one-time Bush campaign foe, Michael
Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   After 1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale was faulted for
being too specific and honest _ even promising to raise taxes _
Dukakis survived a crowded 1988 field of Democrats by being the
most squat _ as in not telling us squat. Only when he won the
nomination did voters realize that he wasn't too tall, either.
</P>
<P>
   No-tell, do-tell
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's a difference between not telling the voters
anything and telling them everything they want to hear, campaign
promise-wise. That, of course, is where Bush knows Clinton would be
most valuable on his ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shouldn't need the help. He comes off a governor's race in
which he came close to promising everything to everyone _ monster
tax cuts, teacher pay hikes, name it. State budget writers are now
coming to grips with the impossibility of it all.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a run for president, not for Texas' weak
governorship. With Clinton aboard, Bush could stay vague. He could
leave the campaign promises to his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, Bush could deflect questions about his ``young
and foolish'' days by directing all sundry questions to his No. 2
man, who would keep the hounds at bay with plates and plates of raw
fleshy matter. Spiro Agnew was the crooked Nixon's
``law-and-order'' mouthpiece. Bill Clinton could be the blemished
Bush's ``sworn-off-sin'' distraction.
</P>
<P>
   Bush-Clinton. Come on, George. How badly do you want it?

GRAND JURY PROBES BABBITT ROLE IN 1995 CASINO PROPOSAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal grand jury is investigating the rejection
of a Wisconsin Indian casino by the staff of Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt, including whether the White House improperly
influenced the decision in exchange for campaign donations, ``The
Republic'' has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the grand jury secretly heard for more than four
hours from Loretta Avent, a former deputy assistant to the
president. Avent, who left the White House in 1996 and now lives
with her family in Phoenix, is not personally a subject of the
investigation, said her attorney, John Frank.
</P>
<P>
   Avent served as the White House liaison to the nation's Indian
tribes in 1995, when lobbyists, backed by large campaign donations,
sought to pressure the Clinton administration to reject a proposed
Indian casino in Hudson, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Avent counseled her colleagues not to succumb to the lobbyists'
requests, and an independent counsel is now investigating, among
other things, whether the White House took her advice and steered
clear of the lobbyists' influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' has learned that the grand jury also has issued
a subpoena for Interior Department records of a Midwestern tribe,
the Shakopee Sioux, that opposed the casino application that's at
the heart of the Babbitt probe.
</P>
<P>
   Avent's appearance is the first signal that independent counsel
Carol Elder Bruce, in resolving allegations against Babbitt, is
exercising her broad authority to investigate not only the Interior
Department but also whether the White House and possibly the
Democratic National Committee improperly sought to involve
themselves in the casino decision.
</P>
<P>
   Many congressional Republicans consider Bruce's probe a final
opportunity to hold Democrats accountable for what they believe
were widespread campaign fund-raising abuses in the 1996
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Attorney General Janet Reno rejected an independent
counsel investigation of former White House deputy chief of staff
Harold Ickes, who was accused of lying to a Senate committee
looking into campaign finances.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce was appointed one year ago to find out whether Babbitt, a
former governor of Arizona, lied to Congress in his account of the
Interior Department's rejection of an application by three bands of
the Chippewa tribe for the Wisconsin casino. Babbitt's
congressional critics allege that the Interior Department denied
the application because of pressure generated by rival tribes that
were donating heavily to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt has said that his staff based its decision on the merits
of the application and that he was not personally involved.
</P>
<P>
   After House committee hearings in January 1998, some GOP
lawmakers privately conceded that the evidence against Babbitt was
so thin that they would not be disappointed if the investigation
focused less on Babbitt than on his political appointees at
Interior and on the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The federal court that appointed Bruce last year gave her wide
latitude, saying she might want to explore not only whether Babbitt
lied but also ``any potential criminal violations in connection
with the underlying casino decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce's spokesman, Cary Feldman, declined comment Monday, as did
Babbitt's lawyers. Prosecutors use grand juries as a method of
collecting documents and testimony. The jury's existence does not,
by itself, mean indictments are forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   Avent became embroiled in the casino controversy because Patrick
O'Connor, a lobbyist opposed to the proposed casino, was trying to
call her at the White House in 1995 _ presumably to discuss the
application to use a 55-acre parcel of land for gaming.
</P>
<P>
   Avent was reluctant to speak to a lobbyist and believed the
administration should also be wary, she wrote in an April 1995
memorandum to Ickes.
</P>
<P>
   Her memo suggested that it would be a dangerous precedent to
appear to accede to well-connected lobbyists who might promise
campaign donations later on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a hot potato,'' Avent wrote. ``The legal and
political implications of our involvement would be disastrous.''
</P>
<P>
   Avent said the administration owed it to tribes to treat all
Indians the same, regardless of how much money they had or who
their lobbyists were. O'Connor was considered well connected
because he was a former official with the DNC.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republican lawmakers quoted from Avent's memo during the
hearings on Capitol Hill last year.
</P>
<P>
   They said they wanted to know who saw the memo and whether Ickes
and others at the White House took her advice to not get involved
with the casino application.
</P>
<P>
   Those questions were not answered at the Capitol Hill hearings,
which is probably why Bruce and her staff of 10 attorneys were
interested in calling her as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Avent referred inquiries to her Phoenix attorney, Frank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was governmental abuse to call her into this at
all,'' Frank said in an interview. ``She has had nothing to do with
Babbitt in any matter, nor with Paul Eckstein.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein, a Phoenix attorney and former Harvard Law School
classmate of Babbitt's, was a lobbyist for the proposed casino at
the time of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein testified on Capitol Hill that Babbitt told him during
a July 1995 meeting that Ickes had ``directed'' that a decision on
the Chippewa casino be issued ``that day.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said he may have invoked Ickes' name in the context that
Ickes ``expected'' or ``wanted'' a decision. But Babbitt said
Ickes, in fact, never demanded a decision, and that Babbitt made
the statement simply as an excuse to end the meeting with Eckstein.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel was appointed to determine which version
of the conversation _ Eckstein's or Babbitt's _ is true.
</P>
<P>
   If Eckstein's version is true, then Babbitt lied to Congress,
according to the Justice Department. But Babbitt's aides say that
even if he said what he is accused of, it doesn't prove that the
casino decision was improper, or that Babbitt was a major player.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the independent counsel nor the Interior Department
would offer an explanation of why the grand jury is seeking
department records pertaining to the membership of the Shakopee
Sioux.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Shakopee Sioux attracted attention during the
congressional hearings because they opposed the casino application
and because two of Babbitt's former Interior aides represented the
Shakopees after leaving the department.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., said last year that the independent
counsel should review why aides John Duffy and Tom Collier ``took
lucrative law jobs representing the tribe that contributed the
largest amount in the effort to stop the casino proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy and Collier didn't violate any ethics rules, and the law
firm, Steptoe and Johnson, says they didn't handle issues related
to the casino application. &QL;

 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Only children are not necessarily lonely
children, but every once in a while they need a little culture
shock to remind them that life at their house is not the norm. My
mother figured a few weeks each summer at Doweezy?s house in the
country would do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Doweezy Bito was my age, and the oldest of five daughters in a
lively, loving Bohemian family. Life at the Bito's was a melodrama
with Mama directing the entire production from the kitchen sink.
Papa worked on the railroad.
</P>
<P>
   Summers at Doweezy's were an impromptu performance with a
six-star cast, although the baby Rita didn't have much of a part
when we played cowboys and rustlers in the woods behind the
abandoned chicken coop. She was too little to ride the range on a
broom-handle horse with the rest of us. On rainy days
</P>
<P>
   though, when we played house on the front porch, Rita was our
baby. She loved it and Mama said it was okay, as long as we didn't
make her cry.
</P>
<P>
   The Bito girls and I got along well. We argued only over whose
turn it was to be Roy Rogers or Dale Evans. Nobody wanted to be
Gabby but it took all of us to be the Sons of the Pioneers, sitting
around the campfire at night singing, ``Cool Water.''
</P>
<P>
   Late afternoons, when potatoes were on the supper menu, Mama
Bito would holler Doweezy and me in to peel. We'd spread
yesterday's paper on the kitchen floor and sit cross-legged as Mama
shook enough potatoes out of a bag to fill the dented, wire-handled
boiling pot. She kept a close eye on my peels so I
</P>
<P>
   wouldn't waste.
</P>
<P>
   Mornings came early at the Bito's. Seven days a week, all of the
girls who were old enough were expected to show up dressed, hatted,
and ready to pedal off to Mass at the little Catholic church three
blocks away. There were two bicycles for the four of us. We took
turns on the handlebars. What a sight we must have been _ three
Bitos and one southern Baptist, clutching prayer books, skirts
billowing in the wind, pedaling toward redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Since my mother had no inkling of my impending conversion, I'd
come without a church hat. Mama Bito whipped up one for me in an
afternoon _ a little Dutch boy thing in white dotted swiss. Each
morning I'd anchor it with a couple of bobby pins and off we'd go.
One day, when my summer stay had lengthened from a couple of weeks
to over a month, the nun asked if I would like to sing in the choir
with Doweezy and her next sister, Marianna. I checked with Mama
Bito and she said God wouldn't mind a Baptist in the Catholic
choir. She even helped me with the Latin.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after supper, the inevitable march to the bathtub began.
Baby Rita and the next one, Cecee, would already be down for the
night when the rest of us hit the bubbles _ two at a time.
Barefoot, in seersucker nighties, we'd line up for our hugs and
goodnight kisses from Mama and Papa. Doweezy, Marianna,

</P>
<P>
   Each year I cried when summer ended and I had to leave my
warm-weather family. There was just so much life being lived at the
Bito's that I didn't want to give up my place in it.
</P>
<P>
   As so often happens, folks drift apart and get out of touch.
That happened to us. It's been over half-a-century since the girls
and I put our make-believe horses in the barn for the last time. I
had no idea what had become of the Bitos, until this morning
anyway, when I pulled up an email from a reader. ``I read your
column in my local paper. Are you the skinny kid who used to spend
summers at our house?'' It was signed, Louise (Doweezy) Bito.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure am,'' I emailed right back. I hope she asks what I'm
doing this summer.

 &HT;    MONEY TALK: Do the Couch Potato
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Couch Potato portfolio had another wonderful year.
</P>
<P>
   It was up 19.6 percent during 1998, which beats the 12.1 percent
average return for 726 comparable mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Couch Potato is one of those too-good-to-be-true investment
formulas, seemingly in the same class with consulting an
astrologer, checking hemlines or woofing with the Dogs of the Dow.
The difference is the Couch Potato seems to work more years than
not.
</P>
<P>
   It's called the Couch Potato because it is simple to execute,
easy to maintain and dull as dirt. You put half your money into an
S&AMP;P 500 index fund and half into a government bond fund. Then you
go away and leave it alone. Maybe once a year you come back and
shift money from one to the other, to maintain a 50-50 balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good investment returns come from being simple, cheap and
virtually inert,'' argues Scott Burns, the Dallas Morning News
columnist who invented the Couch Potato.
</P>
<P>
   The chart tells the story. The Couch Potato has given better
returns in four of the last seven years, compared with the average
for hybrid mutual funds. Hybrid funds have a similar mix of stocks
and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   If you invested $10,000 over those seven years, the Couch Potato
would have made about $24,600, or $2,500 more than the hybrid
funds.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is Burns chose low-cost Vanguard funds for his
portfolio. The stock investment is in the Index 500 fund; the bonds
are in the Intermediate Term U.S. Treasury fund.
</P>
<P>
   I am not saying the Couch Potato is suitable for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of investors: Those who know they can beat
the market, and those who know the market can beat them. This gets
down to the basic urges of the marketplace, greed and fear.
</P>
<P>
   More daring investors _ including the market beaters _ won't be
satisfied with the Couch Potato. That's because it hasn't kept up
with the stock market and probably never will.
</P>
<P>
   The Couch Potato returned 19.6 percent in 1998, but the Standard
and Poors' 500 index was up 26.7 percent. The Couch Potato was held
back by those stodgy bonds, which returned 10.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, especially those with investments in tax-deferred
retirement accounts, may also go for more aggressive investments.
They have the time to coast past any stock market retreats.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the fearless investors, more or less. The Couch Potato
appeals more to the fearful.
</P>
<P>
   If you are willing to accept an average return on your stock
investments, rather than taking a chance on hot-hands investment
managers, then the S&AMP;P 500 index fund will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   If you fear the volatility of the stock market, then government
bonds in the Couch Potato will comfort you.
</P>
<P>
   If you are frozen by the number of mutual funds to choose from _
more than 10,000 now _ the simplicity of Burns' approach will be a
relief.
</P>
<P>
   If you are afraid of making mistakes _ buying too high, selling
too soon, holding on too long and all that _ the passive, even
somnolent technique of the Couch Potato is rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   You are not stuck with those two funds from the Vanguard family.
You can find mutual funds with similar aims in the USAA, Fidelity,
T. Rowe Price, Dreyfus and Schwab groups.
</P>
<P>
   Nor must you stick to a 50-50 allocation. Burns also tracks a
racier formula: 75 percent stocks, 25 percent bonds. Its return
last year was 24.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one more comforting thought: Burns himself is a couch
potato. His own 401(k) retirement account practices what he
preaches.

 &HT;    Toyota serious about reviving full-size pickup
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toyota is making a second stab in the full-size truck segment,
and this time the company has taken the gloves off.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, including Toyota, knows that its first attempt, the
T100, missed the mark. It wasn't that it was a bad truck; it just
had two major flaws. It didn't offer a V-8 engine, and it was
priced too high. Harnessed with the 25 percent import duty, a buyer
really had to want a Toyota to justify the T100's cost.
</P>
<P>
   Things are about to change. Scheduled to go on sale in June, but
with order models expected in Toyota stores late this month, Toyota
has made a concentrated effort to ensure the new half-ton Tundra
not only meets but exceeds buyers' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Toyota realizes the Tundra needs to be better in key
areas that define what a full-sized truck is all about:
acceleration, towing, payload hauling and braking.
</P>
<P>
   Based on tests by AMCI, an independent testing organization, the
Indiana-built Tundra appears to have hit paydirt. It went
zero-to-60 in 7.87 seconds. That's more than a second better than a
comparable Chevrolet Silverado or Ford F-150.
</P>
<P>
   On average, the Tundra has 20 percent better acceleration
performance, comparing base engine against base engine.
</P>
<P>
   AMCI also conducted the tests pitting the Tundra's new
245-horsepower, 4.7-liter, dual-overhead-cam V-8 against the
competition's larger optional engines. Tundra beat the 5.9-liter
Dodge Ram, tied the 5.3-liter Chevy and trailed the 5.4-liter Ford
by 0.003 of a second.
</P>
<P>
   All Tundras will have standard anti-lock brakes. Loaded with a
1,200-pound payload, AMCI found Tundra stopped shorter and surer
than competitors.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake, the new Tundra is not a copy of an American
truck; it is still uniquely Toyota. Equipped with rack-and-pinion
steering, the feel is like that of an upscale passenger car, a
sensation confirmed by an exceptionally quiet cab.
</P>
<P>
   Little wind or road noise can be heard in an interior where you
really have to remind yourself that you are driving a pickup. And
with Toyota's attention to ergonomics, the Tundra's new extended
cab will be the first in the segment in which there are handles
inside and outside the body.
</P>
<P>
   A test drive of a pre-production Tundra gave all indications
that Toyota has handled the performance barrier. And just to get
the consumers' and competition's attention, the company is baring
its knuckles on pricing. A well-equipped truck with the extended
Access Cab will carry a manufacturer's suggested retail price of
$22,250.
</P>
<P>
   It includes a four-speed automatic, air conditioning,
radio/cassette, tachometer, cruise control and 16-inch styled
wheels. A standard cab V-6 with a manual transmission will carry an
MSRP of $14,995.

 &HT;    For Neon, it's already 2000
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bring on 2000 _ that's the message DaimlerChrysler wants to
convey with its all-new Neon sedan, but, unfortunately, that's not
all you'll hear from the frisky compact.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, as DaimlerChrysler reiterates, that the Neon,
available in near-identical versions with your choice of Plymouth
or Dodge badging, is getting quieter as it matures. It's decibels
quieter than when introduced in 1994, but the 2000 Neon does have
echoes of the noise problems that hounded those first-generation
models.
</P>
<P>
   It's no big loser, however. The Neon is basically a smart
compact with some decent standard features and a sound ride and
decent performance and fuel mileage from its four-cylinder engine.
By adding insulation and making other refinements, DaimlerChrysler
now offers a Neon that's a tad bigger, a bit smoother and clearly
coming up to speed in the race for entry-level/budget-conscious
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Some things haven't changed, however, although the pricing isn't
one of them. The base prices for the Plymouth and Dodge versions _
differentiated only by their badging and steering-wheel insignia _
have crept up about $600 this year and now start at $12,890 in base
form with similarly upgraded Plymouth LX and Dodge ES trim levels
available for about $14,600.
</P>
<P>
   The test Neon Plymouth LX came with a list price of $12,390 but
had enough individual and packaged options to push the bottom line
to $17,700 before discounts pulled it down to $16,680. The add-ons
included air conditioning, power anti-lock disc brakes, a CD
player, tilt wheel, cruise control and power windows and locks.
Suffice it to say that the list of standard equipment really isn't
a long read.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to navigate the powertrain possibilities,
either. Missing this year is the 150-horsepower engine option,
meaning the only powerplant is the 132-hp four-cylinder with either
a three-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission. Frequent
stirring of the test Neon's manual were smoothly accomplished and
doubtlessly made for better starts and merges than the automatic is
going to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, pushing it along contributes to the engine and road noise,
but maybe that's why Neons can be equipped with a nice stereo
system that includes a CD player for a modest $125. Add that, and
the cabin, which has good visibility and simple instrumentation
with white-face gauges, becomes quite habitable. Attractively
finished and comfortably designed seats adjust easily, and drink
holders are said to be specially designed to be capable of taking
on Big Gulp beverages _ another sign that the Neon is aimed at the
youth market.
</P>
<P>
   But make that the upper end of the youth market, those buyers
mature enough to be willing to trade the sportiness of a coupe for
the convenience of four doors (and to pay extra for air
conditioning and some other create comforts). The nifty coupe is
gone, leaving the Neon Plymouth/Dodge sedan to motor on despite
unanswered questions about its reliability and the future of the
Plymouth line itself.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, the Neon is the first 2000 model to come to market,
and while it's not a radical way of entering the next millennium,
it's a practical possibility even if it won't go there all that
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Neon Plymouth/Dodge front-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $16,680 (includes discounts not always
available, base price: $12,390)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (132 horsepower),
optional three-speed automatic transmission ($600)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, side-impact beams,
optional power anti-lock disc brakes with traction control ($740)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: package with air conditioning,
power front windows and locks, heated mirrors, keyless entry,
tachometer, assist handles, fog lamps, tilt steering wheel and
185/60R15 touring tires, $2,365; cruise control, $225; AM/FM radio
with CD player, $125; 15-inch aluminum wheels, $355; package with
lights for mirrors, engine compartment and interior, $130
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 25 mpg regular unleaded city, 31 mpg highway

 &HT;    Batteries can fall into short-trip death cycle
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: While living in Florida, I drove my car 20 miles to and from
work without experiencing any battery problems. When I moved to
Cumberland, my commute was shortened to two miles. Coincidentally,
I have had a succession of batteries installed ranging from
expensive, top-of-the-line models to (a discount store's) best.
None of them has lasted. They work fine in warm weather but fall
flat when the temperature turns cold.
</P>
<P>
   One dealer replaced my ignition switch and another my starter,
with no results. I bought a voltmeter that allows me to monitor the
charging voltage while driving and determined the charging rate was
indeed low when all of the accessories were operating. I have since
installed a new aftermarket voltage regulator and am now charging
15-16 volts, yet on really cold mornings the battery voltage still
reads lower than normal. I bought a battery charger, but it is
really inconvenient to run an extension cord from my condo's
bedroom window, so I have resorted to carrying one of those
portable battery jump-start packs in the trunk of my car.
</P>
<P>
   Am I forever doomed to this kind of existence? Is there a better
brand of battery for my short trips? Any suggestions are welcome. _
Cal Calhoun
</P>
<P>
   A: It was not coincidental that your battery saga corresponded
with your two-mile commute pattern. A battery needs about 20
minutes of continuous, high engine rpm to completely recharge after
the starter has drained it. Your Florida commute provided that.
What your battery is being subjected to is a constant cycle of
discharge from the starter motor and partial recharge, with the
battery getting weaker each time.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is also a player here. A marginal battery may
perform satisfactorily in warm weather but even a good, fully
charged battery loses some of its capacity when the temperature
drops.
</P>
<P>
   Your ``15-16 volt'' regulator also has me concerned. Although it
may appear to be a solution, you are more likely compounding your
problem and creating an explosive situation. The charging voltage
to the battery should be about 2 volts more than battery voltage
with accessories off and about 0.5 to 1 volt above with all of them
on. If the battery is being overcharged, it begins to boil out the
electrolyte solution, ultimately uncovering part of the active lead
plate material and rendering it useless. Battery capacity
diminishes. Worse yet, as the electrolyte level gets lower, more
hydrogen gas collects inside the vacated area of the battery. A
good zap with that battery pack of yours and BOOM!
</P>
<P>
   I suspect your particular problem may also be related to a
partial electrical blockage between the alternator and the battery
and needs to be diagnosed by a good electrical mechanic. The
short-trip death cycle of batteries might be solved by using a
different type of battery.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the batteries are the sealed, maintenance-free type. The
good news is that these batteries have a long shelf life and really
are maintenance-free, with no periodic service required. However,
maintenance-free batteries have a downside. They are harder to
recharge and do not tolerate deep discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Low-maintenance batteries, on the other hand, are not sealed
(they have little caps on top) and require periodic service. The
trade-off is that these batteries can be discharged and recharged
easier. Low-maintenance batteries are usually sold at independent
repair shops.
</P>
<P>
   After you have repaired your charging system and replaced your
battery (again), take it out and drive it a long distance at least
once a week.
</P>

industry, is an automotive instructor at DeKalb Technical Institute

 &HT;    SUVs: How big is too big?
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Just what we need: one more guilt-trip
about living in the 'burbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough already that our sport-utility vehicles burn gas by
the tanker and can squash Geo Metros like raisins. Now, here comes
Ford trying to sell us the biggest ``sport ute'' on earth _ one the
pundits and tree-huggers and safety nabobs can't stop howling
about.
</P>
<P>
   And, well... it looks pretty nice.
</P>
<P>
   They call it the Ford Excursion, 19 feet and 4 1/4 tons of
stroller-haulin', Honda-stompin' machinery. It seats nine, gets a
shameful 12 mpg and stretches almost a foot longer than the
previous champ, the Chevrolet Suburban. (Chevy has already vowed to
one-up the monster Ford.)
</P>
<P>
   All of which begs the question: Honey, how big is our garage?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not the question serious people want you to
ask. Pretend you're thinking: My God in heaven! How big is too big?
</P>
<P>
   Seems we really have reached the point where someone needs to do
something about the mass quantities of fuel SUVs burn, the exhaust
they emit and the waste they lay to cars that stray into their
paths.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club nicknamed the Excursion (which sells for
$45,000) the ``Ford Valdez,'' evoking the notorious Exxon
supertanker disaster. And the EPA fears a rise in greenhouse gasses
because, as light trucks, all sport utilities are allowed to
produce more fumes than cars.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, something must be done. But it must be done in Washington
or Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't start in Omaha or Fort Lauderdale or
Poughkeepsie. And a case could be made that it shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is like an 18-wheeler,'' says Angela Farazi, a
mother of two, praising her hulking (but now second-tier) Ford
Expedition. ``I have no use for another foot of space ... but if I
had another child, I'd go for the new, bigger
whatever-you-call-it.''
</P>
<P>
   Key word there: child.
</P>
<P>
   See, it's a car-eat-car world out there on interstates and
six-lane boulevards _ what with all the crazies running red lights
and hurtling across town at 70 mph. And no one will ever convince
suburbanites it's smarter to wrap less protective metal around
their precious kids and spouses, even if a Camry produces less
smog.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, the Farazis and their Expedition had a
nearly head-on collision with a sedan in October. Both cars were
doing 30 mph _ the same speed you see in government crash tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``We practically drove over them,'' Farazi says of the wreck
that demolished the other car but, miraculously, spared its
passengers serious injury. ``We still did $10,000 in damage to our
truck, but inside you couldn't even tell there was an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it costs $30 to fill an Expedition or Suburban's tank.
And SUV owners say they'd happily buy a more efficient,
cleaner-burning SUV _ if only somebody sold one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not driving this thing because I want to guzzle gas or
pollute the environment,'' Ferazi says. ``I'm driving it to protect
my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics need look no further than the soccer fields to see that
any change in vehicle size and efficiency will have to be driven
from the ``supply side.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought about the Expedition for carrying extra kids,''
says Cindy Woolf, a soccer mom now driving her third Ford Explorer.
Why the Explorer? ``It's mostly a safety thing. Also, it has space
in the back for the kids' junk ... And it's not a minivan.'' Big or
too big?
</P>
<P>
   So, how big is too big for SUV buyers?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a line,'' Woolf says.
</P>
<P>
   Like when it slugs down $60 a week in gas? Or when the exhaust
from a planet-sized Suburban forms its own atmospheric weather
systems?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's when it just becomes too hard to maneuver, hard
to park,'' Woolf speculates.
</P>
<P>
   Tsk, tsk.
</P>
<P>
   (Wink, wink.)

 &HT;    SUVs: How big is too big?
 &HT;    By Matt Reed
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Just what we need: one more guilt-trip
about living in the 'burbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough already that our sport-utility vehicles burn gas by
the tanker and can squash Geo Metros like raisins. Now, here comes
Ford trying to sell us the biggest ``sport ute'' on earth _ one the
pundits and tree-huggers and safety nabobs can't stop howling
about.
</P>
<P>
   And, well... it looks pretty nice.
</P>
<P>
   They call it the Ford Excursion, 19 feet and 4 1/4 tons of
stroller-haulin', Honda-stompin' machinery. It seats nine, gets a
shameful 12 mpg and stretches almost a foot longer than the
previous champ, the Chevrolet Suburban. (Chevy has already vowed to
one-up the monster Ford.)
</P>
<P>
   All of which begs the question: Honey, how big is our garage?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that's not the question serious people want you to
ask. Pretend you're thinking: My God in heaven! How big is too big?
</P>
<P>
   Seems we really have reached the point where someone needs to do
something about the mass quantities of fuel SUVs burn, the exhaust
they emit and the waste they lay to cars that stray into their
paths.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club nicknamed the Excursion (which sells for
$45,000) the ``Ford Valdez,'' evoking the notorious Exxon
supertanker disaster. And the EPA fears a rise in greenhouse gasses
because, as light trucks, all sport utilities are allowed to
produce more fumes than cars.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, something must be done. But it must be done in Washington
or Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly won't start in Omaha or Fort Lauderdale or
Poughkeepsie. And a case could be made that it shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing is like an 18-wheeler,'' says Angela Farazi, a
mother of two, praising her hulking (but now second-tier) Ford
Expedition. ``I have no use for another foot of space ... but if I
had another child, I'd go for the new, bigger
whatever-you-call-it.''
</P>
<P>
   Key word there: child.
</P>
<P>
   See, it's a car-eat-car world out there on interstates and
six-lane boulevards _ what with all the crazies running red lights
and hurtling across town at 70 mph. And no one will ever convince
suburbanites it's smarter to wrap less protective metal around
their precious kids and spouses, even if a Camry produces less
smog.
</P>
<P>
   As fate would have it, the Farazis and their Expedition had a
nearly head-on collision with a sedan in October. Both cars were

truck, but inside you couldn't even tell there was an accident.''
</P>
<P>

And SUV owners say they'd happily buy a more efficient,

 &HT;    For Neon, it's already 2000
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bring on 2000 _ that's the message DaimlerChrysler wants to
convey with its all-new Neon sedan, but, unfortunately, that's not
all you'll hear from the frisky compact.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, as DaimlerChrysler reiterates, that the Neon,
available in near-identical versions with your choice of Plymouth
or Dodge badging, is getting quieter as it matures. It's decibels
quieter than when introduced in 1994, but the 2000 Neon does have
echoes of the noise problems that hounded those first-generation
models.
</P>
<P>
   It's no big loser, however. The Neon is basically a smart
compact with some decent standard features and a sound ride and
decent performance and fuel mileage from its four-cylinder engine.
By adding insulation and making other refinements, DaimlerChrysler
now offers a Neon that's a tad bigger, a bit smoother and clearly
coming up to speed in the race for entry-level/budget-conscious
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Some things haven't changed, however, although the pricing isn't
one of them. The base prices for the Plymouth and Dodge versions _
differentiated only by their badging and steering-wheel insignia _
have crept up about $600 this year and now start at $12,890 in base
form with similarly upgraded Plymouth LX and Dodge ES trim levels
available for about $14,600.
</P>
<P>
   The test Neon Plymouth LX came with a list price of $12,390 but
had enough individual and packaged options to push the bottom line
to $17,700 before discounts pulled it down to $16,680. The add-ons
included air conditioning, power anti-lock disc brakes, a CD
player, tilt wheel, cruise control and power windows and locks.
Suffice it to say that the list of standard equipment really isn't
a long read.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't take long to navigate the powertrain possibilities,
either. Missing this year is the 150-horsepower engine option,
meaning the only powerplant is the 132-hp four-cylinder with either
a three-speed automatic or five-speed manual transmission. Frequent
stirring of the test Neon's manual were smoothly accomplished and
doubtlessly made for better starts and merges than the automatic is
going to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, pushing it along contributes to the engine and road noise,
but maybe that's why Neons can be equipped with a nice stereo
system that includes a CD player for a modest $125. Add that, and
the cabin, which has good visibility and simple instrumentation
with white-face gauges, becomes quite habitable. Attractively
finished and comfortably designed seats adjust easily, and drink
holders are said to be specially designed to be capable of taking
on Big Gulp beverages _ another sign that the Neon is aimed at the
youth market.
</P>
<P>
   But make that the upper end of the youth market, those buyers
mature enough to be willing to trade the sportiness of a coupe for
the convenience of four doors (and to pay extra for air
conditioning and some other create comforts). The nifty coupe is
gone, leaving the Neon Plymouth/Dodge sedan to motor on despite
unanswered questions about its reliability and the future of the
Plymouth line itself.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, the Neon is the first 2000 model to come to market,
and while it's not a radical way of entering the next millennium,
it's a practical possibility even if it won't go there all that
quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 2000 Neon Plymouth/Dodge front-drive sedan
</P>
<P>
   Price as tested: $16,680 (includes discounts not always
available, base price: $12,390)
</P>
<P>
   Drivetrain: 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine (132 horsepower),
optional three-speed automatic transmission ($600)
</P>
<P>
   Safety features: dual front air bags, side-impact beams,
optional power anti-lock disc brakes with traction control ($740)
</P>
<P>
   Other options on test vehicle: package with air conditioning,
power front windows and locks, heated mirrors, keyless entry,
tachometer, assist handles, fog lamps, tilt steering wheel and
185/60R15 touring tires, $2,365; cruise control, $225; AM/FM radio
with CD player, $125; 15-inch aluminum wheels, $355; package with
lights for mirrors, engine compartment and interior, $130
</P>
<P>
   EPA figures: 25 mpg regular unleaded city, 31 mpg highway

 &HT;    Batteries can fall into short-trip death cycle
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: While living in Florida, I drove my car 20 miles to and from
work without experiencing any battery problems. When I moved to
Cumberland, my commute was shortened to two miles. Coincidentally,
I have had a succession of batteries installed ranging from
expensive, top-of-the-line models to (a discount store's) best.
None of them has lasted. They work fine in warm weather but fall
flat when the temperature turns cold.
</P>
<P>
   One dealer replaced my ignition switch and another my starter,
with no results. I bought a voltmeter that allows me to monitor the
charging voltage while driving and determined the charging rate was
indeed low when all of the accessories were operating. I have since
installed a new aftermarket voltage regulator and am now charging
15-16 volts, yet on really cold mornings the battery voltage still
reads lower than normal. I bought a battery charger, but it is
really inconvenient to run an extension cord from my condo's
bedroom window, so I have resorted to carrying one of those
portable battery jump-start packs in the trunk of my car.
</P>
<P>
   Am I forever doomed to this kind of existence? Is there a better
brand of battery for my short trips? Any suggestions are welcome. _
Cal Calhoun
</P>
<P>
   A: It was not coincidental that your battery saga corresponded
with your two-mile commute pattern. A battery needs about 20
minutes of continuous, high engine rpm to completely recharge after
the starter has drained it. Your Florida commute provided that.
What your battery is being subjected to is a constant cycle of
discharge from the starter motor and partial recharge, with the
battery getting weaker each time.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is also a player here. A marginal battery may
perform satisfactorily in warm weather but even a good, fully
charged battery loses some of its capacity when the temperature
drops.
</P>
<P>
   Your ``15-16 volt'' regulator also has me concerned. Although it
may appear to be a solution, you are more likely compounding your
problem and creating an explosive situation. The charging voltage
to the battery should be about 2 volts more than battery voltage
with accessories off and about 0.5 to 1 volt above with all of them
on. If the battery is being overcharged, it begins to boil out the
electrolyte solution, ultimately uncovering part of the active lead
plate material and rendering it useless. Battery capacity
diminishes. Worse yet, as the electrolyte level gets lower, more
hydrogen gas collects inside the vacated area of the battery. A
good zap with that battery pack of yours and BOOM!
</P>
<P>
   I suspect your particular problem may also be related to a
partial electrical blockage between the alternator and the battery
and needs to be diagnosed by a good electrical mechanic. The
short-trip death cycle of batteries might be solved by using a
different type of battery.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the batteries are the sealed, maintenance-free type. The
good news is that these batteries have a long shelf life and really
are maintenance-free, with no periodic service required. However,
maintenance-free batteries have a downside. They are harder to
recharge and do not tolerate deep discharge.
</P>
<P>
   Low-maintenance batteries, on the other hand, are not sealed
(they have little caps on top) and require periodic service. The
trade-off is that these batteries can be discharged and recharged
easier. Low-maintenance batteries are usually sold at independent
repair shops.
</P>
<P>
   After you have repaired your charging system and replaced your
battery (again), take it out and drive it a long distance at least
once a week.
</P>
<P>

industry, is an automotive instructor at DeKalb Technical Institute
and an ASE master automobile technician/L-1.

 &HT;    Group unites Allied, German pilots
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Once, they sneered at one another
through cross hairs, each bracing for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   Now they want to get past that.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 60 veterans in the U.S. Military Pilots Association,
based in suburban Boynton Beach, are American. One is Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   And two flew for the Third Reich.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can get past that they were enemies,'' said association
member George Boone. ``The war is over.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during a card game several years ago that Wolf Abler, a
retired consulting engineer from Dusseldorf who's wintered at Quail
Ridge for 18 years, mentioned his flying past. An association
member at the game invited Abler to attend a function.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the beginning it was very friendly coming together,''
Abler said. ``No animosity.''
</P>
<P>
   Abler said he joined the Luftwaffe at 17 and rose to the rank of
lieutenant. He was never shot down but mechanical problems led to
two emergency landings in Germany. And he shot down one British
pilot, believed killed as his plane plunged into the North Sea off
of Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must confess I didn't like the Nazi regime,'' Abler, 77,
said. ``But you have parents. You have relatives. You have other
people. I was always thinking, `I do it for my country.' But if you
are in the air, you are in combat, you have no choice. Shoot or be
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   The other German, Rudy Ploederl, was shot down during the battle
of Stalingrad and spent 3 1/2 years in a Russian prisoner-of-war
camp. He declined to be interviewed, citing his poor English.
</P>
<P>
   Some can't forgive, forget
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first case of former World War II foes getting
together. But it's a sensitive issue with no right answers, said
Phil Bodahn, spokesman for the 2.8 million-member American Legion,
the largest group of American veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of our veterans have gone through things that we not only
don't talk about, we can't talk about,'' Bodahn said from
Washington. ``I know World War II veterans today who can not, who
would not talk to a Japanese or a German veteran. At the same time
I know people, World War II veterans, who feel a sense of kinship
with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Group welcomed Germans
</P>
<P>
   In World War I movies, chivalrous pilots saluted their worthy
foes while their scarves flapped in the wind. That romantic
stereotype tailed off in the next war, said Roger Cirillo, project
historian for the planned World War II memorial in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But pilots of that era do seem less contemptuous of the enemy
than do veterans who fought on the ground, he said. Although pilots
committed atrocities, he said, aerial warfare drew less personal
hatred because it was more machine-versus-machine.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``The real issue with the Germans is over the
Holocaust. And that wasn't the Luftwaffe.''
</P>
<P>
   American members of the local pilots' group said they had no
reservations about admitting the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Bogart, one of the group's founders, said he distinguishes
between ``the Germans who hated everybody and the professional
types; they didn't participate in the atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping it going
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Military Pilots Association started a decade ago with
World War II pilots at Quail Ridge, said Ben Claus, one of the
leaders. As veterans succumbed to age, it expanded to three other
nearby country clubs _ Delray Dunes Golf and Country Club, Pine
Tree Golf Club, and Country Club of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The group meets for golf outings and get-togethers and had its
10th annual banquet March 5 at Quail Ridge Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   The group recently brought in about a half-dozen pilots from the
Korean and Vietnam wars, said Claus, himself a Korean War veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to keep it going, and we're the next in line,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing enemies as humans
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the pilots group said they don't believe it has any
Jewish members.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph L. Shear of suburban Boca Raton, commander for 16 Jewish
War Veterans posts with 2,400 members in Broward and Palm Beach
counties, has for years fought to bring former SS members to
justice.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he has no problem with the pilots' group inviting
the Germans. ``If it's just a couple of them left, how can you say
there's anything wrong?'' Shear said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Boone, who was shot down in the raid over the critical
German refineries at Ploesti, Romania: ``Probably some time ago we
would have had a difficult time with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we just look on them as human beings and people who didn't
want to kill and be killed any more than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone, meanwhile, is heading to Bucharest, Romania this summer _
to meet the man who shot him down over Ploesti.

 &HT;    Managing freedom in assisted living centers

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Josephine Megna is all dolled up with no
place to go. She was awake before dawn, as always, slipping into
her short, brown wig and white-framed sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine insists on looking just-so before making her 5 a.m.
appearance each day in the retirement home lobby, though there's no
one to see her except a sleepy attendant.
</P>
<P>
   Today brought swift fortune: a blue gift-wrap ribbon someone
tossed into a waste basket. Josephine plucked it out and stuck it
bow-tie high on her black-knit sweater, right above the floral
cluster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a woman looks better if she has something bright to
set off her blouse,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   At 96, on a day like most others when she won't leave the
grounds, looking her best is as important as it was during the
years she was married and working.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep going,'' she says. ``Never give up. Never
say, `I'm done for.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's a philosophy she shares freely, sometimes insistently, with
her mates at the Palm Beach Assisted Living Facility in downtown
West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get up and dance,'' she exhorts. ``Move. Move. If I can do it,
you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some listen; most don't. Josephine says she isn't discouraged
and won't quit trying. She knows she isn't trying alone.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly activity board is full of things to do: Board games,
card games, exercise, bingo, prayer services. And yes, dancing. But
it isn't easy to get people excited about another day in a place
none of them expected to end up in.
</P>
<P>
   The path to 534 Datura Street is as wide as America and as long
as a lifetime. This is an unplanned destination for working people
who never had the luck of a corporate pension or the luxury of an
individual retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   There are younger people here with handicaps, and some former
down-and-outers who qualify for state aid to the elderly homeless.
But most of the 165 residents are ``private pay'' retirees who
don't need the constant care of a nursing home but do need a
watchful eye.
</P>
<P>
   It's a broad and forgiving designation. The federal government
considers them poor, but they have some income: Social Security,
veterans benefits. With luck, they get a little help from family,
and a little more from Joseph Glucksman.

   Glucksman is a former assistant county administrator who heads
the nonprofit company that runs the place. After years in
government and nonprofit work, he knows where to look for
additional benefits, and he's a wizard at getting grants and
private donations.
</P>
<P>
   So residents pay an average of about $700 a month for room and
care that costs about $1,100. Many get single rooms with private
baths. Everyone gets a room key laced to a coiled plastic bracelet.
They also get three meals a day plus snacks, and someone to clean
up, do the laundry and make the bed.
</P>
<P>
   They even get a taste of Old Florida's boom times. A 1996
renovation honors the building's origins as the Alma Hotel, built
to catch the 1920s overflow from The Breakers. There are
pink-and-teal accents on the walls, fireplaces on each floor. The
dining room is almost elegant, with white stucco, red tile and
heavy wood chairs covered in brocade.
</P>
<P>
   A new boom is happening all around. The foundations of CityPlace
are being laid just blocks away, and the cafes of Clematis are even
closer. Everyone gets a chance to see the sights.
</P>
<P>
   There are exercise walks every few days plus occasional trips to
festivals along Flagler Drive or to The Kravis Center. Most
residents are free to leave any time if they sign out at the front
desk. Emma Peinhardt McMurray heads out first thing every morning.
</P>
<P>
   She's gone just long enough to walk down the block and buy the
newspaper. She reads the feature stories first and then checks for
news of Cullman, Ala., where she was born 78 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Emma is so happy with the home where she's lived these past two
years that she wrote a letter to the editor suggesting a story
about the ``beautiful, graceful'' people who run it. She is
irritated by the suggestion that she might be an equally
interesting subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised on a farm, attended the University of Alabama,
went to the Rose Bowl twice,'' she says. ``That's all there is.''
</P>
<P>
   She might say more, but she's pressed for time. They're
expecting her in the tailor room to help sort and hang donated
clothes. Then she's due in the dining room to clear tables before
the second lunch seating. Like Josephine, Emma tries to keep
moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked all my life,'' she says. ``I'm not going to stop
now.''
</P>
<P>
   She worked hard enough as a kid to earn a scholarship. That's
when she moved in with Aunt Edith in Birmingham. Emma studied
physical education for two years, which was enough in those days to
start teaching. Good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father said that was enough and I had to come home,'' she
says. ``I had to do what he said. We were strict Lutheran.''
</P>
<P>
   Emma taught in a private school, then a public school. She was
married once, a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just print what I put in my letter about how nice they
keep this place,'' she says, leading her guest from the sitting
room to the kitchen to the outdoor patio. ``It's immaculate, isn't
it?''
</P>
<P>
   There's scrubbing going on as she speaks; even the fish tank's
water is crystalline. Emma detours briefly to help a blind woman
round a corner. Then she spots a woman walking in circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your room is on the fourth floor,'' Emma reminds her, pointing
toward the elevator.
</P>
<P>
   Emma tries to help as many people as she can. Not everyone does.
Being old or sick doesn't make someone nice or honest. Emma points
out a smiling woman. ``She steals clothes,'' Emma says.
</P>
<P>
   It's good to have someone watching out for you. ``Like Ed, my
neighbor across the hall,'' she says. ``He's a good man.''
</P>
<P>
   When Emma spots Ed Smith in the snack room, she gives him a hug
and a kiss on the cheek. If they'd met back home as kids, she
wouldn't have spoken to him. ``I was taught to hate blacks,'' she
says. ``I've come a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed's childhood in Eastman, Georgia, had this in common with
Emma's: Long days in the hot fields on the family farm. ``Both were
poor states,'' he says. ``Most people just had a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Depression hit, they had a little bit less.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got tired of working and working for nothing,'' he says. ``A
bunch of my buddy boys and me loaded up a truck and left town on a
Sunday night. That was 1934 or '35.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed landed in Belle Glade, cutting sugar cane. Then he moved to
Dania for the tomato harvest. The pay wasn't better, but at least
you could eat what you picked.
</P>
<P>
   He picked whatever he could until he had enough money to buy a
car. For the next 40 years, Ed was an independent taxi driver.
``Nobody knows a place like a taxi driver,'' he says. ``I knew
everybody in West Palm Beach, and everybody knew me.''
</P>
<P>
   He never retired. He just stopped driving when the arthritis in
his legs got too bad. That was 1988. He wound up in a nursing home
in Lake Worth, but he didn't like that. Too many people, most of
them nasty.
</P>
<P>
   He likes the people here much better, and it's close to his old
haunts. Ed's 83 now and he walks well enough to get out most every
day and visit friends in the neighborhood. His idea of keeping busy
does not include volunteering the way Emma does.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I worked, I got paid,'' he says. ``I'm not going to start
working for nothing now.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gratten envies anyone who can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to volunteer, but I had to take a leave of absence,''
he says. ``I have pains. The doctors can't figure out what's
causing them. They go up my neck. I'm not living anymore. I'm just
existing.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter's family owned a nightclub in Fall River, Mass. His wife
died 30 years ago. He lived with his younger daughter for a while,
but she has three children to care for. He's been here about six
months, liked it until the pain hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to help the ladies,'' says Peter, 84. ``I'd see them in
the hallways, lost. Sometimes they'd open the fire exit door and
the alarm would go off. You hear things all night.''
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't sleep, but he found the perfect night-shift job:
Tending the front desk. He could count on a visitor every day at 5
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Josephine would come down, ready to dance,'' he says. ``A
couple of times she got me up to dance with her. I can't do that
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Josephine, who is sitting nearby, cuts him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never let yourself down, damnit,'' she says. ``I'm older than
all of you.'' With that, she's out of her seat, her arms waving
hula style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to dance at the Hawaiian room on 59th Street in a
little grass skirt my brother bought for me,'' she says. ``I danced
at the Hotel Taft and won $5,000 with my partner. We won $10,000 at
Madison Square Garden.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, copies of old news clips and pictures of the dance
sensation from Mamaroneck, N.Y., line the wall near the big-screen
TV in the sitting room. Josephine danced her way through the
Depression and World War II. She danced through jobs as a meat
cutter, nurse's aide and waitress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to come out carrying the trays like this,'' she says
with a dip and sway. ``They gave me a big raise.''
</P>
<P>
   She was younger then, but not much. Josephine retired at 91. She
was living on her own in the Poconos when she fainted, fell and
cracked her head. ``That was more blood than I donated all during
the war,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She came to Florida and stayed with her brother for several
years, but he worried she could fall again. She's been here since
August. (She insists it's only been a few weeks, even as she shows
pictures of herself at the Halloween party.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the difference?'' she asks. ``Whatever day it is, you
go ahead with things.''
</P>
<P>
   What she'd like to do is move on. Like many others, this was not
Josephine's first stop after leaving home. Almost everyone talks
about ``the other place.'' The other place was bigger or smaller.
It was noisier or quieter. It wasn't nearly as nice; it was much
nicer.
</P>
<P>
   Josephine liked the other place better. ``I feel like I'm in
jail here,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   She could go for a walk if she signed out at the desk, but she's
not so eager. She loved the outdoors back home. ``I love to do yard
work. I loved to play with my dogs. I used to have rabbits and
bears come right up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like that here. Besides, signing out is too much
like asking permission and she's too independent for that. She
doesn't even like the idea of people coming into her room to clean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I make my own bed,'' she says. ``I don't wait for anyone to do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, maybe, to get up and dance.

NEIGHBORS COOL TO ARIZONA PARK PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By SETH LANDAU  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AJO, Ariz. _ Most small-town residents in southwestern Arizona
can appreciate the Sonoran Desert's natural beauty. To a point,
they even want to preserve it.
</P>
<P>
   But the desire to preserve stops short of losing the way of life
they enjoy now, some Ajo and Gila Bend residents say. And that,
they fear, would be the result of a proposed Sonoran Desert
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   A group of 40 people, most of them from Tucson and Phoenix,
announced last week that it wants to create the park out of more
than 3 million acres of desert in southwestern Arizona. It's ``the
last big piece you can save'' in the lower 48 states, said Charles
Bowden, who backs the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Ajo resident and activist Bud Klinefelter sees it
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (park advocates) get through with this, it's going to
destroy the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 2,500 in the summer and 4,500 in the
winter, Ajo is a sleepy town surrounded by dormant copper mines,
Indian reservations and other federal land.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Ivey, who was born and raised in Ajo, agreed that the park
would mean new restrictions for people who live in the tiny town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing there is to do there is run around in the
desert: four-wheeling and motorcycling,'' he said by e-mail.
``Right now, Ajo is blocked on all sides, leaving only a small area
for recreation.''
</P>
<P>
   The national park would unify Organ Pipe Cactus National
Monument, Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and the Barry M.
Goldwater Air Force Range. That marriage, Klinefelter said, would
put even tighter restrictions on Ajo's neighboring land.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't even go into Cabeza Prieta (now) without a permit,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Gila Bend, population 1,700, resident Ron Henry said a
national park would limit the use of the land just south of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have farmers that use (military range land) for grazing,''
he said. Civilians are permitted to use military land if they first
receive permission from a base commander.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have that much to do in this area and this (national
park) would curtail it that much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Broyles, who has helped create the plan for the park, said
there already are many camping, hunting and driving restrictions
placed upon the three areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out to restrict anybody's access,'' said Broyles, a
Tucson writer. Rather, his group wants to ``best sustain our uses
of the land,'' although he acknowledged that the National Park
Service does have a few more rules.
</P>
<P>
   Broyles and his colleagues are calling for the park to be formed
within five years. Daniel Arreola, an Arizona State University
geography professor, said there would be no further restrictions
for people who want to go into Cabeza Prieta and Organ Pipe because
those sites already are protected by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only part that isn't already a park is the gunnery
range,'' said Arreola, who specializes in Mexican-American
borderlands.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Ajo residents oppose the park.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Crawford, program coordinator for the International Sonoran
Desert Alliance, said he is ``much in favor'' of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the only way to preserve one of the few precious
places we have left on the planet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Organ Pipe, Cabeza Prieta and the Goldwater range are managed by
the National Park Service, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the
Defense Department, respectively. Representatives from the three
agencies have said they cannot comment about the initiative now.
</P>
<P>
   All three zones are owned by the Bureau of Land Management.
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has no position on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve national park status, the Sonoran Desert proposal
would need congressional approval and the president's signature. &QL;

ENVIRONMENTALISTS: PROPOSED MONUMENT SHOULD BE LARGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE YOZWIAK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ A national monument proposed northwest of the
Grand Canyon should be twice as large as originally envisioned by
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, the head of a prominent Flagstaff
environmental group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Canyon Trust wants to make the proposed Shivwits
Plateau National Monument on the Arizona Strip nearly 1 million
acres, almost the size of adjacent Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Barnard, president of the trust, said the larger area is
needed to protect wildlife migration corridors, prevent mining of
uranium and other minerals, stop abuse from off-road vehicles and
halt encroaching development from the booming populations of St.
George, Utah, and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates contend that the monument would protect the last
remaining portions of the Grand Canyon that are not included within
the 1.1 million-acre Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, including People for the USA, call the proposal
``Clinton Land Grab II.''
</P>
<P>
   The group, which advocates recreation, mining, ranching, logging
and oil drilling on public lands, still is steamed by President
Clinton's 1996 designation of the 1.7 million-acre Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument in southern Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and advocates of public-lands extraction
sparred Monday night at a town hall attended by nearly 500 people
at the auditorium of Northern Arizona University's Cline Library.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Mackelprang, a former mayor and lifelong resident of
Fredonia, said Babbitt was lying about grazing and hunting
continuing if a monument were established.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty soon, they lock you out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvia Allen of People for the USA told students in the crowd,
``Good luck to all of you in finding jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Carmen Bradley, chairwoman of the Kaibab band of Paiute Indians,
said she supports the monument to ``preserve and protect the
pristine nature of the (Arizona) Strip.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Euler, a Prescott anthropologist, also backed the
monument's establishment to prevent the destruction of
``irreplaceable cultural resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the venue for the town hall spurred complaints from People
for the USA. The group's executive director, Jeff Harris, told
members in an e-mail alert last week that NAU ``is not neutral
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris described the campus as ``a place full of college
`activists' with nothing better to do.'' He urged his members in
Utah and Arizona to ``pack the joint,'' and bring signs reading
``Babbitt locks up our future'' and ``Yesterday Utah, today
Arizona, tomorrow the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt, in making the proposal in November, said he wanted to
protect the grazing rights of existing ranchers, many of them the
descendants of pioneer Mormon families who moved to the Arizona
Strip, north of the canyon, nearly a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Escalante designation, made in the heat of the '96
presidential campaign, Babbitt has moved to enlist the approval of
Congress, especially the Arizona delegation, in creating the
Shivwits monument.
</P>
<P>
   However, Babbitt said that he is pledged to establishing the
monument before his term ends in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Shivwits Plateau _ named for a band of Paiute _ is managed
by the Lake Mead National Recreation Area and the Bureau of Land
Management. Much of the area was proposed in the 1970s as an
addition to Grand Canyon National Park. But the Senate balked at
the idea because cattle ranching and hunting are not allowed within
federal parks. They are allowed at national monuments.
</P>
<P>
   Barnard said motorcycles and other all-terrain vehicles have
turned the land south of St. George and north of the proposed
monument into ``a free-fire zone for ATVs.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt also said he is concerned that the area, only a few
hours' drive from Las Vegas, eventually could be overrun by miners
and developers.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt's proposal covers 550,000 acres. But the Grand Canyon
Trust proposal would nearly double that, connecting Grand Canyon
National Park to wilderness areas in the Virgin Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   That would create a giant loop of national parks, monuments,
recreational areas and wilderness lands across northern Arizona and
southern Utah. &QL;

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ I'm a uniquely gentle and sensitive soul. I was
joined in my family room Saturday night by a few other gentle and
sensitive souls who share my artistic affection for watching guys
in satin shorts beat each other bloody.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Gregg had picked Evander Holyfield to win. Holyfield,
however, had gotten his butt kicked. Lennox Lewis had landed more
jabs than Holyfield had landed punches. Then the decision was
announced _ a draw.
</P>
<P>
   One judge scored the fight for Lewis by 116-113. Another scored
it 115-115. The third gave the fight to Holyfield, 115-113. The
judges then left Madison Square Garden accompanied by their seeing
eye dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg is a betting man. This charade saved him major bucks. He
reacted to this wonderful and totally unexpected news by jumping up
and shouting, ``This is an outrage! It's a total outrage!''
</P>
<P>
   OK, his money was still his own; Gregg was horrified
nonetheless. So was anybody who cares about honest athletic
competition. But this fight was a Don King Promotion, so what's the
surprise?
</P>
<P>
   In the modern era, nobody can fix a big boxing match by paying
off the fighters. How do you bribe a guy to take a dive when he's
already getting 40 million bucks? But referees and judges? They're
right downstairs, in the bargain basement. Don King fights
routinely reek.
</P>
<P>
   An agreeable stiff named Bruce Seldon once was rendered
unconscious by the breeze from a missed Mike Tyson right hand. As
heavyweight champ, Larry Holmes once took a tuneup bout against
journeyman Renaldo Snipes. Sensing that this was his life's
defining moment, Snipes fought way over his head.
</P>
<P>
   In a middle round, Snipes caught Holmes with a terrific shot and
decked him. Holmes got up, clutched and grabbed and, miraculously,
survived the round. He was in such pitiful shape that any
responsible referee would have stopped the bout.
</P>
<P>
   Not in a Don King Production, though. King had a fortune riding
on Holmes' next fight with Gerry Cooney. It was crucial that Holmes
win this one. So, a few rounds later, when a battered Holmes in got
a rather ordinary shot in against Snipes, that same referee stopped
the bout instantly, proclaiming Holmes the winner.
</P>
<P>
   What happened in the Holyfield-Lewis fight seems obvious. King
has a promotional contract with Holyfield but not with Lewis. The
bout had sold out the Garden, and in only days. It had attracted a
staggering pay-for-view audience.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a contest so one-sided that nobody would pay to see a
repeat, it was clear from the start that a rematch would be staged.
If Lewis had gotten the decision in the first fight, the new
champion would have used another promoter for the second. That
provided Don King with a strong rooting interest in Saturday
night's outcome.
</P>
<P>
   This sport is dirty because there's no national regulation. King
is a former Cleveland numbers guy who did a decade in the can for
kicking a business rival to death. The New York State Athletic
Commission should bar him. It won't because New Jersey and Nevada
won't. Since Don King can always find some state in which to
operate, every state lets him do business rather than see a big
fight go elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The fees from this fight for the promoter and the sleazy
sanctioning bodies should be impounded while New York Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer launches a serious criminal probe into
consumer fraud. The New York State Athletic Commission also should
revise New York boxing rules.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, New York _ and every other state, too, now that I
think of it _ should require the posting of judges' scores after
each round. That way, if the fix seems in, fans would have the
option early on of hanging the judges and the promoter from the
ring mike.
</P>
<P>
   In a gentle and sensitive fashion, of course.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   (PAGE WILL INCLUDE SEVERAL COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS OF HAITI)
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1994, President Bill Clinton confounded his
critics by successfully using 20,000 U.S.-led forces to overthrow a
brutal military regime here and give democracy a second chance.
Almost no blood was shed. A triumph in foreign policy was declared.
But today, after nearly five years of pouring more than $2.2
billion of American taxpayers' money into this tiny island nation,
there is little to feel triumphant about.
</P>
<P>
   WITH: HAITI-FLOPS: The history of U.S. aid in Haiti is peppered
with some pretty big flops.

</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a jar of cumin nestled between the salt and
pepper, you are definitely out of step with the times. Sales of
cumin skyrocketed 62 percent between 1995 and 1997, according to
McCormick &AMP; Co., the country's major spice purveyor. That makes it
the fastest-growing spice in this country, outpacing other spices,
which grew a more modest 17 percent. (Includes 3-column color photo

valued member of the group. Today, these people are on the

</P>
<P>
   WITH: FOOD NOTES: Food fanatics who read the New York Times or

</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1994, President Bill Clinton confounded his
critics by successfully using 20,000 U.S.-led forces to overthrow a
brutal military regime here and give democracy a second chance.
Almost no blood was shed. A triumph in foreign policy was declared.
But today, after nearly five years of pouring more than $2.2
billion of American taxpayers' money into this tiny island nation,
there is little to feel triumphant about.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SIEM REAP, Cambodia _ Here is the historical timeline of the
Angkor kingdom:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  800 AD. -1432 AD. -- The Angkor Kingdom emerges as the
dominant empire in Southeast Asia, ruled by a succession of
temple-building Khmer kings from their capital near present-day
Siem Reap. Each king tried to outdo his predecessor by building
bigger and more magnificent stone temples to the gods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1112-1152 AD. -- King Suryavarman II builds the Hindu temple
of Angkor Wat. Its central tower symbolizes the mythical Mount
Meru, supposedly located at the center of the universe. Its outer
walls stand for the mountains at the edge of the earth. Beyond the
walls is a surrounding moat representing the oceans beyond the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1177 AD. -- The Angkor capital is sacked by the Chams,
invading tribesmen from southern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1181-1201 AD. -- The new Khmer king Jayavarman VII introduces
Buddhism and mobilizes the million inhabitants of his capital on a
crash program to build more than a dozen major new temples and
scores of schools and hospitals. Like his predecessors, he relies
on slave laborers to finish the building spree in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1220-1431 AD .-- Khmer Empire in decline. Angkor is sacked in
1351 and 1431 by Thai invaders.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1431 AD. -- Khmer kings abandon Angkor and move their capital
southward to Phnom Penh. The temples, increasingly engulfed by
jungle, remain inhabited by Buddhist monks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1860 -- French explorer-naturalist Henri Mouhot stumbles onto
Angkor Wat, then all-but-forgotten. His detailed notes and
pen-and-ink drawings become a sensation in the West when they are
published in 1868, seven years after his death.

   SIEM REAP, Cambodia _ Talk about a trip to write home about . .
.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1871 Frank Vincent Jr. dropped out of Yale University,
and despite frail health, the 17-year-old embarked on ``a
systematic tour of the most interesting parts of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   After reaching Bangkok in the Kingdom of Siam, the Brooklyn,
N.Y.-born Vincent decided to pursue a fantastic tale about a lost
city in the jungles. This ``city of monasteries'' had been
uncovered a decade earlier by a French explorer-naturalist named
Henri Mouhot. Malheureusement, the Frenchman had died of a jungle
fever before he could make it back to Paris to publish his
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted by mosquitoes, tigers and cobras, Vincent set off
eastward from Bangkok into the Kingdom of Cambodia. He traveled in
river boats, on foot, on horseback and in bullock-carts. Seventeen
days later, he reached the little Cambodian fishing town of Siem
Reap.
</P>
<P>
   Here he persuaded a local bureaucrat to supply him and his
companions with three elephants. ``Rather impatient'' as they
neared their imagined goal, they left behind their baggage and took
off through the luxuriant forest.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later Vincent emerged at a clearing next to an ancient
moat 600 meters wide filled with lotus plants. Behind the moat and
nearly overrun by giant fig trees rose the outlines of the colossal
sandstone temple.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent was one of the first American travelers to see the great
temple of Angkor Wat, a monument to the four-armed Hindu god Vishnu
the Preserver. Covering nearly one square mile and cresting in a
central tower taller than the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, the
temple of Angkor Wat is the largest and one of the most haunting
religious edifices in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart almost bounded into my mouth,'' wrote Vincent. ``The
general appearance of the wonder of the temple is beautiful and
romantic as well as impressive and grand ... It must be seen to be
understood and appreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   For the next 98 years, an ever-growing stream of sophisticated
travelers from around the world journeyed to Angkor Wat and the
ruins of the nearby royal city of Angkor Thom.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tutelage of French colonial conservators, trees and
giant roots were peeled away and the stone blocks of Angkor Wat's
five great pine-cone-shaped towers were reassembled, starting in
1908.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jacqueline Kennedy visited Angkor Wat in 1967 with
her then escort Lord Harlech, the 800-year-old relics of the Angkor
Kingdom had achieved an almost universal cachet. Angkor ranked
among the classic archaeological sites that every educated person
aspired to visit once in a lifetime, along with Egypt's Great
Pyramid of Giza, the Parthenon in Athens and the Machu Pichu ruins
in Peru.
</P>
<P>
   But then in 1969, a curtain dropped on Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   With the spread of communist insurgency, Cambodia's central
government lost control over the jungle, then the country, to Khmer
Rouge guerrillas. One of the ``wonders of the world'' would become
inaccessible to Westerners for nearly a quarter-century.
</P>
<P>
   By 1972, the Khmer Rouge had set up an ammunition depot inside
the walls of Angkor Wat. Pro-government troops trying to evict them
nicked the main stone doorway with machine gun bullets.
</P>
<P>
   When the Vietnam War brought secret U.S. bombing of Cambodia,
American bombers flew close enough to Angkor to drop a few bombs
within a mile of the temple complex. Local guides and some
guidebooks insist that in the early 1970s, one American bomb
exploded inside the walls of Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   By happenstance, the bomb caused no damage. Even more
miraculously, Angkor Wat and the main surrounding temples survived
Cambodia's 20 years of darkness with almost no signs of harm. The
worst desecration was caused by off-duty soldiers and other temple
robbers who chiseled off a small number of carvings and smuggled
their loot to black market antique shops in Thailand. Despite a few
painful losses, almost everything at Angkor has survived intact.
</P>
<P>
   Late in 1991, after the United Nations extracted a peace
agreement that ended Cambodia's civil war, Western tourists started
trickling back.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the next few years, visiting Angkor wasn't exactly
safe. In and around the dozen most important temples, a French-led
international task force cleared away 21,000 land mines. That job
was finished by 1995, but even today mine experts continue finding
land mines in more remote temple sites still off-limits to
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, roving guerrilla bands also posed a risk for
tourists, especially for those gung ho enough to stray from the
main cluster of Angkor temples. As recently as January 1995,
American Professor Susan Hadden from Austin, Texas, was killed in a
Khmer Rouge guerrilla ambush. Local guides say she disregarded
their warnings and tried to visit the exquisitely carved temple of
Banteay Srei, 20 miles down a lonely road from Angkor Wat.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it has become quite tame in the last year to visit
Angkor. At least that was our experience this February when we
toured Angkor Wat and eight other nearby temples, including Banteay
Srei.
</P>
<P>
   As Frank Vincent felt 128 years before us, we found that Angkor
is one of those rare sights that exceeds every expectation. The
sunrises are more majestic, the ruins are better preserved, the
stone carvings are more delicate, the history more compelling.
</P>
<P>
   We spent three and a half days walking the ruins and wished we
could have stayed longer. The stone carvings inside the temples are
so intricate and vast that connoisseurs can spend months here. Just
on the walls of the main Angkor Wat temple, the bas-reliefs stretch
on for a mile and contain thousands of carved figures depicting
such captivating scenes as ``the battle of the gods and the
demons,'' and the ``churning of the ocean of milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Angkor is humbling and yet addictive for a photographer, with
its mix of ever-changing light, elegant shapes, and exotic live
people who are sweeping or selling or simply visiting.
Saffron-robed Buddhist monks who come as tourists lounge on a step
and look quite at home.
</P>
<P>
   Nature's inexorable power is another integral element,
especially at the temple Ta Prohm that has been left largely to the
jungle's invasion. Trees hundreds of years old have twined massive
roots through roofs and around walls and columns, insinuating
themselves so thoroughly that today they help hold intact the
feeble works of men. Here the sense of antiquity is even more
tangible than at temples where jungle growth has been beaten back.
</P>
<P>
   Rising before the sun may seem beyond the vacation mode, but we
found the morning light magical at the temple Preah Khan.
</P>
<P>
   At 5:30 a.m. the stars were still bright when we walked down the
causeway entrance guarded by stone gods and demons and lit on each
side by a row of lanterns. Inside, the silent complex of galleries
and linked corridors began to loom in silhouette as the sky
lightened above the broken roofs. The experience was spectacular
enough that we were compelled to try it again the next day at the
main Angkor Wat temple, before we caught our airplane out. The
sight was totally different, yet equally absorbing.
</P>
<P>
   An early start makes sense for other reasons. Middays are steamy
hot. Four or five hours of touring followed by lunch and a long
recline by the hotel swimming pool comprise a normal schedule.
Emerging for more sight-seeing in the late afternoon gives the
advantage of more fabulous light effects as the sun goes down.
</P>
<P>
   Reading about Angkor Wat before you leave home will help you
narrow down the choices to fit your time. Even with the best
guidebooks, the traveler is well-advised to hire a local, trained
guide. Choup Lorn, our guide, added immeasurably to our trip,
giving the history, pointing out the best-preserved garudas
(statues of mythical creatures with birdlike wings and human
bodies), tipping us to good camera angles and sharing the local
gossip.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers averse to any kind of risks while on holiday, it
may still be too soon to visit Angkor. Perhaps this is why only
about 100 foreign tourists visit Angkor on an average day,
including only about a half-dozen Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, there are still terrifying incidents.
</P>
<P>
   On the road from the airport toward Angkor Wat, unknown
assassins last September set off a booby trap of rocket-propelled
grenades. They were trying to kill the visiting Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen, but he escaped when three of the four
remote-controlled rockets failed to ignite in the wet weather. Then
early this year, a gang of teenage Cambodian robbers knocked a
Belgian woman tourist on the head several hundred yards from Angkor
Wat, sending her to the hospital and running away with her wallet.
</P>
<P>
   That said, however, European tourists continue to visit South
Florida, even though some have met equally terrifying incidents in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For inveterate globe-trotters, fears of another security
incident must be balanced against a second risk: although Cambodia
is relatively stable now, the curtain of civil war could once again
descend on Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   Even should politics remain under control, in another few years
it probably will get far more crowded here. Now that all known
Khmer Rouge units have come out of hiding and accepted
``integration'' into the Cambodian Army, both Cambodian promoters
and foreign investors are planning for a tourist boom in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Already 10 big new hotels are under construction on the
outskirts of Siem Reap, adding to the one luxury-class hotel, three
moderately-priced hotels and scores of budget guesthouses already
operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have political stability in our country, we'll have a
big increase in tourism,'' said Kousoum Saroeuth, director of the
provincial tourism office. ``The numbers will be two or three times
higher than today, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you are a nervy traveler and you don't like crowds, you'd
better go to Angkor soon.

<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE:
</P>
<P>
   -- By air: For $55, you can fly to Siem Reap on Royal Air
Cambodge from the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. If you want to
skip Phnom Penh, there are scheduled daily flights to and from
Bangkok on Bangkok Air and Royal Air Cambodge. Given the hazards of
armed robbery on some Cambodian roads, it is probably safest to
travel to Angkor Wat by air.
</P>
<P>
   -- By Boat: From Phnom Penh, you can travel up the Mekong River
and across Tonle Sap Lake on a ferry boat for a few dollars. But
the boats take about six hours and are prone to breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY:
</P>
<P>
   -- In great luxury: For $360 a night for a double, you can stay
at the renovated Grand Hotel d'Angkor, one of the most comfortable
hotels in Asia. One reason it's so pricey is that it is the only
first-class hotel in Siem Reap.
</P>
<P>
   -- Next best: If you like staying in the middle of town (within
walking distance of the outdoor marketplace and the honky-tonk
nightclubs) try the Ta Prohm Hotel ($70-a-night for a twin-bedded
room, or $100 for a suite). Two other pretty good second-class
hotels are further from the center of town: the Hotel Nokor Kok
Thlok and the Angkor Hotel. All three are clean and
air-conditioned, but the rooms are reminiscent of off-brand North
Carolina motel rooms along U.S. Interstate Highway 95.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cheap: For $2 a night, you can sleep under a mosquito net in
your own tiny room at the Naga Guesthouse, which many count as one
of the bargains of the Southeast Asian backtracking circuit. For $3
a night, you can even have a room with a bath of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   BEST BOOKS:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia, a Lonely Planet Survival Kit'' (updated 1996)
</P>
<P>
   ``Angkor: An Introduction to the Temples,'' by Dawn Rooney
(1997)
</P>
<P>
   ``A History of Cambodia,'' by David P. Chandler (1993)
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING MONEY:
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't bother. Instead, bring along American dollars,
especially $1 and $5 bills. Greenbacks are the most widely accepted
coin of the realm in today's chaotic Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO SEE THE MONUMENTS:
</P>
<P>
   -- Cost of admission. An individual ticket costs $20 for one
day; or $40 for up to three days; or $60 for up to one week.
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting around. You'll need wheels because the temples are
all spread out, and the nearest one is five miles from Siem Reap.
If you can afford the Grand Hotel, you will probably also want to
rent a car or minibus and driver, for up to $40 a day. If you're
staying at Naga Guesthouse, you'll probably hire a motorcycle-taxi
with driver, for about $8 a day.
</P>
<P>
   -- Guides. You'll get far more out of the trip if you pay for a
guide. We think our guide cost us about $30 a day. But we aren't
sure because our guide was included in the price of our tour
package.

   SIEM REAP, Cambodia _ Here is the historical timeline of the
Angkor kingdom:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  800 AD. -1432 AD. -- The Angkor Kingdom emerges as the
dominant empire in Southeast Asia, ruled by a succession of
temple-building Khmer kings from their capital near present-day
Siem Reap. Each king tried to outdo his predecessor by building
bigger and more magnificent stone temples to the gods.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1112-1152 AD. -- King Suryavarman II builds the Hindu temple
of Angkor Wat. Its central tower symbolizes the mythical Mount
Meru, supposedly located at the center of the universe. Its outer
walls stand for the mountains at the edge of the earth. Beyond the
walls is a surrounding moat representing the oceans beyond the
earth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1177 AD. -- The Angkor capital is sacked by the Chams,
invading tribesmen from southern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1181-1201 AD. -- The new Khmer king Jayavarman VII introduces
Buddhism and mobilizes the million inhabitants of his capital on a
crash program to build more than a dozen major new temples and
scores of schools and hospitals. Like his predecessors, he relies
on slave laborers to finish the building spree in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1220-1431 AD .-- Khmer Empire in decline. Angkor is sacked in
1351 and 1431 by Thai invaders.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1431 AD. -- Khmer kings abandon Angkor and move their capital
southward to Phnom Penh. The temples, increasingly engulfed by
jungle, remain inhabited by Buddhist monks.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  1860 -- French explorer-naturalist Henri Mouhot stumbles onto
Angkor Wat, then all-but-forgotten. His detailed notes and
pen-and-ink drawings become a sensation in the West when they are
published in 1868, seven years after his death.

   On the road from the airport toward Angkor Wat, unknown
assassins last September set off a booby trap of rocket-propelled
grenades. They were trying to kill the visiting Cambodian Prime
Minister Hun Sen, but he escaped when three of the four
remote-controlled rockets failed to ignite in the wet weather. Then
early this year, a gang of teenage Cambodian robbers knocked a
Belgian woman tourist on the head several hundred yards from Angkor
Wat, sending her to the hospital and running away with her wallet.
</P>
<P>
   That said, however, European tourists continue to visit South
Florida, even though some have met equally terrifying incidents in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   For inveterate globe-trotters, fears of another security
incident must be balanced against a second risk: although Cambodia
is relatively stable now, the curtain of civil war could once again
descend on Angkor.
</P>
<P>
   Even should politics remain under control, in another few years
it probably will get far more crowded here. Now that all known
Khmer Rouge units have come out of hiding and accepted
``integration'' into the Cambodian Army, both Cambodian promoters
and foreign investors are planning for a tourist boom in the next
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Already 10 big new hotels are under construction on the
outskirts of Siem Reap, adding to the one luxury-class hotel, three
moderately-priced hotels and scores of budget guesthouses already
operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have political stability in our country, we'll have a
big increase in tourism,'' said Kousoum Saroeuth, director of the
provincial tourism office. ``The numbers will be two or three times
higher than today, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   So if you are a nervy traveler and you don't like crowds, you'd
better go to Angkor soon.

<P>
   HOW TO GET THERE:
</P>
<P>
   -- By air: For $55, you can fly to Siem Reap on Royal Air
Cambodge from the Cambodian capital of Phnom Penh. If you want to
skip Phnom Penh, there are scheduled daily flights to and from
Bangkok on Bangkok Air and Royal Air Cambodge. Given the hazards of
armed robbery on some Cambodian roads, it is probably safest to
travel to Angkor Wat by air.
</P>
<P>
   -- By Boat: From Phnom Penh, you can travel up the Mekong River
and across Tonle Sap Lake on a ferry boat for a few dollars. But
the boats take about six hours and are prone to breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO STAY:
</P>
<P>
   -- In great luxury: For $360 a night for a double, you can stay
at the renovated Grand Hotel d'Angkor, one of the most comfortable
hotels in Asia. One reason it's so pricey is that it is the only
first-class hotel in Siem Reap.
</P>
<P>
   -- Next best: If you like staying in the middle of town (within
walking distance of the outdoor marketplace and the honky-tonk
nightclubs) try the Ta Prohm Hotel ($70-a-night for a twin-bedded
room, or $100 for a suite). Two other pretty good second-class
hotels are further from the center of town: the Hotel Nokor Kok
Thlok and the Angkor Hotel. All three are clean and
air-conditioned, but the rooms are reminiscent of off-brand North
Carolina motel rooms along U.S. Interstate Highway 95.
</P>
<P>
   -- Cheap: For $2 a night, you can sleep under a mosquito net in
your own tiny room at the Naga Guesthouse, which many count as one
of the bargains of the Southeast Asian backtracking circuit. For $3
a night, you can even have a room with a bath of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   BEST BOOKS:
</P>
<P>
   ``Cambodia, a Lonely Planet Survival Kit'' (updated 1996)
</P>
<P>
   ``Angkor: An Introduction to the Temples,'' by Dawn Rooney
(1997)
</P>
<P>
   ``A History of Cambodia,'' by David P. Chandler (1993)
</P>
<P>
   CHANGING MONEY:
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't bother. Instead, bring along American dollars,
especially $1 and $5 bills. Greenbacks are the most widely accepted
coin of the realm in today's chaotic Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   HOW TO SEE THE MONUMENTS:
</P>
<P>
   -- Cost of admission. An individual ticket costs $20 for one
day; or $40 for up to three days; or $60 for up to one week.
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting around. You'll need wheels because the temples are
all spread out, and the nearest one is five miles from Siem Reap.
If you can afford the Grand Hotel, you will probably also want to
rent a car or minibus and driver, for up to $40 a day. If you're
staying at Naga Guesthouse, you'll probably hire a motorcycle-taxi
with driver, for about $8 a day.
</P>
<P>
   -- Guides. You'll get far more out of the trip if you pay for a
guide. We think our guide cost us about $30 a day. But we aren't
sure because our guide was included in the price of our tour
package.

A MOUSY ADMISSION OF GUILT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Probably it's just a coincidence that I got the
worst flu I've had in at least a decade at the very same time I was
murdering mice.
</P>
<P>
   After all, what tangible correlation could there be between some
flu virus that invaded my body (even though I had a flu shot) and
the murder of a bunch of mice who've been living in my walls?
</P>
<P>
   Did I say ``murder''? I meant to say ``exterminate.'' Or ``get
rid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, that's what I meant to say. Get rid of.
</P>
<P>
   If I had gone to where the mice had been living before they took
over my house, if I'd taken, say, a carving knife to them, it would
be proper to say I murdered them.
</P>
<P>
   But I didn't. The mice trespassed onto MY property and I
responded in the only way a reasonable person could; I hired an
exterminator _ or ``pest control'' agent, as the company prefers to
say. It was self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   They were big mice, too. At least I thought they were. In fact,
the first time I saw one _ after listening to them scramble and
scratch for weeks in the wall that runs right next to my bed _ I
was convinced I had rats. When something huge and dark slithered
above my kitchen counter and behind the stove, I nearly had a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the pest control agent came to my house and
assuaged my rat fears. Shining his flashlight on various clusters
of what looked like anise seeds, he said, ``Definitely mice. Little
droppings. That's good. Much easier to get rid of.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieved, I watched as he set out little plastic trays of
azure-colored poison pellets. He said the rain and cold and months
of the power company digging up my street all probably combined to
drive the mice into my house.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just, you know, field mice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Field mice? Visions of fat, disease-carrying rats gave way to
images of little creatures wearing pinafores, overalls and straw
hats.
</P>
<P>
   Whose home might I invade if, like the mice, I were cold and wet
and the power company had jackhammered and dug me out of my abode?
What if I were a mouse mom with babies?
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what's in the pellets that attracts the mice?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peanuts, walnuts and sunflowers seeds,'' the pest guy said.
</P>
<P>
   God. Lethal trail mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they eat it, how do they, uh, die? I heard they crave
water and head outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly, he said. The poison basically shuts down their
respiratory system, suffocates them from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Lord. Little creatures in pinafores, overalls and straw
hats, bug-eyed and gasping desperately for air. Their
swaddling-wrapped babies gasping, too.
</P>
<P>
   When he was finished, the pest guy said it could take 11 days to
kill every mouse but he didn't figure he'd have to come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might find some dead ones, but probably not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What if they die in the walls?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry. They won't stink. They're too little.''
</P>
<P>
   All the rest of that day I felt guilty. Then I had to leave town
on a business trip. Before I shut the door to my house, I yelled,
``I'm sorry, mice! But it's you or me!''
</P>
<P>
   Four days later I came back expecting mouse corpses and stench
throughout my house. (How can something die and not stink?) There
was nothing but a lot of half-empty poison trays.
</P>
<P>
   Then the flu hit. For four nights, as I lay fevered and aching
in my bed, I heard the familiar scratching and scrambling in the
walls. I had nightmares and daydreams about the misery going on
behind them.
</P>
<P>
   On the fifth night, the noise stopped. It's been quiet ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   As I said, the timing is probably just a coincidence. I'm sure I
picked up the flu on the plane. Then again, you know what they say
about stressful emotions compromising the human immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Guilt is a stressful emotion. Especially guilt over playing
Terminator to a bunch of little field mice. If only I'd had rats.

 TEHRAN: ... students took.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jaliehpour expresses regret for the harm caused to the hostages,
but she has no apologies for her actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As human beings, we felt for the hostages and their
families,'' she said. ``But we also felt then and feel now that, as
youth who loved their country and loved their faith in Islam, that
the work of the revolution, even taking the embassy, was necessary
at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her older brother, Hamed, 40, describes being swept up ``in the
charisma of Imam Khomeini'' and cheering in the streets while his
sister and the other students stormed the embassy. Yet today he
views that part of the revolution differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, I think you'd have to say it hurt the
revolution,'' he said in an interview in his office at Nashat, a
newspaper that is a leading voice of the reform movement and where
he is publisher. His sister writes an occasional column.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt us with our relations in the international
community,'' Hamed Jaliehpour said. ``In many ways, we are still
paying the price for it.''
</P>
<P>
   For his views, his newspaper has been shut down three times by
the clerical establishment, and he has been arrested several times.
Often he finds himself at odds with many of the young people with
whom he stood in the street supporting the early revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they say I am no longer committed to Islamic principles,''
he said. ``But I think we are still fighting for the same thing we
were fighting for back then. We want a democratic, participatory
government that is grounded in Islam. The revolutionary discourse
now has to change to civil discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jaliehpours have much invested in the future, in part
because they have paid a heavy price for the past.
</P>
<P>
   In the infighting after the revolution, the opposition
Mujahideen, which espoused a Marxist Islamic view, as opposed to
Khomeini's strict religious code, gunned down their oldest brother,
Mohammad Reza, who was a strong and active supporter of Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Iran-Iraq war, which lasted eight years, claimed
as many as 500,000 Iranian lives, and left the country bankrupt.
Two of the casualties were Fatimeh's brothers, Ali Reza and
Hussein, who were killed on the front lines in the mid-1980s. They
are enshrined in a Tehran street mural praising them as martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   It was to the dead brothers' memory that their mother appealed
four months ago, when Hamed was arrested and placed in solitary
confinement for his political activity. Hajeh Jaliehpour, now 65,
sent a stinging letter to Khamenei, demanding the release of her
son. His arrest, she wrote, was ``an insult to the memory and the
sacrifice'' of her two lost sons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was released right away,'' said Hamed. ``She is a convincing
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   No less a one is Fatimeh.
</P>
<P>
   Her life as a traditional religious woman balancing a political
career with raising her own four children contravenes many American
notions of women's roles in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be tiring to balance so much. I'm sure many American
women know what I am saying,'' Jaliehpour said, trying to break
free from the interview to make dinner for her children. ``But we
do not have any time to rest here. We are still in the process of a
revolution, and we are still struggling to make this country a
better place. This is going to take all the strength we have.''
</P>
<P>
   That struggle in ``the second revolution'' has the support of a
younger generation that includes Jaliehpour's much yonger brother,
Hassan, 25.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan doesn't share the fervor of Fatimeh and Hamed. Hassan
was 5 in 1979; today, a medical student, he is bored by his older
siblings' remembrances of the revolution. His focus is on Iran's
need to modernize its health care and tap into advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strain she feels, Fatimeh Jaliehpour said it is her
desire to do more for youth, especially young women, that led her
to run for City Council in the elections held two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her oldest daughter, Zeynab, 17, has inherited her mother's
passion and progressive views on women's rights within the
traditional framework of a faith in Islam. Mother and daughter
bristle at the notion that the Islamic Republic somehow limits
women's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strictures on dress and Islamic laws that
discriminate against women, they insist that Iranian women have
economic and political opportunities that are perhaps different,
but no lesser, than in Western countries. They point out that the
vice president of Iran is a woman. But they know they still have to
work to gain equality.
</P>
<P>
   Zeynab is studying biology and dreams of working in genetics.
She seems embarrassed to admit she has never used the Internet,
which is controlled by the government, and she recognizes that in
its educational system Iran lags behind much of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a young country in so many ways,'' Zeynab said. ``It is
my mother and uncles who built this new country.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now we will have a responsibility to continue their
work,'' she says. ``They played a role, and now I hope that I will
be able to play a role.''

   If you hate it, blame it on Washington. The word has been
marching northward for more than two decades, but it's only in the
past few months that disconnect, in its new noun form, has been
drawing queries _ and complaints _ from readers and colleagues.

   ``Vile,'' one copy editor calls it. ``I came across it three
times today in one (long) article,'' writes Nancy Shohet West of
Framingham. ``Is this the flip side of impact as a verb?'' And
recently, it's been appearing in the Globe with quotation marks _
``a major `disconnect' between the Beltway media and the rest of
the populace'' _ which is the punctuational equivalent of holding
our editorial nose. Apparently some editors, having just noticed
the arrival of disconnect, want to make it clear they don't yet
consider it respectable, everyday usage.
</P>
<P>
   It can only be Boston's resistance to fashion that has kept
disconnect at a distance so long. Back in 1990, William Safire had
already collected enough examples of the word, mostly from
Washington sources, to report on it in his New York Times column.
At the time, the earliest citation he could find was a 1984
quotation from Pat Caddell, the political consultant and pollster
to President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   But a more recent search finds disconnect in a 1976 issue of
Aviation Week and Space Technology, again in a Washington context:
A spokesman blames the cancellation of Minuteman funding on ``a
disconnect between the research and development community, the
Defense Dept. comptroller, program analysis and evaluation, and the
Office of Management and Budget.'' (Sounds like three or four
disconnects, but who's counting?)
</P>
<P>
   Disconnect as a noun was in Webster's unabridged dictionary in
1976, as the short form of ``disconnecting switch,'' a safety
switch to cut off an electrical circuit. The noun was also current
within phone and power companies, who referred to the customers
they'd cut off as disconnects. It's a short figurative leap from a
gap in the power supply to the notion of a disconnect between the
American people and the politicians, for example, or between a
friend's words and her deeds.
</P>
<P>
   This new disconnect is not just a gap or a gulf. It comes only
between people, or phenomena, with the potential to make a
connection; it implies a broken circuit, not a distant separation.
We wouldn't say there was a disconnect between Mars and Venus
(except in the pop-psychology universe), or between plants and
animals.
</P>
<P>
   As for disconnect's origins, there's no law against making verbs
into nouns in English. Unless you object to a laugh and a scratch,
both derived from verbs, you've got no theoretical reason to
despise disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   It's too soon to tell whether disconnect will prove ``the flip
side of impact as a verb'' _ that is, whether it will have to fight
its way toward respectability against a tide of disapproval. But
disconnect has already hung around for more than 20 years without
attracting much hostility, and it fits right into the techspeak
that's spreading, for better or worse, through our vocabulary. For
instance, in a Times interview last week, novelist Sue Miller spoke
of domestic fiction as her ``default mode.'' In the wired world she
shares with most of us, disconnect isn't likely to be banned from
the lexicon.
</P>

Calling all Beantowners &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The monumental Oxford English Dictionary is an ongoing project,
and ordinary readers can play a role in the revisions now (and
forever) underway. OED entries list the first written citation of
each English word, but many such dates are revised as earlier
evidence turns up. And among the items on the OED's latest
``appeals list'' _ words they're hoping to learn more about _ is
Beantowner, meaning, of course, someone from Boston. The editors
are looking for a citation before 1961, so any Beantowner who has
such evidence is invited to send it along to OED3(at)oup.co.uk.
</P>
<P>
   Sci-fi buffs may be able to help with a couple of other
requests: There's probably a space junk citation from before 1979
(how could Heinlein not have used that phrase?), and the OED is
also seeking pre-1979 examples of men in black _ ``people believed
to visit those who claim to have had an alien encounter,'' as they
delicately put it. The truth is out there . . . .

GRANITE STATE VOTE TAXES N.H. LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DERRY, N.H. _ The stingy image may have been only caricature.
Still, New Hampshire reveled in it. This was a flinty place where
money did not come easy and frugality was a time-tested virtue.
</P>
<P>
   This was not Taxachusetts. And for generations, neighbors sent
neighbors to the State House in Concord with firm orders to keep it
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Live free or die. We lived that, you know?'' said Roland
Routhier, 73, who for 32 years ran Shamrock Cleaners on Railroad
Avenue here before retiring in 1980. ``I never hesitate to tell
people when we went out of state that we are the only place in the
union that doesn't have a sales or an income tax. We're proud of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this month, that solid symbol of parsimoniousness
was jolted. In a seismic vote, state lawmakers in the House of
Representatives voted to approve the state's first-ever income tax.
</P>
<P>
   For New Hampshire, which for decades has paid its bills with a
patchwork quilt of levies and fees that helped preserve its status
as the only state never to have enacted a broad-based sales or
income tax, it was a watershed.
</P>
<P>
   And in it, some see a symbol of what the Granite State has
become.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're consciously aware of the fact that we are being
invaded by America,'' said R. Stuart Wallace, an adjunct history
professor at Plymouth State College.
</P>
<P>
   Said Donald Hall, the award-winning Wilmot poet and author: ``I
may lament the decline of the old culture. But that decline is
real.''
</P>
<P>
   But for people like Peg Lipin, a Massachusetts native who moved
here in 1977, the income tax is the tool to break the chains of a
financing system that has meant absurd property taxes and painfully
unequal school systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tradition is fine,'' Lipin said. ``But there's always a time
for new traditions. We're working with a system that worked a long
time ago, but it doesn't fit the state's needs anymore. Something
needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the income tax is uncertain. It was narrowly
approved by the Republican-controlled House. The state Senate,
controlled by Democrats for the first time in 86 years, could
approve it. But Governor Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, is promising
to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, observers agree, the state Supreme Court's 1997 ruling
that the current system of raising money for education with local
property taxes created unconstitutional inequities between rich and
poor towns, is the greatest-ever threat to New Hampshire's
antipathy for sales and income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a seminal event,'' said Thomas Rath, a Concord attorney
and a former state attorney general. ``We've had a series of
elections here where would-be governors have been defined by what
they would not do rather than what they would do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the income tax bill was approved by the House March 4 in a
194-190 vote with support of almost every Democrat and many
Republicans representing poor school districts, Representative
Elizabeth Hager, a Republican from Concord and the bill's chief
sponsor, clenched her fist in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was its last great hope,'' Hager said. ``If we lost, it
would have been another 20 years before we got another chance. It
still might be.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the larger issue itself, public support for the income tax
is in dispute. Proponents cite a Becker Institute survey showing 52
percent support the income tax. Opponents point to a survey by the
American Research Group of Manchester last December, indicating
that two-thirds of the public opposes it.
</P>
<P>
   But with 400 members, the New Hampshire House is arguably one of
the most representative legislative bodies in the Western world _
intimate political terrain where the elected are never too far from
those who elected them.
</P>
<P>
   As state lawmakers struggle to reach a court-imposed deadline of
April 1 to enact a new education finance plan, what hangs in the
balance is not only how New Hampshire pays for its classrooms, but
whether its decades-old litmus test on taxes lives or finally dies.
</P>
<P>
   The end of what is known here as ``The Pledge'' would be the
curtain on a post-war era.
</P>
<P>
   Before he became a chief aide to President Dwight D. Eisenhower,
Sherman Adams was New Hampshire's Republican governor. Faced with a
yawning budget gap in 1949, Adams proposed the adoption of an
income tax.
</P>
<P>
   When state lawmakers rejected the proposal by 17 votes, the
state's arch-conservative newspaper, the Union Leader of
Manchester, cheered. ``The only way to save is not to spend,'' a
Union Leader editorial declared.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter the newspaper's publisher, William Loeb, made
sure gubernatorial candidates publicly promised to be savers, not
spenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a check on the public sector,'' said Will
McEachern, a Portsmouth native and an economics professor at the
University of Connecticut. ``We don't have to mind the store if we
know they don't have access to the cash register.''
</P>
<P>
   A buoyant economy, creative financing, and Loeb's dominance of
the state's media kept the issue at bay for another generation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Governor Walter R. Peterson's proposal for a 3 percent
income tax was rejected 219-157 in a House vote. When Peterson
sought a third term running on a pro-tax platform, he was opposed
by two-time primary loser Meldrim Thomson Jr., whose winning
campaign slogan appeared on his car's license plate: ``AX TAX.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense that we were sort of headed for an income
tax back then, but when Thomson got elected, that was the end of
that,'' said Hank Nichols, an assistant professor of journalism at
New England College in Henniker.
</P>
<P>
   Those who dared flaunt The Pledge did so at their peril. With a
proposed income tax designed by his economist brother, Will, Paul
McEachern ran for governor in 1984 and lost in the primary. He
became the Democratic gubernatorial nominee in 1986 and 1988,
losing to Pledge-takers John Sununu and Judd Gregg despite having
sworn off income taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, if you're going to choose to lead, it doesn't
do any good to run and lose just to make a point,'' said McEachern.
``New Hampshire is a little bit ornery _ always has been.''
</P>
<P>
   If that orneriness has abated in this year's tax debate,
students of New Hampshire said, it is because of shifting political
realities: Loeb died in 1981 and the influence of his Union Leader
has been waning. Now, a majority of the state's residents _ 60
percent by one estimate _ are not New Hampshire natives.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a simpler explanation. Faced with the estimated
$900 million needed every year to fund schools, state taxpayers are
out of more unconventional options.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they must consider the kinds of big-ticket levies used
by other states _ if not the income tax, then higher taxes on
business, or even casino-style video gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going on now is that New Hampshire is becoming more
like the rest of the states in the country that have had to work
out the process of providing more equal funding for education,''
said Jere Daniell, a history professor at Dartmouth College.
</P>
<P>
   But in such pragmatism, say many residents, is the dilemma: How
to find the money without becoming more like the other states. And
with a deadline looming, nobody yet seems to have put forward a
convincing answer.

SOUTH CAROLINA'S GOP LINES UP BEHIND BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ Some of the same forces that crushed Pat
Buchanan's insurgency in the 1996 South Carolina primary and helped
Lee Atwater throw up a ``firewall'' in the state to protect George
Bush in 1988 are at work to give an advantage to the former
president's son in next year's primary.
</P>
<P>
   In a preemptive move last month, House Speaker David Wilkins
enlisted more than 50 of his Republican colleagues to join in a
public call for Texas Governor George W. Bush to seek the
presidential nomination. Former Governor David Beasley and
associates of Carroll Campbell, another former governor, are also
supporting Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican establishment that has controlled the
political climate in South Carolina for years no longer speaks with
the same authority since the party suffered a string of statewide
defeats last fall, and challengers to Bush are beginning to stake
out positions in South Carolina a year in advance of the critically
situated primary.
</P>
<P>
   Though he is not yet a formal candidate, Senator John McCain of
Arizona received an enthusiastic reception Friday night as the
keynote speaker at a banquet attended by 1,600 party loyalists
where presidential politics bubbled in conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm encouraging McCain to run,'' said Representative Lindsey
Graham, the hero of the evening for his efforts as a House manager
in the impeachment trial of President Clinton. ``Our party is in
the process of reorganizing itself,'' Graham said, asserting that
the old Atwater-Campbell axis cannot dictate events anymore.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans not only lost the governor's office, but failed
to unseat a vulnerable Democrat, Senator Ernest F. Hollings, and
saw other candidates fall in the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   Attention is now focusing on the state's presidential primary,
which closely follows New Hampshire's and is the first major
primary in the South. In recent presidential elections, the South
Carolina contest has played a pivotal role heading into the Super
Tuesday primaries throughout the South.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Charles Condon, the most prominent Republican
official left in state government, said he is ``trying to help''
Elizabeth Dole get a foothold in the state. There is an opening for
her, he says, because ``she's excited many women.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary cannot be wired the way it was in the past, Condon
said. ``Before, we had an incumbent governor with hundreds of
patronage jobs. That's gone. The party's Balkanized, and there is
no clear political leader in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is not yet aligned. Bush and Dole would be formidable
in the 2000 primary, he said, ``but don't underestimate Dan Quayle.
He's the most undersold candidate in the country.'' With a nod
toward McCain, Campbell said, ``He could get a buildup, too.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a free spirit who often dissents against party doctrine,
spent two days in the state during the weekend promoting his
candidacy in this conservative stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Cyndi Mosteller, an antiabortion activist, hosted a
breakfast for the Arizona senator in the Patriot's Room of a hotel
in a Charleston suburb. Although McCain describes himself as
prolife, he has never put abortion at the top of his agenda.
Mosteller pronounced herself satisfied with McCain's position and
hailed him as a man who had shown his ``willingness to sacrifice
for this country . . . In John McCain's vocabulary, dodge is not a
verb.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's strong connections here, McCain insisted in an
interview, ``I'm not starting from scratch in this state.''
</P>
<P>
   With his background as a decorated Navy pilot who endured more
than five years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi, McCain said, ``I'm
keenly aware there are more veterans per capita in South Carolina
than any other state.'' Throughout his South Carolina trip, he said
``rebuilding our nation's defense'' was his first priority, and he
talked wistfully of finding a way to register potential voters at
the many military bases around the state.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last Congress, McCain became identified with a couple
of initiatives that are unpopular with the Republican leadership.
He joined with Democratic Senator Russell Feingold of Wisconsin in
an attempt to choke off special interests in campaign financing,
and he led an unsuccessful move to impose a costly settlement on
the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Henry McMaster, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party,
said McCain's image as ``a true American hero'' would be a major
asset in South Carolina, but he predicted McCain's interest in
campaign-finance reform would have no resonance in the state.
</P>
<P>
   McCain ran into the tobacco issue Friday in South Carolina,
where tobacco is grown and R.J. Reynolds served as a benefactor at
the GOP dinner. In an afternoon meeting with a few prominent party
contributors, Jake Razor, a businessman from Laurens, questioned
McCain about his role in ``a huge ploy by the government to put an
industry out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he got to Columbia, McCain had anticipated the reaction.
``I know tobacco can be a problem,'' he told reporters on a flight
from Charleston. ``I know it will be used against me. They'll try
to make me sound like a tax guy.''

IN N.H. CAMPAIGNS, THERE'S LOGIC TO THE LOGISTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DERRY, N.H. _ Thomas D. Rath, the veteran political activist,
keeps a chart listing 85 voting precincts that contain 67 percent
of the Republican vote in this first-in-the-nation primary state.
He has a map with push pins, too, showing where his candidate,
Lamar Alexander, has been, and where he still needs to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to go where the votes are,'' said Rath. ``We want
to be there as regularly as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   It was no accident, then, that Alexander launched his second bid
for president here last week, in this large, prosperous Republican
stronghold where turnout is traditionally high. In 1996, Alexander
placed third in Derry, with 1,055 votes, following Bob Dole and
Patrick J. Buchanan. This time, Alexander is determined to do
better.
</P>
<P>
   While voters may think the candidates are traversing the state
indiscriminately, every campaign stop at a quaint village,
sprawling suburb, or urban center is the product of calculation by
political strategists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is part science, part art,'' said David M. Carney, a
longtime New Hampshire political strategist unaligned in the
Republican primary.
</P>
<P>
   How candidates structure their time in New Hampshire cannot be
overvalued. For example, a candidate who visits Bedford, next door
to Manchester, is likely to see more Republican voters than if he
or she travels three or four hours to conservative Coos County,
which borders Canada and has only 3 percent of the state's
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the most important part of the campaign in terms of
management because time is the one resource you can never get
back,'' said Carney, who worked for Dole in 1996 and former
President George Bush in '88 and '92.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy varies only slightly between Democrats and
Republicans. More than half the 747,367 registered voters in the
state live in just two of the 10 counties _ Hillsborough and
Rockingham _ in the southern tier. And that's where the candidates,
Republican and Democratic, spend the bulk of their time.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when Vice President Al Gore made his first campaign
trip to New Hampshire this week, he appeared in Manchester, the
state's largest city, and the one with the most Democratic votes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, out of 15 trips here since 1994, the vice president
only ventured twice out of the three main population counties _
Rockingham, which includes Portsmouth; Hillsborough, which covers
Manchester; and Merrimack, which claims Concord. Once, Gore visited
Laconia to address the New Hampshire AFL-CIO, a key constituency;
and once he traveled to Lebanon to attend the Democratic State
House barbecue and address the Dartmouth Medical School's
bicentennial symposium dinner.
</P>
<P>
   When strategists chart their candidate's logistical course
through the Granite State, there is a bible of sorts that they use.
The New Hampshire Manual for the General Court includes the voter
registration, voter turnout, and vote totals from every election in
every voting ward.
</P>
<P>
   That's how Rath can tell not just where the Republican voters
are, but where to find Republican voters who might consider
themselves moderate and might be attracted to Alexander, based on
how they have voted in previous elections.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many other factors go into scheduling. For example,
campaigns look for events that will draw sizable crowds or
important constituencies, and for settings that will reinforce the
candidate's message and look good on television.
</P>
<P>
   On March 26, Gore will head to North Conway up in Carroll
County's White Mountains for the annual Grover Cleveland dinner, a
chance to mingle with Democratic activists there, despite its
out-of-the-way location. And Alexander's kickoff was held at the
Derry Village School, a self-proclaimed ``21st century learning
community,'' to underscore his platform of bettering education.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates also tend to spend their days in one area of the
state. Rath said he doesn't like his candidate to waste time in the
car, when he could be talking to voters. Also, traveling from east
to west is no easy feat due to the indirect layout of the roads.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, campaigns want to hit as many media markets as
possible during a single day, visiting communities with daily and
weekly newspapers and attracting television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're on the front page of the newspaper, you can be
everywhere the newspaper is delivered,'' said Michael Whouley, one
of Gore's top strategists. ``And as long as TV is covering you,
you're reaching the voters. But in New Hampshire there's no
substitute for personal contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the similarities in their approaches to the state,
Democrats and Republicans are drawn to different spots. Many
Democratic primary voters tend to live in Nashua, Keene, and the
seacoast area, while Republican primary voters cluster around Salem
and Derry.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Winters, a Dartmouth College government professor, said
he rarely sees candidates in Hanover and the Upper Valley unless
they are giving a speech at the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not up here for two fundamental reasons: The voters
are in the southeastern section of New Hampshire, and the news
media outlets, television and print, are in the southeast,''
Winters said. ``It's not just that that's where the voters are, you
spend less time getting from one voter to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, sometimes there is no logic at all to where a
candidate will go and what he will do once he gets there. On
primary election night in 1992, Bill Clinton had tried everything
to save his candidacy from allegations of adultery.
</P>
<P>
   But insomnia had kicked in, and the candidate was wired with
energy. Rather than pace his hotel room, Clinton spent the night
visiting bowling alleys, diners, and other all-night establishments
in and around Manchester just to shake the hands of night owls.

MOVE TO TRY JUVENILES AS ADULTS UNDER SCRUTINY

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The criminal case against 15-year-old Anthony
Laster was clear-cut in the eyes of Florida prosecutors: He
demanded lunch money from a schoolmate in a threatening manner and
took $2 out of the schoolmate's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The youth, who is mentally retarded, was charged as an adult
with strong-arm robbery, battery and extortion. He was locked up
for nearly two months _ one month spent in an adult jail. Last
week, prosecutors in Palm Beach County dropped the charges after
the schoolmate testified that he was not threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't an isolated case,'' said Marsha Levick of the
Juvenile Law Center, a children's legal rights organization in
Philadelphia. ``That prosecutors could do this without a judge
reviewing it . . . is enough for us to be concerned about the kinds
of abuses prosecutors can commit when they have discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile justice advocates are pointing to this Florida case as
a cautionary tale of what can happen when prosecutors have the
power to charge and try minors as adults for serious offenses
without having a judge review the case. Florida is the only state
that gives such broad powers to prosecutors, but the idea is
gaining ground in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is considering a bill that would overhaul the
juvenile justice system, including a measure that would allow
prosecutors to try minors 14 and older as adults without the right
to appeal the decision to a judge. The House Judiciary Committee is
conducting hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The White House approves of granting federal prosecutors similar
discretion, as long as juveniles have some form of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been attacked on different fronts in and out
of Congress. Legal groups, including the National Association of
District Attorneys, have protested the bill's federal reach into
state jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   And youth advocates say that even though the federal courts
handle only a small number of juvenile cases, they fear the
legislation could become a standard used by states.
</P>
<P>
   These advocates also say putting more youths into the adult
system means they could be exposed to violent adult behavior while
losing out on counseling and other rehabilitation services provided
through the juvenile court system.
</P>
<P>
   Laster was not physically harmed during his time in the county
jail. But community groups criticized Barry E. Krischer, the Palm
Beach County state attorney, for misusing the Florida law.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for Krischer, said Florida law
requires that juveniles be sent directly into adult court for
certain felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pick and choose charges,'' said Edmondson. ``A crime
had been committed, and you don't select who you are going to apply
the law to.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Krischer's court filing, the charges were dropped
after Laster's schoolmate said in a deposition that he was not
threatened, making ``further prosecution of the robbery charge no
longer viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson added that the state attorney is ``very aggressive
with juveniles,'' and he believes the only way to lower crime is to
send juveniles a ``wake-up call'' by sending them to adult court.
``He wants to scare them straight,'' Edmondson said.
</P>
<P>
   But children's advocates say the state had no business charging
Laster, who has an IQ of 58, with a felony and as an adult and
sending him to jail for taking $2 in lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like hitting an ant with a hatchet,'' said Levick of the
Juvenile Law Center. ``It is even more troublesome in 1999, a time
when juvenile crime has been declining for the past six years, to
suggest that we need to try more kids in adult courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that expanding the power of federal prosecutors to
easily charge juveniles as adults could undermine public safety, as
well as the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the evidence shows you are going in the wrong direction
and will in fact increase, not decrease, crime,'' said
Representative Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee. ``When people say kids should get adult time
for an adult crime, they don't realize they have been misled.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said minors tried in adult court often do not receive
sentences as long as they might receive in juvenile court,
particularly for nonviolent offenses. As an example, Scott said a
first-time adult offender in Virginia convicted of burglary
typically receives a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guarantees that juveniles won't be punished, or they will
be punished for a short amount of time in an adult jail, where they
can count among their associates and role models armed robbers,
drug dealers, rapists and murderers,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Justice Policy Institute, a Washington
legal research and education organization, said: ``Studies about
juveniles prosecuted as adults consistently report that those
juveniles have higher reoffense rates, more serious reoffenses, and
reoffend sooner upon release from confinement'' than those
prosecuted in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Schiraldi, director of the institute, said other studies
show juveniles in adult facilities also are more likely to be
physically and sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he believes ``our juvenile
crime problem has taken a new and sinister direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, speaking on the Senate floor last month while introducing
the juvenile crime bill, noted that minors commit 21 percent of all
violent crimes and said the number of murder cases involving
15-year-olds increased 207 percent between 1985 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our intent to ensure that when there is a federal crime
warranting the federal prosecution of a juvenile, the federal
government assumes its responsibility to deal with it, rather than
saddling the states with that burden,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel said, ``The White House
favors shifting the responsibility from the judges to the
prosecutors to decide whether or not a juvenile should be tried in
adult court.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Association of District Attorneys does not support the
bill because it involves the federal government in state affairs,
Gary Walker, cochairman of the association's juvenile justice
committee, said, ``It is necessary to be able to directly file
juvenile cases to adult court to provide for the safety of the
public. It gives you the ability to incarcerate and remove from
society those people who are exceptionally dangerous for a longer
period of time.''

A WATERY `BATTLE' IN NEW ZEALAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE REINGA, New Zealand _ The battlefield is wet and windy,
fumingly ferocious, and relentlessly fascinating. As oceans collide
like two white buffalo butting horns, your unobstructed ringside
seat is on the grassy rise beside the Cape Reinga lighthouse. An
ivory cinder block tower, it sits, beamingly, at the uppermost tip
of New Zealand's North Island, the storm-bitten nail of a slender,
sandy digit pointed into endless expanses of sea.
</P>
<P>
   A lonely, gale-pounded end-of-the-line, this is known to the
Maoris as ``Te hika o te ika'' _ tail of the fish. They say it's
the terminus of their earthly line, too, sacred ground, the
jumping-off point for spirits headed to the next world.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Tasman Sea, charging from the left, nor the South
Pacific, roiling and rolling from the right, is of a mind to give
an inch as they meet head-on in their unceasing territorial war,
trying to total each other. It doesn't work, of course. No
surrender. Both will survive contentiously forever. But as watery
sparks noisily fly in the form of waves crunching and leaping
whitecappingly as high as 30 and 40 feet, they define the words
``maelstrom'' and ``turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mesmerizing,'' says my friend Aurelio as we spectate on this
rock-faced bluff above the eternal clash that seems a gigantic
briny tossing salad of many greens. ``I give the Tasman the edge
today, but I suspect the Pacific will retaliate.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also the end of one of the better bus lines that runs
from Kaitaia along Ninety Mile Beach to the Cape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better take the bus trip,'' Ian McPhee had advised. ``Forget
driving your rental for the day. You need a 4-wheel-drive to even
get onto the beach, and some of them have been known to sink in a
soft spot and get inundated by the tide. Instant junk. Great only
for the guy that owns the tow truck. But you don't need explaining
something like that to the rental agency, and also maybe walk 20
miles or so back to town. Leave it to the bus drivers at Harrison's
Tours. They know the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian is the proprietor of the Kauri Lodge motel in Kaitaia, a
refuge where his wife, Sally, bountifully greets those checking in
with hot, fresh-baked scones. She also wisely suggested dinner at
the Kaitaia Hotel because of Patricia Wakefield's cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety Mile Beach is ``actually 62 miles long,'' said a laughing
bus driver Pat Heta, a Maori. ``But it probably seemed endless to
the first Europeans to see it, and I guess Ninety Mile had a nice
sound to it, so . . . maybe the old tourism hype?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aw, who's counting?'' said Aurelio. ``It's so beautiful,
whatever the mileage. Just beaches-and-cream,'' she said, alluding
to the surf constantly foaming and frothing on the left as the bus
wheeled along the broad sand flat. High-rising as ivory and khaki
ramparts on the right were dunes patrolled by green-coated scrub.
We were locked into in a corridor of blues and beige: sea, sky, and
sand.
</P>
<P>
   Heta, the driver, said, ``In the old days when nobody much was
around, they would hold speed tests for racing cars here. Kingsford
Smith, an Australian driver and pilot _ the Sydney Airport is named
for him _ did 120 m.p.h. in 1932. I don't know what the bus record
is, but I have no intention of threatening it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays there are annual surfing carnivals and a 36-mile
footrace. A marathon-plus, and you can't get lost. No turnings or
hills, but you might have to watch out for wild horses.''
</P>
<P>
   Or errant fishing lines at the Bluff, a rocky platform that
suddenly appeared at water's edge. We stopped to watch a gang of
Maori fishermen up on the black outcropping where waves splattered
and showered on three sides. Men and women, they furiously wielded
15-foot bamboo poles, rearing back and then casting their lines
into the agitated waters, somehow skilfully managing not to hook
each other or kibitzers.
</P>
<P>
   They were pulling in sizable snapper and trevally, a good day at
black rock. As one of the polesters, Henry Nathan, happily
observed, ``We'll never starve around here.''
</P>
<P>
   After departing the anglers, Heta announced, ``Now, for all of
you who may be missing winter in your Northern Hemisphere home,
we'll have some toboggan rides.''
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand seaside style, that is. Stopping beside a snow-white
monster dune, altitude over 100 feet, he produced from the baggage
compartment plastic two-man sleds. ``Just climb to the top and
slide down. I promise you won't get frostbite (in 85- degree
temperature) or luge bruise.''
</P>
<P>
   No idle promise. But he didn't add that an uphill slog in hot
knee-deep sand will make you feel dune-in pretty fast. The reward
is not pretty fast _ in fact a slo-mo slide as breathtaking as
skateboarding in mud. One walk up to the summit in blazing sunshine
is sufficient. Oh, well. The concept sounds good.
</P>
<P>
   ``A singular novelty, right?'' rationalized Aurelio. ``Probably
not a potential Olympic event, but you don't have to wear a crash
helmet, either.''
</P>
<P>
   A detour took us to the Wagener Museum for lunch. The museum
itself is an eclectic melange of such items as a 1928 American Easy
Spin Dry washing machine, a 1906 Edison Gramophone, player pianos,
an 1897 typewriter, Maori art and crafts, stuffed animals _ ``a
collection of collections,'' in the words of curator Owen Wagener,
a descendant of the founder.
</P>
<P>
   Even an incredible assemblage of about 500 chamber pots and
bedpans. Most of these chinaware, glass, and metal conveniences are
imaginatively shaped, colored, and decorated, many hand-painted.
Certainly state of a lost art.
</P>
<P>
   ``The largest such collection in the Southern Hemisphere _ and,
we believe, second in the world only to one in Germany,'' modestly
stated Wagener. ``There is something for every taste.''
</P>
<P>
   And every waste? Aurelio wondered, ``Are there any in Limoges,
Waterford, or Steuben?''
</P>
<P>
   Most stylish was a 1903 model billed as a ``non-splash thunder
bowl,'' and with a built-in music box that plays ``Oft in a Stilly
Night.'' But a 1940 number from England was timely and satisfying,
bottomed with a portrait of Adolf Hitler. Its music box plays ``In
the Fuhrer's Face.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to the beach, the bus soon pulled up at the Cape Reinga
lighthouse, in time for the big game: Tasman vs. South Pacific.
You're never late, and it's always a tie.

TATYANA ALI JUGGLES HARVARD, HOLLYWOOD AND A RECORDING CAREER 
</HEADLINE>

 By SUZANNE C. RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It's a rainy Thursday night in Cambridge,
</P>
<P>
   and the House of Blues is packed. ``I'm so excited, I'm going to
scream!'' says Keri Palmer, 19. Hovering expectantly in front of
the stage with a posse of fans, she says, ``I really want to meet
her.'' The ``her'' that's eliciting so much enthusiasm is Tatyana
Ali, actress, Harvard freshman, and pop singer.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a waiting room overlooking the stage, dressed in
shiny blue pants and a Karl Kani tank top, the 5-foot-4 Ali looks
every bit the star as she gears up to perform live at her first
Boston performance. Still, you'd never guess what she's thinking
about: ``All of my friends have a quantitative reasoning test
tonight at 8!'' groans Ali, 20, glancing at a clock (It's 7:25.)
Cupping a mug of steaming hot water, the college student paces the
room, adding, ``Some of them ditched it. But some couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about extracurricular activities. Best known as Ashley
Banks, a character from the TV series ``The Fresh Prince of
Bel-Air,'' (1990-1996), Ali is managing to combine the unthinkable:
the music industry, Hollywood, and Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   Many a famous name has launched a career after Harvard. But not
many entertainers maintain jet-setting careers while toiling in the
Ivy League. It's a heavy load. So heavy that Ali has taken four
months off to tour nationally in 50 cities with the group 'N Sync
and promote her debut CD ``Kiss the Sky.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ali swears she'll be back for Harvard's summer session. ``I
want to finish on time,'' she says. ``I'll do five classes my
sophomore year and summer school this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Ali ever waver about school? With recognition, momentum,
and youth on her side, why not save Harvard for later, for when
Hollywood turns to the next young starlet?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to go to college,'' says Ali. ``Forty
percent of my reasoning is brainwashing from when I was little. On
my father's side of the family, they are all educators. And on my
mother's side, not going to college is not considered an option.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of Long Island who has lived in Los Angeles since
landing the part on ``Fresh Prince'' at age 11, Ali could easily
have attended school in California. But she says, ``I know a lot of
people who did that. You're so close to the business. Every
audition and every meeting seems so important that you just leave
school. I figured if I was far away, I can only do the really
important things.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, she says, growing up on the East Coast, she recalls
lots of road trips with her parents and two younger sisters. ``We
went to all the colleges. I have this picture in my mind of ivy and
cobblestone streets and students sitting on the grass. In
California, everything is so new. It's not the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali arrived in Cambridge with no fanfare. Like every other
freshman, she was convinced she needed new clothes. ``My dad said,
`I don't understand why you have to go shopping,' '' she recalls.
``I have a ton of clothes, but not for everyday school stuff.
They're either dressy clothes or sweats. I needed jeans.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ali could have selected a luxury apartment overlooking the
Charles, she opted for a dorm and a suite of rooms with five
roommates and no cable TV. ``An apartment?'' she says. ``That's no
fun. That's totally missing the point.'' Since Ali arrived at
school a day late (she was in London working), she got stuck with
the smallest bedroom and the top bunk of a bunk bed.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Ali's fellow students were curious about the
celebrity, often approaching her in the dining hall. ``People would
say, `I used to watch you when I was little.' Or they'd say, `I
have your album,' '' says Ali. But only one student made a real
fuss, asking to take a picture with her. ``I said, `You do realize
that I'm graduating with you, right? You'll see me every day for
the next four years' . . . It was weird for me because in LA no one
cares. It's such a factory town.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for down-to-earth Ali to settle in around
Harvard Square, although admittedly she has a somewhat surreal
student lifestyle. A good friend and mentor is superstar Will
Smith, who also starred on ``Fresh Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My roommates will say `Will Smith just left a message. Do you
think that's normal?''' laughs Ali, who talks to Smith at least
twice a month.
</P>
<P>
   When Ali went clubbing with her friends recently, a DJ was
playing her hit song ``Daydreamin' '' when the group walked in. ``I
was like, `Oh God. I'll go to the bathroom now,' '' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   And when radio station JAM'N 94.5 agreed to sponsor a show of
hers at the House of Blues Feb. 4 (giving away tickets to callers),
classmates like George Reed, Ali's boyfriend, got to see a
different side of her. Ali executed choreographed steps with four
dancers and confidently shouted in the microphone: ``Put your hands
in the air!. . .What's up, everybody? I feel so much love. You know
this is my home town, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Said Reed last month, ``Tonight is the first time I saw her
perform live. It was amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ali says getting up on stage in Boston was a relief. ``When I
saw my friends there I thought, `Good, now they know me.' This is
such a big part of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments of glamour aside, Ali's life qualifies as ordinary on
most days. Rather than limousines, she'll take the MBTA through the
city _ with a group, not alone. ``I told my mom I took the bus to
the Cheesecake Factory. She just pursed her lips,'' Ali says. ``I'm
in college. No one wants to spend money on a cab when they can
spend 85 cents for a token.''
</P>
<P>
   On campus Ali typically wears no makeup _ just lip balm. Her
hair? ``I might streak my hair blue or braid my whole head,'' she
says. Her uniform is normally jeans, T-shirts, and sweaters. ``I
still think I'm in California. I keep wearing tank tops under
sweaters as if I can take off the sweaters at some point. The cold
is hard to get used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many students, Ali sometimes borrows clothes from her
roommates. ``They wear my clothes, too. It's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali, an African-American studies major, finished her first
semester in January. She took classes in the morning and studied in
the evening. And the afternoons? ``There was a lot of
procrastination going on,'' she admits. ``Hanging out with
girlfriends.'' To show her school spirit, Ali joined a choir. But
in rehearsals with 300 singers from 7 to 10 p.m., she found herself
falling asleep. ``I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was traveling every weekend to radio stations from Chicago
to San Francisco to promote her CD, which was released last summer.
She was also juggling offers to appear in TV specials and award
shows; she has presented at the MTV Video Music Awards, the
American Music Awards, the Billboard Music Awards, and the NAACP
Image Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things come up, and I get excited,'' she says. ``I'm a pretty
ambitious person. But then I think `What will I miss in school?'
It's all about priorities and not being greedy. You have to keep
yourself in mind and what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Disney called asking her to host a Christmas TV special,
she said no. ``I would have missed a class where you can only miss
two sessions,'' she says. Then Ali changed her mind. ``I talked to
the professor and he said OK. But I'm not into going to a professor
and saying, `I have a special situation.' That's lame. Everybody
has a story.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cynical world of show business, Ali has managed to keep
it real, perhaps because her family is a huge part of her life and
they keep her grounded. ``I'm very proud of her,'' says her mother,
Sonia Ali. ``Of course, the school thing is the biggest thing for
me. Nobody can take a degree away from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonia accompanies Ali on all of her business trips and
appearances or ensures that some other relative is present. ``You
have to be very careful,'' she says. Indeed, during a recent photo
shoot in Boston for the cover of Touch, a British pop culture and
music magazine, Sonia paused while talking on two cellular phones
at once. Staring at her daughter, who was lying on the floor,
posing for the camera, Sonia asked an observer, ``Is her top very
open?'' Ali laughed, replying: ``No, Mom.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ali has been acting since she was 3 and saw ``E.T.'' on the big
screen. ``I saw all those kids, and I said, `I want to do that,' ''
she says. ``I liked auditioning . . . You sing. You dance. I never
cared if I got the part.'' She sang on ``Star Search'' twice when
she was 7, winning both times. Later, she appeared in the Broadway
version of ``Fences.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ali landed the part on ``Fresh Prince,'' Sonia, who is
originally from Panama, sacrificed her career as a registered nurse
to move Ali and her two younger daughters (now 13 and 16) to Los
Angeles while her husband, Sheriff Ali, who is from Trinidad,
continued working in New York as a police officer. ``We did the
bicoastal thing,'' says Sonia. ``We came home twice a year and my
husband would come to LA sometimes twice a month.''
</P>
<P>
   When the show went off the air three years ago, Ali spent her
senior year in high school doing all the things she could never do
in the classroom trailer on the set. ``I was part of every
committee and club,'' she says. ``I went to all the parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali deferred her Harvard admittance for one year to record her
first album. She's on tour now, she says, because she wants to give
the album everything she can.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to continue recording albums while at Harvard. ``I'm
already itching to get back in the recording studio,'' she says.
``I feel a lot stronger than when I first started.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ali would also like to act. ``I don't think I have to make a
choice,'' she says. In the summer of 2000, she hopes to do a movie
or another US tour promoting a second album. ``I'm working on new
songs now,'' she says. ``I can record this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   After her Harvard classes, of course.

COMMUNITY GROUPS SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE DEALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They have wish lists.
</P>
<P>
   Housing activist Bruce Marks wants Fleet Financial Group to sell
some of the branches it will be required to divest to a national
lender, which will keep the hometown bank competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our basic feeling that this is like a couple of feudal
lords getting together,'' Marks, executive director of the
Neighborhood Assistance Corp. of America, quipped.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Joseph E. Washington, chairman of the Boston-based
Organization for a New Equality, wants Fleet to increase its
lending to minority small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Draisen, who heads a statewide group for community
development corporations, wants Fleet to convert into equity part
of the estimated $200 million in loans it will have to pledge, as
part of the merger, to a low-income housing program.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the merger mating game: Where housing and community
activists are handed leverage the likes of which they rarely see.
</P>
<P>
   Banks like Fleet, mindful that staunch community opposition has
the potential to delay their deals and create regulatory headaches,
take these demands seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this was a merger in the insurance world, or of phone
companies, they would not be talking to community groups,'' said
Thomas Callahan, executive director of the Massachusetts Affordable
Housing Alliance, a nonprofit group whose low-income home loan
program is underwritten by nine area banks.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act, banks are required to
make sure they loan money to residents of low-income and minority
neighborhoods in which they do business. Each year banks receive a
rating from federal regulators for their CRA performance; most,
including Fleet and BankBoston, receive high marks. But when
regulators start reviewing the fine print of a merger application,
community support or opposition takes on added significance. And
getting local groups onboard early can influence regulators'
decisions of whether or not to dispense with public hearings on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet knows well the sting of bad local publicity.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, a former Fleet subsidiary was accused of
engaging in unscrupulous lending practices in poor and minority
communities. After a 4 1/2-year battle with Marks, and a
multimillion-dollar settlement, Fleet agreed to earmark more than
$7.6 billion over three years to low-income customers and
affordable housing initiatives nationally. The agreements were
inked shortly before Fleet's merger with Shawmut National Corp.
Indeed, a major beneficiary of Fleet's new initiative, dubbed
``InCity,'' was a burgeoning affordable housing program run by
Marks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that largesse, housing activists worry that one less
major bank in Boston will reduce the overall amount of CRA spending
locally. Fleet and BankBoston together have spent hundreds of
millions of dollars trying to comply with the CRA to gain community
support. Fleet spent $151.5 million in Massachusetts on
specially-targeted CRA mortgage programs last year, while
BankBoston spent about $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent round of dealmaking has only begun.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for an attractive set of ``commitments,'' Draisen
said, local groups might offer Fleet their neutrality before
regulators. ``We will be holding meetings across the state with
CDCs and other allies to try and come up with a list of critical
requests,'' Draisen said.

FAME AWAITS SELECT FEW AS BALLOTS ARRIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hall of Fame ballot has arrived. There are 130 voters
nationwide, and ballots are due Friday. The winners will be
announced during Kentucky Derby week.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how one turf writer voted:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
JOCKEY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Russell Baze, Earlie Fires, Jackie Westrope.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: (1) Baze. (2) Fires. (3) Westrope.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Baze rode 400 winners for the seventh consecutive
time. He has been the leading rider on the Northern California
circuit annually since 1980. He is the 12th rider to achieve 6,000
victories and has won at a 21 percent clip during his career. From
1992-96, he led the country in wins, a record run.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is based at Bay Meadows and Golden Gate Fields, Baze
doesn't get much publicity. However, his Hall of Fame credentials
speak for themselvs.
</P>
<P>
   Fires was the leading apprentice of 1965 and is still riding. He
also has won 6,000 races and has done a lot, but not as much as
Baze. Westrope was the leading rider in the nation in 1933 as a
15-year-old apprentice. He was killed in a racing accident at Santa
Anita in 1958. Frankly, this voter is in no position to properly
evaluate a man who was a star 66 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
TRAINER &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Neil Drysdale, D. Wayne Lukas, Richard Mandella.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: (1) Lukas. (2) Mandella. (3) Drysdale.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1974, Lukas has won 927 stakes races with 351 horses. In
1990, he became the first trainer to reach $100 million in total
earnings, and in 1988 he set the one-year mark of $17.8 million. He
has led the purse-money list 14 of the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas has saddled 19 Eclipse winners, a record, including two
who were Horse of the Year (Lady's Secret and Criminal Type). He
has won 13 Breeders' Cup races, the most of any trainer, and 10
Triple Crown races (three Kentucky Derbys, four Preakness Stakes,
three Belmont Stakes). Lukas accomplished what arguably is the
greatest training feat ever by winning six consecutive Triple Crown
races from 1994-96. The only comparable acomplishment was by the
late Woody Stephens, who saddled six consecutive Belmont Stakes
winners from 1981-86.
</P>
<P>
   Lukas doesn't treat his horses like pets, and some people
understandably object to his assembly-line tactics. But this isn't
a popularity contest. It's about career accomplishment, and, on
that basis, Lukas stands out.
</P>
<P>
   Mandella is a terrific conditioner, one who will soon be voted
into the Hall, and Drysdale is a major talent, as well. Their only
problem is being nominated in the wrong year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CONTEMPORARY MALE HORSE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: A.P. Indy, Exceller, Precisionist.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: (1) A.P. Indy. (2) Exceller. (3) Precisionist.
</P>
<P>
   A.P. Indy, a son of Seattle Slew, ran only 11 times. But if you
saw him race, you know he was a great horse. He cost $2.9 million
as a yearling in 1990 and actually earned that back in his brief
career. Racing only at ages 2 and 3, he won the Hollywood Futurity,
Santa Anita Derby, Belmont Stakes, and Breeders' Cup Classic. The
only thing that kept A.P. Indy off the radar screen of the casual
fan is that he injured his hoof the day before the 1992 Kentucky
Derby and had to be scratched the morning of the race. That was the
year that Arazi flopped and long shot Li'l E. Tee captured the Run
for the Roses. A.P. Indy would have been a cinch had he started.
The injury also kept him out of the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   A.P. Indy had soundness problems that limited his career, but he
was a monster on the racetrack, and that's what counts.
</P>
<P>
   Exceller won 15 of 33 starts. In 1978, he took the Jockey Club
Gold Cup at Belmont, beating Seattle Slew and Affirmed. He is the
only horse to have defeated two Triple Crown winners in the same
race. This voter saw Exceller on television, and he was tough to
pass on. But A.P. Indy was brilliant. Precisionist also was a top
horse, winning the Woodward, Swaps, and 1985 Breeders' Cup Sprint
in a carreer that saw him take 20 of 46 starts. However, he was not
quite in the class of A.P. Indy and Exceller.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
CONTEMPORARY FEMALE HORSE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Dance Smartly, Miesque, Winning Colors.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: (1) Miesque. (2) Winning Colors. (3) Dance Smartly.
</P>
<P>
   Miesque, who was based in France, ran twice in the United
States, winning the Breeders' Cup Mile in 1987 and '88, and won two
Eclipse Awards. That's how impressive she was. At age 3, she scored
at Hollywood Park on a firm course. The following year, she won at
Churchill Downs in deep going. Miesque won 12 of 16 career starts,
always racing against males, and was never worse than third. She
captured nine Group I races in Europe. Miesque was as fast as a
rocket. She turned her foot quicker than any other horse this turf
writer has ever seen and, as with A.P. Indy, is worthy of the Hall
despite being lightly raced, in the European tradition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Winning Colors became only the third filly (after
Regret and Genuine Risk) to triumph in the Kentucky Derby. She also
won the Santa Anita Derby against males, and, that fall just missed
winning the Breeders' Cup Distaff at Churchill against undefeated
Personal Ensign, in what many consider the greatest of all
Breeders' Cup races. She was past her peak at age 4, and finished
with a career mark of eight wins in 19 starts. It was tough to vote
against a Derby winner, but Miesque was simply more dominating.
</P>
<P>
   Dance Smartly, a Canadian-bred, was sensational as a 3-year-old
in 1991, going 8 for 8, with her wins including the Canadian Triple
Crown and the Molson Million, against males, and the Breeders' Cup
Distaff. She took 12 of 17 starts in her career, and is worthy of
the Hall, but not over this competition.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
HORSE OF YESTERYEAR &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nominees: Bald Eagle, Bowl of Flowers, Gun Bow.
</P>
<P>
   The vote: (1) Gun Bow. (2) Bald Eagle. (3) Bowl of Flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Since horses must be retired for 25 years to qualify, this
category requires a careful reading of the resumes. If you're known
by your enemies, then this vote has to go to Gun Bow, since his No.
1 foe was the mighty Kelso, the five-time Horse of the Year
recently voted the fourth-best thoroughbred of the century. Gun Bow
beat Kelso by 12 lengths, while setting a then-track record of 1:59
3/5 for 10 furlongs, in the Brooklyn at Belmont in 1964. Kelso beat
him in the Aqueduct Stakes, but Gun Bow came back to nip Kelso in
the Woodward. Kelso evened the series by beating Gun Bow on the
turf in the Washington, D.C., International. Gun Bow won 17 of 42
starts, and his split decison with Kelso is eye-catching.
</P>
<P>
   Bald Eagle, champion handicap horse of 1960, was outstanding on
both grass and dirt and defeated Sword Dancer in the Metropolitan
Handicap. His final record showed 12 tallies from 29 races. He was
great, but Gun Bow appears to have been a little bit greater. Bowl
Of Flowers, champion filly at age 2 and 3 in 1960 and '61, won 10
of 16 starts and was a tremendous female. But she's no match for
Gun Bow and Bald Eagle.

BARNES THREW THE BOOK AT THE BEARCATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Lamont Barnes stood in a corner of Temple's locker
room in the FleetCenter, a white towel wrapped around his waist and
another draped over his shoulder and across his torso like a toga.
He was all smiles. Some were coaxed by reporters, others came
naturally when the 6-foot-10-inch junior forward was asked to
recount the pivotal moments of a 64-54 victory over No. 3 seed
Cincinnati Sunday in the second round of the NCAA East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes's smiles reflected his impact in guiding the sixth-seeded
Owls to their first Sweet 16 appearance in six years. He led Temple
to a regional semifinal matchup against No. 10 seed Purdue in East
Rutherford, N.J., by scoring a team-high 15 points against the
rough-and-tumble Bearcats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, given the many tragedies that have pockmarked his life,
it seems a minor miracle that Barnes can find anything to smile
about. He was 8 years old when his mother was beaten to death
during a robbery of their home in Lexington, Ky.; he was a high
school senior in Hopkinsville, Ky., when his father was shot to
death; and he was just beginning his freshman year at Temple when
his grandmother called with the news of the death of a close
cousin.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with 32 seconds remaining in the Owls' triumph over
Cincinnati, a toothy grin creased Barnes's face as Temple fans
filled the FleetCenter with chants of ``Sweet 16! Sweet 16! Sweet
16!''
</P>
<P>
   How sweet it was, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just happy for our team,'' Barnes said. ``I just looked
up and heard the crowd cheering and it was nice, because I don't
normally hear them cheering during the game.''
</P>
<P>
   In this game, however, Barnes had other priorities. If Temple
was going to succeed against Cincinnati's muscular and heavily
tattooed frontcourt, Barnes knew he would have to set the tone with
physical play in the low post. That was evident to him during
pregame warmups when players from both sides exchanged hard stares.
From that moment, Barnes knew it was imperative that he, 6-9,
240-pound freshman center Kevin Lyde, and 6-10, 290-pound freshman
reserve Ron Rollerson do one thing. ``Go at 'em,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important that we got established, because
defensively they're a very strong team,'' Rollerson said. ``They've
got one guy pushing on you low and another guy coming at you
weak-side to block the shot. But, yeah, they're one of the stronger
teams in the country and, by looking at us, we're not. For us to be
pushing with them, tug for tug, played a huge role in that game.
And Lamont did a great job in there for us. He's been one of our
go-to guys all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lyde, ``Lamont played good, he played good. He wanted to
show that we wasn't a pushover, because they were talking some talk
to us, saying that we were scared. But he wanted to show them that
he wasn't scared.''
</P>
<P>
   That much was evident when Barnes backed in Kenyon Martin,
Cincinnati's menacing 6-8, 230-pound junior center, and hit a
turnaround jumper that gave Temple a 6-0 lead. Then, after Temple's
tough matchup zone forced Cincinnati to commit a 35-second shot
clock violation, Barnes stuffed home an offensive rebound. In all,
Temple outrebounded the Bearcats, 32-31, getting 19 defensive
boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to be physical and we know we didn't
want them to come out and get the upper hand on us, so we wanted to
get physical right back with them,'' Barnes said. ``If the ref was
going to allow that to go on, then we figured we should play
physical with them.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was one sequence that illustrated Temple's tenacity on
the boards, it was late in the first half when Barnes helped keep
the ball alive for a third-chance 3-pointer by Quincy Wadley that
lifted the Owls to a whopping 16-point lead, 29-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I believe it kind of hurt them the way we were
rebounding the ball,'' Barnes said. ``They probably weren't
expecting it, but it helped that our rebounding was good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   It also helped that Barnes, Temple's second-leading scorer (12.8
points per game) and leading rebounder (7.0 per game), found the
mark with his shot. He hit 5 of 8 field goal attempts, including a
towering baseline skyhook over Martin's hand that expanded Temple's
lead to 31-18 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Bearcats underestimate Barnes?
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw, I knew what he could do,'' Martin sniffed. ``He wasn't a
surprise to us. He made a couple of shots. Everyone's going to make
a couple of shots. They were tough shots where I had my hand up,
but they went in.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cincinnati assistant Rod Baker, ``Barnes got more touches
than he had been getting. He really got a lot more touches and they
really went to him and they felt like he was a guy who was going to
get something done for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in the FleetCenter, Barnes did just that. He got it done
for his team _ with a smile on his face _ and because he did, the
Owls are in the Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great for us,'' Barnes said, smiling again. ``There
was a point in time where we hit a little slide and we lost a
couple of games, but to be able to be where we are right now is a
great feeling. It's great for us as a team, it's great for our
program, and it's great for our school. I just hope everybody
enjoys it.''

IMPORTANCE OF FACING CLIPPES NOT LOST ON CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They know it, they think it, and maybe they even
whisper it among themselves. But they never would speak publicly
about what they know. Especially not now. Why? They just can't.
</P>
<P>
   That is the advantage you have over the Celtics. You can see a
bad basketball team and say, ``That team is terrible.'' The
Celtics? Their candor is blunted by extreme diplomacy. So they look
at a team with a 1-19 record and say something like, ``Those guys
have a lot of talent. They have Maurice Taylor, Rodney Rogers and
Lorenzen Wright. If you're not careful, that team can beat you . .
. ''
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Pitino and his Celtics know the truth, even if we don't
have the opportunity to print or broadcast their uncensored words.
And the truth is that they cannot lose to the Los Angeles Clippers
wednesday night at the FleetCenter. Never mind that the Clippers
beat the Kings and the Celtics didn't. Never mind that the Clippers
have won more recently than the Celtics, who have a five-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot lose to Chris Ford's team. Not at home. If a home
loss to the Lakers extends your losing streak to six, that's
acceptable. But the Clippers are 0-9 on the road. This is the team
that lost its first 17 games, a mark that ties the worst start in
league history. This is also the team that still would not have a
winning record if it won its next 17. Lose to a team like that at
home and you'll never forget it. Just in case you do, your fans
will remind you forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our record at home?'' Kenny Anderson asked after the
Celtics lost to the Pacers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He was told 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what's our record on the road?''
</P>
<P>
   He was told 3-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics point guard thought about those numbers for a while
and came to a conclusion: ``We've got to take care of the crib,
man. We've got to take care of our home court. We can't lose too
many more games at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson knew what team was next on the schedule when he made
those remarks. The Celtics haven't heard boos since Opening Night,
when they were thumped by the Raptors. They know they will hear
boos if they lose.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Pitino. If his team were to lose, the loss
probably would end his honeymoon with Boston fans. When most fans
vent online and on radio stations, their complaints are directed at
the players. But a six-game losing streak and a defeat to the LA
junior varsity _ as the late agent Ron Grinker once called them _
would shift the focus from the players to the man who coaches them.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had the day off Monday. You can be sure they ran
errands in Greater Boston. You also can be sure a few of them
paused for a moment and said, ``We cannot lose to the Clippers
(Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little bit of a strange team sometimes,'' Dana Barros
said. ``If we play a team that is perceived to be good _ a team
that is on TV a lot or something _ we'll play very well. If it's a
team that is not supposed to be real great, we'll struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Barros was asked, how do you even out your performances?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the million-dollar question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has said that his team would have to make an
``incredible'' run simply to make the playoffs. He also has
maintained that the Celtics will be a definite playoff team in his
third season, not his second.
</P>
<P>
   But the players know that the coach takes losing hard. After the
Celtics lost to the Pistons Friday night, people outside the team's
locker room could hear the coach's raised voice. He was not happy.
A reporter approached him afterward and extended a microphone.
``Don't put that in my face,'' he snapped. And that was after a
defeat to the seminal Grant Hill and his Pistons. A loss to the
Clippers probably would cause the coach to snap the mike itself if
someone pushed it toward his noggin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who we play, we just need a win,'' Anderson
said. And they need it Wednesday.

A SNAG IN A REMATCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was 6 a.m., the sky over Manhattan just starting
to lighten on the morning after The Indecision, and Don King sat in
front of a plate of spaghetti arrabiati at Bravo Johnnie's trying
to figure out how to make the stink of what had just happened go
away.
</P>
<P>
   With him sat HBO Sports president Seth Abraham. Both men had
only one thing on their mind: ironing out a rematch between Evander
Holyfield and Lennox Lewis as fast as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours after that meeting the three sanctioning bodies _
the World Boxing Council, World Boxing Association, and
International Boxing Federation _ announced that they would not
block such a fight by insisting that their No. 1 contenders get
title shots first, a decision that surprised Abraham and showed
that once in a while common sense rules over uncommon greed, even
in prizefighting. Yet hurdling that stumbling block did not assure
a late summer or early September rematch.
</P>
<P>
   A little-known clause in Lewis's contract may prove to be the
real problem.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis first agreed to take $9.5 million to Holyfield's $20
million for the unification bout that ended in a draw Saturday
night, he granted a rematch clause if Holyfield lost. In return,
Lewis was given an unusual ``draw clause'' that said he would be
paid $15 million for a rematch if the first fight was a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Now that clause hangs over the proposed promotion like a
guillotine blade despite last weekend's financial success. Although
the draw was considered unsatisfactory by most people and unsavory
by some, pay-per-view sales of Holyfield-Lewis have been estimated
between 1.1 million and 1.4 million, which would put it in the top
five all-time pay-per-view fights and net King $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the economics of a rematch could prove overwhelming if Lewis
sticks to his $15 million clause because it is unlikely that
Holyfield, who retained the IBF and WBA titles with the draw, will
agree to have his own purse reduced. With fears that a rematch may
not sell as well, King and HBO will have to scramble to put
together a financial package that works or the cable network's
parent company, Time-Warner, would have to accept the likelihood of
losing money to make the match happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second fight isn't bigger than the first,'' a source close
to the negotiations said. ``It's smaller. But I don't think Evander
will take one cent less, and Lewis's purse is to go up
significantly. If Holyfield refuses to come down to $15 million or
so, why should HBO do it and lose money?''
</P>
<P>
   Those are decisions neither Holyfield, Lewis, nor HBO is ready
to make, but the much-maligned sanctioning bodies wasted no time
announcing they would do nothing to block the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three of us were milling around after the fight talking
about the decision,'' IBF president Bob Lee said. ``After (WBA
president Gilberto) Mendoza, (WBC president Jose) Sulaiman and I
talked for a few minutes, it was clear what we all wanted was a
unified title-holder. That's what's best for the sport. So we all
said we'd relax the rules for mandatory defenses and I released it
to the papers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctioning bodies have opened the door. We want it done.
But we can't promote it. That's up to King and Duva. But if money
is an issue, that's a major stumbling block.''
</P>
<P>
   King, Holyfield, Lewis, and Abraham were all at HBO Monday to
tape the replay show that will run Friday night. Holyfield and
Lewis will break down from their perspectives what went on, and
Lewis certainly will reiterate his claim that he was robbed.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Holyfield's physical wounds remain raw, so do Lewis's
emotional ones. Abraham knows he will have to deal with that, but
he also knows deals like this must be done quickly, before they are
slowed by the weight of the warring parties' demands and egos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don wants the rematch because he knew what would happen,''
Abraham said. ``He knew everyone would blame him. Tempers are very
hot right now. Lennox's people are outraged, so we have to let
things cool down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope after that we'll do the practical thing. What happened
happened. It can't be changed. If you wallow in self-pity, no deals
get made. I'm saddened for the sport for what happened but we have
to move quickly on a rematch. We'd like one by July or August.''
</P>
<P>
   If Holyfield, Lewis, and perhaps Time-Warner are willing to pay
the price, they just may get it.

   NEW YORK _ Jean Williams has judged at least a dozen title
fights and never once had a scorecard questioned. That's how she
got the assignment that has led people to bellow that she is blind,
incompetent, a co-conspirator in Lennox Lewis's demise, in the
pocket of Don King, or all of the above.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is the Atlantic City municipal accountant who Saturday
night tallied up her scorecard and concluded that Evander Holyfield
had defeated Lewis in the heavyweight unification fight at Madison
Square Garden. Based on that, you might not want her doing your
income tax, but boxing insiders said Monday that there was no
reason to suspect her honesty or competence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a problem with her when we heard her name,''
said Carl Moretti, matchmaker for Main Events, Dino Duva's
promotional company that represents Lewis. ``We had seen her a lot
in Atlantic City because she's from New Jersey and works a lot of
fights here. She's done 10 or 12 world title fights. She did (Ivan)
Robinson-(Arturo) Gatti. We had no reason to raise a red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until her card said 115-113 for Holyfield. Then her fitness
to work such a fight came under assault, especially after she
somehow concluded that Holyfield had won the fifth round even
though Lewis battered him for much of the three minutes and nearly
knocked him down.
</P>
<P>
   Williams stood by her card, saying after the fight, ``That's
what I saw round by round.'' Monday she still stood by her scoring
and claimed she couldn't see Lewis's fifth-round assault on
Holyfield because his back was to her most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't see the blows that I later saw on TV,'' Williams
said. ``If I couldn't see it, I can't score it. That's what we're
told (by the International Boxing Federation and the New Jersey
Athletic Commission). I'm taking a lot of heat but I can't score
what I can't see. I scored what I saw.''
</P>
<P>
   What she saw is something very few others saw, because she saw
Holyfield a winner. But IBF president Bob Lee continued to back
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a good official,'' Lee said. ``I had no reason not to
support her. She saw what she saw. She's earned her wings. People
are dumping on her, but look at the Englishman's card.''
</P>
<P>
   British judge Larry O'Connell scored the fight a draw, and both
Moretti and HBO Sports president Seth Abraham said they had Lewis
winning only 7-5 in rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd for me to defend (promoter) Don King, but Eugenia
Williams is not his baggage,'' Abraham said. ``She's the IBF's
baggage. Frankly, I had the fight 7-5 myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging a fight is subjective. In a big fight, the tenser
things get, the more extra subjective it can become. We can all
make a list of decisions that were abysmal. Although I believe
Lennox won, I wouldn't put this decision in that category.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer, the New York
Athletic Commission, and the state's Senate Committee on
Investigations each announced that they had begun investigations
into Saturday's fight, according to the Associated Press.

MOVE TO TRY JUVENILES AS ADULTS UNDER SCRUTINY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The criminal case against 15-year-old Anthony
Laster was clear-cut in the eyes of Florida prosecutors: He
demanded lunch money from a schoolmate in a threatening manner and
took $2 out of the schoolmate's pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The youth, who is mentally retarded, was charged as an adult
with strong-arm robbery, battery and extortion. He was locked up
for nearly two months _ one month spent in an adult jail. Last
week, prosecutors in Palm Beach County dropped the charges after
the schoolmate testified that he was not threatened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't an isolated case,'' said Marsha Levick of the
Juvenile Law Center, a children's legal rights organization in
Philadelphia. ``That prosecutors could do this without a judge
reviewing it . . . is enough for us to be concerned about the kinds
of abuses prosecutors can commit when they have discretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Juvenile justice advocates are pointing to this Florida case as
a cautionary tale of what can happen when prosecutors have the
power to charge and try minors as adults for serious offenses
without having a judge review the case. Florida is the only state
that gives such broad powers to prosecutors, but the idea is
gaining ground in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is considering a bill that would overhaul the
juvenile justice system, including a measure that would allow
prosecutors to try minors 14 and older as adults without the right
to appeal the decision to a judge. The House Judiciary Committee is
conducting hearings on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The White House approves of granting federal prosecutors similar
discretion, as long as juveniles have some form of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has been attacked on different fronts in and out
of Congress. Legal groups, including the National Association of
District Attorneys, have protested the bill's federal reach into
state jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   And youth advocates say that even though the federal courts
handle only a small number of juvenile cases, they fear the
legislation could become a standard used by states.
</P>
<P>
   These advocates also say putting more youths into the adult
system means they could be exposed to violent adult behavior while
losing out on counseling and other rehabilitation services provided
through the juvenile court system.
</P>
<P>
   Laster was not physically harmed during his time in the county
jail. But community groups criticized Barry E. Krischer, the Palm
Beach County state attorney, for misusing the Florida law.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Edmondson, a spokesman for Krischer, said Florida law
requires that juveniles be sent directly into adult court for
certain felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't pick and choose charges,'' said Edmondson. ``A crime
had been committed, and you don't select who you are going to apply
the law to.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Krischer's court filing, the charges were dropped
after Laster's schoolmate said in a deposition that he was not
threatened, making ``further prosecution of the robbery charge no
longer viable.''
</P>
<P>
   Edmondson added that the state attorney is ``very aggressive
with juveniles,'' and he believes the only way to lower crime is to
send juveniles a ``wake-up call'' by sending them to adult court.
``He wants to scare them straight,'' Edmondson said.
</P>
<P>
   But children's advocates say the state had no business charging
Laster, who has an IQ of 58, with a felony and as an adult and
sending him to jail for taking $2 in lunch money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like hitting an ant with a hatchet,'' said Levick of the
Juvenile Law Center. ``It is even more troublesome in 1999, a time
when juvenile crime has been declining for the past six years, to
suggest that we need to try more kids in adult courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that expanding the power of federal prosecutors to
easily charge juveniles as adults could undermine public safety, as
well as the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the evidence shows you are going in the wrong direction
and will in fact increase, not decrease, crime,'' said
Representative Robert C. Scott, a Virginia Democrat on the House
Judiciary Committee. ``When people say kids should get adult time
for an adult crime, they don't realize they have been misled.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said minors tried in adult court often do not receive
sentences as long as they might receive in juvenile court,
particularly for nonviolent offenses. As an example, Scott said a
first-time adult offender in Virginia convicted of burglary
typically receives a suspended sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guarantees that juveniles won't be punished, or they will
be punished for a short amount of time in an adult jail, where they
can count among their associates and role models armed robbers,
drug dealers, rapists and murderers,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the Justice Policy Institute, a Washington
legal research and education organization, said: ``Studies about
juveniles prosecuted as adults consistently report that those
juveniles have higher reoffense rates, more serious reoffenses, and
reoffend sooner upon release from confinement'' than those
prosecuted in juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Schiraldi, director of the institute, said other studies
show juveniles in adult facilities also are more likely to be
physically and sexually abused.
</P>
<P>
   But Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah and chairman of
the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he believes ``our juvenile
crime problem has taken a new and sinister direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, speaking on the Senate floor last month while introducing
the juvenile crime bill, noted that minors commit 21 percent of all
violent crimes and said the number of murder cases involving
15-year-olds increased 207 percent between 1985 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our intent to ensure that when there is a federal crime
warranting the federal prosecution of a juvenile, the federal
government assumes its responsibility to deal with it, rather than
saddling the states with that burden,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department spokesman Brian Steel said, ``The White House
favors shifting the responsibility from the judges to the
prosecutors to decide whether or not a juvenile should be tried in
adult court.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Association of District Attorneys does not support the
bill because it involves the federal government in state affairs,
Gary Walker, cochairman of the association's juvenile justice
committee, said, ``It is necessary to be able to directly file
juvenile cases to adult court to provide for the safety of the
public. It gives you the ability to incarcerate and remove from
society those people who are exceptionally dangerous for a longer
period of time.''

IMPORTANCE OF FACING CLIPPERS NOT LOST ON CELTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- They know it, they think it, and maybe they even
whisper it among themselves. But they never would speak publicly
about what they know. Especially not now. Why? They just can't.
</P>
<P>
   That is the advantage you have over the Celtics. You can see a
bad basketball team and say, ``That team is terrible.'' The
Celtics? Their candor is blunted by extreme diplomacy. So they look
at a team with a 1-19 record and say something like, ``Those guys
have a lot of talent. They have Maurice Taylor, Rodney Rogers and
Lorenzen Wright. If you're not careful, that team can beat you . .
. ''
</P>
<P>
   But Rick Pitino and his Celtics know the truth, even if we don't
have the opportunity to print or broadcast their uncensored words.
And the truth is that they cannot lose to the Los Angeles Clippers
wednesday night at the FleetCenter. Never mind that the Clippers
beat the Kings and the Celtics didn't. Never mind that the Clippers
have won more recently than the Celtics, who have a five-game
losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   They cannot lose to Chris Ford's team. Not at home. If a home
loss to the Lakers extends your losing streak to six, that's
acceptable. But the Clippers are 0-9 on the road. This is the team
that lost its first 17 games, a mark that ties the worst start in
league history. This is also the team that still would not have a
winning record if it won its next 17. Lose to a team like that at
home and you'll never forget it. Just in case you do, your fans
will remind you forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's our record at home?'' Kenny Anderson asked after the
Celtics lost to the Pacers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He was told 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   ``And what's our record on the road?''
</P>
<P>
   He was told 3-10.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics point guard thought about those numbers for a while
and came to a conclusion: ``We've got to take care of the crib,
man. We've got to take care of our home court. We can't lose too
many more games at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson knew what team was next on the schedule when he made
those remarks. The Celtics haven't heard boos since Opening Night,
when they were thumped by the Raptors. They know they will hear
boos if they lose.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is Pitino. If his team were to lose, the loss
probably would end his honeymoon with Boston fans. When most fans
vent online and on radio stations, their complaints are directed at
the players. But a six-game losing streak and a defeat to the LA
junior varsity _ as the late agent Ron Grinker once called them _
would shift the focus from the players to the man who coaches them.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics had the day off Monday. You can be sure they ran
errands in Greater Boston. You also can be sure a few of them
paused for a moment and said, ``We cannot lose to the Clippers
(Wednesday).''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little bit of a strange team sometimes,'' Dana Barros
said. ``If we play a team that is perceived to be good _ a team
that is on TV a lot or something _ we'll play very well. If it's a
team that is not supposed to be real great, we'll struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Barros was asked, how do you even out your performances?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the million-dollar question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino has said that his team would have to make an
``incredible'' run simply to make the playoffs. He also has
maintained that the Celtics will be a definite playoff team in his
third season, not his second.
</P>
<P>
   But the players know that the coach takes losing hard. After the
Celtics lost to the Pistons Friday night, people outside the team's
locker room could hear the coach's raised voice. He was not happy.
A reporter approached him afterward and extended a microphone.
``Don't put that in my face,'' he snapped. And that was after a
defeat to the seminal Grant Hill and his Pistons. A loss to the
Clippers probably would cause the coach to snap the mike itself if
someone pushed it toward his noggin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter who we play, we just need a win,'' Anderson
said. And they need it Wednesday.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ John McCain is not a big guy, but he exudes a
quiet intensity that is as arresting on television as it is in
person. It starts with the eyes that bore into you, making a
connection that the Arizona senator seals with an interesting habit
of raising his eyebrows way up while he listens.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also attracts people I call ``nodders,'' folks any pol
would kill to have. Talking to a small group, you notice people
unconsciously nodding their heads while they listen to his
invariably plain talk, a classic sign of connection.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bauer is also not a big guy, but at 52 he has trouble
overcoming with his persona the accidental fact that he appears
much younger than he is. He talks very well about himself, a
necessary ability for a conservative activist not well known
outside movement circles. But he tends toward boiler plate rhetoric
on the issues, too much like a guest on a cable show and not enough
like a president.
</P>
<P>
   But he knows the game. It might not please all of the state, but
on New Hampshire's school funding challenge he goes right after his
fellow conservatives with attacks on the state supreme court's
decision requiring reform.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Bill Bradley is a very big man. His one-on-one
skills are as famous in politics as they were in basketball. But he
is far from overpowering or overbearing; in fact he comes off
smaller, often diffident, occasionally distant.
</P>
<P>
   Part of it is intellectual. He isn't ready to define himself
yet, so he is constantly labeling topics ``interesting'' and saying
of specific ideas, ``It might be something to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   The visual symbol the other evening here was his footwear,
distracting tan walking shoes more suited to a California software
designer headed out for sushi. It's as if he had the words ``Not
Yet'' stamped on his forehead.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, everyone who runs for president next year will have
to turn off Main Street here and go a few blocks into the old mill
area to the new studios of WMUR-TV, the ABC affiliate of statewide
reach, for 30 minutes of deceptively easy work.
</P>
<P>
   The New Hampshire Citizens' Forum is being sponsored in an act
of inspired corporate citizenship by Citizens Bank, part of the
scrappy New England banking group, together with WMUR.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody who hopes to be anybody will go through a short chat
with a reporter from the station, then questions from three dozen
potential voters. The resulting shows will start airing on Saturday
evenings later this month, then be distributed through the school
system.
</P>
<P>
   Between now and well into the fall, this is likely to be the
best single opportunity for each of the 11 Republicans and two
Democrats currently in the mix _ reaching something like 100,000
people in the state per broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing on television could duplicate the famous ``coffee'' of
Iowa and New Hampshire fame _ 20 to 30 people in a living room
listening to and questioning a candidate. But this is as close as
you can get.
</P>
<P>
   By design, it's introductory, personal in the proper sense of
the term, issue-oriented without edge, and therefore ideal in a
small-state campaign that is often a case of first impressions. The
upside potential for someone who connects, like Senator McCain, is
obvious.
</P>
<P>
   But so is the downside, which is why the celebrities other than
Bradley _ meaning Vice President Al Gore, Texas Governor George W.
Bush, and Elizabeth Dole _ will come here inadequately prepared at
their peril.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Bradley did poorly; it's that he failed to
impress. He told interviewer Jennifer Vaughn, ``The taste is in my
mouth,'' that his zest for the race is real. But he projected
laid-back distance, not just in appearance and manner but in
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley often talks around issues; he's better at establishing
the significance of a topic than he is at putting his stamp on it.
</P>
<P>
   A good example at his taping earlier this month was campaign
money. He gave a magnificent short course on the issue, noting that
limiting candidate spending is either going to take a
constitutional amendment or a trade-off for public fund.
</P>
<P>
   But if neither giant step is possible, he said the first step
must be a ban on the unregulated gobs of cash called soft money.
And that is the long-standing Clinton-Gore position.
</P>
<P>
   The instructive contrast is with McCain. Upfront, he
self-identified as a conservative. He said he had never voted for a
tax increase, was a proud parent of the line-item veto, and was
devoutly pro-life.
</P>
<P>
   But without prompting, he also brought up his documented
willingness to go against a majority of his party colleagues in
Congress on issues like campaign reform and smoking, arguing he has
the kind of independent spirit that people up here have on occasion
rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   And he used humor well. Asking for support and noting the fate
of Arizonans Barry Goldwater, Mo Udall, and Bruce Babbitt (all
pals, by the way), he said it wasn't fair that Arizona moms can't
tell their kids they have a chance to grow up to be president.
</P>
<P>
   These shows won't generate the traditional political headlines
or opponent-trashing controversy.
</P>
<P>
   They will, however, be the best short course on the crowded
field available until the race heats up. The sponsors should be
congratulated, and the people should watch.

20 YEARS LATER, A NEW `REVOLUTION' GRIPS IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN _ Twenty years ago, Fatimeh Jaliehpour was an 18-year-old
leader among the Islamic student revolutionaries who stormed the
American Embassy here and took 52 Americans hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Now a 38-year-old mother of four, Jaliehpour has emerged as a
leader of what she calls Iran's ``second revolution'' for an
Islamic brand of democracy and pluralism, winning a seat on the
powerful Tehran City Council in the republic's first municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after the revolution that toppled the
American-backed Shah, Iran is again writhing with change. Not only
have the recent elections been the nation's boldest experiment with
decentralized democracy to date, but its reformist president last
week moved to break Iran's two decades of diplomatic isolation with
an official visit to Italy and the Pope.
</P>
<P>
   And though the shifting tides of history may make it seem that
Jaliehpour has changed course, she says her views and her values
have been constant. In many ways, her history illustrates the
unfulfilled dreams and yearnings for democracy over the last two
decades in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Jaliehpour has always believed in democracy, she says, but only
within the context of Islam. She says she believed in democracy
when she charged into the American Embassy in 1979 and the United
States branded her a terrorist. And she says she believes in
democracy today as she fights for democratic reform and the US
applauds what she represents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so much work to do here to make our dreams for this
country and for our children come true,'' she said, adjusting her
chadour, the traditional black head covering that is mandatory
under Iran's strict religious laws. ``But we must determine our own
path and not be steered by anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes she now seeks are embodied in President Mohammad
Khatami, whose trip to Europe last week was the first by an Iranian
president since the 1979 revolution. But even as Khatami attempts
to open up what he calls a ``civil society,'' he is
constitutionally subservient to the clerical hierarchy headed by
Ayatollah Sayed Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   The conservative clerical leadership is resisting the push for
democratic reforms in this nation of 65 million people, and the
battle for the future of Iran remains uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   However that future unfolds, Fatimeh Jaliehpour and her family
seem destined to play a role, just as they helped shape the
country's recent history.
</P>
<P>
   The values that have guided Jaliehpour throughout are those of
her parents, who were themselves traditional and very religious,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The family patriarch, Mohammed Jaliehpour, was a rice merchant
in Tehran's bazaar, the open market that has been a center of city
life since at least the days of the Silk Road, the fabled trade
route that linked east Asia to the Mediterranean. It is a place
where the smells of spices, fresh produce, and strong coffee fill
the air even today.
</P>
<P>
   From the elder Jaliehpour and his wife, Hajeh, the six children
learned contempt for what they saw as the West's secular and
promiscuous culture, which was so eagerly embraced by the shah.
</P>
<P>
   After the shah gained power in a CIA-backed coup that toppled an
elected nationalist president, Mohammed Jaliehpour kept a small
black-and-white photo of the Ayatollah Khomeini hidden in a wooden
box. He knew, and the children knew, that the shah's secret police
arrested anyone who publicly displayed the image of Khomeini, who
in February 1979 would return from exile as the spiritual leader of
Iran's revolution and the Islamic Republic that grew from it.
</P>
<P>
   The family faithfully attended Friday prayers at the Ayatollah
Saiidi Mosque. Although the shah had crushed more secular
opponents, especially the communists, there was little he could do
to suppress the message in the mosques. It was there that they
first heard anyone voice opposition to the shah.
</P>
<P>
   But when the shah's government offered free higher education to
all in an attempt to co-opt the growing discontent, the
Jaliehpours, like many working-class families, took advantage. Soon
five of their children were on their way to university.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, the tide turned, and Fatimeh, then 18, and her brother
Hamed, then 20, were swept up in the student protests. That
February, the shah fled, and by the next November she was one of
the five youths who led the taking of the US Embassy after
President Jimmy Carter admitted the exiled shah to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, the grainy television images of that day _
students storming the embassy's steel gates and blindfolded
Americans paraded before cheering crowds _ remain a symbol of the
frightening power of Iran's Islamic revolution. And Iran's
subsequent history of exporting its revolution has kept the nation
under strict international sanctions, isolated as a ``rogue
state.''

<P>
   Yet Fatimeh Jaliehpour remembers Nov. 4, 1979, from a very
different perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was tear gas in my eyes. And I remember using my chadour
to shield against the smoke,'' she said. ``It was exciting, and we
felt we were willing to risk our lives to fight for our country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to know why America would harbor a criminal,''
Jaliehpour said, referring to the shah. ``It was protest, then it
became a hostage crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   To Jaliehpour and many of the students who took part, it is
still puzzling how the embassy protest turned into a hostage-taking
that lasted 444 days. The students thought the Americans would be
held for only two days. But it became a powerful political tool
that was co-opted by Khomeini's circle to consolidate its power.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the ironies of modern Iran that many of those
student protesters are among those now trying to loosen the
political hold the religious hierarchy gained from the hostages the
students took.

MY SON, THE RACER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN VENNOCHI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This time, ski as fast as I do. I want you to see what it
feels like.''
</P>
<P>
   With that challenge, he was off. The snow sparkled off the
mountainside, the brightness swallowing up his sandy-colored head.
Thank goodness for his Chicago Bulls jacket. The silly oversized
black and red coat stood out against the whiteness, keeping him in
focus a hundred yards down the trail.
</P>
<P>
   This was no expert skier. This was just a typically reckless,
just-turned-10-year-old boy, thrilling to everything his mother
fears: body-hurtling speed, sharp turns, and hard falls, especially
in public places.
</P>
<P>
   We were celebrating his breakthrough into double digits with a
midweek ski adventure, an escape from work and school encouraged by
the month's surge of almost-spring snowstorms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom's a nice, easy skier, right?'' the ski rental guy asked
with polite contempt and depressing accuracy. Hearing no protest,
he handed over a pair of short, balloon-tipped skis, all the rage
for aging baby boomers who never mastered the art of swift edging
on steep slopes.
</P>
<P>
   But for some reason, Mom didn't feel like skiing as nice and
easy as usual. How could she, when her companion was taking so much
delight in doing the opposite?
</P>
<P>
   Her carefully carved turns guaranteed she would never go fast
enough to lose control.
</P>
<P>
   But they also meant she would never feel the furious rush of
frigid air that he did when he bolted forward, caring nothing about
form and everything about fun.
</P>
<P>
   At first, he jumped over ridges and she skied around them. But
then, she planted her poles, dug in, and lifted up. She was just
the merest fraction off the ground, but, waiting below, he saw the
gap between earth and skis and grinned a thumb's up.
</P>
<P>
   When he tucked along narrow, relatively flat passages, so did
she _ no more cautious snowplow, designed to hedge off disasters
like awkward, face-losing skids off icy patches. The knees creaked
a little on the way down, but the crouch felt good. Getting up felt
even better.
</P>
<P>
   When he bombed down the final stretch to the bottom, landing in
a ridiculous heap in front of the base lodge, she fought back the
impulse to tell him to get back up and act his age. After all, he
was doing just that. Instead, she headed to the lift line and
waited for him to gather himself and his goggles together to take
another run.
</P>
<P>
   No one, not even a mother, should over-romanticize a quick trip
up Interstate 93. But there was something very special about this
moment, stolen from our regular routine.
</P>
<P>
   Parenting so often means managing a schedule of chores and
assignments. It's time to read. Time to practice piano. Time to
play soccer. Have you finished your homework? Brushed your teeth?
Grabbed your lunch money?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's the constant limit-setting. No more Nintendo.
No more fighting with your sister. No more flip answers,
eye-rolling looks of disgust, or embarrassing noises designed to
imitate bodily functions. No more chips or Coke.
</P>
<P>
   In everyday life, getting too loud or wild is never welcome. It
starts a chain reaction that affects siblings, spouses, and pets,
never in a positive way. It intrudes on obligations. It ends with
arguments, time-outs and the worst threat of all: no sleep-overs.
</P>
<P>
   But on the mountain, getting slightly but not unsafely out of
control is acceptable. Let's get chili nachos for brunch and forget
about the calories. Let's hop into the outdoor hot tub even though
the air is so cold, your hair nearly freezes on the way in and out.
</P>
<P>
   There is also time for conversation beyond the ``did you?'' and
the ``don'ts!''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the ski lift attendant looks a little like the actor in
``Free Willy.'' No, it's not always disgusting to kiss someone in a
hot tub, although doing it in front of strangers as avidly as the
teenagers across from us are doing it is not highly recommended by
mothers. Of course, your test score on the upcoming MCAS will not
define you for the rest of your life; but doing your absolute best
on this newest form of fourth-grade torture is the preferred
option.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, it is OK to ski and live harder and faster than
your mother.
</P>
<P>
   But please, Nicholas. Don't go too fast, too soon. I am far from
ready to let you out of my sight. And already, I am having trouble
keeping up.
</P>

   Good advice no doubt, yet getting intimate on the veranda rates
only number eight in a Porthole Web site survey of the best places
on a ship to . . . well, you know. Here, in order, are the top 10:
in the cabin, by the pool, in a lifeboat, at the disco, in the
casino, in a hot tub, by the smokestack, on that veranda, in the
spa/gym, and in the galley.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're merely talking romance, here, in order, is
Porthole's list of the top 10 romantic activities on board:
strolling in the moonlight, kissing, dancing, sharing a romantic
dinner, stargazing, watching the sunset, drinking champagne, giving
each other a massage, having breakfast in bed, and indulging in
aphrodisiacs.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're looking for love, look in all the right places.
The magazine says that if you want to meet people in their 40s and
up, consider a more upscale line like Holland America or Crystal
Cruises. Meanwhile, moderately-priced lines with shorter
itineraries, such as Carnival or Norwegian, are more likely to
attract people in their 20s and 30s.

 &QL; 
And speaking of romance: Couples aboard Celebrity ships report
enjoying AquaSpa treatments called Rasul (on the Century, Galaxy,
and Mercury) and Seraglio Bath (on the Horizon). The treatments
start with a seaweed-soap shower, followed by the application of
medicinal muds to each other's bodies, followed by an herbal
steambath, followed by . . . who knows? &QL;

Travel Trivia: Which two lakes does the Niagara River connect?
(Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: ``Nausea'' is derived from the Greek word for ``ship.''
But that was long ago. Today's sailings can be smooth indeed. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``You never enjoy the world aright till the sea itself
floweth in your veins.'' _ Thomas Traherne. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Cruise-ship joke: ``As you leave the ship for the final time,
you'll see two boxes. One is marked ``Towels'' and the other is
marked ``Ashtrays.'' _ Keith Cox, cruise director of the Grand
Princess. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Virtual cruisegoing: Phil Beach, editor of the popular Shipboard
Cruiser newsletter, has set up a Web site that can link you to
cruise lines, itineraries, ports, and even airports. Visit
www.shipboardcruiser.com. Meanwhile, www.cruise-news.com is an
Internet newsletter about ships 'n' such. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Burning to travel: The Queen Elizabeth II moves just 6 inches for
each gallon of diesel it burns. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to go: If you love cruisegoing, you might consider a
repositioning cruise, in which the ship moves from one geographical
area to another for the season. ``The itineraries usually call for
more days at sea than a typical cruise, so passengers have more
leisure time,'' says James G. Godsman, president of Cruise Lines
International Association. ``The cruise lines also use this
occasion to schedule extensive onboard programs, special
entertainment, and theme cruises.'' This spring, at least 12 major
lines will be sailing across the Atlantic to reposition in Europe.
Others will have ships transiting the Panama Canal before heading
for other waters. And a couple plan not-to-be repeated routes. For
more information, see a CLIA-affiliated travel agent or visit
www.cruising.org. For a copy of CLIA's 1999 Cruise Vacation
Planner, a 68-page guide, visit the Web site or call 888-Y-CRUISE
(888-927-8473). &QL; 
 &QL; 
Advice to (not) go: If a woman is seven or more months pregnant,
many cruise lines will recommend that she not sail, lest she give
birth at sea. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Opera afloat: The Sydney Opera House is one of the world's most
distinctive buildings, so it's fitting that a distinctive
Australian dinner ship features opera on selected evenings. The new
MV Sydney 2000, which proclaims itself the world's biggest and most
beautiful floating restaurant, conducts sails with four-course
dinners accompanied by a program of the world's most popular arias
performed live by principal Australian opera singers. And the ship,
which departs from historic Circular Quay, also provides
magnificent views of the opera house from the sea. The cost is
about $60 US. For more information on this or other sailings, call
888-292-2775 or visit www.captcookcrus.com.au. For information
about Australia cruises, flights, lodging, and tour packages, call
800-633-3404. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Taking no chances: The Grand Princess cruise ship has 23,000 rolls
of toilet paper aboard. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? The Niagara River connects Lake Erie and Lake
Ontario. &QL;

EXPLORING THE WONDERS OF THE GALAPAGOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI DOTEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALAPAGOS ISLANDS, Ecuador _ It's a strange place _ this
archipelago 570 miles off the coast of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Cormorants don't fly, they swim. Mockingbirds fly, but don't
mock. Penguins sit on black volcanic rock, not ice. Iguanas glide
with great ease in the sea. And sea lions sunbathe alongside
members of the island's only transient species _ homo sapiens.
</P>
<P>
   Fear doesn't exist here. The harmonious coexistence among the
animals, unknown in the rest of the world, began centuries ago when
the islands' inhabitants found themselves marooned here and without
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Until, that is, the arrival of man.
</P>
<P>
   His introduction of goats, pigs, rats, and donkeys upset the
islands' delicate ecological balance. And although the islands were
declared a national park in 1959 and various programs have helped
contain the goat and donkey population, many naturalists believe
the only way to restore and preserve the ecology of the archipelago
is to ban tourism entirely.
</P>
<P>
   So this archipelago is a fitting place for the
turn-of-the-century traveler. Not only because it may be off-limits
in the near future but because it's a millennium-esque type of
place _ dark, stark, mysterious, and otherworldly. Early navigators
called the islands ``Las Encantadas'' or the ``bewitched ones''
because they appeared and then quickly vanished within swirling
mists and cloud formations. Yet this bleak landscape can also be
set afire with dazzling sunrises and sunsets.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent five-day/four night excursion (there are weeklong
cruises as well) aboard the luxurious ship Explorer II, the 90
passengers, predominantly American, all took advantage of the daily
hikes, snorkeling, and sunbathing plus the on-board buffets,
four-course dinners, and free drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Two islands are visited daily, with the ship traveling the
longest distances at night. The Galapagos is made up of 13 large
and six smaller islands and 42 islets stretching over 30,000 square
miles of ocean. Humans inhabit four of these islands. The rest
remain relatively unchanged since their accidental discovery by a
Spanish bishop in 1535 who noted in his journal: ``found nothing
but seals and tortoises, and such big tortoises that each could
carry a man on top of itself'' and birds ``so silly that they do
not know to flee.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred years later, Charles Darwin spent 35 days here and
used the islands' animals as the basis for his 1859 book on
evolution, ``The Origin of Species.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the islands draw 45,000 visitors annually.
</P>
<P>
   All guides working aboard the Explorer II speak English and have
trained at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz, the
area's second-largest island. They lead groups of 12 to 15
passengers onto the islands where they act as island police. They
keep visitors from wandering freely, leaving or taking anything or
touching the animals. The latter is perhaps the most difficult for
visitors since baby sea lions waddle over and look up at island
guests with huge, imploring brown eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The daily routine is camplike: 6:45 a.m.: wake-up call; 7:15
a.m.: buffet breakfast; 8 a.m.: Groups gather in the lounge and
prepare to disembark in ``pangas,'' small motor boats, for the
morning's hike. At noon, a buffet lunch is served onboard around
the pool, and then another journey to another island begins at 3
p.m. Dinner is served at 7:30 followed by a briefing on the next
day's activities.
</P>
<P>
   One warning _ cruising the Galapagos is not like cruising the
Caribbean or Greek Isles. Although the Explorer is luxurious, with
gleaming wood paneling, wall-to-wall carpeting, and marble baths in
the staterooms, it is more a means of transportation than an entity
unto itself. Passengers must be agile enough to get in and out of
the pangas, climb to the summit of Pinnacle Rock on Bartolome
Island (a steep stairway of 370 steps), and walk across rugged lava
terrain. Also, elementary school children can become bored on the
hikes _ this is not an action trip or a Disney World but an
educational natural zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Composed entirely of basalt, the islands are the tips of
gigantic volcanoes poking up some 30,000 feet from the ocean floor.
The earliest islands are believed to have formed 4- to 5 million
years ago with Fernandina and Isabela relative youngsters at 1
million years old. Some of the islands are still active (Isabela
erupted last fall) and were never connected to the mainland.
Therefore, all living things had to cross hundreds of miles of
water.
</P>
<P>
   This explains the predominance of sea birds, mammals, and
reptiles, which, it is thought, floated to the islands on organic
debris. Seeds and insects arrived either stuck to the wings of
birds or in the contents of animal stomachs. To survive, the
animals had to adapt to their new environment.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the iguanas grew long tails for swimming, fed on algae,
and developed glands to expel the salt from ingested sea water. The
flightless cormorants became good fishermen. And Darwin's finches
either grew thick beaks for splitting seeds or long thin bills for
catching insects, depending on the particular island on which they
took up residence. It is believed that the 13 species on the
islands came from one original species.
</P>
<P>
   Adding color to these parts are the pink flamingoes, frigate
birds with their boastful red chests, blue-footed boobies who strut
their stuff during elaborate mating rituals, and the highly
polished, red-orange Sally Lightfoot crabs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the islands are virtual deserts, while others are more
lush with large mangrove forests.
</P>
<P>
   Bartolome Island is lunarlike, with brackish-colored lava dried
into huge mud cakes, deep craters, and the honeycombed Pinnacle
Rock _ perhaps the best viewing stage in the islands. But there's
also plant life here in the soil-less crevices _ hardy lava cactus
with long spiny fingers.
</P>
<P>
   On James Island, abandoned shacks and water tanks are testimony
to man's effort to start a salt business. It failed. Other signs of
man's presence exist in Tagus Cove where graffiti was carved on
rocks by pirates and buccaneers who roamed these parts in search of
fresh water and tortoise meat.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandina Island, a flat island with black lava covered with
emerald algae, has many lava pools where female sea lions watch
their young practice their swimming prowess while huge bulls fend
off intruders with loud barking. Cormorants dry their stubby wings
in the sun while hawks sit motionless on leafless branches.
Visitors must walk gingerly here to avoid stepping on the hundreds
of iguanas piled on top of one another as they take in the
afternoon sun _ warming their bodies for the cool nights.
</P>
<P>
   Rabida Island, with its dark red beaches (due to high iron oxide
content), is the best place to photograph, sunbathe, and swim with
sea lions.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Galapagos'' is Spanish for giant land tortoise, these
creatures are in short supply today. Thousands were killed for
their meat by whalers during the 18th and 19th centuries. The only
tortoises seen on our trip were those being bred at the Charles
Darwin Research Center on Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   One of the tortoises, the 185-pound George from the island of
Pinta, is the last of his species. He shares his large bachelor pad
with two females brought in for romance. So far, George prefers his
own company, living up to his nickname, Lonesome George.
</P>
<P>
   As for weather, the Galapagos are an all-year destination with
two seasons. The hot or wet season lasts from January to early May
with an average temperature of 82 degrees (we encountered only one
rainstorm). The cool or dry season is from May to December, when
the average temperature is 64. Although the islands straddle the
equator, the days are comfortable and the evenings are cool.
</P>
<P>
   And a trip to the islands should also include a visit to the
mainland. Ecuador is a stunningly rugged, beautiful, and varied
country with the Andes running up its spine. Quito, the highest
capital in the world, is well worth a visit. Then go south along
the Avenue of the Volcanos to Banos and stay at the Swiss-managed
hotel, Luna Runtun, high up in the mountains overlooking the city.
Or go north from Quito and stay at one of the comfortable haciendas
and shop at the famous Otavalo market. Further north is Cotacachi _
a small town lined with leather shops. The two yellow Pompeii shops
have the highest quality goods.

<HEADLINE>
A BIG VOTE OF CONFIDENCE IN THE CRUISE MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America is getting into cruising in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans are already into cruising, you say. So what's the
deal?
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, American Classic Voyages, the company that runs
American-Hawaii Cruises and the Delta Queen Steamboat Co., has just
placed orders for two of the largest ships ever built in America.
Yes, America. There hasn't been a large cruise ship built in this
country in 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   This is pure confidence in a growing market for cruise
vacations. The high cost to build and operate an American-flagged
vessel is cited as the main reason no one has undertaken a project
this big. As it is, American Hawaii presently operates the largest
American-flagged cruise ship _ the Independence (20,221 tons,
682-feet-long, 1,021 passengers), built in Quincy in 1951 for
transatlantic voyages.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising, simply put, is getting bigger in vacation plans with
each year. Later this year Carnival Cruises will introduce the
Triumph, a slightly larger version of the Carnival Destiny, which
only two years ago ruled the seas as the largest cruise ship at
100,000 tons. Since then, Princess came along with the Grand
Princess at 109,000 tons, and this fall, Royal Caribbean will top
them all with the Voyager of the Seas at 138,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this growth are simple. Cruises offer one of the
most relaxing ways to travel, provide good value for the travel
dollar, appeal to all ages, and can provide vacation experiences to
suit most travelers.
</P>
<P>
   While cruises are relaxing, these vacations are not just for the
sedate. Cruising is also for the active with many vessels offering
lavish spas and fitness centers; others are designed for adventure
cruising, and all can offer active land tours in port. Simply put,
cruise travelers can be as active as they want, relax when they
want.
</P>
<P>
   Last week American Classic Voyages Co. signed an agreement with
Litton Industries' Ingalls Shipbuilding for a Project America
contract that calls for the building of the largest US cruises
ships ever built. . Ingalls initially will build two 1,900
passenger US flag cruise ships at its Pascagoula, Miss., shipyard
for service in the Hawaiian Islands. There is an option for a third
vessel. The base price for the first two vessels is $880 million
with the first vessel set to enter service in early 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Ingalls built the last American-built large cruise ships, the
Brasil and the Argentina, for Moore McCormack Lines in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal at American Classic is to provide passengers a great
Hawaiian vacation experience aboard modern US-owned, US-built, and
US-crewed cruise ships,'' said Phil Calian, president of American
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Calian said the first two ships will be about 72,000 gross tons
and 840 feet long (by comparison, the United States launched in
1952 was 50,924 tons), with a design that blends the best of Hawaii
with the modern luxuries of cruising. Of the ship's 950 cabins, 77
percent will be ``outside'' (64 percent of which will have private
balconies). Calian added the ships will be designed to maximize the
sense of spaciousness on board and provide panoramic views of the
Hawaiian Islands and the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Giving a boost to the project was Congress' passage of the
US-Flag Cruise Ship Project Statute in 1997 with the goal of
revitalizing the US-flag oceangoing cruise ship fleet. Senator
Trent Lott of Mississippi said the project also should lower
overhead costs of building military ships. Interestingly, the
Independence was built with two engine rooms, so that if it were
called into military service it could operate should one engine go
down.
</P>
<P>
   American Classic isn't just building megaliners, it also
announced last year its Delta Queen Steamboat Co. will build a new
line of five small coastal cruise ships that will operate along
America's Eastern Seaboard, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern
California. The first of these $35 million, 300-foot, 226-passenger
vessels is scheduled to be launched in spring of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The confidence in the growth potential of the cruise market is
``tremendous'' according to Micky Arison, chairman of Carnival
Corp. And, when Arison says tremendous, he backs it up with
investments of billions of dollars in new ship construction.
Carnival is now the largest cruise company in the world, owning not
only Carnival Cruises but also Holland America, Windstar, Cunard,
and a major share of Costa Cruises.
</P>
<P>
   This summer Carnival's second 100,000-ton plus ship, the
Carnival Triumph will debut with a series of four- and five-day
cruises from New York to Canadian ports of Saint John in New
Brunswick and Halifax in Nova Scotia. The cruises will operate July
19 through Oct. 11.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, the world's largest cruise ship debuts. Royal
Caribbean International's Voyage of the Seas. The Voyager will sail
the Caribbean from Miami and will offer many new innovations in
cruising including Promenade View staterooms that overlook the
interior ``boulevard of shops and restaurants.'' Royal Caribbean's
trademark Viking Crown lounges that sit atop their vessels, will
have a new touch on the Voyager, a wedding chapel atop the lounge.
The ship also will have an indoor ice-skating rink, rock-climbing
walls and an in-line skating track _ who said cruising was for the
sedate?
</P>
<P>
   Princess Cruises just introduced its Sea Princess, one of its
Grand Class of 77,000-ton vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Holland America will introduce two 65,000-ton vessels this year
_ the Volendam in August and the Zaandam in November. The Volendam
will offer a series of cruises from New York through eastern
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Even Disney is into the cruise business. Its Magic is currently
sailing on three- and four-day sails to the Bahamas and Disney's
fantastic private isle. These cruise vacations also include a
three- or four-day stay at Disney World. The line's second ship,
the Wonder is scheduled to enter service this year.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian Cruise Line will have the maiden voyage of its
76,000-ton Norwegian Sky in August.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller vessels are also in: Radisson Seven Seas Cruises will
offer the Seven Seas Navigator, a 30,000-ton vessel, this August;
Mediterranean Shipping Cruises launches the 47,900 ton Mistral in
June (the line boasts it will be the most beautiful ship of the
decade), and Star Clippers will introduce its largest sailing
vessel, the Royal Clipper in November.
</P>
<P>
   And, that's just the list of new ships coming on line this year.
Even more are now under construction in European shipyards for
delivery beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   Also new this year will be some major changes at Cunard. Cunard,
now owned by Carnival, will see a major updating of the Queen
Elizabeth 2, the renaming of the Vistafjord as the Coronia. The new
Cunard company will also operate Seabourn Cruises and is rebranding
the Sea Goddess I and the Royal Viking Sun as the Seabourn Goddess
and the Seabourn Sun. ``We are rebuilding the Golden Age of sea
travel for those who missed it the first time around,'' said Larry
Pimentel, president of Cunard. For this, Cunard is reintroducing
much of the transatlantic service it offered in the golden days of
ship travel with service between Southampton and New York and
European ports and Boston and Miami.

SMALL BANKS AWAIT THEIR SLICE OF THE ACQUISITION PIE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The big banks weren't talking Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Major national players such as First Union Corp. and KeyCorp and
BankAmerica Corp. had no comment when asked whether they might be
interested in bidding for the banking business that will be sold
off when Fleet Financial Group and BankBoston Corp. get together.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a matter of policy we never speak about our acquisition
plans,'' said a spokesman for KeyCorp, an $80 billion bank based in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But smaller local banks were more than happy to talk Monday. And
a number of them were positively gushing about the prospect of
getting a chance to acquire some of the $13 billion in deposits
that will have to be divested to meet antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Deposits, branches, and loans probably will be sold around
Boston, Hartford, and Providence, places where the two banks
overlap the most. Fleet will have a say in who gets the prizes, but
federal regulators will have a big say in the matter as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some real competition for these deposits because
a lot of people will view this as a one-shot opportunity,'' said
William Ryan, chief executive at Peoples Heritage Financial Group
in Portland, Maine. Ryan said his $10 billion bank would be very
interested in anything that came up for sale in Massachusetts or
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   At USTrust in Boston, chief executive Neal Finnegan was already
plotting his strategy. By Monday morning he was on the phone with
his investment banker wondering how he might raise the money he
would need to put in a bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a responsibility to our shareholders to look at this
as an opportunity to build a more valuable franchise,'' said
Finnegan.
</P>
<P>
   Finnegan's $6.5 billion bank got a lot bigger in 1996 when it
bought a series of branches that came up for sale when BankBoston
bought BayBanks. Finnegan clearly would love to be able to pick up
some crumbs a second time.
</P>
<P>
   Who else might be interested? Eastern Bank for one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready, willing, and able,'' said Mark Primeau, the
bank's executive vice president. Eastern, based in Lynn, is a $2.7
billion bank that has grown rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens Financial Group also has to be added to the list. The
Providence bank was a bit circumspect Monday, saying only it would
take a look at whatever came up for sale. But given its past
appetite for acquisitions, Citizens is likely to take a bite at the
apple. At $18 billion, Citizens is currently the third-largest bank
in New England, soon to be the second-largest. The new
Fleet-BankBoston combination will have $178 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   For some people, that gaping disparity is a problem. They argue
that a series of small to medium-size banks will never pose serious
competition for a giant. Their proposed solution: bring in another
giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be aggressive in getting another major lender to
come into this market,'' said Secretary of the Commonwealth William
Galvin. Galvin's concern is the economy. He says local businesses
need at least two big banks they can go to for loans. Without that
second big player, the newly enlarged Fleet could have too much
clout here, said Galvin.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Marks agrees. The community activist, who has forced a
number of banks to make loans available to poor and working-class
citizens, says he too will be urging regulators to recruit a second
giant to come into the region. Like Galvin, Marks believes only a
major competitive threat will be able to keep Fleet in check.
</P>
<P>
   The smart money says it isn't going to happen. Bank analysts say
there is very little precedent for the sale of deposits and loans
to big competitors. The selling banks obviously don't want the
competition and regulators have not forced them to go that route.
</P>
<P>
   There's another problem with the ``two giant'' strategy. While
$13 billion may sound like a lot of money, in big-time banking
circles it amounts to chump change. For major national banks, some
of whom are closing in on $500 billion in assets, the opportunity
to pick up $13 billion in New England may not be that exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Finally there is an argument to be made that smaller banks may
be able to provide real competition for Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this consolidation has opened a window for well-run
community banks,'' said James Moynihan, an analyst with Advest in
Boston. Customers turned off by the megabanks, said Moynihan, often
prefer the service and personal touch the smaller banks can offer.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives say the small banks have been beating the
bushes recently, competing aggressively to make business loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't hear anyone complaining about the lack of credit,''
said Brian Gilmore, executive vice president at Associated
Industries of Massachusetts, a business trade group.
</P>
<P>
   It will be some time before the winner is crowned in this
competition. But don't be surprised if the victor is somebody who
already lives in the neighborhood.

MISSING THE SHIP CAN BE COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What happens if you miss the ship? It can and does happen,
sometimes for unusual reasons. And, you could lose hundreds if not
thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Generally the most common reason for missing the ship is
weather, especially for Northeastern travelers in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Most cruise lines will do their best to get you to the ship,
even if it is at the next port of call. Norwegian Cruise Lines says
it will work with passengers who have purchased an air/sea package
in the event they miss the ship for weather problems. If for some
reason they cannot sail, the line, said they have offered to apply
the costs toward a future cruise within a year.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, however, many travelers missed their sailing because
of the Allied Pilot's Association ``sick out.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to at least save the cruise is to purchase travel
insurance that provides for trip cancellation or trip interruption
insurance. But even with this insurance, you could miss the boat if
the policy doesn't cover an incident such as this.
</P>
<P>
   Those who purchased Travel Guard insurance policies were covered
because the company decided to make an exception and reimburse
policyholders for trip cancellation and trip interruption losses.
``We just thought it was the right thing to do,'' said John Noel,
Travel Guard International chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Losses caused by incidents such as the airline sick-out are
typically not covered in travel insurance policies. If it were a
strike, it would have been covered.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers booking a cruise which can cost thousands of
dollars, travel insurance that covers cancellation and other
circumstances makes good sense. However, before buying a policy, it
pays to read the fine print. Find out what is covered and what is
not.
</P>
<P>
   Travel Guard, for example, covers any unforeseen circumstances
other than those specifically excluded. Some policies cover only
specific circumstances. Some policies may cover just the cost of
the cruise, and not the air fare. Other policies may offer
graduated coverage with a full refund of the cost of the trip if it
is cancelled a month or more in advance, and only a portion
otherwise. The policy also may offer no coverage if cancelled
within 24 hours of the sail.
</P>
<P>
   Travel Guard said it has covered people who experienced a flat
tire on the way to the airport, a couple who two days before the
trip were told the baby they were seeking to adopt was suddenly
available in just a couple of days, and even a groom left at the
altar when his bride-to-be never showed up. He at least got the
cost of the honeymoon back.
</P>
<P>
   Deciding on how much insurance to take on a vacation trip
depends on how much you're willing to lose on any nonrefundable
portion of the trip. If you can't afford to lose anything, full
coverage is worthwhile. On a $3,000 cruise, Travel Guard said the
cost would be $275.
</P>
<P>

NATE PUSEY REG Q AND ALL THAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; If you think for a minute that there was anything coincidental
about the fact that it was just an hour before the traditional St.
Patrick's Day breakfast in South Boston when the news that Fleet
Financial Group would acquire BankBoston Corp. began to seep out to
the best informed, then you don't know anything about Boston.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you think that simply being Irish is going
to get you a job working for Terrence Murray in the banking
behemoth that is the new Fleet Boston Corp., then you don't know
anything about modern times.
</P>
<P>
   The picturesque developments whereby the 215-year-old bank that
was Boston's proudest old Yankee institution as recently as the
1980s soon would be absorbed into an upstart Rhode Island bank run
by an Irishman of humble origins have many antecedents.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the merger's unseen stars no doubt include Senator
Edward M. Kennedy and Representative Joe Moakley, who plumped for
it behind the scenes. Why let a gang of high-rollers from New York,
Charlotte, N.C., or San Francisco take control of New England's
biggest banks if it could be avoided?
</P>
<P>
   Yet the regulator whose say-so surely counted for more than any
other in the deal was Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin. Federal
Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan shares reponsibility for
banking oversight, but Treasury's view counts for more in the
administration's policy toward mergers.
</P>
<P>
   That means the man who, more than any other, unleashed the
social forces that led to Monday's combination is a plain
Midwestern clergyman named Nathan Pusey, who was president of
Harvard University during the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   It was Pusey who in the mid-1950s presided over the effort
ordained by its governing corporation to transform Harvard College
from a regional college _ and sometimes little more than a
finishing school for the children of the upper classes of New
England _ into an institution of national standing and scope.
</P>
<P>
   Under Pusey _ and especially under admissions director Wilbur
Bender _ the decision had been made to seek out promising
applicants nationally, from all walks of life, and to admit
students on the basis of character, not standardized tests alone.
Harvard (and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology) also
invested heavily in the sciences in those days, especially the
infant field of molecular biology.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of this opening-up of the university could scarcely
have been more far-reaching, for New England in particular. Class
restrictions continued to chafe, but putting bright kids close to
one another immediately began to erode old barriers. Social
deregulation had begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin arrived at Harvard in 1956 from New York; Murray, two
years later from Woonsocket, R.I. Neither would have made it into
the Harvard of a dozen years before, when social and economic
standing counted for more than smarts and drive. Both men lived for
a time in Winthrop House, an undergraduate dormitory, and if they
didn't know each other then, they would have become aware of each
other's existence soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Murray made his way to Industrial National Bank in Providence.
Rubin went to the London School of Economics, Yale Law School, and
then to work for the investment banking house of Goldman Sachs.
Both men rose rapidly to the top.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, the enthusiasm for deregulation had spread to
finance. Traditional barriers separating financial institutions
functionally and geographically _ the Glass-Steagall and McFadden
acts, and Regulation Q _ had begun to fall. A great financial
merger movement was under way.
</P>
<P>
   Little Industrial National was quicker out of the blocks than
venerable Bank of Boston. It was not that the Yankees didn't try.
It was simply that the smaller bank was quicker, bolder, luckier:
Murray bought Albany's Norstar Bancorp in 1987, Boston's Bank of
New England in 1991, and Shawmut National Corp. in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Monday it was BankBoston's turn, and though the ``social
arrangements'' _ as the measures designed to maintain the losers'
wealth and self-esteem are known _ were as generous as in any other
deal of similar size, there could be no doubt whatsoever as to who
had won. Hence the announcement so close to St. Patrick's Day.
Boston would remain a financial center _ Boston go bragh!

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT MYERS, Fla. _ Picked-up pieces while counting the cars on
the Florida Turnpike . . .
</P>
<P>
   --How many days before the Patriots-to-Hartford deal collapses
under the weight of greed and ego?
</P>
<P>
   --Despicable baseball story of the day comes from Vero Beach,
where Gary Sheffield says he's considering retirement. Shef has
five years left on a six-year, $61 million contract and doesn't
like the Dodgers' new dress codes and personal-grooming guidelines.
He told the Los Angeles Times, ``I'm tired of every decision always
being around me. I just want to wear my facial hair and earrings
and just play the game.'' Go home, Gary, you nitwit.
</P>
<P>
   --John Calipari no doubt someday will tell folks that he made
Stephon Marbury the player he is  &UR; today &LR; . Coach Cal, after all, did
coach Marbury for one whole game. It was clear from the start that
Caliparis boola-boola stuff wasn't going to work in the pro game.
But weep not for the fired coach. He's got a pile of dough in the
bank and will get plenty of job offers. Maybe he can clean things
up at the University of Minnesota. Maybe he can clean up our state
treasury, or put UMass back on the map. Can he steal a slogan from
the Clippers and copyright, ``Refuse to Win''?
</P>
<P>
   --If Jim Calhoun can't make the Final Four this time, then he's
truly jinxed. Top West seeds (2-3-4) Stanford, North Carolina, and
Arkansas are bounced and the Huskies have to beat Iowa and either
Florida or Gonzaga to make it to St. Pete. It's never easy, but it
could have been a lot tougher.
</P>
<P>
   --If you're feeling ripped off from Saturday night's boxing
debacle, tell it to somebody else. The sport, as known by our
fathers and grandfathers, is dead. Anyone who bets hard-earned
money or buys pay-per-view expecting legitimate competition is a
sucker. And the suckers keep coming back. The boxing game is a
quagmire of sleaze. It's WWF without the good acting. Ears are
bitten, landslides are ruled draws, and we're supposed to wait
breathlessly for the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   --Boxing judge Eugenia Williams just awarded the 1998 World
Series to the San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   --Red Sox first base hopeful Brian Daubach is from Belleville,
Ill. If you remember that Jimmy Connors also hails from Belleville,
pass Go and collect $200.
</P>
<P>
   --You say you want more positive stuff from the Boston sporting
press. So I show up and write a glowing column on the Celtics.
They've been pummeled almost daily since the column ran. That's it.
No more Mr. Nice Guy.
</P>
<P>
   --Teddy Dupay, the 5-10 reserve guard who helped Florida beat
Penn and Weber State, is the same kid Jimy Williams watched twice a
week last year as a Florida high school senior.
</P>
<P>
   --Driving on I-4 near Orlando I saw a truck advertising Dot
Richardson's softball training center.
</P>
<P>
   --The Darryl Strawberry situation could get testy. George
Steinbrenner renewed Darryl's contract but doesn't want to pay the
$850,000 in luxury tax he'll face if Straw is on the Opening Day
roster. Straw wants to be in the majors, but the Yankees have three
left fielders and a DH (Chili Davis) ahead of him. Stay tuned.
</P>
<P>
   --Seen ``Affliction''? The murder suspect/deer hunter says he
was as good a pitcher as Roger Clemens.
</P>

   HAITI-EXODUS _ SAINT MARC, Haiti _ In the teeming, dust-caked
villages and dirt poor farms outside the capital city of
Port-Au-Prince, the sun-parched country people of Haiti have a
saying about the United States. ``That's where the water pipe is
cold,'' they say. Mona Emile's husband believed it. Nadier
Austinville's son did too. So for ten years Emile's husband planned
and saved. Austinville sold her farm, her cow and scraped together
$3,000 for her son. Then, the neighbors kissed their wives and
mothers, said good-bye to their six children, and climbed aboard
the country's newest underground railroad to the United States.
More often than not, it is a trip that carries its passengers and
their famililes into an ocean of the unknown where they can vanish
for months, sometimes forever. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post). 50.

   JOURNAL-RUSSIA _ MOSCOW _ Since Russia's economy crashed and
burned last August, it has not been easy to find good news to
report from the capital. Perhaps now let us praise a few things
that _ well, let's be blunt here _ actually WORK WELL in Russia.
Operating in a market economy may give Russians a fit, but
operating in a blizzard is ``byez problemah'' _ without a care.
Armies of snow removal trucks deploy on the roads day and night to
clean the streets while the extensive Moscow subway system handles
millions of riders a day. And the centralized heating system works
so well that on some winter days it may be sub-zero outside while
it is shorts-and-t-shirt weather in your apartment.

   FLA-ILLEGAL-INS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The promise of jobs
fuels the business of migrant smuggling, and Florida offers a land

``Personally, I believe that, if you focused on employees and
contractors and take away all sources of employment . . . you can
literally turn your back on the borders,'' said Billy Kring, former
chief of the U.S. Border Patrol in Miami. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which oversees the Border Patrol, does just
the opposite. It focuses on border security. An illegal job market
flourishes in Florida, prompting growing numbers of migrants to
turn to smugglers. And smugglers operate in a climate of acceptable
risk: a Border Patrol in Florida that hasn't seen an increase in
manpower in 10 years, a Coast Guard patrolling a region strewn with
islands of safe havens, courts wrestling with complex immigration
law and juries sympathetic toward refugees. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)

dozen Cuban passengers aboard. The boat's captain explains that he
happened to be fishing when he spotted the Cubans struggling in a
sinking raft. Though the passengers show no signs of fatigue,
dehydration or injury, they confirm the story and insist the
captain be treated as a hero. Smuggling cases are difficult to
prosecute because often the only witness to the crime is the
smuggled human cargo. And people who spend their life savings in a
desperate bid to get into the United States make reluctant
witnesses, prosecutors say. (Kane, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

ON-LINE RETAILERS DANGLE THEIR PROFITABLE GOODS: PORN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ When these executives talk electronic commerce,
they're not discussing best-selling books and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   During the ``XXX Files'' discussion Monday at the South By
Southwest (SXSW) Interactive Conference, electronic retailers were
talking about photographs of ``mummification bondage,'' a practice
that involves the creative use of duct tape.
</P>
<P>
   SXSW offers plenty of opportunities to discuss high culture on
the Internet, but this year's conference has been dominated by the
Internet's pursuit of money _ and pornography is the one commercial
activity on the Web that does make money.
</P>
<P>
   So while some executives pondered when such retail giants as
Seattle-based Amazon.com would turn a profit, money-making
pornographers merrily chatted away to a captive audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``A 14-foot-by-14-foot garden plot'' crowded with a ``giant
handful of seeds'' was how panelist Content Love Knowles of Austin
described the Internet porn economy.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, a former brothel manager who runs Babalon.com, a Web
site that specializes in sadomasochistic content, said customers
overwhelming demand quality on-line porn. Quality, in this case,
refers to reputable companies that provide customer service rather
than just click-here-and-order credit card processors.
</P>
<P>
   Although most Internet analysts don't break out statistics on
on-line pornography purchases, Forrester Research, an Internet
market research firm in Massachusetts, estimated in February that
consumers spend about $1 billion annually to purchase naughty
pictures, videos and sex toys through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the occasional mention of unusual sex practices, the
panel of on-line pornographers spent most of their meeting
discussing the usual retailing concerns of any Internet company:
dealing with troublesome middlemen, preventing theft and
maintaining inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Christophe Pettus, founder of San Francisco-based Blowfish, one
of the first Web sites to sell sex products, said the absence of a
central warehouse for sex toys and other paraphernalia has hindered
the industry from meeting demand. Centralized distribution has been
key to keeping inventories moving at Amazon.com and other massive
Web retailing sites.
</P>
<P>
   Pettus said that kind of infrastructure ``just isn't there yet''
for the porn trade.
</P>
<P>
   George Hunt, founder of the Thursday Night Videos Web site,
which makes on-order fetish videos, raised the question of how to
handle the on-line version of shoplifting: other Web site operators
who illegally copy original explicit content onto their own sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone steals from me, I'm going to make a business deal
(out of it),'' said Knowles, who said she either threatens the
offender with a lawsuit or makes them link to her site. Panelists
agreed that the problem was widespread and perhaps plagues
pornographers more than other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists also complained that sites without sexual content have
been luring away potential customers by using explicit words in
their metatags, the keywords that a Web site gives to search
engines so they can be identified. This causes the search engines
to call up vast lists of Web sites that are not necessarily
sex-related.
</P>
<P>
   This practice, panelists agreed, threatens the on-line
pornography industry.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the meeting agreed that the next frontier in
on-line pornography is attracting women customers. Knowles
estimated that upwards of 30 percent of her customers are women.

INVESTMENT BANK FINDS ITSELF FACING NEW BOSSES ... AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Robertson Stephens, the San Francisco investment
bank that helped build the high-tech economy, has had a wild ride
of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, BankAmerica Corp. bought the company for $540
million. Then last year, BankAmerica sold Robertson Stephens for
$800 million to BankBoston Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Now Fleet Financial Group Inc. plans to acquire BankBoston for
$16 billion, creating the eighth largest bank in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet has $104 billion in assets and the Quick &AMP; Reilly discount
brokerage. BankBoston has $74 billion in assets and Robertson
Stephens, the nation's leading underwriter of initial public stock
offerings since 1995, with 282, according to Securities Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robertson Stephens has been through a fair amount,'' said
Michael Flanagan of Financial Service Analytics in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the short term, the deal spells another round of identity
crisis. But for the long term, Robertson Stephens gains great
potential for an expanded marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McCaffery, chief executive of Robertson Stephens, said
the acquisition was another big plus for his investment bank.
Profits for Robertson Stephens were up 35 percent the first year
with BankBoston, he said, and income will hit a record high for the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our business is in great shape, and we're extremely
successful,'' McCaffery said. ``This is a big positive for our
organization. We're ecstatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The marriage with Fleet's Quick &AMP; Reilly discount brokerage will
give Robertson Stephens popular retail outlets for its investment
products, including equity research and initial public offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Quick &AMP; Reilly's electronic brokerage, SureTrade,
will let Robertson Stephens jump into the electronic investment
banking field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll tap into every aspect of their retail channels,'' said
Camille Lepre, a Robertson Stephens spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The deal between the two Boston banks, announced Monday, may
save $600 million in operating costs and lead to 5,000 lost jobs.
Robertson Stephens, however, plans to hire this year, McCaffery
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson Stephens was founded in 1978 by Sanford Robertson, who
left the company last year to start his own investment outfit.
</P>
<P>
   Robertson built the company into a leading investment bank
specializing in financing for high-tech startups. Since its
founding, the company has raised $49 billion in initial public
stock offerings, or IPOs, and other financing.
</P>
<P>
   The Fleet-BankBoston deal, which must be approved by regulators
and shareholders, is expected to close late this year.

 &HT;    
 By MIKE McMANUS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Drivers caught in a snarl of freeway traffic leading into Dallas
looked up last week at that tall skyline and saw a huge new black
billboard with a few stark words in white:
 &HT;    ``Keep Using My Name In Vain, I'll Make Rush Hour Longer. GOD''
 &HT;    Those driving in from different directions saw other billboards
with equally arresting messages from the Creator:
 &HT;    ``Don't Make Me Come Down There. GOD''
 &HT;    ``What Part of `Thou Shalt Not...' Didn't You Understand? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Will the Road You Are on Get You to My Place? GOD''
 &HT;    The God Ad Campaign is being donated by local billboard
companies as a public service. There will soon be 10,000 billboards
like these all across America as billboard firms donate the space.
 &HT;    ''It is a gift to the community,'' says Nancy Fletcher,
president of the Outdoor Advertising Association of America. ''It
is a positive way to get people thinking about spirituality, and
increasing the numbers who are going to church. It makes you
believe in divine interventin!''
 &HT;    The campaign began in Broward County, Florida, in and around
Fort Lauderdale last fall. It was football season, of course. So
two of the first billboards to go up tartly said:
 &HT;    ``Let's Meet at My House Sunday Before the Game. GOD''
 &HT;    ``C'mon Over and Bring the Kids. GOD''
 &HT;    The ads were developed by The Smith Agency after an anonymous
client came in one day and told owner Andy Smith, ''I have one
goal. I need to have people start thinking about God. Things are
getting out of control. People are not obeying the rules any more.
Every day you read about murder, robbery, adultery everything that
God said, `Don't do.'
 &HT;    ''If we can get to one person before he robs a bank, to think
about God first, maybe we can stop him. If so, it will be worth
it.''
 &HT;    I tried to find out who the anonymous benefactor was even to
learn whether he was a pastor or businessman, but could learn
nothing. Oprah Winfrey offered to put the guy on her show, but he
declined: ''If people focus on me or the money I spent, they will
forget the message of the ads. Forget about me. I am looking for
nothing. The message is much more important than who I am.''
 &HT;    So let's go back to the message. This summer you may be driving
along some hot day and look up to see these billboard that ought to
get your attention:
 &HT;    ``You Think It's Hot Here? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Need a Marriage Counselor? I'm Available. GOD''
 &HT;    Some of the messages were written by the anonymous donor. They
are more gentle:
 &HT;    ``I Love You...I Love You...I Love You. GOD''
 &HT;    ``Tell the Kids That I Love Them. GOD''
 &HT;    But most were written by Charlie Robb, who describes himself as
''being in the target audience of people who used to go to church,
but who don't any more.''
 &HT;    ``I'm a former altar boy,'' he told me. To reach such people,
Scripture would not work, he says. ''We had to make the message
contemporary, slightly irreverent, reminding people that they are
dealing with the ultimate CEO.''
 &HT;    ``Need Directions? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Do You Have Any Idea Where You're Going? GOD''
 &HT;    ``Follow Me. GOD''
 &HT;    ``Have You Read My Number 1 Bestseller? There Will Be a Test. --
GOD''
 &HT;    How has the God Ad Campaign worked? The Miami Herald surveyed
churches in he area and reported that attendance rates were up.
Even Charlie has been to church a few times. A woman in Fort
Lauderdale sent an E-mail to the Smith Agency, thanking it for the
ads which are ''such a breath of fresh air.'' She said her niece
was married to a man who would never go to church with her. While
driving along, they both saw this ad:
 &HT;    ``I Loved the Wedding. Invite Me To The Marriage. GOD''
 &HT;    The man went to church with his wife for the first time the next
Sunday, and has been going ever since.
 &HT;    ``We Need To Talk. GOD''

 By JOHN VINOCUR  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Way back when Jacques Chirac didn't know Zinedine Zidane from ZZ
Top, before he scored the goals that won France the World Cup in
1998, before French kids voted him more popular than Michael Jordan
and French women called him sexier than Brad Pitt or Antonio
Banderas, before his face was painted in street murals big enough
for Stalin or Mobutu, Zinedine Zidane did something brutal and
dumb.
 &HT;    That was last June, in the second match of the World Cup,
soccer's world championship, when Zidane raked his studs across the
stomach of a fallen South African player and was suspended for the
next two games. It was not a smart thing to do, crudeness bordering
on disgrace for someone who would subsequently be voted the best
player in the world _ and whose game illuminates soccer in its
finest shadings, all virtuosity, elegance, intellect.
 &HT;    In the stands and in the streets in France, the talk descended
from ``what a shame'' to ``what did you expect?'' Zidane, they
said, the Algerian kid, the one from the worst slum in Marseille,
reacted as if he was back on the street with his homies.
 &HT;    The simple explanation, that he overreacted in a fit of stress
and frustration, dissolved in a rush of national discomfort. In the
Arab bars and cafes in St. Denis near Le Stade de France, the
stadium France had built for the 1998 World Cup, Zidane's expulsion
was all about prejudice and politics and plots.
 &HT;    In the white French working world of diminished expectations, of
train strikes and broken stamp dispensers and kids beating up bus
drivers, it was about a French team that more resembled a group
picture from the housing projects, with their Arabs and blacks.
Zidane, uh, you know, what else could you expect?
 &HT;    The French coach, Aime Jacquet, refused to look at him when he
walked off the field in disgrace. Smail and Malika Zidane's
youngest son, a 26-year-old from Building 7 in La Castellane
projects, was a goal or two away from being blamed for France's
elimination from the World Cup. He went back to the team's training
facility to shut up and wait out his suspension.
 &HT;    When Zidane came back to the lineup, France won its next three
games and the World Cup. His two goals in the final, both
magnificent headers, beat Brazil, soccer's pre-eminent national
team. A country that had never romanticized or intellectualized
sports found itself marveling at what it decided it wanted its
triumph to mean: the first happy signs of its transformation into a
multicultural society of underestimated vigor.
 &HT;    Suddenly, la France universelle, the cultural pressing machine
that remodels every difference into standard-issue Frenchness,
conceded, at least for the moment, that it was richer through all
its Zidanes. The victory, with a team composed of white, brown and
black players, had said something enormously encouraging about what
kind of country France could be.
 &HT;    In the dismal hierarchy of French racism, light-years from the
notions of tolerance that attracted the Richard Wrights and James
Baldwins and Bud Powells to Paris, the country's millions of North
Africans _ Arabs in the French mind, regardless of their
citizenship _ people exactly like Zidane's family, are easy targets
for daily scorn. They are automatically suspect, reflexively and
indiscriminately linked to growing street violence or _ like
Arab-Americans _ to any terrorist bombing.
 &HT;    In winning the World Cup, however, France lived through a burst
of generosity and good intentions unlike anything it had
experienced since the liberation of World War II. And it put in the
middle a soccer player whose brilliance was too quickly taken as a
metaphor for a change in national political temperament.
 &HT;    Wishfully, France persuaded itself to read into Zidane's
wondrous creativity the beginning of an end to its problems of race
and class, a too facile symbol of victory for a job nowhere near
done. Zidane became the emblematic figure of a social phenomenon of
which politicians and marketers and instant sociologists all wanted
a piece.
 &HT;    President Chirac, no soccer fan, pinned Legion of Honor ribbons
on Zidane and his teammates; the president's approval rating
soared. Marketing people pronounced Zidane ``stable, virile and
serious'' _ complimentary, yes, but not quite their usual
vocabulary when talking about French athletes of European origin.
 &HT;    Zidane took all this in very quietly, with an air of distance
that later looked like wisdom. With a million people on the
Champs-Elysees, he saw blue lasers spell out his name on the Arc de
Triomphe: ``Zidane for President,'' the giant letters said, and
``Merci, Zizou.'' The French press took to calling him Zizou, which
sounds very French and cute.
 &HT;    It was only months later that one of his brothers, with ever so
mild reproach, said that his family and friends actually call him
Yaz, short for Yazid, not a terribly unusual name in Kabylia, the
region in Algeria from which their parents had come. Months later,
too, when Zidane talked about the experience, it was pointedly
about his buddies from the projects (Malek, Baba, Richard, Nordine,
Nasser), not the moment's groundswell of good feeling and
fraternity.
 &HT;    In the autumn, perhaps with the special egalitarian moment
withering, Christian Jelen, writing in Le Figaro magazine, said
that ``the immigrant has become the new vector of revolution. The
immigrant is the new pariah, the new symbol of oppression and
waste. He has replaced the worker as the Christ figure in the mind
of the left-wing intellectual.''
 &HT;    At just about the same time, a stand-up comic named Guy Bedos,
much loved in France for his precisely targeted cynicism, caught
the evolution in the national mood from summer to winter. ``Hey,''
he shouted at his audience, ``a couple of kicks from some
(epithet), two head shots from an Arab and France starts going
around like it's in some kind of Benetton one-world commercial.
What is this?''
 GROWING UP IN THE PROJECTS  
 &HT;    Zidane looked at me as if I were out of my mind. I had come to
Turin, where he plays for Juventus, the great and superrich Italian
team built by Gianni Agnelli, and I was talking to him about his
old housing project, La Castellane.
 &HT;    We went over the obvious: Social workers said that in some
buildings the unemployment rate ran at about 60 percent, that Arab
families were disintegrating and that the only people seemingly up
in the morning were kids going to school. The cops feared the
place, doctors refused to make house calls there for a while last
year and when the Grand Mufti of Marseille, the city's Islamic
spiritual leader, came by on a kind of official pastoral visit,
somebody stole his car.
 &HT;    Still, I said, set on the scale of projects and mean streets in
the United States, Marseille North seemed a lot less forbidding:
whitewashed apartment houses built into the side of a deep ridge, a
view out to the Mediterranean, an arc of beiges, rusts, opalescent
blues and eucalyptus trees.
 &HT;    Zidane stared back, amazed at this proposition. He has kind
green eyes. He tried hard not to make me into a fool and searched
for something judicious to smooth away the embarrassment.
 &HT;    ``It's not like the projects are horrible, disgusting,'' he
explained, ``but things happen there. It was a pretty rough place.
There were 6,000 people at La Castellane when I lived there. If it
wasn't happening at the bottom of the hill, it was happening at the
top. Rough.''
 &HT;    At La Castellane, soccer happened in confined spaces, under
building eaves, in driveways, in parking lots. In the Marseille
projects, the game is played the way basketball is in inner-city
America. When you get the ball, you do what you can fast. Project
soccer is moves, ball control, amazing your homeboys, bidding up,
working the ball _ tricks that are every La Castellane's equivalent
of slam-dunks.
 &HT;    An old club team coach remembered Yaz at 11 or 12. ``The kid was
Zorro,'' he said. ``He made the law.''
 &HT;    If he had not combined schoolyard flash with the skills of a
master architect, Zidane might have wound up among the 43 percent
of young men in France with foreign parents who are out of work. As
it was, a recruiter saw Zidane at 13 dribble through the legs of an
opponent in front of his own goal, a display of dazzling soccer
gall.
 &HT;    Nervously, and after a check of his French citizenship, Zidane
was brought into the training program of the professional club at
Cannes. His mastery developed from there, a mixture of hot street
moves and a very much colder sense of space that lets his passing
control the game in the subtlest of geometric patterns.
 &HT;    On the field he's slightly hunched, not wildly fast, not buffed
and muscular, but remarkably supple. Unlike other players,
according to Enzo Francescoli, the former Marseille midfielder
Zidane idolized as a kid, he takes control of the ball with the
outside rather than the inside of his foot. Uniquely, the ball
seems to sit not so much in front of his feet but tucked
protectively between them. When Zidane is on, he does for soccer
what the most brilliant point guards do for basketball: He creates
the continuously unexpected.
 &HT;    Zidane lacks Michael Jordan's transcendent physical grace, but
his moves, like Michael's, make true believers. Zidane, says Pierre
Labat, who coached him at Bordeaux, has two characteristics. ``He
does things that nobody has ever seen before, and when he does the
same thing others do, he does it differently.''
 &HT;    Pele, the Brazilian who is widely considered the greatest soccer
player ever, brought a joy and athletic fluidity to the game in the
1960s. Maradona, the stumpy Argentine of the 1980s, was all heat
and percussion, looking as if he would score every time he got the
ball.
 &HT;    Zidane has been described as the player of the year 2000 _ the
first model for the next generation, an athlete whose draftsman's
sense of space, line and invention, mixed with moments of wild
schoolyard jive, seems cooler, more modern, a step beyond.
 &HT;    Told he had outpolled Jordan in France as the world's best
athlete, Zidane said: ``I'm not even on the same planet with
Michael Jordan. Get serious.''
 &HT;    No one has imposed new loyalties, new emotions on him. His
friends truly are his buddies from the projects. During his first
two years in Italy, Zidane had at least one of them living at all
times in his house with his family.
 &HT;    He tried to explain what it was like to be a North African kid
in the projects, with your father stacking boxes in a supermarket
chain's warehouse. When he watched the French national team on TV
with his brothers, it was like: ``You know, they're over there, and
we can only be here. You've got to be twice as strong as the other
guy. When you start off, the two of us, we've got something less
than the French guy.''
 &HT;    This soft-spoken resentment also marks Zidane. He doesn't say
quite what would soothe the French status quo, and he subtly but
steadfastly resists efforts to make him into the symbol of a new
multicultural movement. He didn't like the subject when I put it to
him, and he pushed it back. He limited talking about his doubts to
soccer and acknowledged them as ``more the fact that I'm never
fully happy with what I do.''
 &HT;    For someone who may be the world's most popular Frenchman, it is
not always easy going home, and Zidane expresses no great interest
in playing again for a French club team. The reason is unstated but
clear enough. After the marketing man who condescendingly
pronounced him stable and serious, a television critic for the
sports newspaper L'Equipe watching a recent appearance gave him
good marks for alertness and passion. But, as if he were grading
Zidane on his Frenchness, the critic felt compelled to add that he
was also ``inhibited and hesitant in his phrasing.''
 ENCOURAGING SIGNS  
 &HT;    Winter finds Zidane back at Juventus, playing for a salary
estimated at more than $3 million a year and getting thrown out of
a match and suspended again after a nasty tackle. The event makes
next to no news in France, and this time the what-did-you-expects
are missing.
 &HT;    There are other encouraging signs. Loubna Meliane, a young woman
with a North African background, emerges as the spokeswoman for a
student movement that actually talks the government into making
some reforms. French rap, from groups in the projects, dominates
pop music, while Le Figaro, often an almost comic advocate of
cultural conservatism, offers an article on the popularity of rai,
a form of Algerian pop music.
 &HT;    Even the sacred French language seems to be moving toward a
wider idea of pluralism. Bourgeois parents tell of their kids
developing housing-project accents that reflect the intonation and
sentence structure of Algerian immigrants. And all of France savors
the story about Germany, disgraced in the World Cup, changing
soccer managers and thinking about how to get more non-100-percent
Germans onto the national team.
 &HT;    But not everyone believes that Zidane's face on giant wall
murals in Marseille and on the highway to Charles de Gaulle Airport
signals conclusive change. A report from the traditionally ignored
High Commission on Integration, established some years before,
lists profound inequalities in education, housing and the justice
system and warns about ``the rise and seriousness of discrimination
that victimizes foreigners and French citizens of foreign origin.''
 &HT;    With the nation focused on the crime issue with its
not-so-subtle undercurrents of racism, notions of France's
brilliant multicultural future look a bit overdrawn. The best that
can be confidently said about Zidane and the French World Cup
victory is that they may have given a different sense of what
France might be. For now, what there is of transformation stops
there.
 &HT;    French television recently carried a report on a 19-year-old
named Nicolas Anelka, a black man from a mean Paris suburb who is
playing soccer for Arsenal in London. He's described as possibly
the next Zidane, but faster, stronger.
 &HT;    On camera from London, Anelka waves the crew off, saying at
first that he doesn't like to talk to the press. Maybe, a voice in
the background suggests, he'd just like to say hello to France.
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' says Anelka, perking up. ``Hello Djamel, Karim, Akim
and Sami.''

was also ``inhibited and hesitant in his phrasing.''
 ENCOURAGING SIGNS  
 &HT;    Winter finds Zidane back at Juventus, playing for a salary
estimated at more than $3 million a year and getting thrown out of
a match and suspended again after a nasty tackle. The event makes
next to no news in France, and this time the what-did-you-expects
are missing.
 &HT;    There are other encouraging signs. Loubna Meliane, a young woman
with a North African background, emerges as the spokeswoman for a
student movement that actually talks the government into making
some reforms. French rap, from groups in the projects, dominates
pop music, while Le Figaro, often an almost comic advocate of
cultural conservatism, offers an article on the popularity of rai,
a form of Algerian pop music.
 &HT;    Even the sacred French language seems to be moving toward a
wider idea of pluralism. Bourgeois parents tell of their kids
developing housing-project accents that reflect the intonation and
sentence structure of Algerian immigrants. And all of France savors
the story about Germany, disgraced in the World Cup, changing
soccer managers and thinking about how to get more non-100-percent
Germans onto the national team.
 &HT;    But not everyone believes that Zidane's face on giant wall
murals in Marseille and on the highway to Charles de Gaulle Airport
signals conclusive change. A report from the traditionally ignored
High Commission on Integration, established some years before,
lists profound inequalities in education, housing and the justice
system and warns about ``the rise and seriousness of discrimination
that victimizes foreigners and French citizens of foreign origin.''
 &HT;    With the nation focused on the crime issue with its
not-so-subtle undercurrents of racism, notions of France's
brilliant multicultural future look a bit overdrawn. The best that
can be confidently said about Zidane and the French World Cup
victory is that they may have given a different sense of what
France might be. For now, what there is of transformation stops
there.
 &HT;    French television recently carried a report on a 19-year-old
named Nicolas Anelka, a black man from a mean Paris suburb who is
playing soccer for Arsenal in London. He's described as possibly
the next Zidane, but faster, stronger.
 &HT;    On camera from London, Anelka waves the crew off, saying at
first that he doesn't like to talk to the press. Maybe, a voice in
the background suggests, he'd just like to say hello to France.
 &HT;    ``Yeah,'' says Anelka, perking up. ``Hello Djamel, Karim, Akim
and Sami.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Remember the Year of the Woman? Well, it's beginning to look as
if 2000 will be the Year of the Wife. Elizabeth Dole is nearing a
run for the presidency, to the delight of many Republican
strategists. And Hillary Clinton is _ famously, teasingly _
thinking about the Senate. The part of me that relishes a cinematic
plot turn in real life loves the very idea.
 &HT;    These are, after all, perfect big-screen story lines. In this
President Dole story, Bob would be self-sacrificing husband,
consigned to wistful observation of his wife's rising star _
because, hey, it's her turn now. In the Senator Clinton story,
Hillary would be the girl scorned in high school who shows up at
her reunion in splendor, humbling her old tormentors and winning a
seat on the Appropriations Committee while ``I Will Survive''
crescendos on the soundtrack. You'd have to be a killjoy of the
dourest hue not to see the fun in it.
 &HT;    And I'm not, really. But I was a teen-ager in the '70s. And it's
in the spirit of that era's egalitarian feminism _ the very one in
which Hillary Clinton, cosmetic-free Yale law student, came of
intellectual age _ that I find this latest brand of political
dynasticism lamentable.
 &HT;    Sure, that period produced some risible cultural flotsam, but
its emphasis on female autonomy and possibility was bracing.
(Still, I drew the line at gynecological self-examination courses.)
That sensibility is precisely what's missing from the new
wifeocracy, in which a woman's own political career is an outgrowth
of her husband's.
 &HT;    What does it say about American political culture that our two
most promising female candidates derive much, if not all, of their
star power through marriage? Yes, I know, the ultracompetent Dole
was secretary of transportation during the Reagan administration
and secretary of labor during the Bush administration.
 &HT;    But Samuel Skinner and John R. Block and Terrel H. Bell and
Lauro F. Cavazos were all Cabinet secretaries in those
administrations, too, and nobody's talking about what formidable
presidential candidates they would make.
 &HT;    As for Hillary, she probably should have run for office on her
own strengths years ago. Now, though, both women are, in the
old-fashioned sense, better halves.
 &HT;    We know them because they filled the role of political wife,
which, like the image of Betty Crocker or Aunt Jemima, keeps
getting updated but never really transformed. We like them for the
ways they complete their husbands' images, often with traditionally
feminine virtues.
 &HT;    In the 1996 campaign, Elizabeth Dole was supposed to be the warm
people-person, the one who waded into campaign audiences,
Oprah-style, and reminded her husband to smile more, whereas Bob
Dole was aloof and self-contained. (This was before he started
chatting to the nation about erectile dysfunction.)
 &HT;    Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, has achieved her maximum popularity
by appearing to compensate for all her husband's shortcomings:
Since Gennifer, and Paula, and Monica, and Juanita, she looks more
upright, more like the embodiment of beleaguered wifely morality
than ever.
 &HT;    And yet, to run successfully, both women will have to show sides
of themselves we have not seen lately, and that may not fit our
fantasy of who they are in relation to their husbands. Hillary
Clinton won't be able to stand above politics and Bill, as an icon
of dignity and forbearance. She'll have to run a tough campaign
that may remind voters of the old sharp-elbowed Hillary they didn't
like quite so well.
 &HT;    And Elizabeth Dole's sugary, Southern charm will only carry her
so far; who wants a magnolia, even a steel magnolia, for president?
 &HT;    I can't resist the the old feminist rhetorical trick of
reversing the equation. Could a man launch a national political
career primarily as the ``husband of''? Would he want to? Not
likely.
 &HT;    For one thing, female politicians don't tend to marry men with
ambitions to office. (They often seem to hook up with businessmen,
who stay behind the scenes and raise money for their campaigns.
Sometimes, of course, those business connections are trouble: Think
of Geraldine Ferraro, Enid Waldholtz, Carol Moseley-Braun.)
 &HT;    More important, though, political husbands barely constitute a
category unto themselves. They're not expected to affix themselves
to their wife's side and wave that parade-float half-wave. We'd
think it was slightly embarrassing if they did. And so,
paradoxically, they cannot turn marital status into political
capital quite as easily.
 &HT;    If a woman were to be elected president, no first gentleman
could maintain a Dennis Thatcher-like low profile. But so far,
display-quality political husbands are an untested entity.
 &HT;    In a way, the same double standard applies to all working
couples. A husband who launches his career by drawing on his wife's
connections (like men who earn less than their wives, or who stay
at home) makes many people uneasy _ even people who would be
surprised to hear themselves admit it. What's the deal with him,
anyway, they wonder? Why can't he stand on his own two feet?
 &HT;    Most of us are reluctant to ask such questions about Hillary
Clinton and Elizabeth Dole. Maybe, in the name of fairness, we
shouldn't be.

CIRCUMCISION A DIFFICULT CHOICE FOR SOME PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Deyva Arthur's decision not to circumcise her
newborn boy last month created quite a stir among her relatives.
</P>
<P>
   But she feels better about defying family tradition since the
American Academy of Pediatrics stated in a new policy on March 1
that the potential medical benefits of circumcision are not
sufficient to recommend it as a routine medical procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of vindicates me a little bit,'' said Arthur, who
lives in Troy, N.Y., with her husband and her son, Julian Sam Foy,
who was born Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over whether to circumcise, however, isn't expected
to die soon, as parents wrangle with cultural, religious and ethnic
traditions, as well as medical factors in making the decision.
</P>
<P>
   The American Academy of Pediatrics stopped short of giving any
specific advice: ``We encourage parents to discuss the benefits and
risks of circumcision with their pediatrician, and then make an
informed decision about what is in the best interest of their
child,'' said Dr. Carole Lannon, chairwoman of the academy's task
force on circumcision.
</P>
<P>
   As Arthur attests: ``It wasn't an easy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Each year, an estimated 1.2 million newborn males are
circumcised in the United States, at a cost of between $150 million
and $270 million. Circumcision surgically removes the foreskin, or
the skin that covers the end of the penis.
</P>
<P>
   In revising its policy, the academy also stated for the first
time that if newborn males are circumcised, they should be given
local anesthesia for pain relief _ something that's not usually
done now, in part because of some concern about the risk of
complications, including allergies and swelling.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Rosenblatt, a obstetrician and gynecologist, is
already anticipating questions from parents, who may feel even more
confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``There never really has been a lot of medical evidence that
circumcision was necessary,'' said Rosenblatt, who practices in
Delmar, N.Y. ``Some parents go on the basis that if everybody else
is doing it, maybe we should too.''
</P>
<P>
   Circumcision is the widespread tradition in the United States.
Some doctors have long believed it decreases the risk of
infections, sexually transmitted diseases and the risk of penile
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But there are cultural reasons too. For Jews and Muslims,
circumcision is a religious ritual. For many Americans, it's
considered more socially acceptable, even though in Europe and
Latin America, circumcised males are a minority.
</P>
<P>
   It remains controversial, however, whether circumcision affects
penile sensation and sexual satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Horgan, the head of neonatal medicine at Albany
Medical Center, believes the academy did a good job of distilling
all the available medical literature on circumcision. But he
acknowledged that parents rarely talk about risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you get that information out so parents can make an
informed decision?'' Horgan said.
</P>
<P>
   On urinary tract infections, the academy concluded that
uncircumcised infants are four to 10 times more likely to acquire
one in the first year of life than circumcised boys, but the
absolute risk is very low _ about seven to 14 cases in every 1,000
uncircumcised infants, compared with one to two out of every 1,000
circumcised infants.
</P>
<P>
   With penile cancer, their findings were similar. Although
uncircumcised males have a threefold increase in risk, they
concluded that the disease is so rare that the absolute risk is
very low _ about nine to 10 cases for every million men.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur and her husband discussed circumcision at length before
their son was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had done some research and read Dr. Spock and a variety of
articles. None of them said there was much medical reason,'' Arthur
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she acknowledged she and her husband had trouble
reaching an agreement. ``He couldn't decide,'' she said. ``Once the
baby was born, he didn't want anything to cause him pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Arthur is optimistic that as more parents learn about the issue,
they will choose not to have their children circumcised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the world isn't circumcised,'' she said. ``By the time
my son is that age, half of the boys won't be circumcised either.''

 RIDING THE WILD, PERILOUS WATERS of AMAZON.com

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    I have seen the future, and it's a little exaggerated. It's the
Frederick's of Hollywood padded panty No. 50404, which promises to
add a dollop of bump to any behind. I stumbled upon this fetchingly
inflated undergarment the same way _ if you believe what you hear _
I will find almost everything in the glorious, not-too-distant
future. I found it on Amazon.com.
 &HT;    Despite the fact that the Web site has been hemorrhaging ever
larger amounts of cash per quarter since it went up, Jeff Bezos,
Amazon's brilliant, charming, hyper and misleadingly goofy
mastermind, has managed to keep his three-and-half-year-old company
the ``it'' stock of the late millennium by regularly upping the
ante with ever more sweeping intimations about the scale and scope
of E-commerce.
 &HT;    First it was books, then music and video, then gifts. Now, with
his just-opened ``Shop the Web'' service, which offers links to
scores of other on-line retailers, the menu has been widened enough
to include disingenuous lingerie.
 &HT;    But no matter what new foray or feature Bezos is trumpeting, he
always keeps our filmy gaze locked on the future, reminding us in a
way that somehow manages to be both winningly modest and
titillatingly grandiose that this is the merest tip of the iceberg.
 &HT;    ``We probably know as much about E-commerce as anyone, but it's
2 percent of what we'll know five years from now,'' he says, and
even with his latest bold move, the purchase of a controlling 46
percent stake in Drugstore.com, he points out that this is likely
to be only the first of many investments in compatible Internet
businesses.
 &HT;    While his beleaguered physical rivals are mired in the present,
where they have to attend to sticky details like making money, the
specifics of Amazon.com's ultimate form remain forever elusive, a
lovely shimmering at the edge of the horizon. In this way
Amazon.com truly is a virtual company, existing only in the
imagination.
 &HT;    And Bezos hasn't pulled this off only with his formidable
technical or quantitative skills, but also with his political
genius for telling each of his divergent constituencies exactly
what they want to hear. To his employees he holds out the rare
chance to create from the ground up an entirely new medium that
will reshape the world for the better. To his on-line visitors he
offers a kinder and gentler form of commerce, in which a community
of customers, armed with the right information, help one another
make the purchase that is perfect for each one of them. And to Wall
Street he presents a lean, mean virtual juggernaut that, unburdened
by such anachronisms as sales clerks, operating hours and
inventory, will run circles around any brick-and-mortar dinosaur,
whether it be Barnes &AMP; Noble or those Arkansas boys from the
Wal-Mart Stores.
 &HT;    So far a startling number of people are not just biting but also
swallowing. Amazon employees have thrown themselves into their
yokes like bovine missionaries. Their customers, 6.2 million and
counting, have been so free and easy with their encrypted
credit-card numbers that sales have grown an average of more than
50 percent a quarter and ended 1998 at a billion-dollar-a-year
pace.
 &HT;    At one point early this year, Wall Street gave the company a
valuation north of $30 billion, which was more than Texaco's, and
made the 35-year-old Bezos, who with his family owns just over half
of the shares, one of the wealthiest fellows on either side of the
Amazon.
 &HT;    But Bezos may have spun his company a bit too well, if such a
thing is possible. The outrageous valuation has brought enormous
scrutiny and a certain impatience about the lack of profit. From
mid-January to mid-February, the stock lost half its value. And as
Bezos struggles to move the company into the black with the whole
world watching, it may become clear that the various versions of
his vision are not just different but also conflicting.
 &HT;    If the promised future ever arrives, we may see that the grand
vision for Amazon.com isn't much more than an electronic mall, that
as at any big retailer most of the jobs are lousy and pay badly and
that Amazon.com's only real goal in regard to its customers, just
like that of any other business, is to separate them from their
money.
 &HT;    To be exciting, a stock needs a good story, and the Internet and
Amazon.com, both growing faster than Otto the overfed goldfish, are
good stories, with the potential for only a few happy endings.
 &HT;    This is not to say that all the investor enthusiasm for
Amazon.com and the Internet can be dismissed as an expression of
hype and greed. Last year Amazon.com posted book sales of $610
million, an increase of 313 percent over 1997 sales of $147.8
million, making it in just three and a half years the country's
third largest bookseller (virtual or physical), behind Barnes &AMP;
Noble ($2.7 billion) and Borders ($2.3 billion). In only its second
quarter of operation, Amazon.com's music division became the
largest on-line music seller, with $33.1 million in sales.
 &HT;    At the same time, E-commerce, after a holiday season that
dwarfed even the most optimistic estimates, increased by 230
percent to $5 billion. Although that is still less than 1 percent
of total North American retail sales of $2.6 trillion, such rapid
and seemingly limitless growth poses a serious threat to physical
stores, which is why Barnesandnoble.com, bolstered by a $100
million matching pledge from its partner, Bertelsmann, is so
committed to winning back some of that business.
 &HT;    So far, however, on-line profits have been minimal at best
because of the extreme cost of attracting customers.
 &HT;    Part of the great sell of the Internet has always been its
promise to level the playing field, so that Bezos and five comrades
working in a garage just outside of Seattle could create a site
that looked in its own way as substantial and bona fide as a Barnes
&AMP; Noble superstore. A month ago Lyle Bowlin, of Cedar Falls, Iowa,
working by himself and in his spare time, was able to open a site
offering almost the same vast selection as Amazon.com.
 &HT;    But it is far less democratizing than it appears. You can offer
the greatest selection and service on the Net, but without an
enormous expenditure for marketing and advertising, no one will
come because no one will know you are there. That's why Amazon.com
spent approximately $50 million on advertising last year and doled
out at least another $50 million to AOL and Yahoo! and MSN to
funnel visitors in its direction.
 &HT;    On average, on-line retailers spent $26 on marketing and
advertising per sale in 1998, while their physical counterparts
spent only $2.50. Until Bezos and other Internet retailers can find
a way to attract and keep customers without such an enormous
outlay, they are all going to have a hard time making any money.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, despite the ample accomplishments and serious,
unresolved challenges, it is the peculiar fate of Amazon.com that
both are completely overshadowed by the sensational valuation and
volatility of its stock. For all its all-nighters and tattooed
punks humping books in the distribution center and golden
retrievers wandering the halls in the corporate office, Amazon.com
is a $20 billion, 2,100-employee company built on the thin membrane
of a bubble, and this brings a manic precariousness to the place
that no amount of profitless growth can diminish.
 &HT;    
 NO CYNICS ALLOWED  
 &HT;    When it comes to seducing his employees, Bezos offers not just a
low-paying job with a handful of stock options, but also a life's
work. The company's motto is ``Work Hard, Have Fun and Make
History,'' and cynicism is not an option.
 &HT;    Richard Howard, who was fired at the very end of a four-week
trial for an entry-level ``Tier 1'' job in customer service, and
later wrote a story for Seattle Weekly titled ``How I Escaped From
Amazon.com,'' refers to a tone of ``quasi-religiosity'' and an
``unspoken taboo against any speech or expression (including
gallows humor) that betrays your lack of commitment to the
long-term success of the enterprise.''
 &HT;    Maintaining this degree of zealotry is going to be difficult,
because the overwhelming majority of the company's employees have
tedious, low-paying jobs either in the distribution center or in
customer service.
 &HT;    Despite CEO admonishments not to dwell on the value of the stock
price, it's hard to see what else would keep these Tier 1 and 2
employees returning to this vast electronic sweatshop, and the
options are a notable part of the job description in the local want
ads. When the stock was up over 70 points for a couple of hours one
morning, the paper value of even the lowliest workers, with their
100 stock options, had gone up $7,000 that day, and when the stock
topped off three and a half weeks later, just after the split, any
worker who'd been there a year had a portfolio that was at least
briefly worth $120,000. Even in the last few weeks, when the stock
has settled at around 100, their portfolios are a not-too-shabby
$60,000 each.
 &HT;    In fact, the more you look at an Internet phenomenon like
Amazon.com, the more central the stock price seems to the whole
enterprise. It's as if the stock price is the business model. Not
only does it help bolster the cultlike commitment of the employees
needed to provide the slavish service that is Amazon's competitive
advantage, but it allows the company to painlessly make hundreds of
millions of dollars in acquisitions, paying with stock or cash
raised through bond offerings.
 &HT;    Amazon.com spent $280 million to buy two companies, including a
software provider and an Internet address service, in 1998. The
astounding stock price allows the company to deepen its pockets to
survive the price wars or whatever other competitive nastiness is
surely coming. It is also an enormous branding and PR engine, and
it's central to the long-term strategy. By the same token, it seems
that if the stock were to crater, it would all unravel in a
heartbeat.
 &HT;    
 PAMPERING THE CUSTOMERS  
 &HT;    The warm and gooey place Amazon.com occupies in the hearts and
minds of so many of its customers is the great equity of the
franchise, and that precious beachhead has been won by deeds and
words. Some of that affection is just the natural and deserved
spoils for getting there first.
 &HT;    At the same time, Amazon's early inordinate responsiveness to
customers gave them a heady sense of ownership in this bold new
experiment. When they hunted down used and out-of-print books,
their enterprising efforts on behalf of their customers were closer
to what one might hope for from the concierge of a five-star hotel
than from the clerk of a bookstore.
 &HT;    ``We may be the most customer-obsessed company to ever occupy
planet Earth,'' says Bezos.
 &HT;    Of course all this proactive groveling is expensive and part of
the reason Amazon.com has been spending more than it makes.
 &HT;    Even as its market valuation soared past that of Barnes &AMP; Noble
and Borders combined, the company has clung tenaciously to the
image of a principled David pluckily battling its much more
powerful and supposedly less principled rivals. In fact, in many
ways, they purloined the tone of those beloved independent
bookstores that everyone accuses Barnes &AMP; Nobles and Borders of all
but wiping off the face of the earth.
 &HT;    They posted the same kinds of lists of in-house favorites like
``What We're Reading'' and ``Amazon.com Recommends'' that you first
saw on the crowded, small round tables at those independents. As a
company it consciously tried to give customers the impression,
which had actually been the case with those small bookstores, that
this was much more a labor of love than a pursuit of wealth.
 &HT;    Although Bezos emphasizes his obsession with the customer and
plays down his concern with rivals, the way he toyed with Barnes &AMP;
Noble was so instructive that any established brand getting
bushwhacked by an Internet upstart is now referred to as ``getting
Amazoned.''
 &HT;    He started with a bold print ad campaign that hailed Amazon.com
as ``Earth's Biggest Bookstore'' and used splashy graphs to support
the claim that Amazon.com offered a much larger selection than the
country's biggest book retailer.
 &HT;    Then he got mobile billboards to cruise around Barnes &AMP; Noble
superstores posing the question, ``Can't find that book you
wanted?'' This was a bit misleading, considering that Amazon.com at
that point carried no books at all and was simply ordering them for
customers, just as Barnes &AMP; Noble or any other bookstore would if
they didn't happen to have it in stock.
 &HT;    More important, he held up Barnes &AMP; Noble as the embodiment of
the doomed past with all its supposed assets reinterpreted as
liabilities, and held up Amazon.com as the shining alternative.
 &HT;    This constant taunting egged Barnes &AMP; Noble into quickly putting
up its own site, and when Barnesandnoble.com failed at first to cut
into Amazon.com's big lead, it reinforced the message Wall Street
needed to hear: It's not just hype; cyberspace is a whole new
animal; none of the old retail skills apply.
 &HT;    Then Barnesandnoble.com began to work out the kinks and gained
back some market share, running ads with headlines like ``Who's
Fooling Who?'' and its own graphs showing they offer almost twice
as many titles. By then, Amazon.com had opened its music store,
replaced ``Earth's Biggest Bookstore'' with ``Books, Music and
More'' and left Barnes &AMP; Noble wrapping its fingers around the neck
of a phantom.
 &HT;    Bezos says, ``A year from now I don't think Barnes &AMP; Noble will
even think of us as a rival.''
 &HT;    Bezos' claim almost seems true. According to Nicole Vanderbilt,
an Internet analyst for Jupiter Communications, Amazon.com's real
rivals now aren't the lumbering store-based retailers but the other
heavily trafficked Internet portals and providers, from AOL to
Yahoo!, and now, after its acquisition of USA Networks, Lycos.
 &HT;    ``As impressive as Amazon's 6.2 million customers are,'' she
says, ``AOL has the credit-card numbers of 16.2 million
customers.''
 &HT;    Every morning, even before her husband leaves their modest loft
and heads to his little office in his sensible Honda, MacKenzie
Bezos is at her laptop. For most of the last five years she has
been researching and writing her own novel. Regardless of whose
undertaking ends up being more successful or more worthwhile, both
husband and wife are storytellers, and both are spinning epics out
of thin air.

   LAYER-CAKE (Undated) _ The layer cake, an American icon, is in
dire straits. Decades of supermarket cake mixes have inflicted some
real harm at home, of course. Most bakeries, with their airy cakes
frosted in sugared shortening, have simply failed to hold up their
end of the bargain. And high-end restaurants, where the layer cake
once played such a proud role, have left it for dead, a casualty of
the war among today's dueling pastry chefs. By Milissa Clark.

While the original Aureole is elegant and understated, the version

the wine tower. Four stories of stainless steel, glass and
plexiglass, it is a wine cellar in reverse, soaring 42 feet over
the bar. Clearly the centerpiece of the restaurant, it holds _ and
dramatically displays _ some 9,000 bottles of wine. Move over,

 &HT;    TECHNOLOGY A MIXED BLESSING FOR BLIND CONSUMERS
 &HT;    With BLIND-DATA. For release Sunday, March 21.
 &HT;    1380&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As technology races into the future, many blind and
visually impaired consumers are having trouble keeping up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of in the middle between rather costly, but fairly
good, access in the computer environment, and increasingly bad
access in portable telecommunications and home appliances,'' said
Paul Schroeder of Chicago, director of the national technology
program of the New York-based American Foundation for the Blind.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, technology has been a boon for the 10 million
Americans whose vision can't be corrected with glasses or contact
lenses alone. That is especially true for the 3 million with the
most severe visual handicaps _ those who can't read newsprint or
recognize a friend at arm's length, or are blind in both eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Using special software, they can use computers. Telephones can
receive e-mail or voice-mail messages. In some cities, blind people
can phone a 24-hour ``Newsline'' number to hear stories from their
local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But the rapid development of technology often leaves people with
bad sight behind:
</P>
<P>
   _ The computer programs most popular in homes or offices seldom
include features that will help visually impaired users.
</P>
<P>
   _ As makers of home appliances and electronic gadgets focus on
sleek exteriors, some of their products have become harder to use.
</P>
<P>
   Computer users with bad eyesight must buy, install, customize
and frequently upgrade the software that lets them use
graphics-oriented programs designed for people who can see well.
That assistive technology can cost more than the computer itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some vision for most of my life,'' said Linda Jacobson
of Orange Park, Fla. At first she used software that enlarged the
print and icons on her screen. But as her sight deteriorated, she
went shopping for a program that would read the computer screen to
her aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The screen-reader Linda bought cost $550,'' said her husband,
Eric, a software developer. ``It didn't work, and we called the
company for support, and their reply was, 'It works here.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Even the best special software ``doesn't work on some modern Web
pages because of the graphics, and when it does work it downloads
very slowly,'' said Shawn Martin of Alamogordo, N.M., who is blind.
``It's new, and it's just not as reliable as the old low-tech
stuff, like talking thermometers and talking scales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get to the point where maybe you can fill out the
order form to buy a book on line, but you can't find the 'submit'
button, and there's no keyboard equivalent to activate it,'' said
Scott Marshall, a blind lawyer and advocate in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A test by Cox Newspapers of the home pages of the 25 busiest Web
sites showed that all but five had graphic elements that could not
be read by assistive programs for the visually impaired.
</P>
<P>
   The job market offers an even bigger challenge, because many
businesses develop their own computer networks in-house. It's not
always easy to plug assistive software into such a system.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just a few techies in the field who can do it,''
said LaDella Holmes-Reddick of the Center for the Visually Impaired
in Atlanta, ``and if an Atlanta company offers a job to one of our
blind clients, we might have to fly in someone from Texas to write
the code.''
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of specialized technicians is nationwide, said
Curtis Chong, director of technology at the Baltimore headquarters
of the 50,000-member National Federation of the Blind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't learn this stuff in Silicon Valley. The few of us
who do it pick it up on our own with a whole lot of assistance from
talking to other blind people,'' Chong said. ``Second, if
somebody's really good at technology you have to pay them a lot of
money to keep them from being hired away, and rehabilitation
agencies just haven't had that kind of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, however, many blind people find everyday appliances
even more annoying than computers. At least computers have
keyboards they can become familiar with.
</P>
<P>
   But today's top-of-the-line microwave ovens, radios, TVs, VCRs,
cell phones and ATM machines often operate with touchpads and video
displays that ask written questions or use up-and-down arrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can twirl knobs by feel, but that doesn't work with visual
displays,'' said Michael Fischer of New York, director of
low-vision services for Lighthouse International.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, Audley(cq) Blackburn's TV set stopped responding
to his remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``It talks to you to tell you what to do next, but it doesn't
give you feedback to tell you whether you did it right,'' the
Austin, Texas, small business owner said. ``I accidentally pushed
the wrong button and somehow deprogrammed the thing. So I had to
call a sighted friend to come over and ask him to look at my set
and read me the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   William Schiavo, a young programmer studying technology in
Baltimore at the National Center for the Blind, said, ``The average
guy can run down to the ATM and stuff their card in and get out
some money, but unless we have previously visited and memorized the
sequence of ATM commands, we can't use it.''
</P>
<P>
   On an out-of-town trip, he met a woman who proudly told him that
her bank's ATM was braille-equipped ``so us blind guys could use
it.'' Pawing the machine, he finally found a little braille tag
that read, ``For assistance, pick up the nearest telephone.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Ward of Jacksonville, Fla., who enjoys infomercials on TV,
jokes that she saves money by being unable to respond to those that
end, ``please call the number on your screen.''
</P>
<P>
   But she gets genuinely upset during hurricane season when she
hears the beep on her TV set that means a weather warning is
scrolling across the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called the TV station once and told her that blind people
didn't know what the message was, and her response was like, 'what
are blind people doing watching TV?' That was nasty,'' Ward
recalled. An audio option that could be used for such purposes
without disturbing sighted viewers has been required in all stereo
TV sets for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife went shopping for an electric range,'' said Al
Pietrolungo of Baltimore, who is blind. ``She called the library
and asked them to look up the top five recommendations from
Consumer Reports. She went to the appliance store, and all five of
them were unusable by blind people, because they had digital
displays or touchpads.''
</P>
<P>
   How do these things happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't test things for blind people,'' said spokeswoman Rana
Silver of Consumer Reports magazine. ``There are consumers with
disabilities who use mainstream products, but unfortunately, when
you are blind, it's a very specialized subset of the population.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the complaints, the Electronics Industry
Association, which includes major appliance and electronics
companies, referred all questions to two blind experts: disability
consultant Mike Paciello of Nashua, N.H., and Lawrence Scadden at
the National Science Foundation's program for persons with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manufacturers don't consider or use or test their devices or
appliances with people with disabilities,'' Paciello said. One big
reason, he said: ``There are no national or international standards
that mandate accessibility.''
</P>
<P>
   While their numbers are increasing as baby boomers age, market
forces still work against the blind. Appliance makers don't think
that 1 million legally blind consumers and 9 million visually
impaired consumers are a big enough niche to target in a country of
more than 270 million people, Paciello said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the visually impaired aren't as prosperous as the
population in general. Half are retired, and only three in 10 of
working age have jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Scadden said that Whirlpool and Sharp Electronics are the only
big U.S. suppliers that will give braille overlays to any consumer
who buys products with touchpads. But in today's mega-stores, many
clerks and customers don't even know that the option exists, or
which company makes which brands.
</P>
<P>
   ``No designer would deliberately make something inaccessible,
but they just go ahead and design products for fully able-bodied
young people,'' Scadden said. ``They don't even save any money by
doing it that way. ``
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   He once asked the engineers at one computer manufacturer to make
a cost-free change: A higher contrast between the letters and
background on a new model's keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I can't see keys myself, I know a lot of people with
low vision who wanted the keys labeled in high contrast,'' Scadden
said. ``But I was told by the engineers that that wasn't their
department, that was marketing, which was more concerned about
appearance than usability.''
</P>
<P>
   Even learning what kind of technology could help is a mystery to
many people who start losing their vision after a lifetime of
normal sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no Consumer Reports magazine for the blind or partly
blind,'' said William Paul, whose central vision in each eye
deteriorated steadily during the decade before his retirement as
executive vice president of United Technologies in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no one-stop shop where the average person can check
out all the electronic software and hardware to find out what will
help with your particular kind of eye disease,'' Paul said.
``Almost no one, including eye doctors, knows much about the
closest thing we have to it today _ the low-vision clinics the
Lions Clubs are starting at several universities, and the little
stores where some gutsy entrepreneurs are aiming at this marketing
niche.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Congress have approved three federal laws
that could help deal with inaccessible technology.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of how well the laws will be enforced is still
up in the air:
</P>
<P>
   _ The Department of Education was empowered last fall to create
a central Web site containing a big, national inventory of
technology and devices usable by people with disabilities,
including visual problems. ``We have to do something, but we don't
know yet what we will do,'' a departmental spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorized the Federal
Communications Commission to study how to make the next generation
of telecommunications devices usable for the blind. For three years
now, the commission has been studying the question of whether to
issue regulations or voluntary guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Assistive Technology Act of 1998 required that no later
than August 2000, the federal government try to make its agencies
stop buying electronic information technology that cannot be used
by employees or citizens with disabilities. Federal advisory panels
are hard at work on the first drafts of such rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, if any consumers buy software off the shelf,
chances are it will have accessibility built right into it,'' said
William Paul, who serves on one of the advisory panels. ``Suppliers
will have already folded accessibility features into their product
in order to sell it to the federal government, because it is by far
their biggest customer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do is make sure the regulations that enforce
those laws are efficient, effective and in line with the spirit of
the laws,'' said Paul Edwards, a disability expert at Miami-Dade
Community College who heads the nation's second largest
organization of blind consumers, the American Council of the Blind.

MOCK INVASION PITS MARINES AGAINST PROTESTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL and LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALAMEDA, Calif. _ The Marines, computers and high-tech weapons
at the ready, landed on the eastern shore of the San Francisco Bay
amid a war of words and not much else.
</P>
<P>
   A half-hour behind schedule, the first of 550 battle-dressed
Marines were ferried ashore at the old naval base here Monday
aboard husky CH-53 Super Stallions, helicopters that carry 37
soldiers in full combat gear, and the smaller 22-person CH-46 Sea
Knights.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers who came ashore in the Marines' urban warfare
rehearsal were equipped with laptop computers, tiny digital radios
_ the first major change in combat radio communications since 1938
_ and ``acoustical anti-sniper weapons'' that react to the sound of
gunfire and automatically pound the source with .50-caliber
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting on shore were about 100 protesters representing an array
of causes, including peace, tree and bicycle activists. There were
sharp words but no incidents and the police were on hand.
</P>
<P>
   After helicopters had deposited most of the Marines ashore, four
LCAC hovercraft, 88-foot heavy-duty landing vessels, rumbled
noisily across the Bay and onto the tarmac at Alameda Point, where
they disgorged about 200 troops and a quantity of equipment,
including trucks and light armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a dress rehearsal for war,'' said veteran San
Francisco leftist Gloria La Riva. ``We think they're just planning
for an invasion of Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's absolutely untrue,'' Lt. Col. Gary Shenkel, a Marine
spokesman, said in the sharpest exchange of the exercise. Noting
that 300 civilians were working with the operation, he added,
``This is not a preparation for war. There will be tremendous
technology transferred to civilian uses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marines already know how to make landings, attack and
bombard, added Marine Col. Mark Thiffault.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't know how to do is to fight and survive in an
urban area,'' he said. ``We don't believe we're going to have
another large Saddam Hussein-type operation. They (Iraqis) are not
stupid. They're not suicidal.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined Navy-Marine exercise included overflights of the
Bay area by the Sea Shadow, the Navy equivalent of the stealth
bomber, in what Thiffault called a major test of combat
communications capability.
</P>
<P>
   The communications gear centered on the USS Coronado was
essential to new types of warfare, he said. ``It lifts the fog of
war,'' he said of the high-tech hardware.
</P>
<P>
   The exercises were a follow-up to similar urban warfare
practices in Monterey over the weekend.

   Method: List of the 25 Web sites with the most visitors in
January was compiled by Media Metrix Inc. On March 10, Cox
Newspapers tested the home page of each site, using a Web-based
service (http://www.cast.org/bobby) of the Center for Applied
Special Technology. The service analyzes Web pages for their
accessibility to people with disabilities. The analyses were based
on the latest working draft of the voluntary guidelines for HTML
4.0. The guidelines are being developed by the W3C's WAI Page
Authoring Working Group.

the wine tower. Four stories of stainless steel, glass and

the bar. Clearly the centerpiece of the restaurant, it holds _ and
dramatically displays _ some 9,000 bottles of wine. Move over,

 &HT;    JOURNAL: SOME THINGS STILL WORK, EVEN IF RUSSIA DOESN'T
 &HT;    With Photo Mug of Holmes.
 &HT;    Moving in both the International and Commentary categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Since the economy crashed and burned last August, it
has not been easy to find good news to report from Russia's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But as winter delivers its last punches in the next few weeks,
now let us praise a few things that -- well, let's be blunt here --
that actually WORK WELL in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Operating in a market economy may give Russians a fit, but
operating in a blizzard is ``byez problemah'' -- without a care.
Russia has to struggle to find its way in the post-Cold War world;
there is no such identity crisis in the everyday routine of coping
with winter.
</P>
<P>
   Armies of snow removal trucks deploy on the roads day and night
to clean the streets while the extensive Moscow subway system
handles millions of riders a day.
</P>
<P>
   And the centralized heating system works so well that on some
winter days it may be sub-zero outside while it is
shorts-and-t-shirt weather inside your apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, where snowstorms are tracked by armies
of meteorologists and television bulletins offering alarming
updates of snowfall amounts and school closings, there is no such
panic in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the weather rarely makes the news here. Beginning in
late October or early November, the weather outlook goes something
like this: Today, it is definitely going to be cold and will
probably snow. Tomorrow, ditto. And on and on until April.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the good news: This city of 12 million is never really
paralyzed by winter. Sure, urban traffic crawls, as it does most
all the time, summer or winter. But snowfall rarely brings school
closings and flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   History attests to Russia's proficiency at dealing with winter.
It helped Moscow repel the armies of Napoleon and Hitler. Winter is
an old friend, the subject of affection and only a few complaints.
It never keeps a Russian from getting to work, school, the
unemployment office.
</P>
<P>
   This harmony with winter is as old as Russia itself and an
integral part of the national character. But the systems in Moscow
for coping are thanks in large part to Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and the Communist regimes that
followed industrialized what had been a country of peasant farmers.
Many of these new factory workers came to live in the cities. And
happy workers needed a way to get to work, and a warm apartment at
the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets built an impressive, efficient subway system and a
network of central heating stations that provide hot water and
steam heat to every apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   They also made sure the roads were clean, for the party
hierarchy zipping around in their black limousines -- and also for
the bread trucks to make their deliveries to keep those workers
happy.
</P>

 &HT;    JOURNAL: SOME THINGS STILL WORK, EVEN IF RUSSIA DOESN'T
 &HT;    With Photo Mug of Holmes.
 &HT;    Moving in both the International and Commentary categories.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Since the economy crashed and burned last August, it
has not been easy to find good news to report from Russia's
capital.
</P>
<P>
   But as winter delivers its last punches in the next few weeks,
now let us praise a few things that -- well, let's be blunt here --
that actually WORK WELL in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Operating in a market economy may give Russians a fit, but
operating in a blizzard is ``byez problemah'' -- without a care.
Russia has to struggle to find its way in the post-Cold War world;
there is no such identity crisis in the everyday routine of coping
with winter.
</P>
<P>
   Armies of snow removal trucks deploy on the roads day and night
to clean the streets while the extensive Moscow subway system
handles millions of riders a day.
</P>
<P>
   And the centralized heating system works so well that on some
winter days it may be sub-zero outside while it is
shorts-and-t-shirt weather inside your apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the United States, where snowstorms are tracked by armies
of meteorologists and television bulletins offering alarming
updates of snowfall amounts and school closings, there is no such
panic in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the weather rarely makes the news here. Beginning in
late October or early November, the weather outlook goes something
like this: Today, it is definitely going to be cold and will
probably snow. Tomorrow, ditto. And on and on until April.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the good news: This city of 12 million is never really
paralyzed by winter. Sure, urban traffic crawls, as it does most
all the time, summer or winter. But snowfall rarely brings school
closings and flight delays.
</P>
<P>
   History attests to Russia's proficiency at dealing with winter.
It helped Moscow repel the armies of Napoleon and Hitler. Winter is
an old friend, the subject of affection and only a few complaints.
It never keeps a Russian from getting to work, school, the
unemployment office.
</P>
<P>
   This harmony with winter is as old as Russia itself and an
integral part of the national character. But the systems in Moscow
for coping are thanks in large part to Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   The 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and the Communist regimes that
followed industrialized what had been a country of peasant farmers.
Many of these new factory workers came to live in the cities. And
happy workers needed a way to get to work, and a warm apartment at
the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviets built an impressive, efficient subway system and a
network of central heating stations that provide hot water and
steam heat to every apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   They also made sure the roads were clean, for the party
hierarchy zipping around in their black limousines -- and also for
the bread trucks to make their deliveries to keep those workers
happy.
</P>
<P>
   All these systems still work today, heavily subsidized by the
local and federal governments. Then, as now, they remain important
to maintaining the social order in difficult times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our budget is bad,'' explained Gennady Krapivny, a senior city
official, ``but we keep everything normal.''
</P>
<P>
   This winter, it has snowed more days than not. Every 24 hours,
more than 6,800 snowplows, trucks and other machines are operated
by more than 15,000 workers to remove snow from Moscow streets.

ENDANGERED: THE BELOVED AMERICAN LAYER CAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one knows for certain just how the layer cake originated, but
it's easy to trace its rise and its decline.
</P>
<P>
   Layer cakes as we know them first appeared around the latter
half of the 1800s in the United States, said Stephen Schmidt, the
author of ``Dessert in America,'' to be published next year by
Scribner. But he said that the ``impulse to layer'' could be traced
back to as early as the 1820s or even earlier, when cooks made what
he said was the original model for the layer cake: the jelly cake.
</P>
<P>
   This was fashioned from a poundcake-like batter that was baked
on a griddle into very thin layers that were then spread with jelly
and stacked.
</P>
<P>
   But what truly spawned the layer cake, later in the century, was
the cast-iron stove, which gradually replaced less reliable brick
hearths in American kitchens, said the culinary historian Karen
Hess.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of baking powder, starting in the mid-1800s,
also made cakes easier to tackle, she continued, adding, ``The oven
and the use of chemical leaveners went hand and hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hess said that some of the earliest recipes for layer cakes
were published in 1871 in ``Mrs. Porter's New Southern Cookery
Book,'' one of the first cookbooks written for people who had those
newfangled iron stoves. One recipe, for White Mountain Cake, filled
and frosted with meringue, may offer a clue to the popularity of
layer cakes for birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   The text accompanying it says that it ``is very nice indeed,
particularly for weddings and parties.'' Birthday parties, say.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1890s there were numerous recipes for fancy layer cakes
filled with sherry-macerated dried fruits, preserves and whisky- or
fruit-flavored curd. In well-off households on special occasions,
the entire dining room sideboard would be filled with different
layer cakes, their icings tinted pink, green or chocolate brown and
festooned with rosettes, swags, nuts and glaceed cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt brackets 1900 to the 1930s as the heyday of these kinds
of cakes. Cookbooks of this era dedicate dozens of recipes to layer
cakes, built six layers high, voluminously frosted and meant to be
set on footed cake stands.
</P>
<P>
   He traces the beginning of the end of the layer cake as
extravaganza to the 40s. Fifty years ago this year, the first
commercial cake mixes were introduced. ``Paradox of Plenty: A
Social History of Eating in Modern America'' (Oxford University
Press, 1993), Harvey Levenstein wrote that by 1957 more than half
of the cakes baked in America were made from a mix.
</P>
<P>
   In restaurants, said Tim Moriarty, the author of several dessert
books, the decline probably began with the importing of French
cuisine in the 60s, when Julia Child appeared on television and a
new generation of upscale restaurants offered showy
chocolate-and-nut tortes and cream-filled mousses and charlottes.
</P>
<P>
   By the 80s, a layer cake was more likely a genoise, cut into
three segments, stacked with a filling and frosted. The ubiquitous
flourless chocolate cake followed.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout was complete by the 90s, as trends turned away from
anything simply sliced and served on a plate.

NO FOOTBALL PLAYERS HAVE BEEN OPEN ABOUT BEING GAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Are there any self-described gay people on a pro football
team?
</P>
<P>
   _ D.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: No gay NFL players have discussed the subject publicly.
``Dave Kopay is the only former NFL player to be open about his
sexuality,'' said Dan Woog, author of ``Jocks: True Stories of
America's Gay Male Athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   Agent Leigh Steinberg told New Republic in 1998, ``Frankly, it
would be easier for someone convicted of bank robbery to get a job
in the NFL than an overtly gay player.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Glenn Burke, Major League Baseball's first openly gay
player, believed that teams were unwilling to sign him because of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Kopay openly discussed his sexuality after retiring in 1975.
``The David Kopay Story,'' a book he wrote with Perry Deane Young,
describes the experiences of several gay players in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people don't give the public _ even the sporting
public _ enough credit for being fair and open-minded, even about
something as controversial as homosexuality,'' Woog said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to have a birthday card or greeting from
the president sent to a senior citizen celebrating a 100th
birthday?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.K., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The White House Greeting Office sends out cards recognizing
birthdays 80 and up, and wedding anniversaries 50 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Send requests to The White House, Attn: Greeting Office, Room
39, Washington, D.C. 20502; or fax a request to (202) 395-1232.
</P>
<P>
   You should request a card at least six weeks before the event.
The Greeting Office mails cards 10 days prior to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How can a person become a contestant on ``Hollywood
Squares''?
</P>
<P>
   _ F.H., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: If you're going to be in Los Angeles, call the ``Hollywood
Squares'' Contestant Department at (323) 850-0707 to arrange an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squares'' is open to anyone 18 and up who has not appeared on
a game show in the past year and isn't affiliated with CBS or other
companies involved in the production. The show does not pay any
travel or hotel expenses for contestants.
</P>
<P>
   To request tickets to see a taping, write to Guest Relations,
CBS Television City, 7800 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, CA 90036.

   No one knows for certain just how the layer cake originated, but
it's easy to trace its rise and its decline.
</P>
<P>
   Layer cakes as we know them first appeared around the latter
half of the 1800s in the United States, said Stephen Schmidt, the
author of ``Dessert in America,'' to be published next year by
Scribner. But he said that the ``impulse to layer'' could be traced
back to as early as the 1820s or even earlier, when cooks made what
he said was the original model for the layer cake: the jelly cake.
</P>
<P>
   This was fashioned from a poundcake-like batter that was baked
on a griddle into very thin layers that were then spread with jelly
and stacked.
</P>
<P>
   But what truly spawned the layer cake, later in the century, was
the cast-iron stove, which gradually replaced less reliable brick
hearths in American kitchens, said the culinary historian Karen
Hess.
</P>
<P>
   The availability of baking powder, starting in the mid-1800s,
also made cakes easier to tackle, she continued, adding, ``The oven
and the use of chemical leaveners went hand and hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hess said that some of the earliest recipes for layer cakes
were published in 1871 in ``Mrs. Porter's New Southern Cookery
Book,'' one of the first cookbooks written for people who had those
newfangled iron stoves. One recipe, for White Mountain Cake, filled
and frosted with meringue, may offer a clue to the popularity of
layer cakes for birthdays.
</P>
<P>
   The text accompanying it says that it ``is very nice indeed,
particularly for weddings and parties.'' Birthday parties, say.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1890s there were numerous recipes for fancy layer cakes
filled with sherry-macerated dried fruits, preserves and whisky- or
fruit-flavored curd. In well-off households on special occasions,
the entire dining room sideboard would be filled with different
layer cakes, their icings tinted pink, green or chocolate brown and
festooned with rosettes, swags, nuts and glaceed cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt brackets 1900 to the 1930s as the heyday of these kinds
of cakes. Cookbooks of this era dedicate dozens of recipes to layer
cakes, built six layers high, voluminously frosted and meant to be
set on footed cake stands.
</P>
<P>
   He traces the beginning of the end of the layer cake as
extravaganza to the 40s. Fifty years ago this year, the first
commercial cake mixes were introduced. ``Paradox of Plenty: A
Social History of Eating in Modern America'' (Oxford University
Press, 1993), Harvey Levenstein wrote that by 1957 more than half
of the cakes baked in America were made from a mix.
</P>
<P>
   In restaurants, said Tim Moriarty, the author of several dessert
books, the decline probably began with the importing of French
cuisine in the 60s, when Julia Child appeared on television and a
new generation of upscale restaurants offered showy
chocolate-and-nut tortes and cream-filled mousses and charlottes.
</P>
<P>
   By the 80s, a layer cake was more likely a genoise, cut into
three segments, stacked with a filling and frosted. The ubiquitous
flourless chocolate cake followed.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout was complete by the 90s, as trends turned away from
anything simply sliced and served on a plate.

MINORITY ADMISSIONS PLUMMET AT SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The number of blacks and Hispanics accepted into
San Francisco's most prestigious public high school for the coming
year plummeted 50 percent from fall 1998, raising serious questions
about how to maintain diversity without using race in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, offers to Chinese-American and white students
has jumped considerably at Lowell High, one of the top public
schools in California.
</P>
<P>
   The changing demographics of the school are the result of a
settlement reached in February that bars the city's public schools
from using race as a factor in admissions. The Lowell numbers show
the formidable challenge the district faces as it wades tentatively
into an era of color-blind admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Prevented from considering race or ethnicity, the district hoped
to maintain diversity at Lowell by awarding extra points to
students from low-income and otherwise disadvantaged families.
Lowell is the only high school in the district to require an
admissions test.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the school district gave bonus points to
Lowell applicants who come from single-parent families, augmenting
a system of points already in place taking economic hardship into
account.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of helping blacks and Hispanics, however, the points
system made more Chinese-American and white students eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell makes between 825 and 850 offers for freshman admission
every year, and 600 to 625 students generally accept.
</P>
<P>
   Of the offers made to students for fall 1999, 65.3 percent went
to Asian-Americans, 26.97 percent to whites, 5.4 percent to
Hispanics and 1.97 percent to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Asian-Americans received 58.8 percent of the offers,
whites received 23.57 percent, Hispanics received 11.41 percent and
blacks received 5.57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   According to the terms of the February settlement, the
62,000-student district has until Sept. 20 to craft a new
enrollment plan that will govern all schools beginning in the fall
of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on finding ways to continue diversity in our
schools,'' said Jennie Horn, who oversees Lowell admissions. ``It's
very tricky. We're doing number crunching and simulations and
studies. With Lowell, we tried every which angle, incorporating
every factor other than race.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco PTA President Carol Kocivar, a member of the
Lowell admissions committee, said relying on social and economic
factors to increase enrollment of blacks and Hispanics wasn't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The district and the community must work very hard to help
youngsters become eligible,'' Kocivar said. ``That means starting
from the beginning. If we don't have these kids in the 50th
percentile by the third grade, we can't expect them to be
Lowell-eligible by the eighth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1983 until last month, San Francisco's public schools were
governed by a federal consent decree requiring them to enroll
students through a rigid racial formula: No more than 45 percent of
students at any school could be of one race, and at least four
ethnic groups had to be represented at each school.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese-American families filed suit to overturn the 1983
formula because their children were being kept out of prized
schools, notably Lowell, due to the racial quota system.

AND NEXT: AL GORE'S PLAN TO MAKE LIVER TASTE LIKE CHOCOLATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Isn't Al Gore the guy who was supposed to reinvent government?
The guy who was supposed to take a hatchet to the federal
bureaucracy? The guy who inspired one of President Clinton's
boldest declarations: ``The era of big government has ended''?
</P>
<P>
   The very same.
</P>
<P>
   OK, then. Why on earth is Vice President Albert ``Slash the
Government'' Gore popping up on television every day to tout some
new government program that is guaranteed to spur the economy,
promote world peace, cure cancer and eliminate tooth decay?
</P>
<P>
   Because he's running for president, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   Look, folks. Gore has spent the last six years laboring in the
shadow of the most controversial president in memory. He may not
want to admit it, but the vice president is desperate to raise his
profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like I'm in a shadow,'' Gore told some TV
interviewer the other day. But that sounded about as sincere as his
claim that there was ``no controlling legal authority'' prohibiting
his use of White House telephones for political fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Gore labors in the president's shadow; that's what
vice presidents are supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been loyal to a fault, defending Clinton in the face of
allegation after allegation, scandal after scandal. The former
Tennessee senator went so far as to predict at the president's
post-impeachment pep rally in December that William Jefferson
Clinton would be remembered as one of America's greatest
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   He said it with a straight face, too. But then, Gore says
everything with a straight face. ``Expressiveness'' is not the
first word that comes to mind when making an inventory of Gore's
political assets.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, it's not one of the first 50 words that come to mind.
</P>
<P>
   Gore won his reputation as a humorless stiff the first time he
ran for president, way back in 1988. It's a reputation that has
followed him through two more national campaigns and his entire
tour of duty as Clinton's right-hand man.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will never be able to dazzle voters with his charisma, so
he is hoping to delight them with his ability to get things done.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why he seems to be on CNN every time we turn around:
going to bat for frustrated air travelers one day, announcing new
labeling requirements for over-the-counter medicines the next _ and
all the while assuring the electorate that his vision for America
is superior to the visions being espoused by the one other Democrat
and the herd of Republicans who covet Clinton's job.
</P>
<P>
   This program-a-day business used to be the president's domain,
most news junkies recall, but that was when he needed a daily
diversion to get the public's collective mind off impeachment. If
the scandal started heating up, Clinton would concoct some new
government initiative, step in front of the cameras to announce it,
and then boast that he was focusing on the people's business while
his enemies engaged in the politics of personal destruction.
</P>
<P>
   You don't keep those 60 to 70 percent job-approval ratings by
staring out the window all day long.
</P>
<P>
   With impeachment behind him, Clinton now can afford to fly
around on Air Force One and leave the daily unveiling of new
programs to Gore _ who has been hard pressed to get his name in the
paper lately except as a projected loser to Republicans George W.
Bush and Elizabeth Dole in those 2000 presidential preference
polls.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 election is a long way off, needless to say, and there
are any number of scenarios that might transform Gore from underdog
to winner by the time voters go to the polls. To his credit, the
vice president is steady as a rock _ which figures, since he has
the personality of a rock _ and thus isn't likely to make any
catastrophic, self-destructive mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   He has a problem, though: If Gore keeps inventing government
programs to get himself on television, the Republican who takes him
on will rip him to shreds for wiping out the budget surplus that he
and Clinton have been bragging about.

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Too Many Spices Spoil the Chai 
 &HT;

 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Once Starbucks started serving it, chai tea
officially became mainstream. So it's no wonder the Indian spiced
tea has been showing up on grocery shelves.
<P>
   But just where it shows up is a mystery, unique to every store.
Some place it beside soft drinks and bottled water; others put it
in the coffee-and-tea aisle. Still others keep it in the
refrigerator case, even though some of the teas are shelf-stable.
</P>
<P>
   Equally as varied are the tastes. Today's panel tasted seven
brands of chai tea, and the results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Each brand was made according to package directions. All but one
recommend being heated and mixed with different amounts of steamed
milk, though the drink also may be served cold.
</P>
<P>
   The top scorer was &UR; Oregon Chai &LR;  (32 ounces, $4.49-$6.39 at many
supermarkets). One panelist described it as ``very restorative and
comforting.'' Most panelists liked the combination of spices, but
one dissenter thought too many spices created a medicinal flavor.
Four would buy it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; Tazo  &LR; (32 ounces, $5.29 at Andronico's).
Two panelists thought is was mild _ one referred to it as ``sort of
a Wonder bread approach.'' But all but one panelist liked the blend
of spices. Four would buy it; one would not.
</P>
<P>
   Scores on the remaining brands dropped significantly. The best
of the rest was  &UR; Toddy &LR;  (12 ounces, $3.99 at Trader Joe's), though
panelists were divided. Two panelists thought it had good tea
flavor, another thought it tasted too strongly of tea. Others were
put off by the gray color. One would buy it, two might buy it and
two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth place went to  &UR; Sattwa Chai &LR;  (32 ounces, $4.39 at Rainbow
Grocery). Three panelists disliked the overly sweet flavor and the
heavy use of spice, but another panelist thought the drink was
nicely spiced. Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Celestial Seasonings &LR;  (32 ounces, $5.99 at Andronico's) scored
just one point lower than Sattwa. Two panelists complained about
the bitter taste, and others thought it was too heavily spiced. One
panelist compared the flavor to pumpkin pie. One would buy it; four
would not.
</P>
<P>
   Honest Tea Kashmiri Chai and Masala Chai Co. scored too low to
rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Panelists were Dan Bowe, associate culinary director, Center for
Culinary Development; Jon P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Roland Passot,

wonderland. Over the next few months, we'll take you from field to
forest to factory to look at the wealth of ingredients stocking our
larders. As a bonus, ``Georgeanne Brennan will offer tips for using
the bounty in fresh, innovative ways.  AT THE SOURCE: Radishes Make Organic Grower's World Go 'Round  
   
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Quick mental association with the word radish:
cute little red sphere decorating deli trays; may or may not be
eaten.
 &HT;    Well, think again. There is the granddaddy of them all _ sturdy
white daikon, a mainstay of Japanese cuisine, which can grow to a
foot and a half; black Spanish radish (black on the outside, creamy
white inside), much favored by Eastern Europeans; mild icicles,
both white and red, or white French breakfast radishes that are
particularly favored alongside soft-ripened cheeses.
 &HT;    How about a radish weighing a full pound? Watermelon radishes
can get that big without turning woody. These roots (the word
radish comes from radix, the Latin word for root) have greenish
skin and crimson- and white-ringed interiors that make them real
lookers when sliced. Their taste goes from sweet to spicy, says
Andy Martin, sales manager at Lakeside Organic Gardens in
Watsonville, a major supplier to local markets and restaurants.
 &HT;    Lakeside is the organic spin-off of a major conventional grower,
Dick Peixoto Co., and cultivates 600 acres of certified organic
produce. The farm adds 100 acres a year, so by the end of 1999, 700
acres will be planted. (Certification comes after three years and a
long paper trail of organic practice.)
 &HT;    Radishes are a secondary crop (lettuces, broccoli and
cauliflower are main crops), says Lakeside manager Terence Welch,
but one or the other kind of radish is harvested year-round. Trucks
loaded with hundreds of boxes of radishes roll out of the farm
three times a week, destined for such stores as Draeger's,
Cosentino's, Whole Foods and the Santa Cruz area's New Leaf
markets. Even with this heavy local consumption, Welsh says, more
than half the crop travels east of the Rockies.
 &HT;    Watsonville, home to several radish growers, boasts ideal
conditions for radishes _ sandy loam and lots of water. The climate
also allows weekly planting throughout the year.
 &HT;    Martin, a former chef in Aptos, says many restaurants have
discovered that radishes are far more than a spot of color for the
crudite tray. Chefs are serving them with butter and sea salt for
an appetizer, incorporating them into stir-fries or making them the
main ingredient of salads.
 &HT;    Radishes have been staples in European, Middle Eastern and Asian
cuisines for centuries (their cultivation is believed to have
started thousands of years ago in China, from where they traveled
to Egypt and Greece). Now, it seems, the pungent subterranean
treasures are finding their place in the sun of American menus.

 GEORGEANNE'S KITCHEN  _ Cool Ways to Use Crisp Radishes &HT;

<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Radishes of all kinds, and even their greens, may be used in
numerous ways. Here are just a few ideas:
<P>
   &UR; Tunisian-Style Roasted Pepper and Radish Salad.  &LR; Roast, peel
and seed 1 or 2 poblano chile peppers, then slice into very fine
strips. Cut 5 or 6 French breakfast or round red radishes into very
thin slices.
</P>
<P>
   Toss the peppers with olive oil, vinegar, salt, pepper and a bit
of cayenne pepper. Arrange on a plate and top with a mixture of
chopped cilantro and parsley. Top with the radishes and drizzle
with a little olive oil.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; French Radish Plate &LR; . Choose tender young radishes, such as
French Breakfast, round red, purple, Easter Egg. Leave the young,
bright green leaves attached. Arrange them on a plate, along with a
ramekin of kosher salt and a small pot of unsalted butter. Serve
with slices of country-style bread for an appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Watermelon Radish and Pork Stir-Fry &LR; . Make a mixture of about 1
tablespoon cornstarch with an equal amount of water, a little soy
sauce and some dry sherry.
</P>
<P>
   Put cubed pork in a bowl and pour in the cornstarch mixture,
gently turning to coat. Let stand for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Cut watermelon radishes into 1/2-inch cubes. Clean and coarsely
chop some spinach. Mince 2 or 3 garlic cloves.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a little oil in a wok. Add the garlic and radishes;
stir-fry until the radishes are tender, about 3 or 4 minutes.
Remove and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Using a slotted spoon, transfer the pork to the wok and stir-fry
1 to 2 minutes. Return the radishes and garlic, add the spinach and
stir-fry until the spinach is just limp. Pour in any remaining
cornstarch mixture, and add a heaping spoonful of black bean and
garlic sauce; stirring to combine.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Black Radish Appetizer &LR; . Peel and grate a black radish or two.
Spread thin slices of chewy, dark bread with butter. Top with the
grated radish. Serve with iced vodka or slivovitz.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spring Rolls with Radishes &LR; . Crush 5 or 6 garlic cloves and put
them in a bowl with red wine vinegar. Let stand for at least 1 hour
and up to overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Grate red, purple or daikon radishes. Grate carrots. Sliver
green onions.
</P>
<P>
   Saute minced garlic and ginger in oil, then stir in the radishes
and carrots, cooking only a moment or two. Sprinkle with a little
salt.
</P>
<P>
   Spread open a spring roll wrapper and fill with the
radish-carrot mixture. Add slivers of green onion and roll up
according to package directions. Fry in oil until crisp and golden,
about 2 minutes on each side. Remove to paper towels to drain.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, cut a slit lengthwise in each roll and spoon in a
little of the garlic vinegar.

THE LOWDOWN ON RADISHES &QL; 
 &QL; 
Radishes are part of the family of cruciferous vegetables (which
includes broccoli), which are believed to have cancer-inhibiting
properties. They are extremely low in calories (17 for one cup of
sliced radishes, which supplies about one-third the daily
requirement of vitamin C).
</P>
<P>
   Radishes keep up to a week in the refrigerator if you remove the
greens (use those as a salad ingredient if they are fresh). If a
radish such as the black Spanish is too pungent for your liking,
peeling it will leave you with only the much milder interior.
</P>
<P>
   Large, long white radishes are a staple in Bavarian beer
gardens, where regulars compete in carving them into paper-thin
spirals. The layers are liberally sprinkled with salt and pressed
back together to be eaten in big bites as a companion to a stein of
ice-cold beer.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Martin of Lakeside Organic Gardens, a Watsonville grower of
radishes, says radishes of all kinds make a pleasantly crunchy
addition to stir-fries. A former restaurant chef, Martin also
recommends a salad in which sliced or shredded radishes are dressed
with sesame oil and rice vinegar, seasoned with salt and pepper to
taste and sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds.

IT WASN'T THAT HARD TO SEE THAT NCAA REQUIREMENTS WERE A PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some people have a devil of a time with their ``I-told-you-so''
reflex.
</P>
<P>
   When something happens that validates some position they once
took or some prediction they made, they can't resist crowing about
it.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not that kind of person. But it's clear that I was right all
along about the NCAA's Proposition 48 and its misbegotten
offspring, Proposition 16.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes U.S. District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter and gives
that elitist, discriminatory and hypocritical baggage the legal
heave-ho. The case against the National Collegiate Athletic
Association was so overwhelming that Buckwalter didn't even see the
necessity for a trial. He just ruled ``no.'' He said, in effect,
that the eligibility standards for freshmen should not remain in
effect because they are grossly unfair to African-American athletes
and athletes from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Buckwalter mince his words. In fact, he used the NCAA's
own words and data to condemn its freshmen eligibility policy. He
cited a July 27, 1998, memo dispatched by NCAA officials to
Division I member schools, documenting the fact that
``African-American and low-income student-athletes are
disproportionately impacted'' by the grade point and standardized
test score requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In plain English, he means that those categories of student
athletes are getting the short end of the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Well, if that isn't a kick in the old elitist keister. The judge
sees in a flash that the standards are unfair. The NCAA has known
it for some time. And some people, most notably members of the
Black Coaches Association, tried to tell the NCAA that before
Proposition 48 became unholy writ in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But no one had any data before the fact with which to counter
the powers that be in the NCAA, who were infernally bent on
pursuing that folly. And it took a boycott by Georgetown University
basketball coach John Thompson in 1989 to persuade the NCAA to
jettison the infamous Proposition 42.
</P>
<P>
   That proposition would have denied financial aid to athletes
forced to sit out their freshman year because they failed to meet
Proposition 48 standards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the NCAA proceeded to make matters worse by racheting
up the standards with the overlay of Proposition 16. Proposition 48
imposed a minimum 2.0 grade point average and a 700 SAT score or a
17 ACT score. Proposition 16 imposed a sliding scale that would be
based upon a 2.5 GPA combined with either a 700 SAT or a 17 ACT. An
athlete with a 2.0 GPA would need a 900 SAT or a 21 ACT to be
eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 16 went into effect in 1996. In 1997, four
Philadelphia high school athletes sued the NCAA, asserting that
NCAA rules that effectively prevented them from getting athletic
scholarships were discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   It is on the basis of that lawsuit that Buckwalter has issued
his historic ruling. If there is any justice in this matter, his
ruling will provide appropriate relief to others besides those
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   This case should be given class-action status. And every athlete
still in college who was among those ``disproportionately
impacted'' by the NCAA's discriminatory rules should at the very
least have a year of eligibility restored.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the final outcome of this case, the NCAA's way of
determining initial eligibility will have to change. That will be
the case, even if the NCAA prevails on appeal. The statistical
evidence of unfairness is too overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   Some prominent nonblack coaches already have been saying as
much. Among them is Mike Krzyzewski, Duke University basketball
coach and president of the National Association of Basketball
Coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Krzyzewski said in reaction to Buckwalter's ruling that the NABC
has long been concerned about how the minimum test score would
affect youths from lower socioeconomic backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This court ruling will certainly open a new discussion for
creating better legislation for all youngsters,'' Krzyzewski said.
</P>
<P>
   Giving credit where it's due, the NCAA appeared to have had good
intentions in installing Propositions 48 and 16. There was a lot of
genuine concern about unacceptably high numbers of collegiate
athletes failing to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   Some, however, suggested that another objective of the standards
was to increase the percentage of white athletes participating in
NCAA programs and decrease the numbers of African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Although I never subscribed to that school of thought, I can
understand why such suspicions arose. It was obvious even then that
the eligibility standards favored white athletes from affluent
backgrounds. The standardized tests on which they rely too heavily
are culturally and class biased.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fight Buckwalter's ruling, the NCAA needs to move as
quickly as possible to enact fair initial eligibility criteria. The
appeal is a waste of time and money and an insult to the student
athletes and former student athletes who were injured by the bogus
rules.

 CHRON   Not Your Grandmother's Custard  
 Bay Area chefs dress up a homespun favorite in jazzy new guises 
 &HT;       
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  Call it a new indulgence, a craving for comforting
food or maybe a backlash against one too many plates artfully
adorned with two al dente baby carrots.
<P>
   Whatever the reason, chefs and their customers are succumbing to
the soothing, silky _ even sexy _ seduction of custards, flans,
timbales or whatever name you care to attach to a baked concoction
of eggs and milk (or cream), enhanced with whatever strikes a
cook's fancy.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas in the early '90s, it was cr &LR; e &LR; me brul &LR; e &LR; e, that
seductively silky dessert chefs flavored with the likes of designer
chocolate, mango puree, lavender blossoms and more, that took
custard out of the nursery-food category, now savory custards are
in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend was slowly simmering for a couple of years, it came
to a spectacular boil when Ron Siegel, the talented 32-year-old
chef of Charles Nob Hill restaurant in San Francisco, stunned his
culinary cohorts by becoming the first American chef to score a
knockout victory (unanimous decision by all four judges) in Japan's
glitz-for-gluttons Iron Chef television competition last fall
(televised here in mid-January).
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the formidable task of creating _ in 60 minutes _ a
complete meal based on a secret theme ingredient revealed to the
competitors at the start of the show (live lobster, in this case),
Siegel started his menu with a lobster custard _ and wowed the
judges.
</P>
<P>
   He has prepared that international attention-getter for his Nob
Hill customers a few times since, but it's not his only custard
caper. As a bouche amus &LR; e &LR; e _ the complimentary appetizer top
restaurants present to tease guests' gustatory expectations _ he
sometimes bakes a simple mushroom custard in empty eggshells. As
delicious as they are fetching, these are great starters for an
Easter brunch or dinner, and it's not a project of Iron Chef
complexity. If a home cook doesn't have the time to prepare the
eggshells, he/she can always cheat a tad and bake the custards in
paper-lined muffin tins.
</P>
<P>
   At San Francisco's Grand Cafe, Denis Soriano also has made room
on his menu for savory custards. He gives a crispy,
mahogany-colored roasted chicken breast taste and color contrast
with beet-red molded basmati rice and a smooth little mound of
spinach custard. Venison's complementary companion is a woodsy
chestnut custard.
</P>
<P>
   At Oakland's Bay Wolf, chef/owner Michael Wild, the master of
duck cookery, features an appetizer of duck liver flan with pickled
onions and grilled bread.
</P>
<P>
   Ten or 15 years ago, these items would not have been found on
American restaurant menus. Eighty years ago, they would have been
commonplace. Leaf through the ``Hotel St. Francis Cook Book''
(published in 1919), in which Victor Hirtzler, San Francisco's
first celebrity chef, gives a year's worth of his menus, and you'll
find savory egg-cream dishes almost daily at lunch or dinner _ or
both.
</P>
<P>
   In 19th century American and British cookbooks, savory puddings
were staples. ``The American Frugal Housewife,'' by a Mrs. Child,
published in 1832, amusingly distinguishes between country and city
dwellers in its recipe for batter pudding. Country folk are told to
``beat up five or six eggs with a quart of milk, and a little salt,
with flour enough to make it just thick enough to pour without
difficulty. Those who live in the city, and are obliged to buy
eggs, can do with three eggs to a quart, and more flour in
proportion. Boil about three quarters of an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   This was meant to be a filling starch dish. Some modern chefs
use savory puddings much the same way, if with a bit more
sophistication than boiling a flour-egg-milk gruel on the stove.
</P>
<P>
   At One Market in San Francisco, chef Rabah Abusbaitan says the
revival of savory custards is a natural outgrowth of the new
popularity of old-fashioned dessert custards like cr &LR; e &LR; me brul &LR; e &LR; e
and cr &LR; e &LR; me caramel. The latter was his favorite sweet his mother
cooked when he was a boy in Jerusalem. Now he heightens the
richness of lobster bisque with an aromatic basil flan. He also
favors the rich smoothness of custard with such robust dishes as
roasted lamb, which he pairs with a white bean custard.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Striffeler of Anzu in the Nikko Hotel in San Francisco
is fond of a custardy mushroom bread pudding to accompany the
restaurant's signature prime steaks. The custard works equally well
with veal, chicken and pork, he says _ ``anything except fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Custards fit into the trend of home-style foods gaining on
supertrendy concoctions, Striffeler says.
</P>
<P>
   He would not get an argument from Elka Gilmore of San
Francisco's Oodles, who serves a subtle roasted garlic flan with
Western-style food and an intricate steamed chawan mushi as part of
her fusion tasting menu. A free-form interpretation of the
traditional Japanese dish, chawan mushi is made of duck consomme,
eggs, chicken confit, scallops, gingko nuts and shiso leaves, with
dashi (Japanese stock) adding a smoky note.
</P>
<P>
   Not your grandmother's custard, Gilmore would readily admit. But
she feels these dishes fit the zeitgeist of the late '90s _ a
peculiar mix of comfort and sophistication to which diners respond.
Gone, she says, are the days, a dozen or so years ago, when people
came to upscale restaurants to be seen rather than nourished.
</P>
<P>
   Today's savvy restaurant patron, she says, wants to go beyond
``something grilled with mango/chile.'' The new diner appreciates
nuances of cuisine and isn't afraid of the occasional indulgence,
including, she says, a ``divinely rich'' savory custard.

(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMS) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tips for Making Perfect Custard &QL; 
 &QL; 
Savory custards and their cousins, bread puddings and timbales, are
not difficult or labor-intensive to make (Irma Rombauer in ``The
Joy of Cooking'' called timbales the more even-tempered cousins of
souffles). But there are a few simple facts to bear in mind for
optimum results:
</P>
<P>
   _ Having all ingredients at warm room temperature ensures even
cooking. If eggs are refrigerator cold, place them in a large bowl
of lukewarm water for 10 minutes before cracking them. This is also
important if a recipe calls for whipping egg whites; they will
reach their maximum volume when they are about 75 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Straining uncooked egg-milk mixtures through a fine sieve is
not strictly necessary but does promote a smooth, silky texture.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never cook custard concoctions at more than medium heat.
Temperatures over 350 degrees will toughen the albumin (protein) of
eggs, resulting in tough curds and a watery texture, since the
protein can no longer absorb liquids.
</P>
<P>
   _ For the same reasons, custards are baked in a bath of hot but
not boiling water (hot tap water is safe) which helps diffuse heat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Another way to avoid watery custards is to blanch or cook
vegetables before adding them to the basic egg-milk (or cream)
mixture. Uncooked vegetables exude too much moisture during baking.
</P>
<P>
   _ When testing for doneness, insert a sharp knife or skewer near
the edge of the dish. If it's done there, residual heat will finish
cooking the center as the dish cools. If you have let the custard
bake a little too long and the center is completely set when you
test, remove it from the oven, let stand about 1 minute, then place
the dish in a shallow pan of ice water to stop further cooking.

   &UR; CHARLES NOB HILL MUSHROOM CUSTARDS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, chef Ron Siegel serves these as an amus &LR; e &LR; e
bouches (complimentary appetizer). They would be a fun addition to
an Easter brunch.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   12 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped mushrooms, sauteed in 1 tablespoon butter
</P>
<P>
   Salt and white pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 275.
</P>
<P>
   Working over a bowl to catch any spills, remove the top quarter
of each eggshell, either with small, sharp shears or by
decapitating the eggs with a determined whack of a chef's knife.
Put the contents of 3 eggshells into a small bowl, whisk to mix;
set aside. Reserve the remaining egg yolks and whites for an omelet
or other use.
</P>
<P>
   Trim the tops of the shells as neatly as possible. Rinse the
shells with hot tap water and carefully remove any membrane. Place
the shells upside down on a drainer tray to dry.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the milk and cream in a saucepan and bring to a boil.
Add the mushrooms and return to a boil. Pour into a blender and
puree on high speed until liquefied. Pour back into the rinsed
saucepan and bring to a boil once more.
</P>
<P>
   Whisk the hot mixture slowly into the 3 beaten eggs. Strain
through a fine sieve. Season the egg mixture with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Set the cleaned egg shells into the depressions in the bottom
half of a cardboard egg carton; divide the custard mixture among
them. Place the carton in a large baking pan; add enough hot water
to reach the bottom of the eggshells.
</P>
<P>
   Cover loosely with foil and bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until
just set. Remove and cool to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  Serve in individual egg cups. Garnish with sprigs of
watercress, parsley or dill. You may also carefully crack the
bottom of the shells with a teaspoon, so the shells will stand
upright on a plate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; If cooking in the eggshells seems too time consuming,
line 12 small muffin tins with paper liners, divide the custard
mixture among them, place in a shallow pan with 1 inch of hot water
and bake as above. Cool and unmold onto small plates; garnish as
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 12.

 &UR; ASPARAGUS CUSTARD &QL;  &LR; 
This is a classic custard adapted from Julia Child's original
``Mastering the Art of French Cooking.'' It may be made with other
chopped cooked vegetables such as cauliflower, Brussels sprouts,
broccoli or spinach.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup panko or other dry white breadcrumbs
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup finely minced onion
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   Pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   A few gratings nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup grated Swiss or medium-sharp cheddar cheese
</P>
<P>
   5 eggs
</P>
<P>
   1 cup reduced-fat or whole milk, brought to a boil
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds asparagus, tough parts removed, blanched
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Coat a 6-cup souffle mold or
oven-proof casserole with cooking spray. Coat the inside of the
mold with 1/3 cup of the breadcrumbs, shaking out excess.
</P>
<P>
   Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a small saucepan over medium
heat. Add the onions, cover and cook for about 10 minutes, until
translucent but not browned.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the onions to a large mixing bowl. Add salt, pepper,
nutmeg, the cheese and remaining breadcrumbs. Beat in the eggs, 1
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the remaining 4 tablespoons butter in the hot milk; add to
the onion mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Cut the asparagus into 1/2-inch pieces and add to the custard.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the custard into the prepared mold. Place the mold in a
baking pan. Pour enough very hot water into the pan to come about
halfway up the sides of the mold.
</P>
<P>
   Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, until until a knife inserted into the
center of the custard comes out clean.
</P>
<P>
   Let cool at least 5 minutes. Run a knife around the rim of mold
and invert the custard onto a serving plate. Or serve directly from
the mold.
</P>
<P>
   Surround with a bechamel sauce seasoned with chopped fresh
herbs, Mornay sauce or other cheese sauce, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; The custard may be baked in individual souffle molds or
custard cups. Reduce the cooking time to 25-30 minutes.

 &UR; OODLES ROASTED GARLIC FLAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups veal or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 cups heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig fresh rosemary
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons pureed roasted garlic (see note)
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   7 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a small skillet; add the onion and cook over
medium heat until caramelized, stirring frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the caramelized onion and stock in a small saucepan;
bring to a boil and cook until reduced to 8 tablespoons. (Measure 8
tablespoons water into the pan beforehand, so you know at which
level the stock should be when it is sufficiently reduced.) Strain,
discarding the onion.
</P>
<P>
   Coat 8 small (3-inch) ramekins with nonstick cooking spray.
Divide the stock among them. Refrigerate until the stock has
solidified.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, combine the cream, rosemary and garlic in a
heavy-bottomed saucepan. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and let
cool. Discard the rosemary. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Beat the egg yolks in a medium bowl until blended, then add the
cream, beating until well mixed. Strain through a fine sieve.
Divide the mixture among the ramekins.
</P>
<P>
   Place the ramekins in a shallow baking pan. Pour enough hot
water into the pan to come two-thirds of the way up the sides of
the ramekins. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the flans are set.
</P>
<P>
   Let the flans cool, then unmold onto serving plates and garnish
as desired.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8 as an appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Many delis sell heads of roasted garlic; pureed roasted
garlic also is available in jars. To roast your own, cut off the
top quarter from a whole head of garlic, drizzle with a scant
teaspoon of olive oil, wrap in foil and bake in a 325 oven until
very soft, about 1 hour. Squeeze out the soft garlic pulp into a
small bowl, discarding skins. A medium head yields about 2
tablespoons.

 FOOD IN THE NEWS: Consumers Puzzle Over Antibiotic-Free Meat  
   
   
 By Kim Severson  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Consumer interest in antibiotic-free meat and
poultry is growing. But butchers say people are still confused
about the decades-old antibiotics debate.
<P>
   Sales of meat and poultry labeled ``antibiotic free'' spiked at
Andronico's Market in San Francisco last week after the Food and
Drug Administration announced plans to tighten its guidelines
regarding antibiotics and livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever something like this comes out on television or in
stories or whatever, it will go full force for a couple of weeks
and then it dies down,'' says Alex Castro, a 14-year veteran of the
Andronico's meat department on Irving Street in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, interest in antibiotic-free meat and poultry has
increased slowly. Sales of those products now make up about 20
percent of the store's meat department sales, he says. Prices of
beef sold as antibiotic-free can be $1 or more per pound higher
than the market's standard beef, and the price can keep some people
from putting the meat in their carts, he says.
</P>
<P>
   At Magnani Poultry in Berkeley, which sells only antibiotic-free
meat and chicken, business is good. And consumers are asking more
questions about how their meat and chicken are raised, co-owner Tim
McCormick says.
</P>
<P>
   That means butchers in turn must ask their purveyors tougher
questions. But with few regulations in place, knowing exactly how
an animal has been treated is tough _ even for meat sellers well
versed in antibiotic use.
</P>
<P>
   Butchers can rely only on wholesalers' promises that animals
have either not eaten antibiotics or were taken off the drugs a
week or two before slaughter, allowing antibiotics to pass from
their bodies, McCormick says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 50 million pounds of antibiotics produced annually in
America, about 40 percent are given to animals. Most of that goes
into feed to promote growth.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA is expected to tighten its system for approving new
antibiotics for animals and for monitoring the effects of drugs
already in use. The concern is that antibiotic use in animals can
lead to drug-resistant strains of bacteria. People in the United
States increasingly have fallen victim to drug-resistant bacterial
infections _ a problem some researchers attribute to the overuse of
antibiotics in humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
   The new FDA guidelines aren't expected for two years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pity the Pyramid &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In case you weren't confused enough about what the government
wants you to eat, note that a new version of the mother of all
federal food guidelines comes your way this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Every five years, the U.S. departments of Agriculture and Health
and Human Services revise the nation's dietary guidelines, which
serve as the cornerstone of federal nutrition policies and are used
to design school lunch menus and build the nation's food pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   The current pyramid is based on grains, suggesting a daily
intake of six to 11 servings for a healthy adult. Fruits and
vegetables come next, followed by high-protein food, such as meats,
nuts and legumes. Dairy follows. Fats and sweets top the pyramid.
</P>
<P>
   A number of groups want to influence the outcome of the
nutrition guideline committee's work, which is set for release in
September. In a series of press conferences and testimony at last
week's public hearing on the guidelines in Washington, D.C.,
various nutrition agendas were pushed. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ A coalition of more than 20 groups, including the American
Heart Association and the American Cancer Society, want the pyramid
to center on vegetables and fruits rather than grains. Elizabeth
Pivonka, a registered dietitian and president of Produce for Better
Health Foundation, says America suffers from a growing ``vegetable
deficit.'' Her organization has found only 17 percent of foods most
Americans eat at lunch are fruits, vegetables or 100 percent juice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nutritionists and advocates for the elderly suggest a new
pyramid to reflect the dietary needs of people over 70. That
pyramid, say nutritionists at Tufts University, should be based on
eight glasses of water to compensate for a reduced thirst
mechanism. It also suggests more fiber, special attention to
calcium to prevent bone loss and smaller portion sizes to reflect
the elderly's reduced energy needs.
</P>
<P>
   A prototype of the pyramid, published in the March issue of The
Journal of Nutrition, shows a small flag waving from the top. The
flag represents supplements of calcium and vitamins D and B-12,
three nutrients in which the elderly are often deficient.
</P>
<P>
   _ The pyramid should incorporate the needs and habits of a
broader range of ethnic groups, some advocates say. Physicians for
Responsible Medicine argues that the inclusion of three servings of
dairy products ignores the fact that many people with African,
Asian, Native American or Latino roots are lactose-intolerant.
Other nutritionists have created various ethnically customized food
pyramids, and argue the new guidelines should better reflect the
way non-whites eat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food safety tips should be included in the dietary guidelines,
representatives of the Clinton administration say. The guidelines
should teach Americans not only what to eat, but also how to handle
food. Medical expenses and lost productivity while people recover
from food-borne illness cost the country between $6.6 billion and
$37 billion annually, Catherine Woteki, Clinton's undersecretary
for food safety, told the panel.
</P>
<P>
   How all this will affect the panel's recommendations is
anybody's guess. So is whether Americans will respond at all to the
intricate new set of guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Says Janet King, director of the USDA Western Human Nutrition
Research Center in San Francisco: ``Eventually, in perhaps a
decade, we will have customized food pyramids.'' Until then, she
says, Americans who can't keep up with all the suggested changes in
the guidelines could follow a simple formula. Start by eating at
least five servings of fruit and vegetables a day, eat some sort of
calcium-rich food with every meal and lay off the fat.
</P>
<P>
   People who want to comment on changes in the nation's nutrition
guidelines can submit written comments to Shanthy Bowman,
Department of Agriculture Nutrient Data Laboratory, 4700 River
Road, Unit 89, Riverdale, MD 20737.

   If the stream of reports about food and health have you
terrified of eating anything, you might want to zip over to the
FoodSafe Web site, produced by the Department of Food Science and
Technology at the University of California at Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Not only can you find out about food safety and read a flurry of
food research, you also can discover the song stylings of the
program's director.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Winter, who makes his living as a food toxicologist,
rewrites rock lyrics to reflect the nation's food fears and make
food safety a little more palatable.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles' ``I Wanna Hold Your Hand'' becomes ``You Better
Wash Your Hands.'' The BeeGees' ``Stayin' Alive'' becomes an ode to
food poisoning: ``You can tell by the way I chose my food/I'm a
worried guy, in a cautious mood.'' And how about this Village
People hit? ``It's fun to work with the USDA.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bay Area classrooms now playing the CDs, you can
catch Winter's act next week at the Hard Rock Cafe in Baltimore,
where he is the headliner for an Institute of Food Technologists
conference.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Aperto Bathes Mussels in a Vibrant Sea  
   
   
 By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Few dishes are better _ and easier to prepare _
than mussels. In most cases, they are steamed, but at Aperto they
are baked, which produces a vibrantly flavored dish that looks as
good as it tastes.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The seafood is flavored with fennel, bright dots of cherry
tomatoes and arugula. The wine and butter that are used as a sauce
become even better when mingled with the natural juices from the
mussels and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   At Aperto, the mussels are cooked in the oven and transferred to
the stove top simply to reduce the juices and concentrate the
flavors.
</P>
<P>
   These can make an impressive starter to any meal, or for an
informal get-together they can become the main course. They're
especially good accompanied by crisp roasted or fried potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   It's this casual type of dish, crafted by Chris Shepherd, that
has made Aperto on Potrero Hill a popular hangout. The storefront
space, with an open kitchen carved out of one corner, is always
crowded and has a comfortable homelike quality.
</P>
<P>
   At Aperto, you'll find several signature dishes, including an
excellent roast chicken with preserved lemons, warm prawns with
cannellini beans and more than a half dozen pastas. It's this type
of vibrant food that you'll find all over Italy but with a lighter
California twist.

caramelize. Add the mussels, cherry tomatoes and wine; bring to a
quick boil. Remove from heat. Spread the arugula over the mussels,
dot with butter and season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Place the pan in the oven and bake for 5 to 7 minutes, until the
mussels open. Remove pan from the oven and place over medium heat.
Boil until the liquid has reduced slightly, about 2 minutes.
Discard any mussels that have not opened.
</P>
<P>

 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The layer cake, an American icon, is in dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   Decades of supermarket cake mixes have inflicted some real harm
at home, of course. Most bakeries, with their airy cakes frosted in
sugared shortening, have simply failed to hold up their end of the
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   And high-end restaurants, where the layer cake once played such
a proud role, have left it for dead, a casualty of the war among
today's dueling pastry chefs. Even the wave of heart-warming
comfort food that carried mashed potatoes and roast chicken back
into the restaurant mainstream just rolled right by.
</P>
<P>
   The neglect in restaurants, at least, isn't completely
irrational. A whole cake, resplendent on its pedestal, concealing
the pastry and filling within, radiates potential and drama. But
that's not how it's presented in a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole movement against serving just a slice of
cake on a plate started quietly in Europe,'' said Timothy Moriarty,
a co-author of ``Grand Finales: The Art of the Plated Dessert (Van
Nostrand Reinhold, 1997). ``It used to be that desserts were served
from a cart, and the presentation was up to the waiter. Pastry
chefs wanted more control, and assembling desserts at the last
minute allowed them to serve fresher creations that also looked
great. Now, individually plated desserts are the norm. It's what
people expect.''
</P>
<P>
   The wedge of layer cake _ with its precisely contrasted flavors
and textures, its perfect proportion of crumb to buttercream _ is a
stellar representative of confectionary harmony. But it's just no
dazzler.
</P>
<P>
   Tish Boyle, the author of ``Diner Desserts,'' scheduled to be
published by Chronicle Books next year, said: ``There's not much
you can do with a slice of layer cake. But at the same time,
there's no hiding behind fancy garnishes, either _ a slice of cake
has to stand on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   At today's prices _ and at the current level of competition in
pastry kitchens _ it takes a confident chef to give it a try.
</P>
<P>
   Such people do exist. Some brazen it out, serving a wedge of
cake surrounded by more spectacular offerings, others disguise it
if they feel they have to or serve it on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer McClintick, the pastry chef at Zoe in SoHo, serves a
terrific slice of layer cake, her take on Ebinger's famous
chocolate blackout cake. But she only makes the classic version for
lunch, when a wedge is presented on a plate in all its austere
glory, a sublime melding of dark cocoa layers, thick chocolate
blackout filling and smooth icing dusted with nubby cake crumbs.
</P>
<P>
   Then she loses her nerve as the day wears on.
</P>
<P>
   Evening customers are served not the iconic slice but rather
individual little cakes. The components are the same _ cake,
filling, frosting, crumbs _ but the effect of the small round cake
is entirely different. Now, it seems to be encased in too much
frosting, since more is needed to ice around the sides. The crumbs
seem too prominent. The dessert tastes sweeter and feels mushier in
the mouth than the lunchtime archetype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely a fan of layer cakes,'' said Martin Howard, who
was the pastry chef at the Rainbow Room and is now at the Blackbird
Restaurant and Bar, which is due to open in midtown next month.
``But if you serve them, you have to disguise them. At Rainbow, we
stood a slice of chocolate layer cake on its end with the point up,
then put a chocolate sculpture of 30 Rockefeller Plaza in front and
a creme anglaise road going around the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Fleming, the pastry chef at Gramercy Tavern, serves
layer cakes, but only when she must.
</P>
<P>
   She won't make one, she said, unless someone orders it for a
birthday. And then it's barely recognizable. For those parties
(there are about eight a month), Ms. Fleming has been making an
orange genoise filled with blood-orange curd and covered with
swirled meringue frosting, which is torched at the last minute like
a baked alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cake looks like a giant toasted marshmallow,'' Ms. Fleming
said, ``and that makes it a little more special than the average
layer cake.''
</P>
<P>
   And in honor of the occasion, the cake is served whole, which
makes for a stunning presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for layer-cake lovers, there are still some chefs who
dare to serve them all the time. Larry Forgione, the chef and owner
of An American Place and the Coach House in Manhattan, has been
offering his grandmother's recipe for chocolate fudge cake since An
American Place opened in 1983. ``Every time we've tried to take it
off the menu,'' he said, ``our customers threaten to riot.''
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of a layer cake, said Ira Freehof, the owner of the
two Comfort Diners in Manhattan, is its simplicity in an age that
reveres the complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need blueprints to figure out how to deconstruct our
desserts _ you just stick your fork in and eat,'' he said. ``Plus,
I talk to my customers, and everyone seems to have stories and
memories about layer cakes, which makes it nostalgic. Who's going
to have a childhood memory about a chocolate sculpture of New York
City on a plate?'' Freehof sells 500 slices of cake a week.
</P>
<P>
   But the way things are going, if the genuine layer cake is going
to survive, a few professional mavericks aren't likely to be its
saviors. It's time for the home cook to go back to the first
principles _ and start from scratch.

FROM GRAVY TO JUS, NOW `AMISH' IS TRENDY

 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For centuries, the word ``Amish'' has been associated with
devout religious belief, barn raisings and Kelly McGillis churning
butter for Harrison Ford. Now it has a new connotation.
</P>
<P>
   Just listen to Mark Spangenthal, the chef at the Screening Room,
explaining why he brought his Amish chicken dish from the Markham,
his old restaurant, to his new restaurant: ``There is nothing more
American than the word `Amish,''' he said. ``I don't want to say
`sexy.' Sexy isn't the right word. But it looks real nice on the
menu.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not the only chef turned on by Amishness. At Follonico,
Amish chicken for two is a recurring special, either pan-roasted in
the wood-burning oven with fresh herbs or _ in a strangely
cross-cultural locution _ fricasseo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've caught a little flak when we've run it on the menu,''
Follonico's chef and owner, Alan Tardi, said. ``People say: `You're
supposed to be an Italian restaurant. What are you doing with Amish
chicken?'''
</P>
<P>
   A valid question. It appears that New York foodies have come to
see ``Amish'' as the ultimate simple-chic approbation, the
gustatory equivalent of antiquing in Lancaster County, Pa. They may
have picked it up from high-end meat purveyors, who like to
advertise the Amish origins of their fowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Complete Meat Cookbook'' (Houghton Mifflin, $35) notes the
new popularity of Amish pork. And the Amish Manhattan Farmers
Market, which opened its second store a year ago at 240 East 45th
Street, will hang its third horse-and-buggy shingle at the World
Trade Center in May.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the Amish market's owners are from Turkey or
that the store is stocked with non-Amish staples like balsamic
vinager, Froot Loops and Perrier. Never mind that many Amish
chickens are raised no better than Frank Perdue's, or that even if
the menu says ``Amish,'' the birds can come from almost any farm in
Lancaster County. For all that diners know, they could be eating
Shaker-bake.
</P>
<P>
   So what exactly does ``Amish'' mean, in a culinary context?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a marketing ploy,'' said Ariane Daguin, co-owner of
D'Artagnan, a Newark-based supplier of Amish chicken to New York
restaurants and markets. ``It doesn't mean anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The mystique of the Amish label, Ms. Daguin said, comes from its
``aura of naturalness,'' though chickens raised on Amish farms do
not always eat vegetarian feed. Nor are they free-range or free
roaming.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Aidells, co-author with Denis Kelly of the ``Complete Meat
Cookbook,'' is a devotee of Amish meat products. ``I don't know if
it has more fat in it or what,'' he said of Amish pork he ate in
Bern, Ind. ``But it has a wonderful taste, a real nice pork
flavor.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to describe that flavor, Aidells offered the word
``porkiness.'' He also recalls fondly the Amish chicken at the
now-closed David Ruggerio restaurant, which had a taste that he
called ``chickeny.''
</P>
<P>
   Tardi of Follonico agrees that the virtues of Amish chickens are
hard to pin down. ``There's all this talk about free-range and
organic, and this isn't that,'' he said. ``But it is minimally
processed, with no hormones. It's a chicken with morals.''
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily. Phyllis Pellman Good, the author of ``The Best
of Amish Cooking'' (Good Books, 1988), who is a Mennonite (the sect
from which the Amish broke in the 17th century), says that Amish
chickens, contrary to popular belief, are not free-range.
</P>
<P>
   ``They lead pretty confined lives,'' she said. How about hormone
injections? ``There's a range from quite cautious to full
participation in that type of technology,'' she said. ``They're way
beyond little nests in quaint barns.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the origin of Follonico's ``Amish'' chicken, Tardi
acknowledged, ``I can't vouch for the fact that it was produced by
Amish people in black hats and no buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   At the River Cafe, Amish chicken is served with Yukon Gold
whipped potatoes, Blue Lake green beans and button mushrooms in a
chicken jus. Peter Demers, the restaurant's steward, said that, of
the Amish chickens he buys, ``the majority are from Amish
farmers,'' but that ``some might be Mennonites, too.'' Such
distinctions apparently fall off the trucks from Pennsylvania. And
``Mennonite chicken'' (italics)is(end italics) a bit of a mouthful.
</P>
<P>
   But the River Cafe's Amish chicken is a distant city cousin to
the simple country dish served in Lancaster County. Ms. Good
approved of the potatoes and greens as side dishes, but not the
mushrooms, which are not grown by the Amish. ``If you have them,
they come out of the can,'' she said. ``And we would never say
`jus.' It's gravy. Thick, not that watery stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Few Amish people, restricted by their religion and cultural
inclination from straying far from Pennsylvania Dutch country, make
the trek to New York to sell their wares. One exception is David
Wengerd, an Amish farmer who has been commuting here from central
Pennsylvania since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He and his 11 children operate stands at Columbus Circle,
Federal Plaza and the Union Square Greenmarket. Five years ago,
Wengerd said, he gave up a store on the west side of Union Square
when the rent went from $12,000 to $18,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In his straw hat and black corduroy jacket with hooks in place
of buttons, Wengerd certainly looked like the real thing. He had a
gray goatee and fantastic set of teeth. ``It doesn't bother me,''
he said of the casual way in which the adjective ``Amish'' is
thrown around. ``The Amish philosophy is live and let live. People
would like us to do something about it. But it would be completely
against our religion. We don't believe in fighting against
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Good said that these quiet, pacifist people just don't take
their food seriously enough to get upset about the use and abuse of
their good name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here in Amish country,'' she said, ``the emphasis is on lots
of food mildly seasoned. Presentation is way down in the order of
importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Here in Amex country, it's the other way around.

   LAS VEGAS _ ``Would you care for some wine, sir?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'd like a bottle of the 1990 Mondavi Reserve cabernet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Excellent choice, sir. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll adjust
my harness and go up and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene is Aureole, the desert branch of Charlie Palmer's
highly regarded restaurant in New York. While the original Aureole
is elegant and understated, the version here in the new Mandalay
Bay Hotel is ... well, pure Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, the wine tower. Four stories of stainless
steel, glass and plexiglass, it is a wine cellar in reverse,
soaring 42 feet over the bar. Clearly the star of the show, it
holds _ and strikingly displays _ some 9,000 bottles of wine.
</P>
<P>
   The wine steward going for a bottle of cabernet or Champagne
will crawl into a harness that is hooked onto hoists on the sides
of the tower and be lifted swiftly to the correct level. The
harness is equipped with an intercom and up and down controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, it's theatrical,'' said Steven Geddes, the hotel's
director of wine, ``but it's also functional: 10 seconds to the
top, 10 seconds back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Move over, Paris. Move over, New York. When it comes to wine,
Las Vegas is the place to be: a city with an unquenchable thirst.
</P>
<P>
   The competition among hotel wine buyers is fierce and is
expected to intensify as half a dozen new luxury hotels and
casinos, including the Paris and the Venetian, are completed. ``We
go through a case of first growths every weekend,'' said Barrie
Larvin, the wine director at the Rio Hotel, referring to five of
the top Bordeaux chateaus: Haut-Brion, Latour, Margaux,
Lafite-Rothschild and Mouton-Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   The casino patrons who have created this demand bring a certain
high-living swagger, if not connoisseurship, to their enjoyment of
wine. But they're not getting any bargains. Wine prices in Las
Vegas are comparable to those in New York and Los Angeles,
especially in high-end restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   What is exceptional is the extraordinary range of wines. Few
restaurants in the world offer such variety.
</P>
<P>
   At the new Bellagio Hotel, the wine director, Jay James, buys 34
pallets of wine a week, each holding 56 cases. During high tourist
season, he sells 900 bottles a day.
</P>
<P>
   At the Las Vegas outpost of Smith &AMP; Wollensky, the New York
steakhouse, Michael Feighery, the manager, shakes his head at the
demand. ``We've only been open a couple of months and we can't
restock wine fast enough,'' he said. ``And everyone wants
three-liter bottles.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol has always fueled the action here; scantily clad
waitresses circulating among the players and serving free drinks
are as much a tradition as the gaming tables and the slots. But gin
and vodka, not wine, were the beverages of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Most Las Vegans trace the interest in wine to the opening of a
branch of Wolfgang Puck's Los Angeles restaurant Spago in the Forum
at Caesars in 1993. Its almost instant success persuaded casino
operators that the rules had changed, that the days of stiff drinks
and bland food were over. ``Las Vegas has always offered two
things: gambling and entertainment,'' said James at the Bellagio.
Now, he said, ``food and wine here are entertainment.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first hotel to commit to a major wine program was the Rio, a
gaudy skyscraper set apart from the rest of the hotels on Las Vegas
Boulevard, the so-called Strip, by Interstate 15. The Rio, which is
also home to Jean-Louis Palladin's Napa Restaurant, hired Larvin in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Larvin, 51, got involved with wine at age 18, when he went to
work at the Dorchester Hotel in London. In the early 1970s he was
named Britain's sommelier of the year three times. Now he buys
wine, lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought wine secretly for three months,'' he said, explaining
that he did not want to push prices up by letting purveyors know
the hotel he worked for had deep pockets. ``At one point I was
bringing in 15,000 bottles of wine a day. We went to 600 labels,
then we went to 2,000.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he paid just over $1 million for 127 bottles of Chateau
d'Yquem, the most famous of the sweet wines of Sauternes. The
collection consisted of one bottle of every vintage of Yquem from
1855 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas hotels are becoming important in the wine auction
market. The biggest auction in recent years was the sale of Andrew
Lloyd Webber's cellar at Sotheby's in London in 1997. Larvin bought
about a quarter of the collection.
</P>
<P>
   Larvin values his cellar, assembled in less than three years, at
more than $6 million. ``When we opened the new wine cellar in 1997,
I thought I had enough wine for 10 years,'' he said. ``I was
reordering in 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Though less flamboyant, perhaps, than Larvin, Geddes at Aureole
and James at Bellagio have remarkable wine lists of their own.
Aureole's list offers 19 vintages of Mouton-Rothschild between 1900
and 1995, including 1945, 1959 and 1961. Also listed are 64
different zinfandels, 114 cabernet sauvignons and, for something
completely different, an extensive choice of Austrian wines,
including 30 different gruener veltliners, an Austrian specialty.
``We have about 2,000 different wines,'' Geddes said.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Bellagio's master list has 52 chardonnays.
Smith &AMP; Wollensky's wine list is shorter, but the selection is
sophisticated and there is no lack of good wine. The restaurant is
particularly strong in large bottles _ magnums, double magnums and
three-liters.
</P>
<P>
   While the wine lists at the big hotels are large, so is the
number of people ordering wine. The Bellagio, for example, has 11
restaurants, including Vegas versions of Le Cirque 2000 and Il
Circolo, two New York City restaurants, a steakhouse called Prime
directed by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and Picasso, directed by
Julian Serrano, formerly of Masa's in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each restaurant has its own list,'' James said. ``Most have
about 250 labels. Le Cirque has about 400. There are some overlaps
and each can draw on the master list. There is a wine warehouse and
a temperature-controlled vault that keeps 5,000 or 6,000 bottles on
call. We can get any bottle to one of the restaurants in 15
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hotels, the high rollers, big gamblers that every casino
woos, can order any wine they want and often get it free. Sometimes
they ask for bottles the wine staffs would like to hold for
connoisseurs, or just to dress up the wine list. The high rollers
have priority. ``Casino marketing calls,'' James said. ``I get them
what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   He would, of course, prefer to sell his wine. ``Someone comes
here, wins $100,000, maybe $1 million, we're happy to sell him
$30,000 worth of wine,'' James said. ``It keeps some of that money
in the house.''

THE TORTILLA AS OMELET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Spanish tortilla has nothing in common with the Mexican
tortilla except its shape and its name. The first tortilla is just
a bread. The other can be an appetizer, a snack, even a light meal.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spanish tortilla has another advantage: Because it is
better at room temperature than it is hot, it should be made in
advance, anywhere from 15 minutes to a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   In its most basic form, the tortilla is a potato and egg
open-faced omelet that derives most of its flavor from olive oil.
Onions or scallions can replace the potato in part or entirely, as
can cooked greens like chard. Pepper strips are good when sauteed
in the oil, and small bits of chorizo, cooked bacon or shrimp, or
prosciutto can be stirred into the eggs. Just make sure that any
additions are either sauteed in olive oil or thoroughly drained.
</P>
<P>
   Tortillas are best when cooked over moderate heat from start to
finish. The potatoes are first fried until tender in olive oil,
then combined with eggs and cooked to form a cake that is flipped
once to cook on both sides. A nonstick skillet works best.
</P>
<P>
   The only hard part is turning the partly formed tortilla, but
just do it swiftly and carefully. The worst that will happen is
that a little potato and egg will be left behind when you return
the cake to the skillet. If you can't bring yourself to risk the
flip, just slide the pan into a 375-degree oven until the eggs are
completely set but not overcooked.
</P>
<P>
   SPANISH TORTILLA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 40 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 pounds potatoes, 3 or 4 medium
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   6 extra-large or jumbo eggs.
</P>
<P>
   1. Peel and thinly slice potatoes and onions; it's easiest if
you use a mandoline. Meanwhile, heat oil in an 8- or 10-inch
nonstick skillet over medium heat. After 3 or 4 minutes, drop in a
potato slice. When tiny bubbles appear around its edges, add
potatoes, onions, a good pinch of salt and a liberal sprinkling of
pepper. Gently turn mixture in oil with a wooden spoon, and adjust
heat so oil bubbles lazily.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cook, turning potatoes gently every few minutes, until they
are tender when pierced with a small knife. Adjust the heat so they
do not brown. If potatoes begin to break, they are overdone; stop
cooking immediately. As potatoes cook, beat eggs with some salt and
pepper in a large bowl.
</P>
<P>
   3. Drain potatoes in a colander, reserving oil. Wipe out
skillet, and heat over a medium flame for a minute. Add 2
tablespoons oil. Gently mix warm potatoes with eggs, and add to
skillet. As soon as edges firm up, after a minute or so, reduce
heat to medium-low. Cook 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   4. Insert a rubber spatula all around edges of tortilla to make
sure it will slide from pan. The top will still be runny. Carefully
slide out onto a plate. Cover with another plate, and holding
plates tightly, invert them. Add another tablespoon oil to skillet,
and use the spatula to coax tortilla back in. Cook 5 minutes, then
slide from skillet onto a clean plate. Serve warm (not hot), or at
room temperature. Do not refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 3 main-course or 6 appetizer servings.

UPSTATE NEW YORK MAY GET FARE RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 21)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flying between New York City and upstate New York, which can
cost more than flying across the Atlantic, may get cheaper this
fall, because investors in a proposed discount airline are working
with a variety of elected officials to bring fares down. But there
are formidable obstacles to the plan, and leisure travelers may not
benefit nearly so much as last-minute travelers paying full coach
fare. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High air fares are a hot business and political issue upstate,
where Rochester has the fourth-highest air fares in the country,
while Buffalo and Syracuse are among the 20 most expensive,
according to Transportation Department data.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a recent search of air fares for tickets bought on short
notice, it typically cost $384 to fly from Albany to La Guardia
Airport and back the same day, or $1.39 a mile, while a same-day
round trip from Albany to Miami on most lines cost $468, 19 cents a
mile.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat,
said that a subcommittee of the Economic Development Committee will
be named in a few weeks to look into the situation and that a staff
member was already collecting economic data. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Silver's inquiry follows complaints by corporations upstate that
they are being gouged by the airlines. Eastman Kodak recently
relocated some sales people from Rochester to Atlanta to take
advantage of lower fares and more frequent service.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Upstate business and political leaders say the city whose air
fares has attracted their interest is Providence, R.I., where the
arrival in 1996 of the biggest and strongest low-fare carrier,
Southwest, sent all carriers' average fares plummeting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Southwest has shown little interest in upstate New York. But a
group of investors, including George Soros, filed in February to
start a discount airline that would use Kennedy International
Airport as a hub. David Neeleman, the entrepreneur who has raised
$130 million to start the airline, said he had promised that
Buffalo, Rochester or Syracuse would be the first city his airline
served.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neeleman's airline does not have a name yet. But after he picks
one, the airline faces the daunting task of persuading travelers
that its fares are low enough to make it worth traveling via
Kennedy instead of La Guardia, which is closer to Manhattan.
Neeleman says Kennedy has fewer flight delays, which would
compensate for the longer and costlier taxi ride. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The proposed new airline has powerful allies. In Washington,
Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer, both Democrats,
and four upstate representatives have asked Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater to do whatever is necessary to insure
low-cost air service for upstate cities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Their Jan. 20 letter came three and a half months after a small
low-cost carrier, Eastwind Airlines, gave up on Rochester after
about two months of service to Boston, Trenton, Dulles Airport near
Washington and Greensboro, N.C. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   United and US Airways say their prices are fair and competitive.
Richard Weintraub, a spokesman for US Airways, said upstate fares
were high because most flights are under 300 miles and costs per
mile fall as the length of flights increases. He said that the
costs of operating 250-mile flights _ roughly the distance from
Rochester to Philadelphia or Syracuse to Boston _ were about 25
percent more per mile than 300-mile flights and about twice as
costly per mile as 1,000-mile flights.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   US Airways and United call the Transportation Department
air-fare data misleading because city pairs with mostly business
travelers have higher average fares than those with mostly leisure
travelers. ``Average fares appear high for Buffalo, Rochester and
Syracuse because most passengers are on business fares,'' Weintraub
said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Louise Slaughter, a Rochester Democrat who has been
complaining that high fares are strangling business upstate, said:
``Fares in western New York are subsidizing fares in other parts of
the country that have low-cost competition. Fares really aren't
going to come down until we get competition.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tony Molinaro, a spokesman for United, denied that his airline
used high fares out of upstate New York to subsidize fares
elsewhere. But his remarks also lent support to the congresswoman's
point. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We set prices according to a number of factors: supply and
demand, population base in two cities, overhead costs such as
landing fees, aircraft expenses, and competition is another big
piece,'' he said. ``To know if fares are high or not I would have
to know what the competition is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``But to compare upstate New York to Chicago to, say, Salt Lake
City to Denver or Albuquerque to Denver would not be reasonable
because of competition in those markets from Southwest, America
West and other carriers. But it is not like we are looking at the
whole country and saying these are low prices here in Utah so let's
jack them up here in New York.'' &QL;

MCCARTNEY, JOEL, OTHERS HONORED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Bono of U2 said when inducting Bruce Springsteen
into the Rock Hall of Fame Monday: ``It was good night
Haight-Ashbury, hello Asbury Park.'' In a larger-than-life
ceremony, Springsteen led the way this year in a banner class that
included Billy Joel, Paul McCartney, Curtis Mayfield, Del Shannon,
Dusty Springfield, Charles Brown, Bob Wills and His Texas Playboys,
the Staple Singers, and Beatles producer George Martin.
</P>
<P>
   But all eyes were on Springsteen, who was called the ``Buddha of
my youth'' by Bono, who added: ``He's a very unusual rock star,
isn't he? No drug busts, no blood changes in Switzerland . . . no
wearing dresses in his videos, no exhibition of his paintings, and
no public brawlings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend that everyone get an Irishman to do his
induction,'' Springsteen joked of Bono's over-the-top words. Then,
in a healing gesture, Springsteen brought out his E Street Band
(who were not inducted because Bruce's eligibility dated back to
when he was a solo act) and showered each of them with praise _ a
positive morale-booster, since his E Street reunion tour starts
this spring in Europe, followed by summer shows, including one at
the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   Springsteen, who in previous years had inducted Roy Orbison,
Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Bob Dylan to the Rock and Roll
Hall of Fame, also praised his family, especially his recently
deceased father, with whom he often quarreled. ``If everything had
gone great between us, it would have been a disaster for my music.
Can you imagine me doing all happy songs?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he and the E Street Band, showing no rust from their
decade apart, jammed deliriously on classics ``Promised Land,''
``Backstreets,'' and ``Tenth Avenue Freezeout.'' Wilson Pickett
later joined them onstage.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorable night that saw the biggest press corps in the
event's history (250 media reps jammed into the press room) and a
sold-out crowd of 1,500 industry types paying from $1,500 to $2,500
per ticket, the other show-stoppers were the inductions of Joel and
McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Charles did the honors for Joel, saying, ``I genuinely love
and respect this man.'' Joel talked about growing up on Long
Island, where blacks were discouraged from getting housing and
``the only soul you could get was from the radio, listening to Ray
Charles, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Wilson Pickett, and Otis
Redding.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called derivative,'' Joel added. ``And I'm damned
guilty. I'm derivative as hell. If derivative people were excluded
from the Rock Hall of Fame, there wouldn't be any white people
here.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar boost for black artists was voiced by Bonnie Raitt
when she inducted West Coast R &AMP; B pianist Charles Brown. ``Honor
him by getting payback for some of the artists who put us in this
room tonight,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   McCartney, who had previously been inducted as a member of the
Beatles, was inducted for his post-Beatles solo career. Neil Young
gave the induction speech, praising McCartney for being ``simple
and clear . . . and making no attempt to compete with what he had
done before.'' McCartney dedicated his award to his late wife,
Linda, who died last year of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Elton John inducted '60s singer Dusty Springfield, who died
March 2 of breast cancer. ``I was so touched by her voice and I
loved her beehive hairdo, the pink top, and the purple skirt. It
had no effect on me whatsoever!'' he said, tongue in cheek. Melissa
Etheridge then belted out Springfield's 1968 hit,
``Son-of-a-Preacher Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Grammy star Lauryn Hill inducted the Staple Singers, praising
their combination of gospel and social-message songs. And rapper
Puff Daddy inducted Curtis Mayfield, adding that he had sampled
much of Mayfield's music for his own tunes. ``He had a sense of the
holy and the sting of the truth,'' he said. Eric Clapton and
D'Angelo then combined to sing Mayfield's ``Keep On Pushin'.''
</P>
<P>
   Del Shannon was inducted by Art Alexakis, lead singer of
Everclear, and George Martin by rock producer Jimmy Iovine.

IN FRENCH WINE COUNTRY, GOOD EATING, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 21)  
 (bl)  
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vineyards command the horizon along the Rhone River from Avignon
to Lyons and, farther north, in Burgundy. In winter, of course,
there are no grapes, or even vines. They've been pruned back,
leaving only thick, gnarled stalks, rising a twisted foot or so
above the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Like their vines, the French of the wine country seem to pass
the cold weather in a state of dormancy. Aside from a wispy fire to
burn cuttings or a lone worker trudging the fields, the land
appears deserted. But look closer and you see light dancing through
the cracks of the farmhouse shutters, smoke pouring from the
chimneys. Though hidden away, pots continue to be stirred.
</P>
<P>
   On a midwinter trip with three friends to visit wineries in the
Rhone Valley and Burgundy, many of the more celebrated restaurants
_ those with Michelin stars _ had cut back their hours or were
closed for vacation. Yet, it's also a season of great eating, with
lots of game, hearty stews and, of course, truffles. (In spring,
menus change to offer lighter fare.)
</P>
<P>
   Where to go? We asked the winemakers for recommendations, and
they were happy to oblige. They suggested some unpretentious
restaurants that don't require a lot of time or cost a lot of
money, where workers in jeans are as welcome as executives in ties.
These restaurants serve robust, unfussy food, and, as a bonus,
almost always have excellent wine lists. Here are five, moving
south to north.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant St.-Hubert
</P>
<P>
   This friendly, pleasant restaurant in Entrechaux, northeast of
Gigondas, focuses on fresh game in winter. Heads of wild boar, stag
and mountain goat dominate the bright dining room, where a
fireplace warms the cold marble floor. Unlike many places that
serve frozen game, in which the flavor has been dulled and the
texture toughened, St.-Hubert uses only fresh game from various
parts of France, which it dresses itself.
</P>
<P>
   To get properly in the spirit, you might start with a seasonal
specialty, assiette de la foret, a huge portion of game charcuterie
that includes an earthy terrine of wild hare, leathery smoked ham
of baby wild boar, rich smoked breast of wild duck and a dish of
lactaires delicieux mushrooms in a light vinaigrette (or, in fall,
cepes). Alternatives to game include excellent foie gras de canard
or a truly luxurious dish, brioche aux truffes and foie gras. You
are served what looks like an ordinary brioche, but the top is
hinged. Open it up and dig out a soft-cooked egg with truffles and
strips of luscious duck liver. As you eat, the egg is absorbed by
the bread until it becomes extraordinarily soft, like baby food for
grown-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Main courses in winter include a selection of civets, or game
stews, made with deep, hearty sauces of red wine and the blood of
the animal. The wild boar civet is tender and mellow, with a warm,
lingering aftertaste, while venison _ from a biche, or doe, to be
precise _ has a stronger, more pronounced flavor. Selle de
chevreuil, or saddle of venison, in a creamy grand veneur sauce is
gamier than the farm-raised American version, while the meat of the
perdreau, or partridge, is wonderfully flavored underneath its
brittle skin. The bird is split for two people, and served with
bacon, bay leaves and roasted garlic. As good as the partridge was,
it was also a little dry.
</P>
<P>
   The dessert selection is not memorable. Instead finish the meal
with a cheese course, which might include a pungent Roquefort, a
wedge of nutty Reblochon, and three different chevres: a soft,
fresh disk, a slightly more flavorful semiripened sample and a
gloriously well-aged slice, hardened and subtly yet powerfully
flavored.
</P>
<P>
   While most of these places have great wine lists, St.-Hubert is
the inexplicable exception. The restaurant has the wines of the
southern Rhone at its fingertips, but its list is sadly mediocre.
</P>
<P>
   La Beaugraviere
</P>
<P>
   With salmon-colored walls and tablecloths and a floor of beige
industrial tile, this resolutely plain restaurant near Bollene has
all the charm of a car rental office. The dining room's sole
enticing feature, a big fireplace, is blocked from view by a table
right in front of it. What draws people to La Beaugraviere is not
its looks but its specialty: truffles, and lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant not only offers three special truffle menus from
December through March, it also offers 18 truffle dishes a la carte
in winter (dropping to five the rest of the year), including
truffle ice cream, which, at $17 or so a scoop, I decided to
forego. I didn't want to overdo it, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the truffle menus are paragons of restraint. The least
expensive of the truffle menus, about $67, offers three truffle
courses, plus cheese and dessert. The starters include either
pumpkin veloute with truffle shavings, which give the creamy soup a
decadent edge, or eggs softly scrambled with truffles, my choice
for swooning over their rich, intoxicating flavor.
</P>
<P>
   The menu comes with a mid-course of chicken cannelloni in a
Parmesan-and-cream sauce, with truffles, of course, which elevate
this prosaic dish to unexpected heights. The main course, a thick
hunk of broiled veal under a shroud of truffles, is a sensuous
blend, while a side dish of tiny round potatoes with truffles is a
glorious expression of the humble tuber and fungus, adorned with a
little olive oil and coarse salt.
</P>
<P>
   The nontruffle choices are even more interesting. A $34 menu
centers around lievre a la royale, magnificently gamy wild hare
stuffed with ground liver and herbs, tasting of the forest and the
earth. For just $23, the meal might include lamb's feet wrapped in
tripe, a wonderfully mellow, homey dish that I loved.

   La Beaugraviere offers a huge selection of Rhone wines,
including, on the moderate side, a silky berry-scented 1995
St.-Joseph from J.L. Grippat for about $42.

<P>
   After a cheese course comes dessert, a delicate apple tart or
the ubiquitous molten chocolate cake, crisp outside and liquidy
inside. Both are fine and, I think, more than a match for truffle
ice cream. Then the correct yet friendly waiter brings a little
treat, dense chocolate pot-au-creme in little glass cups. &QL;

GETTING PAINT OFF CERAMIC TILE SHOULD BE EASY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for Lakeland and all needing; moved Friday in advance
for March 14)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In a condo I bought, someone painted the wall tile in the
bathroom, yellow, of all things, over perfectly acceptable light
blue tiles. Now I am trying to remove the paint. Is there an easy
way to remove the paint, which is peeling badly? How about putting
new tile over the old? The old tile was installed in mud.
</P>
<P>
   DON YOVICSIN, Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. There is no easy way, but chemical paint remover will take
off the paint quite well; and for your purposes, try a less toxic
remover such as Cistristrip. When the stripper softens the paint,
you can scrape most of it off with a putty knife. Apply more
stripper and remove remaining paint by rubbing with fine steel
wool. Wear skin and eye protection when working with stripper, and
provide lots of ventilation. The paint will be difficult to remove
from grout, but you can scrape it off physically. But before you do
all this, take the paint off a few tiles and check for any sanding
marks. Tile should be power sanded before painting, and if you find
any sanding marks, then the tiles are beyond help. Since the paint
is peeling badly, chances are fair that no sanding was done.
</P>
<P>
   If stripping sounds like too much work, you can set new tiles on
the old, using thin-set mortar. The old finish must be power sanded
so the thin-set will stick. When you come to the top of the tile,
the doubled tiles will provide a half-inch shelf. Cover this with
half-inch-wide border tiles or cut regular tile to cover it.
</P>
<P>
   For fixtures such as towel racks, soap holders, and others, you
can butt the new tiles against them and fill the gap with grout
when you grout the rest of the tiles.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way you can remove tiles in a mud job without
tearing out the whole wall and starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Having written all this, it occurs to me that removing the paint
is easier, and if the tiles have not been sanded, the result can be
pretty good for a lot less work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have a puzzle. I get animals down my fireplace flue, they
never come into the fireplace and they always leave. But what if
one goes down the furnace flue and gets killed by the fumes, then
blocks the flue? That could be a big hazard. What can I do about
it?
</P>
<P>
   ED BOOTH, Medford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You have a good point, but animals often stay in flues even
with the burner on, and somehow can back away from the gaseous
stream, or get the hell out in time to continue dear old life. But
you can have peace of mind by having stainless steel chimney caps
installed, covering all flues. These caps, generally installed by
chimney sweeps, keep out animals and water. Just make sure the
critters are out when the caps go on. It's funny; there are
thousands of old and new uncapped chimneys, some with flue liners,
some not, that have never had any animals in them. I don't know
why, but those who do not have critters are just lucky.

   When I.H. of Belmont, Mass. asked if old-fashioned wood storms
were still made and where to get them, the handyman suggested
salvage yards and other dealers in old house things. Such storms
are the type that hang on the outside casing from hooks at the top
of the casing.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what John Miley of Belmont (I hope I got the name right)
wrote: ``I feel compelled to share information with you and the
reader from Belmont. Traditional storm screens and windows are sold
by Midwest Architectural Wood Products Ltd., 300 Trails Road,
Eldridge, IA 52748, phone: 319-285-8000.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, John Miley, for taking the time to write with some
valuable information. That information is going into the handyman's
vast electronic file, even as we speak.

<P>
   The above was good news for I.H., and the handyman has good news
for ``Looking a Long Time'' in Dorchester, Mass., who asked if
there were any toilet seats available with enlarged openings. The
handyman didn't know, so asked, and here's what he found:
</P>
<P>
   Paul MacInnes, who heads up Standard of Lynn, Mass., specialists
in bathrooms and kitchens, wrote: ``Church is coming out later this
year with a seat they call the Jumbo, (no euphemistic approach with
this name). However, it has been designed with larger folks in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not only larger than standard, but has a
larger-than-standard opening. And, MacInnes said, it will fit on a
standard toilet.
</P>
<P>
   It will be introduced in April at the National Kitchen and Bath
Industry Show; after that it should be in plumbing supply shops.

well.

   Restaurant Le Chaudron
</P>
<P>
   Chaudron means kettle, and a bubbling pot is the perfect image
for this boisterous, lively restaurant in Tournon, a prime meeting
spot for local winemakers, who love to share old jokes at full
volume from across the room. At this, they are aided by the owners,
Marc and Dominique Grillon, who welcome everybody with a smile and
leap right into the teasing themselves.
</P>
<P>
   This is no temple of haute cuisine. It is a moderately priced
gathering spot for sampling the local culture with an excellent
wine list specializing, naturally, in the wines of the northern
Rhone. You might find some bargains on the list, like a beautifully
balanced 1992 Hermitage from Alain Graillot for about $37. Or you
might splurge on a more extravagant wine, a lovely, complex 1991
Cornas from A. Clape for about $53.
</P>
<P>
   The menu itself requires more careful navigation. Crepinette de
sanglier, a kind of wild boar sausage that has been wrapped in
caul, was extremely dry and was served without the red wine sauce
promised on the menu, but the foie gras de canard was smooth and
creamy. The best main course was a fricassee de pintade, guinea hen
with bacon and braised cabbage, a delicious combination. Magret
with caramelized pear was tender and flavorful, but a civet de
lapin, or rabbit stew, was tough and unexpectedly dry.
</P>
<P>
   A nice plate of local cheeses served with a basket of good bread
is a satisfying ending, perfect with the last sip of wine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Les Tontons
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of restaurants or winemakers in Beaune, the
beautiful little walled city in the heart of Burgundy. Les Tontons,
an inviting restaurant in the center of the city, is a favorite of
the wine trade. Its beige stucco walls are unadorned except for a
big painting of the proprietors, Pepita and Richard Grocat,
superimposed over a background of the city and bearing a basket of
eggs, a plump chicken and bountiful produce. We were greeted warmly
as we stepped in out of a driving rain, feeling as if we had found
a refuge.
</P>
<P>
   The husband-and-wife owners are hands-on. Mrs. Grocat, smiling
and jovial, is unobtrusively attentive, while her husband comes out
of his kitchen every so often to bring out food and help clear
plates. His $26 lunch menu is full of alluring choices,
meticulously prepared with exceptional ingredients. The flavors are
complex yet unrefined, the antithesis of fussy.
</P>
<P>
   A layered loaf of foie gras and Mulard duck confit is a
luxuriously delicious appetizer, sweetened just enough with figs,
while risotto with shrimp and slivers of Parmesan is superb,
animated by a judicious few drops of truffle oil, the texture at
that precise point between dry and creamy. For a $4 supplement
comes another excellent starter, small, sweet scallops,
cross-sectioned and sauteed with a little pile of caramelized
endive.
</P>
<P>
   Main courses included what I regarded as the perfect rainy day
dish, parmentier de boeuf Bourguignon, which is really no more than
a Gallic shepherd's pie, a circular terrine of the beef sandwiched
by pureed potatoes that is marvelously soothing. Ris et mignon de
veau is a more forceful dish of veal and sweetbreads, moistened by
their own juices and complemented by a sweet ragout of salsify.
Pigeonneau, or roasted squab (for a $5 supplement), is the most
powerfully flavored main course. The rich, livery meat is as red as
beef, with a thin layer of glistening fat, and goes beautifully
with sauteed cabbage.
</P>
<P>
   By Burgundian standards, the wine list is reasonably priced. We
drank a fresh 1996 Savigny-les-Beaune Les Narbantons from Ecard for
$31, although there are also many wines for which you can pay much
more.
</P>
<P>
   We skipped the gorgeous cheese plate and indulged in desserts,
including a refreshing baked pear with exceptional nougat ice
cream, and a classic, floating island, that was surprisingly light
and pleasant.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aux Vendanges De Bourgogne
</P>
<P>
   This bright restaurant in Gevrey-Chambertin, on the main road
through the Cote de Nuits is a winemaker's haven. Not only is the
front room decorated with grapevine wallpaper, but the Art Nouveau
ceiling lamps are wrapped in vines. The lamps themselves look like
nothing so much as generous breasts, as if wine were mother's milk.
</P>
<P>
   Aux Vendanges offers a special wine feature as well. Each Monday
it selects three Gevrey-Chambertin wines to sell at cost. We pulled
in for lunch on a Wednesday, but were still able to find some
excellent values on the list, like a simple, spicy 1995 Bourgogne
from Leroy for $21 and a 1993 Marsannay from Bruno Clair for $23.
Even a more expensive choice, like a supple, perfumed 1994
Charmes-Chambertin from Geantet-Pansiot is a terrific buy at $54.
</P>
<P>
   The brief $19 lunch menu is a great deal as well, with a starter
like a sensational galette de pied de porc, a brown buckwheat crepe
wrapped around the incredibly rich, almost gelatinous meat from the
pig's foot. It comes with a small salad and is almost a meal in
itself. The other appetizer selection, a large green salad with
marinated mushrooms, is neither as rich nor as distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Main courses include tender chicken baked in cream sauce with a
heaping portion of preserved morels and a firm, white-fleshed
Mediterranean fish called rascasse, moist and well-cooked, but
again not particularly distinctive. Perhaps the restaurant is
reluctant to upstage its wines.
</P>
<P>
   The menu offers a choice of cheese _ including some hard-to-find
Burgundy specialties such as a lush Soumaintrain fermier _ or
dessert, a terrific pain perdu, a sweet crisp-but-airy slice of
bread. It's proof that French toast really does come from France.
</P>
<P>
   Bill of Fare
</P>
<P>
   These restaurants all accept Visa but not American Express.

REGULAR CHECK-UPS SEEN AS KEY IN FIGHT AGAINST COLON CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE A. SCRUTON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The second-largest cancer killer _ colon cancer _
has a 90 percent survival rate if detected early, yet almost
two-thirds of new cases aren't discovered until the cancer has
invaded other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   American Cancer Society figures present an unsettling snapshot
of colon cancer in 1999. At Stage 2, where the cancer has spread to
the area around the colon, the survival rate (defined as living
five years after diagnosis) declines to roughly 2 in 3.
Thirty-seven percent of the cases are discovered at this point.
</P>
<P>
   When the cancer has moved to other parts of the body _ and 1 in
5 cases are discovered at this advanced stage _ the chances of
living five more years is less than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bright spot is a survival rate of more than 90 percent when
the cancer is discovered at the local phase, or stage 1. Only 37
percent of the cases are diagnosed at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Being pushed this year, however, is an educational program aimed
at both doctors and the general population.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't recommend testing enough,'' said Dr. Gabe Feldman,
director of colon and prostate cancer for the American Cancer
Society. ``Everyone needs this screening at age 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Of cancers that strike both sexes, lung cancer is the biggest
killer, followed by cancer of the colon.
</P>
<P>
   Incidence and mortality rates for African-Americans is higher in
both men and women, with about half that difference being
attributed to diagnosis at a later stage of the cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Without another step in research, Feldman notes, doctors can
save 20,000 to 30,000 lives with earlier colon cancer screening.
``We can stop most of this development, just by using what we know
today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Such early screening can detect polyps, the growths on the
inside of the bowel which are often the precursors to cancer and
which, if removed, ``means the patient won't even get (colon)
cancer,'' he stressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what causes these growths yet,'' said Dr. George
Boyar with Saratoga-Schenectady Gastroenterology Associates in
upstate New York. ``But polyps are very common, especially as you
get older.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Cancer Society, there is a 1-in-1,708
probability of developing colon cancer for those up to age 39. In
the next two decades of life, however, the odds drop to about 1 in
125. Between ages 60 and 79, there is a 1-in-25 chance of a man
developing cancer in the large intestine. For women, the chance is
1 in 32.
</P>
<P>
   What makes colon cancer such an insidious killer is that in its
early stages there are often no symptoms, Feldman said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyar, whose practice does about 1,000 colonoscopys a year, said
colon cancer ``is not detected because there are no active signs. A
lot of the symptoms (for gastrointestinal problems) are the same
and you can have a lot of disease in the colon with no symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of recent studies, however, show there is a good
chance of diagnosis before there are active symptoms. A diagnostic
test, coupled with high survivability when detected in early
stages, is the basis for the new educational push on colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The tool is a simple fecal occult blood test for everyone age 50
and older. Stool samples are collected at home over the course of
three days and taken to the doctor's office. A few drops of a
chemical onto the test strips can show the presence of blood _ one
of the earliest warning signs.
</P>
<P>
   Polyps can get irritated and bleed. Of course, the doctors
noted, blood can also point to other problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the study of 46,000 people in Minnesota over a 20-year
period showed 33 percent fewer deaths from colon cancer in those
who had a yearly fecal occult blood test. Testing just every other
year showed a 21 percent reduction in the death rate.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John H. Bond, co-author of the study, said there is a 35
percent chance of finding a growth in the colon of someone with a
positive test. About 10 percent of those people will have cancer
with the others having precancerous polyps.
</P>
<P>
   Should blood be found, or if there are other indications of
cancer possibility, such as a family history, the doctor will order
a close look. In younger (under 40) people, the No. 1 cause of
bleeding is hemorrhoids, noted Feldman, but a doctor should be
consulted to be sure.
</P>
<P>
   Boyar said the quickest and easiest exam is a sigmoidoscopy,
done in the office. Using a flexible tube with a built-in camera
and lights, the doctor looks at the lower third of the large
intestine. ``If we find something there, the odds are there are
problems further up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other procedure is a colonoscopy, usually done in a hospital
setting, in which a longer tube travels the entire six-foot length
of the large intestine. For this procedure, the patient is in a
drug-induced, relaxed state.
</P>
<P>
   Should any polyps be discovered, a thin wire can be passed
through the instrument, looped over the growth to cut it off. A
later biopsy determines if there is, or was, cancer.
</P>
<P>
   More advanced stages of cancer, which can also be seen with the
colonoscope, require more radical treatment, such as surgery,
chemotherapy or radiation.
</P>
<P>
   While the exact reason for polyp development, and cancer, is
unclear, Feldman noted there are some general trends to note, such
as being overweight, inactivity and ``a typical Western diet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean chili peppers,'' he laughed, noting that diets
rich in fruits and vegetables seem more protective than those with
plenty of red meat.
</P>
<P>
   And family history, he said, is extremely important in colon
cancer. People with a parent or sibling who has colon cancer should
not wait until age 50 to be checked. While non-hereditary colon
cancer rarely occurs before age 40, hereditary colon cancers often
occur in younger people.
</P>
<P>
   Regular examinations can detect polyp growths. Remove the polyp
and remove most chances of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Regular exams for everyone over 50 can also detect polyp
growths, the doctors stressed. ``If you're a man and concerned
about prostate cancer, you should be concerned about colon
cancer,'' Feldman said. ``And for women, to be checked for breast
cancer, get checked for colon cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need this,'' he said. ``Talk to your doctor. Go see him.
This simple test can save lives.''

REAL PENALTIES SHOULD GO TO THOSE STRESSING `ATHLETE' OVER
`STUDENT'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The problem of unfairness and unequal opportunity for potential
participants in college athletics doesn't lie in the minimum
eligibility standards set by the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that easy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies in the failure of this nation's high schools to
adequately educate students so they can meet the admission
requirements at the colleges and universities where they want to
compete. Oh, and hopefully get an education at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It lies with the universities that would be more than happy to
turn a blind eye, if they could, to a potential star's dismal
academic record in order to get him in pads and cleats and on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   It lies with a nation so obsessed with sports that it instills
in too many minority and low-income children the misguided belief
that the only way up and out is to become a professional athlete.
</P>
<P>
   The recent ruling by U.S. District Judge Ronald Buckwalter to
throw out the National Collegiate Athletic Association's system of
using standardized test scores, grade point averages and a
prescribed list of 13 core courses as criteria for athletic
eligibility has the collegiate world once again struggling with
what yardstick to use to ensure that more student athletes
graduate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Student athletes'' _ now there's an oxymoron on far too many
college campuses these days. Let's face it: For many universities,
``student athletes'' are little more than money machines wearing
Nikes. Earning a diploma ranks behind yards gained or dunks slammed
in the revenue-producing sports. A winning football or basketball
team means money.
</P>
<P>
   When the NCAA created Proposition 48 in 1986, which
metamorphosed into Proposition 16 in 1992, the organization had the
best of intentions. Graduation rates for NCAA participants were
unacceptable, and the association looked for a method to help
ensure that more student athletes finished their college days with
a degree. But Buckwalter, whose ruling should not have come as a
surprise to the NCAA, determined that the system
``disproportionately impacted'' African-American students and those
from low-income families.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, I get heartburn over the idea of a sports association,
which has become something of a profit-making athletic cartel in
these days of multimillion-dollar broadcast contracts, dictating
which courses my kid has to take as a high school student before
she can play ball and receive a scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   If the state of Texas determined that my child did the course
work necessary to earn a diploma, and a college somewhere accepts
her based on the academic records it received from her, that should
be more than sufficient for the NCAA's purposes of granting
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   But what do I know? I was a walk-on freshman to the volleyball
team at the University of Kansas in 1974. The NCAA eligibility
requirements then were a high school diploma and a 2.0 GPA. No 13
core courses, no minimum SAT score.
</P>
<P>
   This nation is not bereft of universities that are doing the
right thing and still creating strong athletic followings. Notre
Dame has one of the finest athletic traditions in the country, yet
it doesn't compromise on its academic standards for athletes.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for whatever eligibility standard is finally set
by the NCAA is that honorable institutions are going to do the
right thing, and the not-so-honorable ones are going to find a
million ways around the rules.
</P>
<P>
   And it isn't just the universities finding ways to circumvent
the rules. The cheating starts back in high school for many
students _ and their parents. An underground railroad exists for
talented athletes who may not live in the right attendance zone to
play for the winning high school that's going to attract the eye of
the right recruiters. So Johnny moves in with his cousins to get
around eligibility rules.
</P>
<P>
   There's a bigger problem in America than who's getting college
athletic scholarships and whether an academic nonqualifer has to
sit out his freshman year and is only eligible to play for three
years. As a culture, we perpetuate the fairy tale that everyone who
wants to be Michael Jordan has more than a gnat's chance of making
it. The fantasy starts as early as Little League, where playing for
the sake of playing is replaced with win-at-all-cost pressure. We
glorify the increasingly younger players who go from high school
into the pros. We make heroes out of professional athletes, some of
whom in all honesty aren't very decent human beings.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey taken by the Center for the Study of Sport in
Society reported that 66 percent of all African-American youth
believe they will become professional athletes. Although I would
never advocate crushing a child's dream, somebody is failing these
kids by not opening up their minds to a back-up plan, like getting
an education on the off chance that they aren't the next Michael
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   That is the unfairness and inequity in athletics today.

GENTLE RIVALRY PACKS BIGGER PUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before last weekend, I had planned to do a comparative analysis
using two very unusual rivalries: Matisse and Picasso dueling it
out at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth while Holyfield and
Lewis duked it out at Madison Square Garden in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   I know, it's a big leap _ but I was feeling froggy.
</P>
<P>
   The media hype for the Lewis-Holyfield match raised the level of
boxing fans' anticipation as high as Don King's Afro. In one
corner, the American, Evander Holyfield, who at age 36, was older,
balder, shorter and 31 pounds lighter than his opponent. Yet,
Holyfield was the favorite going into the fight. After all,
Holyfield was a proven warrior. He beat George Foreman and ``Iron''
Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield's opponent, Lennox Lewis of Britain, was young and
cocky, and he appeared in the ring with his dreadlocks pinned up
with bobby pins. I have nothing against dreads, but a French roll
on a fighter is just so ... so unwarriorlike.
</P>
<P>
   So you've got a proven champion who enters the ring singing
hymns vs. a guy with hairpins. Of course, Holyfield was the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite the cornucopia of famous faces encasing King's
canvas like a human frame, the better match was in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Henri Matisse, the great French artist best known for his bold,
colorful paintings, also excelled in sculpture and illustration.
Matisse pursued a career in law before he discovered his talent for
painting at the age of 20. For the next 60 years, he pursued his
passion. The results are so magnificent that people still stand in
long lines to see his works.
</P>
<P>
   Pablo Picasso, Matisse's contemporary, began studying art at a
very young age. He is best known by the general public for his
uncanny ability to transform geometric shapes into colorful,
sensuous women with large hips. He was versatile and prolific like
Matisse. He was also a critic and admirer of Matisse.
</P>
<P>
   Matisse and Picasso engaged in a match of skills that involved
more structure and strategy than strength, yet it was an intense
battle nonetheless. Their one-upmanship left the art world reeling
in its brilliant aftermath.
</P>
<P>
   What is the point of all this? Nothing really. I just liked the
exhibit a lot, and I'm really hoping that big hips become vogue
again. However, I should point out that Lewis, bobby pins and all,
beat up Holyfield as if Holyfield had stolen his mother's purse on
Christmas Eve. I have rarely seen so decisive a fight. Although it
ended in a controversial draw, Lennox was the winner, in my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The boxing world is still reeling from the uppercut to its
credibility. No one would stand in line to see that fight again. I
wouldn't even stand up to see that fight again.
</P>
<P>
   The only real draw was at the Kimbell, where the exhibit billed
as ``A Gentle Rivalry'' left the audience awestruck; unable, and
unwilling, to choose a winner.
</P>
<P>
   The moral of this story is: It costs $8 to see Matisse and
Picasso; it cost between $60 and $10,000 to see Don King's circus.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner by unanimous decision is ...

OUT OF CONTROL WHEN IT COMES TO GUN SAFETY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first it looked like a photograph of Ma Barker somehow got on
the inside pages of The New York Times last week. But even the
infamous mom of a brood of gangsters would have known better.
</P>
<P>
   There stood Dianne Feinstein, the anti-gun senator from
California, posing for all the nation's media to capture on
Kodachrome, holding an AK-47 with her finger firmly planted on the
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a woman so concerned about the supposed recklessness of
gun manufacturers that she's calling for a ban on high-capacity
ammunition magazines _ the justification being little more than
anecdotal evidence _ who wouldn't know firearm safety if it bit her
on the end of her upturned San Franciscan nose.
</P>
<P>
   Any 8-year-old who's ever taken the Eddie Eagle Gun Safety
Program offered by the National Rifle Association knows that one of
the first rules of firearm safety is to never put your finger
inside the trigger guard and on the trigger of a gun unless you
mean to shoot it. Never. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   And there stood one of the poster children for gun control,
exhibiting to the whole world exactly how accidental shootings
happen. The result? The gun manufacturers get blamed for producing
an unsafe product when the responsibility lies with the careless _
or in some cases deliberate _ person who doesn't respect firearms.
</P>
<P>
   It's a safe bet that Feinstein was also violating another rule
of gun safety, but I can't say for sure because of the way that the
photograph was cropped. Judging by the crowd of people gathered
round the senator, it's likely that she had that dreaded assault
rifle pointed at someone.
</P>
<P>
   Never, ever point a firearm, even an unloaded firearm, at
anything you're not willing to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   One of my colleagues overheard my rant about the photograph _
frankly, it would have been nigh onto impossible to ignore me in
our small office, the flames shooting out of my ears were so hot _
and interjected that I might be overreacting just a tad. After all,
he said, the gun was undoubtedly unloaded.
</P>
<P>
   Thereby prompting a lesson on the first and most important rule
of firearm safety: Treat all guns as if they are loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's demonstrated ignorance of how to safely handle a
firearm is proof that state Rep. Suzanna Gratia Hupp is on the
right track with her proposed resolution to encourage Texas schools
to use the Eddie Eagle program to teach youngsters what to do if
they find themselves around a firearm.
</P>
<P>
   The Lampasas Republican is asking her colleagues in the
Legislature to declare Oct. 18-22 as Childrens' Firearm Safety Week
and to encourage schools statewide to use the tested and successful
program to instruct youngsters about the fundamentals of gun
safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Eddie Eagle program teaches children what to do if they see
a gun: Stop, immediately leave the area and tell an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the adult they tell about the firearm is clueless
about how to safely handle it, we still have a problem. But the NRA
has an answer for that scenario as well.
</P>
<P>
   The organization produces an informative booklet called ``Smart
&AMP; Safe: Handling Your New Gun.'' It's designed especially for teens
and for adults with little or no firearm experience. There's also a
10-minute video on the fundamentals of gun safety that's targeted
toward teens and adults, and a brochure that explains parental
responsibilities regarding gun safety for children. All are
produced by the NRA's safety and educational division and can be
ordered by calling (800) 336-7402.
</P>
<P>
   I've been accused of being a shill for the NRA. I make no
apologies for being a member of an organization that fights as hard
for Second Amendment rights as the media fights for the First. I
don't always agree with its tactics _ there's room for negotiation
and compromise on some issues _ but I support the basic mission of
protecting the right of private gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   It's the individual choice of adult Americans as to whether they
want firearms in their homes. You may not want one in your house,
and that's fine. But parents should not be blind to the reality
that their children may come across a firearm somewhere else. Teach
your children to understand that the danger is not the gun but what
can happen if the gun is mishandled.
</P>
<P>
   Accidental shootings would never occur if people would follow
basic, common-sense procedures on how to handle firearms. So,
Dianne, take your finger off the trigger before someone gets hurt.

FISH STICKS AND TARTAR SAUCE FOR GROWN-UPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 This is the seventh of eight columns by Rick Moonen, the executive
chef and an owner of Oceana in Manhattan. His collaborator on these
columns is Dorie Greenspan.  
 By RICK MOONEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I had to choose my one ``desert island'' sauce, the only
sauce I would be allowed to take to a place where I'd have lots of
fish of different varieties, this vinaigrette, highlighting soy,
ginger and orange, would be it. It's an ideal companion to fish
firm or soft, big-flavored or mild. It is easy to make, but it
required the usual balancing act to develop.
</P>
<P>
   When I develop a sauce, whether a simple sauce made from the
cooking juices left in the pan, a butter sauce derived from a
French classic or a modern vinaigrette like this one, I often use
wine as my reference.
</P>
<P>
   A good wine is balanced; its flavors are layered so that its
fullness and complexity are revealed in stages, and its finish is
round and complete. It is that same balance, mystery and pleasure
that I look for in a sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at the components that make wine so satisfying.
There's the acid, which is what you taste first. It opens your
palate, so you can fully appreciate the fruit. Then you get the
fruit and, if there is some residual sugar in the wine, the
sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the real fun begins and the nuances start to come
through. Depending on the grape varietal, where it is from and how
it has been cellared, you will get different flavors. You may get
spice or tropical fruit or earth, the way you often do with pinot
noirs, or what is sometimes referred to as an autumn leaf or
barnyard taste in Burgundies. The wine may be grassy or herbaceous,
like sauvignon blanc, or flinty and tasting like minerals, like
chablis.
</P>
<P>
   After that, you might taste the wine's age, the flavors
associated with the grape's development and the wood in which it
was fermented.
</P>
<P>
   You go through layer after layer of flavor until you come to the
finish. This may be when you experience the wine's tannins, without
which any wine would seem too lean, but it is certainly when you
have the pleasure of recapping all the layers.
</P>
<P>
   No analogy is ever a perfect fit, but the wine-sauce parallel is
pretty close for this sauce, in which the flavors are very
deliberately layered.
</P>
<P>
   I start the sauce by warming some olive oil in a pan. Oil always
provides the structure of a sauce, and structure is what gives you
body and body is what gives you ``mouth feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Structure also develops legs. When you swirl a wine around in
your glass and slender lines of wine remain after most of it has
settled down, those are the legs. Legs hold up the wine or the
sauce, and in this case, because the legs come from oil, they also
carry the flavors throughout the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 30 seconds, the oil is heated with ginger, a
perfume and spice giver. Then shallots are added, for more perfume
and spice. The Asian-flavoring trinity is completed when I toss the
garlic into the warm, fragrant oil.
</P>
<P>
   Next, I bring in the husky components: white wine for acidity;
sherry vinegar for acidity and for its flavors of wood and age; soy
sauce for richness and salt, which is the first flavor you catch in
a sauce, and orange _ whole for its fruit and the bitterness of the
oils in its zest, and juice for sweetness and more fruit.
</P>
<P>
   I cook these ingredients at a boil for 20 minutes to concentrate
their flavors. Taste the sauce after this reduction and you will be
surprised: it is just too concentrated to appreciate. The flavors
are closed. In a way, it is like a bouillon cube, and as with a
bouillon cube, it needs to be reconstituted.
</P>
<P>
   To start putting things right, I stir in rosemary, which adds
another layer of perfume; I don't add it earlier, because it has a
tendency to go from aromatic to medicinal over time. And then I add
some previously reduced chicken stock, which will contribute to the
sauce's structure.
</P>
<P>
   I let everything steep a few minutes, strain the ingredients and
pour the liquids (which, at this point, are strong and bitter) into
a blender. With the blender going, I add flavorless grape-seed oil,
which dilutes and clarifies the muddled flavors in the reduction,
provides the structure the sauce needs to live up to the name
``sauce'' and, most important, balances the flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Taste the sauce now and you'll have the same sensation you have
with a good wine: there will be the bouquet, followed by the
acidity, spice, sweetness, fruit and age, and then the smooth,
balanced finish.
</P>
<P>
   I created it to go with fennel-crusted tuna, a dish inspired by
the traditional Italian salad of fresh orange, rosemary, red onion
and fennel, but I serve it with pesto-topped salmon, pecan-crusted
trout and simply grilled fish.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I prepare this sauce, I think of the expression
``mother sauce,'' the term French cooks use for a basic, essential
sauce. In my kitchen, this vinaigrette is a mother sauce.

CAN'T WAIT TILL SUMMER TO BARBECUE? READ ON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are many charms to late winter, but right about now, they
are definitely fading. For one thing, it seems like years, rather
than months, since we enjoyed the foods of summer. And for us, that
means barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   We miss the time-honored ritual of hovering around a smoky fire
all night, drinking beer and trading stories. Even more than that,
though, we miss the taste. Crusty outside and tender inside, imbued
with the rich, deep flavor of hickory smoke, barbecue is an
unbeatable treat.
</P>
<P>
   But when the snow is on the woodpile, there's just no way to
barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe there is.
</P>
<P>
   While it is rank heresy even to suggest this among true
aficionados, it is possible to approximate the taste of real
barbecue in the oven.
</P>
<P>
   Notice that word ``approximate,'' because, of course, you can't
duplicate the flavor of meat that has spent eight or 10 hours
sitting over a smoldering hickory fire. But with patience and the
help of bottled flavor, it is possible to produce a reasonable _
and tasty _ facsimile.
</P>
<P>
   This culinary sleight of hand requires that the cook abandon any
desire for efficiency, in favor of the time-honored motto of the
great pit masters of the South: ``Slow and low is the way to go.''
The heart of the process is cooking over low heat for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Barbecuing essentially consists of placing a large, tough cut of
meat in an enclosed space like a pit or a cast-iron smoker, with
the fire on one side and the grid holding the meat on the other.
The meat is cooked through the indirect heat and smoke of the fire.
The temperature is kept just below the boiling point, 212 degrees,
and over many hours the meat's stringy connective tissues, called
collagen, dissolve into gelatin. This transforms the tough meat
into a tender delicacy.
</P>
<P>
   To cooks who are not used to the method, its very slowness seems
daunting, but barbecue cannot be hurried.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, there is actually an advantage to using an
oven, rather than a live fire. With a fire, you have to guess at
the temperature: place one too many logs on, and you get meat that
will cook too fast. An oven can maintain the required low, even
heat for an indefinite time: Just set the dial.
</P>
<P>
   What the oven cannot do is to provide the dominant flavor of
smoke. To mimic that, you have to add a step untraditional to
barbecuing: a dunk in brine.
</P>
<P>
   A classic brine combines water and salt, sometimes with sugar
added. Both salt and sugar are hygroscopic, which means that they
attract and absorb water.
</P>
<P>
   This quality lets the brining solution work its way into the
meat, seasoning the meat throughout and enhancing its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   We decided to take advantage of the phenomenon by adding a good
dose of liquid smoke to the brine, so that its flavor is carried
right into the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Some cooks may balk at using liquid smoke, suspecting that it is
a witch's brew of chemicals and additives, like many potions that
have been designed to mimic flavors. Not so. It is made by simply
burning hickory wood, condensing the resulting smoke, dissolving it
in water and filtering it to remove impurities. With no added
chemicals or coloring, it has been designated as a ``natural''
product by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Since the amount of brine required depends on the size and shape
of the container that is used for brining, it may not always be
necessary to make as much brine as is called for in the recipe
presented here.
</P>
<P>
   As with most unfamiliar dishes, you will have to go by trial and
error the first time, but after that you will know what you need
before you begin.
</P>
<P>
   The spice rub and the tomato-based barbecue sauce recipes
offered here are multipurpose, suitable not only for ribs but also
for barbecued beef brisket, grilled chicken or even strong-flavored
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember that the sauce should be passed as an addition
after the cooking; if you put it on the food while it is cooking,
the sauce will burn.
</P>
<P>
   As for the meat, there is no point in aiming for an exact
cooking time. After all, this is a cooking method so casual that
the interval at which more fuel is added to the fire is
traditionally measured in the time it takes the cook to consume a
beer.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to determine when the meat is done is not by time,
temperature or even appearance, but by sticking a large fork into
the meat and trying to lift it up. If the fork will not hold the
meat because the meat starts to fall apart, then it is ``fork
tender'' and ready to eat.
</P>
<P>
   So, while you will miss the experience of hunkering down next to
smoldering logs in a dirt pit, this oven method lets you enjoy
results that are as close to real barbecue as you are likely to get
without digging a hole in your back yard.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing to prevent you from sitting up all night
next to the oven, if you wish, telling tall tales and drinking
beer.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKY BRINE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   4 ounces (1/2 cup) liquid smoke
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup brown sugar.
</P>
<P>
   In a large bucket, very large roasting pan or other container
that can easily hold the meat to be brined, combine a gallon of
water, liquid smoke, salt and brown sugar. Stir to dissolve salt
and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about a gallon.
</P>
<P>
   BARBECUE SPICE RUB
</P>
<P>
   Time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons cumin
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chili powder
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup paprika.
</P>
<P>
   In a small bowl, combine all ingredients, and mix well. This rub
will keep for months when covered and stored in a cool, dark place.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 1 scant cup.
</P>
<P>
   BASIC BARBECUE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   6 ounces tomato puree
</P>
<P>
   2 16-ounce cans of tomatoes with juice
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup white vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup dark brown sugar, packed
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon each, paprika and chili powder
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons each, kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. In a large, heavy-bottomed saucepan, heat the oil over medium
heat until hot but not smoking. Add the onion, and saute, stirring
frequently, until golden brown, about 7 to 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   2. Add the tomato puree, tomatoes, vinegar, orange juice, brown
sugar, paprika, chili powder and salt and pepper, and bring to
boil. Reduce heat to very low, and simmer, uncovered, at lowest
possible heat for 1 hour, stirring every once in a while to prevent
scorching.
</P>
<P>
   3. In a food processor or blender, puree the sauce, in batches
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: about 2 pints.
</P>
<P>
   CHEATER-STYLE BARBECUED RIBS
</P>
<P>
   Time: 4 1/2 hours, plus 24 hours' brining
</P>
<P>
   2 full racks of pork spareribs, about 3 pounds to a rack
</P>
<P>
   Smoky brine (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Barbecue spice rub (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   Basic barbecue sauce (see recipe).
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the ribs in the bucket, very large roasting pan or
other container holding the brine. Make sure the ribs are
completely covered. Refrigerate them for 24 hours, turning them
once after 12 hours.
</P>
<P>
   2. Heat oven to 200 degrees. Remove ribs from brine, dry with
paper towels, and rub all over with the spice rub, pressing
slightly to be sure it adheres. Put ribs on baking sheets, place in
oven, and cook for 4 1/2 hours or until ribs are very tender.
Remove, and serve, passing the basic barbecue sauce for diners to
apply as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Air heated on descent from the Rocky Mountains enveloped the
west-central Plains Tuesday, boosting temperatures to near 80
degrees in western Nebraska. On Wednesday, breezes from the West
will direct the unseasonable warmth into much of the Eastern
states. Indeed, beneath plenty of sunshine, daytime readings will
approach 70 degrees as far north as Washington, D.C. Farther north,
snow cover will temper the warmth a bit over the interior Northeast
and eastern Great Lakes where readings will average in the 50s.
</P>
<P>
   A slow-moving, high-altitude low pressure system will bring
inclement weather to portions of the Southwest and Texas on
Wednesday. A pocket of cold air associated with the low will cause
snow to fall in sections of northern New Mexico and extreme
southern Colorado. Several inches of new snow is likely by evening
in the Sandia and Sangre de Cristo Mountain ranges.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered rain showers will dampen the lower
elevations of New Mexico and the Texas panhandle as moist breezes
from the Gulf of Mexico develop. As the upper low center encounters
the moistened air, rain will turn heavy later Wednesday night and
Thursday across Texas and the lower Mississippi Valley. Local
flooding is possible.
</P>
<P>
   Light snow will accompany another low pressure system near the
Minnesota-Canada border with spotty rain showers occurring farther
east over northern Michigan. Elsewhere, rain will arrive near the
Pacific Northwest coast by evening while mild and dry conditions
cover California and Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Beginning of the End
</P>
<P>
   March marks the beginning of the end of the rainy season in
Southern California as the jet stream, which carries
precipitation-producing disturbances, begins an inexorable
northward migration. Time for rain is running out. By April,
chances will decrease dramatically. Most of Southern California's
precipitation falls during late autumn and winter, but this season
has been dry. On Monday, 0.45 inches fell at Los Angeles, bringing
the city's seasonal total to only 4.78 inches. Normal-to-date
rainfall is 12.35 inches. By March 15, 1998, 23.59 inches of rain
had fallen at Los Angeles.

A WARM PORT

<TEXT>
<P>
   Rozes Port, 40 Years Old, Oporto, Portugal. About $120.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons known best to the tradition-bound port trade, there
is absolutely no mention on the bottle of this wine that it is, in
fact, an aged tawny. The label says only that it is 40 years old.
And that isn't entirely true.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of all the wines in the blend is more than 40
years but some are quite young. Tawnies can be ``refreshed'' with
younger wines as they mature in casks. Younger wines can also be
blended in shortly before bottling. The name tawny comes from the
brownish color the wine acquires as it ages in barrels. This wine
is warm and rich with a distinctive nutty flavor.

(ATTN: N.Y.)  
 TO AFRICA, THROUGH ITS FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jessica Harris' first trip to Africa, when she was 24, was a
``going home'' to the West Africa of her roots. It was her
introduction to a continent of vast geographic and ethnic
diversity, which she has revisited many times since that first trip
in 1972. Those trips, and the foods she sampled in her travels, are
recounted in her new book, ``The Africa Cookbook: Tastes of a
Continent'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris, a historian and professor of English at Queens
College in New York, who has written other cookbooks, dares the
reader to confront preconceptions about the continent. Her chapter
on the history of African food, for example, is called ``Beyond
Bare-Breasted Maidens and Cannibal Cooks.''
</P>
<P>
   As for food history, she points out that Egypt had Africa's
first high-class cuisine, as ancient wall paintings showing ducks
being force-fed seem to prove. But don't look for foie gras recipes
in this book. Despite a few production numbers calling for multiple
meats and every vegetable on the produce stand, the clearly written
recipes are mainly for simple preparations, with garlic and chilies
the dominant seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   The North African recipes show their basis in refined Islamic
traditions, and are complex and sophisticated. Adding orange flower
water to fresh orange juice, for example, is an inspired Moroccan
notion. To my palate, the recipes from other parts of Africa seemed
to cry out for finishing touches, like the chopped cilantro I could
not resist adding, for color and flavor, to the jagacida, a meat
and bean stew with rice from the Cape Verde Islands, and to the
delicious Kenyan curried corn with coconut. Many vegetable recipes,
like kale with chili and garlic, were more appealing than the
starchy porridge dishes and fritters.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Harris writes about ingredients like okra and black-eyed
peas, which came to the Americas in the holds of slave ships and
influenced cooking here.
</P>
<P>
   And she does not shy away from the influence that contact with
Europeans had on Africa's cuisine over the centuries, identifying
it in dishes like baked crab: though it is from the Nigerian
province of Benin, it is European in style.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Harris didn't set out to present only authentic
non-Europeanized dishes, she observes that an appreciation for
native cuisines grew after countries achieved independence. Because
she examines Africa mainly on a regional basis, a reader wanting to
understand how, for example, the cooking of Senegal differs from
that of Ghana, will not get much help here.
</P>
<P>
   A glossary of ingredients and utensils, and an excellent list of
sources for exotica like bitter leaf (a spinach-like herb), make
the book extremely user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   BENIN-STYLE BAKED CRAB
</P>
<P>
   Adapted from ``The Africa Cookbook''
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds fresh lump crab meat
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup minced scallions
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped tomato

<P>
   2 eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 stalk celery, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon tomato-based hot sauce, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup stale crumbs from French bread.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Lightly butter 6 6-ounce
ramekins or empty, well-washed crab shells.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine crab meat, scallions, parsley, tomato, eggs, garlic,
celery and hot sauce in a bowl, and mix. Season to taste with salt
and pepper. Stir in half the bread crumbs. Divide mixture among
ramekins, and sprinkle with remaining bread crumbs. Bake about 25
minutes, until lightly browned on top.

TRACKING DOWN THE ARTS

   (For release Sunday, March 21)

</P>
<P>
   Culturefinder is an online directory of mostly live
entertainment _ theater, classical music, opera, dance and jazz _
as well as museums. You can find events practically anywhere in the
United States and, for a $4.50 fee, buy a ticket to them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The numbers claimed, 300,000 events in more than 1,000 cities in
the United States, are so impressive that they are difficult to
believe. I didn't know there were 1,000 ``cities'' in the United
States, so I looked up the town of about 11,000 people I live in
and found it, with an event listed but no further information. At
any rate, Culturefinder has full listings and ticket services,
including discounts, for seven cities: New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, Boston, San Francisco, Philadelphia and Washington. (Five
more cities are scheduled to be added in March: Atlanta,
Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami and Minneapolis.)
</P>
<P>
   I requested arts events in New York City from March 21 to 28.
After a few minutes _ minutes, not seconds _ a calendar with 1,784
events appeared: ``The Great Hollywood Studios,'' a musical revue
at the 92nd Street Y; a graduation recital by Erin Elstner, a
percussionist, at the Mannes College of Music; Marcel Marceau at
the Sylvia and Danny Kaye Playhouse at Hunter College; ``Lewis
Wickes Hine: the Final Years,'' a photography exhibit at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, and ``Macbeth'' at the American Place
Theater, a full and varied list indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ZOOMING INTO THE PARK
</P>
<P>
   The first day of spring is a perfect time to start thinking
about national parks, and Maptech's National Park Digital Guide on
CD-ROMs provides a lot of information to ponder on all 54 of them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The CDs are loaded with maps, both 1:24,000-scale and
1:100,000-scale topographic maps from the U.S. Geological Survey
and the official National Park Service maps. As you move across a
map with the cursor, the coordinates change on the screen, and you
can zoom in for more detail or zoom out for the big picture. The
maps are sharp and colorful _ how sharp and colorful depends on
your computer and display _ and they pop up fairly swiftly for a
CD-based program. The computer should be a 486 or better running
Windows 95, 98 or NT, with at least 16 megabytes of RAM and,
obviously, a CD-ROM drive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides the maps, the disks contain a wealth of information
about the parks _ activities, plants and animals, trails, history,
reservation information, among other things, including such
services as restaurants and accommodations outside each park. The
trails section, for example, lists each trail by length and level
of difficulty, and you can trace each one on the screen to get a
sense of how tough it is. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much of this information is also offered at Parknet, the
National Parks Web site at www.nps.gov, but not, for instance, the
Geological Survey maps. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A CD for one park is $29.50. There are six regional sets at
$69.50 each, and you can get all 54 parks for $179.50. The parks
can be sampled, and disks ordered, at the Web site,
www.maptech.com/topo; Maptech's phone number is (800) 627-7236.

   It should come as no surprise that the third volume of Henry
Kissinger's ambitious, all-embracing memoir of public service,
``Years of Renewal,'' turns out to be a distinguished and important
work. Kissinger had already written two intellectually powerful
volumes of memoirs covering the five years he served as national
security adviser and secretary of State in the Nixon
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The new book, which covers the three years of the post-Watergate
presidency of Gerald R. Ford, brings the entire memoir to roughly
3,800 pages, not counting notes and indexes, which makes it an
ocean liner, a megalopolis of an account. (By contrast Dean
Acheson's ``Present at the Creation'' was a scanty 800 pages.)
</P>
<P>
   But Kissinger's history of his own time in office is a work
whose breadth, clarity of vision and historical scope amply justify
its size. It is an event, a likely classic of its genre.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt one of Kissinger's purposes in writing at such length
and in such detail is to seize the historical ground. This, after
all, is not any ordinary writer. Like Richard M. Nixon himself,
Kissinger has taken critical hits from all directions: from
conservatives for being too accommodating to the evil Soviet
empire, from liberals for being a cold-hearted practitioner of
realpolitik with, as he somewhat bloodlessly summarizes this
position, a ``preference for order over justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger uses his 3,800 pages to make his case against his
critics and detractors, trying, as he works through the years, to
demolish the various ``myths'' that, in his view, have accumulated
around him (among the more important of them, for example, is that
he did not attempt to negotiate a solution to the war in Cambodia
and is indirectly responsible for the triumph and the atrocities of
the Khmer Rouge).
</P>
<P>
   But ``Years of Renewal'' is far more than an elaborate
self-justification. Among its qualities is its sheer
informativeness about the way policies were debated, formulated,
and carried out (or, just as often, frustrated) in the Nixon and
Ford years.
</P>
<P>
   The volume covers vital episodes like the early arms-limitation
talks with the Soviet Union (and the concurrent pursuit of
detente), the beginning of what later came to be called the Middle
East peace process, and the collapse of United States policy in
Indochina in 1975. He treats the last of these with an elegiac
eloquence that makes it both the emotional and political
centerpiece of the entire book.
</P>
<P>
   Like its predecessors the new volume is laced with anecdotes,
for example, about Leonid I. Brezhnev interrupting the SALT
negotiations with ``periodic and very futile attempts at making a
toy artillery piece fire off a small explosive charge.'' It is
larded with numerous sharply observed sketches of major figures
from Ford (much admired by Kissinger) and Sen. Henry M. Jackson
(grudgingly admired) to Mao Zedong (overly admired) and various
others from Archbishop Makarios of Cyprus to Kenneth D. Kaunda of
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   Kissinger leaves nothing out, providing copious, comprehensive,
sometimes minute-to-minute accounts of the major international
events of the mid-1970s and those that seem a bit less major today
_ the Cyprus crisis, the investigations into illegal domestic
intelligence gathering by the Central Intelligence Agency, the
seizure of the Mayaguez by Khmer Rouge soldiers in Cambodia, the
quadrupling of oil prices in 1973, the European Security Conference
summit in Helsinki in 1975 _ rescuing some of them from the vapors
of historical forgetfulness.
</P>
<P>
   In all Kissinger demonstrates that he is not only a formidable
diplomat but an engaging storyteller as well, and he treats
episodes of diplomacy as narratives, complete with interesting
characters, plenty of dramatic tension and, obviously, high stakes.
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was a historical actor aware of the relationship
between theory and action, it was Kissinger, and one of the
striking features of his entire memoir is the way he relates the
myriad details of practical action to an overarching purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Brought from Harvard into the highest counsels of power in 1968,
in the midst of the turmoil over Vietnam, he was already imbued
with an idea about the proper conduct of foreign policy.
Specifically, he says, he wanted to steer the United States away
from what he calls Wilsonian moralism toward a foreign policy based
on the twin pillars of self-interest and balance of power.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This Aristotelian self-presentation, the statesman seeking a
middle road between two extremes, will probably not sweep away
Kissinger's critics. Liberals, for example, will find that he
offers no definitive evidence that the cutoff of military aid to
South Vietnam was ultimately responsible for the debacle of 1975,
rather than the perplexing failure of the South Vietnamese to fight
with half the ferocity and determination of the northerners.
</P>
<P>
   On the Soviet Union and detente Kissinger slips into a certain
vagueness over his contention that detente was actually a clever
tool to be used ultimately to provoke a Soviet defeat, rather than
a tacit admission of the permanency of Soviet superpower status.
But whether or not one is persuaded by Kissinger here, the
arguments that he makes, and the evidence that he marshals to
support them, make for a powerful case.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Kissinger describes American foreign policy in the
Nixon and Ford years as a historic success, altering the balance of
power in favor of the democratic West and to the insurmountable
disadvantage of the Soviet Union. But this does not contradict
another striking feature of Kissinger's work: its undercurrent of
frustration, the abiding sense that it conveys of the tragic in
human affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of his accounts, from the temporary collapse of detente in
1974 to the congressional cutoff of aid to anti-Communist Angolan
forces, involve failures in foreign policy that he attributes to
human error.
</P>
<P>
   The most important adversary in Kissinger's world was what he
calls the McGovernite Congress that came to power in the wake of
Watergate. In passages of controlled anger Kissinger makes his case
that the cutoff of aid in Indochina represented nothing short of
criminal irresponsibility, and that the advice of the mainstream
media that he somehow negotiate a diplomatic solution under the
circumstances amounted to a kind of sentimental wishful thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were being urged,'' Kissinger writes, ``to abandon a
military solution for a political one at the precise moment when
the elements on which a political compromise might have been based
were being systematically destroyed. In their absence, the demand
for a political solution amounted to a discussion of the modalities
of surrender.''
</P>
<P>
   There are extraordinary scenes depicted in this book: Anwar
Sadat struggling with what he saw as Israeli stonewalling, or Mao
worrying aloud that American policy consisted of a Machiavellian
plan to instigate a Soviet-Chinese war and then turn against the
weakened victor. But there is perhaps nothing more dramatic than a
simple, dignified letter cited by Kissinger to make his point about
United States policy in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   It was the refusal of the American offer of evacuation ahead of
the Khmer Rouge army, written by the former Cambodian prime
minister, Sirik Matak. ``We are all born and must die,'' he wrote.
``I have only committed this mistake of believing in you.''
</P>
<P>
   One could go on almost as long as Kissinger does citing the
absorbing passages in this compendious but energetic, unflagging
memoir, which seems likely to stand as a major work of contemporary
history.

<P>
   They talked about wanting love and sex and the need just to have
someone to hold them. They talked about what the world looks like
for someone who is 75 or 80 and alone. When a group of elderly
members of a Lower East Side theater group shared the most intimate
details of their lives, their stories were powerful enough to
persuade a student filmmaker, Keiko Ibi, to turn her senior thesis
into a documentary, and it has been nominated for an Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ibi is a 32-year-old native of Tokyo who received a Master
of Fine Arts from New York University last year and is married to
another filmmaker, Greg Pak. ``The Personals: Improvisations on
Romance in the Golden Years,'' Ms. Ibi's first documentary, is
nominated in the documentary short subject category.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really surreal,'' Ms. Ibi said of her nomination and the
flurry of telephone calls, e-mail media interviews and inquiries
about what she would wear to the Sunday night Academy Awards
ceremony in Los Angeles. (A designer dress, ``simple, purple, with
an Oriental flair.'')
</P>
<P>
   A thin woman with thick black hair and an open, relaxed manner,
Ms. Ibi seems giddy these days, as well she might. It is rare for a
student thesis to win an Oscar nomination, and ``The Personals''
has been shown at some 15 film and video festivals and has won six
awards.
</P>
<P>
   The project started in 1996 when Ms. Ibi took a basic acting
class with Seth Glassman, then the director of the Alliance Stage
Co. He invited the class to a party at his home, where Ms. Ibi met
the actors from his theater company.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were really funny,'' Ms. Ibi said. ``They wanted my
attention. They took my hand and said, `Oh, I met this girl.' One
talked about his open-heart surgery. I was intrigued right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday Ms. Ibi went to the Educational Alliance, a
settlement house, community center and social service agency on the
Lower East Side. She would spend about two hours filming the men
and women as they rehearsed an original play about looking for love
in the personal advertising columns. She also went home with them
and started hearing their stories about the role of love and sex in
their real lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I saw them on the stage,'' she said, ``I started to wonder:
`How are they at home? Are they alone?' I think fundamentally they
really liked me. I didn't ask, `How's your sex life?' I started
with where were you born, tell me about your parents. As they
became more relaxed, they opened up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ibi added: ``They were at the time of their lives they just
wanted to be happy. They just wanted to be themselves and find an
outlet to express themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   They did. The 37-minute film captures one man putting in his
dentures and another talking about his impotence. The women talk
about going into marriage as virgins and their disappointments in
lovemaking. Another man with neither a wife nor children wonders
what his life has meant and if he will die lonely. A couple, both
disabled, talk about how they met.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ibi has stayed in touch with her new friends and says they
all liked the film. One of them, Fred Schecter, died recently, and
his family told Ms. Ibi the film was a comfort to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her,'' Rose Straub, one of the women in the film, said
of Ms. Ibi. ``I wish to God she was my daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The film is excellent,'' she said. ``What you saw in the film
was me. We were really very honest and frank in that film. I'm not
ashamed; what I put in that film was my life. I was brought up very
strict. We were not taught how to handle a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Straub, who is 80 and has a 43-year-old son and two
grandchildren, said she has had suitors since ``Personals'' was
released but is becoming tired of the whole business.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our age there's not the respect they gave their wives,''
she said. ``They're offering you nothing. This last man I'm going
with, all he talks about is his wife, his wife, his wife. She's
dead already six years.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma Wernick, who is seen in the film talking about her former
husband's impotence and her affair with a married man, said she was
pleased with ``The Personals'' and wanted her children to see it.
Ms. Wernick is 74, and her son and daughter are in the their 50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the film is wonderful,'' she said. ``I think it gives
out two messages. Seniors are like everyone else. The other message
is, there is life after retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Like any good filmmaker, Ms. Ibi has her own story to tell. It
starts in Tokyo where she was the only child of a couple, now
divorced, who worked in real estate. She had always found delight
in American films. Some of her favorites were ``The Godfather,''
``Gone With the Wind'' and ``Chinatown.''
</P>
<P>
   She studied literature at Japan Women's University and won the
title of Miss Japan Grand Prix as a 19-year-old beauty contestant.
She also took acting class, directed school plays and finally
begged her mother for permission to go to New York to study film.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ibi enrolled at Syracuse University in 1991 and became a
film major. ``I was learning the language, learning the culture,''
she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   She transferred to N.Y.U. in 1993 in part because of its film
program's reputation. Its graduates include Spike Lee, Martin
Scorsese and Oliver Stone. In no time, Ms. Ibi recalled, she had
stopped wearing full makeup each day, had stashed away her pink
sweaters and become a true downtown New Yorker.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens at the Academy Awards ceremonies ``The
Personals'' will have its television premiere on HBO in June. Ms.
Ibi said the network editors helped her cut her original 79-minute
version of the film, which came from 70 hours of tape.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, who put up most of the money for the film, is now
convinced that sending her daughter to the United States was not a
bad thing. Meantime Ms. Ibi is completing a feature-length
screenplay and is about to begin a new documentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keiko is destined to do wonderful things,'' said David K.
Irving, chairman of the undergraduate film and television program
at the Tisch School of the Arts at N.Y.U. He was acting graduate
chairman of the department when Ms. Ibi presented several cuts of
her film. ``She is so unassuming, she is so pleasant,'' Irving
said. ``Her persona is such that you can tell her anything.''

   DOW-MAGICMARK _ The Dow Jones industrial average opened on the
downside today but quickly mounted a furious rally and passed the
magic 10,000 mark at 9:51 a.m. before retreating. Traders and
analysts compared the milestone to the breaking of the sound
barrier and reaching the moon. ``I never thought I'd see this,''
marvelled Larry Wachtel, a veteran analyst for Prudential
Securities. ``I am 66, have been on the Street 38 years, and this

industrial average. Why it should get so much attention is a matter
of considerable debate, between those who see the Dow at 10,000 as
historic and those who see 10,000 as ``just a number.'' (Walker,

   HAITI-EXODUS _ SAINT MARC, Haiti _ In the teeming, dust-caked
villages and dirt poor farms outside the capital city of
Port-Au-Prince, the sun-parched country people of Haiti have a
saying about the United States. ``That's where the water pipe is
cold,'' they say. Mona Emile's husband believed it. Nadier
Austinville's son did too. So for ten years Emile's husband planned
and saved. Austinville sold her farm, her cow and scraped together
$3,000 for her son. Then, the neighbors kissed their wives and
mothers, said good-bye to their six children, and climbed aboard
the country's newest underground railroad to the United States.
More often than not, it is a trip that carries its passengers and
their famililes into an ocean of the unknown where they can vanish
for months, sometimes forever. (Staletovich, Palm Beach Post). 50.

Operating in a market economy may give Russians a fit, but

Armies of snow removal trucks deploy on the roads day and night to

   FLA-ILLEGAL-INS _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The promise of jobs
fuels the business of migrant smuggling, and Florida offers a land

``Personally, I believe that, if you focused on employees and
contractors and take away all sources of employment . . . you can
literally turn your back on the borders,'' said Billy Kring, former
chief of the U.S. Border Patrol in Miami. The Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which oversees the Border Patrol, does just
the opposite. It focuses on border security. An illegal job market
flourishes in Florida, prompting growing numbers of migrants to
turn to smugglers. And smugglers operate in a climate of acceptable
risk: a Border Patrol in Florida that hasn't seen an increase in
manpower in 10 years, a Coast Guard patrolling a region strewn with
islands of safe havens, courts wrestling with complex immigration
law and juries sympathetic toward refugees. (Kane, Palm Beach Post)

dozen Cuban passengers aboard. The boat's captain explains that he
happened to be fishing when he spotted the Cubans struggling in a
sinking raft. Though the passengers show no signs of fatigue,
dehydration or injury, they confirm the story and insist the
captain be treated as a hero. Smuggling cases are difficult to
prosecute because often the only witness to the crime is the
smuggled human cargo. And people who spend their life savings in a
desperate bid to get into the United States make reluctant
witnesses, prosecutors say. (Kane, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

KGIL PICKS UP ADULT BLEND OF '50S_'70S HITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED SHUSTER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The adult standards format produced by Westwood
One and featured on KLAC-AM (570) from 1994 through 1998 will
resurface on KGIL-AM (1260) for a two-station simulcast.
</P>
<P>
   The format, which propelled KLAC from a .5 to a 2.6 share, will
be exclusive to KGIL. The program director is Chick Watkins, who
will also helm the midday shift, spinning the music of the '50s,
'60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   KGIL will feature the music of Nat King Cole through March 29,
when the new format kicks off on two frequencies _ 1260-AM and
1650-AM (replacing all-traffic KKTR).
</P>
<P>
   Mornings on KGIL will be hosted by Jeff Rollins, who has worked
in radio on both coasts and was once evening traffic anchor at
all-news KFWB-AM (980).
</P>
<P>
   After the Westwood One format left KLAC late last year, the
station switched to a music mix it calls ``standards, swing and big
band,'' anchored by Charlie Tuna in morning drive. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Around the dial: Modern-rock programmer Mike Halloran, formerly of
KROQ-FM (106.7) and San Diego's 91X, takes over the afternoon shift
and the assistant program director desk at KLYY-FM (107.1) _ Y107 _
on Monday. ... San Diego radio executive Michael Steele succeeds
Tracy Austin at KIIS-FM (102.7) as assistant program director and
music director. Austin moved to a Hartford, Conn., station as
program director. &QL;

TEMECULA WINE TASTERS LET SOMEONE ELSE DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMECULA _ Mount Palomar Winery is experimenting with European
vines and is bottling excellent yields _ a crisp white from the
cortese varietal, a smooth red blend of mourvedre and grenache.
</P>
<P>
   A short distance away, Cilurzo is pouring a superb 1997 Merlot
Reserve, made from the precious free-run juice that trickles out of
the wine press before the mechanism is activated.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway boasts of its '97 Pinot Gris, which received a rating
of 85 on Wine Spectator magazine's 100-point scale.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Temecula Valley wine country remains as
delightful as ever, even in winter, when the skies are often gray
and the vines bare and skeletonlike.
</P>
<P>
   A sip here. A taste there. Compare. Contrast.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that sampling can add up, and a day of tasting _ even
an ounce or two per glass _ is a threat to knock the unsuspecting
wine enthusiast for a loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're usually sampling a good 12 ounces at each place,'' said
Kurt Lundell, general manager of MVP Temecula Shuttle. ``They
(visitors) will go to at least four (wineries) in a day. It creeps
up on you real quick, that's for sure. We see that all the time. By
the time the third (tasting) tour is done, people are giddy,
tripping all over themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live here locally, and we prefer not to have people on our
streets who have been drinking wine. It's good for them not to
worry about who's driving, who's drinking, who's going to get in an
accident and kill themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   As a direct result, Temecula _ which lies in southwestern
Riverside County, about 25 miles directly inland from San Clemente
_ is experiencing steady growth in a specialized industry:
designated drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Lundell's shuttle service is listed in AAA's California tour
book. Dave Wilson, with Destination Temecula, launched a van tour
four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The region's yellow pages list no fewer than nine limousine
companies _ quite a fleet for a community with a population of
47,000. There's even a horseback outfit, JT's, that will get you to
the wineries along an interconnected series of trails.
</P>
<P>
   Local law enforcement welcomes these developments. In fact, the
Temecula police seem to have played a major role in fostering them.
</P>
<P>
   Temecula's 12 wineries are sprinkled along or near Rancho
California Road, just east of the 15 Freeway. Temecula's eastern
city limit lies at the very edge of the wine country _ and visitors
must pass through town on their way back to the freeway. According
to several limo and shuttle companies, Temecula police have been
known to set up sobriety checkpoints on Rancho California Road ...
on weekends ... at about 2 p.m. ... right at the eastern border of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious what they're there for,'' said Louis De Rosa,
owner of Esquire Limousine Service. ``They'll usually announce it
the day before, in the newspaper, but it's kind of a surprise for
the tourists coming in. They (the police) will do it about every
three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Two spokesmen for the Temecula police, Officer Lynn Fanene and
Sgt. Rod Crisp, insisted that the department's drunk-driver
vigilance is not specifically targeted to the wine-country
visitors, and Fanene said ``we don't have any stats'' on the
breakdown of who has been caught in the checkpoint web. Crisp added
that the wine-country visitors ``are not a major problem; we seem
to have more problems in town, with the bars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fanene was emphatic in declaring the department's ``zero
tolerance for DUI,'' while also voicing an endorsement for shuttle
services that pick up tourists at their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   For visitors from the Los Angeles area, designated drivers can
be hired relatively easily in Temecula. All will pick you up at
your lodgings _ whether you've opted for the quiet seclusion of the
Temecula Creek Inn, the utilitarianism of the motels that cling to
I-15, or a bed and breakfast like the Loma Vista, in the heart of
the wine country.
</P>
<P>
   In the small parking lot of the Mount Palomar Winery recently,
Matt Petrie of Chicago climbed out of a van and said he'd ridden up
from a hotel in San Diego. ``It's something you don't want to take
a risk with,'' he said. ``It allows us to just sit back and relax
and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most shuttle services charge by the hour. Lundell's company
offers Lincoln Town Cars for small parties ($35 per hour for one to
four people, plus 15 percent gratuity) and minivans for larger
groups ($50 per hour).
</P>
<P>
   De Rosa's limo service, which is recommended to guests of the
Temecula Creek Inn, accommodates up to eight passengers and can be
hired for $50 an hour (three-hour minimum). He also offers a
four-hour wine tour for $180 (plus 20 percent gratuity). Wilson is
attempting a different tack, charging by the person _ $51 _ for a
four-hour tour.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the fledgling service appears to be geared primarily
to the San Diego tourist, and, as such, travelers from Los Angeles
might encounter some snags in it.
</P>
<P>
   A person staying at a hotel in San Diego, for example, will get
door-to-door van service from his hotel. But the van will not stop
at Temecula hotels before it begins its tour of the wine country.
Instead, Wilson has contracted with the driver of an antique Ford
Model-T to ferry Temecula guests to and from their hotels. The
open-air jalopy might be fun for a quick spin around Temecula's Old
Town, but it could present a potentially harrowing ride from
lodgings several miles away _ especially if the weather is cold
and/or wet.
</P>
<P>
   And Los Angeles customers pay the same $51 rate as the tourist
who was collected at his hotel door in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The tour itself, however, was enjoyable on a recent Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After gathering his passengers in Old Temecula, the
frontier-themed, curio-laden stretch of old Highway 395 just west
of I-15, Wilson eschewed busy Rancho California Road and instead
took a circle route to the wine country. He rattled off facts about
the naming of the valley by Pechanga Indians, the area's rich
history as a stop for the Butterfield Overland Stage in the
mid-1800s, and the presence of a deep notch in the coastal
mountains, which creates dramatic climate swings in Temecula _
cool, damp mornings, sizzling afternoons _ and a great life for
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The tour encompassed three wineries, featured a tour of
Cilurzo's winemaking operation and included a picnic lunch on the
grounds of Temecula Crest Winery, the second-best picnic spot in
Temecula (Mount Palomar, with its secluded hilltop picnic area and
sweeping view to the east, reigns supreme).
</P>
<P>
   At Temecula Crest, host Gus Vizgirda lined up the glasses and
said, ``Are you tasting, Dave?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' came the reply, ``I'm driving.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a comforting response. &QL;

THE FINE IS WINE IN TEMECULA VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Has sidebar slugged TEMECULA-DRIVING) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMECULA _ Go on a weekend _ but only if you must.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its cousins to the north in Napa and Sonoma counties, the
Temecula Valley wine country is bracketed by two major metropolitan
areas _ Los Angeles and San Diego. Thus, some 18 million people
live within 100 miles of this narrow swath of vineyards in
southwestern Riverside County, and on most weekends it seems as if
a good percentage of them have crammed into the tasting rooms of
the 12 wineries here.
</P>
<P>
   If your schedule can be juggled to allow for a weekday visit,
that is a much more advisable course. Tasting rooms tend to be much
less crowded, and winery personnel have more time to relax, visit
and enlighten you on the history and traits of the wines they've
slaved to bottle.
</P>
<P>
   But even on busy weekends, this region has its charms. Most of
the wineries _ gargantuan Callaway the notable exception _ are
small, mom-and-pop operations, bottling only a few thousand cases
of wine per year. These micro wineries may dabble in a few sales in
nearby San Diego, but they don't even bother trying to crack the
daunting Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
   So the Temecula Valley is the only place to find some of these
wines. And several of them will reward you for your drive (about 90
miles from downtown L.A.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most varietals do very well down there because of the long
growing period during the summer,'' said Tim Bekins, senior wine
buyer for the Trader Joe's chain of gourmet markets. ``The weather
is constant. They don't have to worry about rain destroying or
watering down the vineyards. It stays sunny so long down there. It
raises the sugar tremendously. That way, they have these fully ripe
fruits when they harvest. I think they do very well with cabs and
chars (cabernets and chardonnays).''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because most visitors from Los Angeles and San Diego
treat this wine region as a day trip, Temecula has plenty of room
for improvement in lodging and dining experiences. That was evident
during a three-day visit last month.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a guide to select wineries, lodgings and
restaurants. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WINERIES
</P>
<P>
   Callaway: This is Temecula's behemoth, bottling an estimated
260,000 cases annually (a winery spokeswoman said she wasn't at
liberty to divulge the actual figure; the only one of 12 Temecula
wineries unwilling to do so). Since its wines are on the shelves of
neighborhood Ralphs and on the menus of California-cuisine grills
throughout the state, name recognition is extreme, and Callaway
often fills every square foot of its cavernous tasting room.
</P>
<P>
   The wines here are outstanding, laden with high ranks by wine
magazines and silver and bronze medals from various county fairs
(including Los Angeles'). But the high quality of the wines is
about the only inducement to visit this winery.
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday, the tasting room was crowded and impersonal. On a
return visit the next day, it was empty and impersonal. Employees
seemed infinitely more interested in arranging a collection of
bottles and chattering over their plans for the evening than
engaging four visitors in conversation about their product.
</P>
<P>
   And when one visitor used up her allotted four tastes on
Callaway's superb array of white wines, she was rebuffed when she
offered to pay another tasting fee to sample a couple of the reds.
``Only one tasting per person,'' came the curt recitation of
company policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cilurzo: The antithesis of the Callaway experience.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, when Vince Cilurzo was a senior lighting director
for the ABC television network in Los Angeles, he and wife Audrey
sought an escape from the urban madness and found it here in a
parcel of the former Vail cattle ranch. In the spring of 1968, they
planted several rows of petite sirah grapes, and Temecula's first
commercial vineyard was born. (Eli Callaway, now of golf-club fame,
followed shortly with the region's first winery.)
</P>
<P>
   On the recent visit, Audrey herself conducted a tour of the
winemaking operation, looking as if she had just put aside her
work, wiped the grape juice off her hands and emerged from the
cellar to meet guests.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the tasting experience on both a Sunday and a Monday
was like walking into someone's kitchen, as Cilurzo employees
enthused over each bottle like doting parents.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey indicated a bottle of Cilurzo's 1997 Merlot Reserve. ``We
sent a barrel sample to Orange County (for last year's fair),'' she
said, ``and they called back and said, `When are you going to
bottle this?' Vince said, `Not for a while.' And they said, `Well,
we're not supposed to tell you this, but it's going to win a big
medal, but it will be disqualified if it's not in a bottle.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was promptly bottled. It promptly won a four-star gold medal
at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hart: This winery is so unassuming it hasn't even gotten around
to paving its driveway off Rancho California Road, which made for a
spinning, splattering ride through the mud on a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, you're rewarded with a tasting room that is little
more than a corner of the actual winemaking operation, with
stainless-steel fermenting tanks and oak casks all around.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is accordingly friendly, and the wines _
particularly the 1996 Syrah and 1995 Zinfandel _ were well worth
the mud bath.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Palomar: Plan your day so that lunch is a picnic here.
Follow either a dirt driving road or a walking path from the
parking lot to a hilltop collection of picnic tables at the edge of
a citrus grove. The view to the east of Temecula's rolling hills
won't disappoint you.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will the tasting room, where Terri Bennett cheerfully
held forth recently, offering a wealth of information about the
effect of El Nino, the traits of Temecula's soil and the vines that
flourish in it, and the winery's experimentation with such European
vines as sangiovese from Italy's Chianti region, sirah from
France's Rhone Valley, and cortese, the northern Italy varietal
that yields such a delightfully crisp white wine.
</P>
<P>
   If you forgot to pack provisions for your picnic, don't despair.
Mount Palomar has a fully stocked deli where you can order
sandwiches or pick through the shelves and refrigerator cases to
assemble your lunch piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   Temecula Crest: Wine snobs beware of Gus Vizgirda and Jim Lyle,
who were playfully hosting the tastings at this picturesque winery
on the top of a hill.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a sip of Temecula Crest's 1997 Chardonnay, which
won a gold medal at the California State Fair, a patron furrowed
his brow and said, ``It's not as buttery as most.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We use oleo, actually,'' Vizgirda deadpanned. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LODGING
</P>
<P>
   Temecula Creek Inn: If you're staying the night in the Temecula
Valley, do whatever you can to get a room here _ the other
accommodations in the region can't touch it for comfort and
serenity.
</P>
<P>
   It is tucked between a golf course and a steep bank that climbs
to the 15 Freeway, but surprisingly, no freeway noise bleeds
through the thick doors of the rooms. Inside are some clever
touches, including window shutters and closet doors constructed
largely of twigs. For maximal comfort, try to wangle your way into
a junior suite.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds include a seldom-used pool and spa, and on chilly
winter mornings the lobby features a fireplace that crackles with a
real-wood blaze, a giant basket of fresh apples and Los Angeles
newspapers (though none, strangely, from San Diego).
</P>
<P>
   Alas, availability can be at a premium, since the hotel has only
80 rooms, but Doug James of the front-office staff said there is a
plan to add 20 new rooms and upgrade the existing ones within the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Information and reservations: (909) 694-1000.
</P>
<P>
   Loma Vista Bed and Breakfast: The location can't be topped _ in
the heart of the wine country, at the crest of a hill, surrounded
by grapefruit groves.
</P>
<P>
   The service is cheerful, too, notably in the case of Sheila
Kurczynski, who owns and operates the inn with her husband Walt _
when he isn't off in Long Beach attending to his custom-car
business, Alterdyne.
</P>
<P>
   The Loma Vista's rooms are decorated to correspond to various
wine varietals, and there is a bottle of sherry and basket of fruit
in each one.
</P>
<P>
   Staying at a b&AMP;b, however, is like dropping in on your aunt and
uncle, and this kind of accommodation isn't for everyone. The Loma
Vista wasn't without its shortcomings one night last month.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m., a puppy began whimpering to get in at a downstairs
door. It was pronounced. It sounded almost human. It precluded any
hope of sleep for nearly an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's hot tub, meanwhile, was no warmer than tepid _ an
acute disappointment on a rainy night after a long day of
sightseeing. But worse, the contents of the tub were a kind of
chlorine cocktail _ perhaps 50 parts water to 50 parts chemicals
(or so it seemed). It bleached the pigment right out of one
swimsuit and left skin reeking of chlorine _ no exaggeration _ for
two days.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (909) 676-7047. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DINING
</P>
<P>
   Baily Wine Country Cafe: This establishment has a reputation for
some of the best food in the Temecula Valley, and it proved worthy
of it during a lunchtime visit.
</P>
<P>
   Raves were voiced for the crab cakes, the baked brie and such
unusual dishes as butternut-squash soup.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this restaurant is located not amid the rolling
hills of the wine country, or anywhere near the winery itself, but
in a strip mall in town, by a Mobil gas station, a mattress store
and a Round Table Pizza joint. Ambience takes a severe beating in
such environs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while the bill of fare understandably includes a broad
selection of Baily wines, an unmistakable conclusion was reached:
What Baily puts on the plate is vastly superior to what it puts in
the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (909) 676-9567.
</P>
<P>
   Temet Grill: The restaurant at the Temecula Creek Inn came
highly recommended, but hotel eateries are usually guaranteed a
steady stream of new customers and thus have no great compulsion to
lure repeat ones. The Temet Grill, unfortunately, fell solidly into
this category.
</P>
<P>
   The food _ with the exception of a perfectly prepared and
presented filet mignon _ was ordinary, while the service alternated
between inattentive and downright surly.
</P>
<P>
   When the wine order was taken, for example, our table of four
voiced a preference for a merlot that had been sampled just two
hours before at Hart Winery. The waitress contradicted us and
strongly suggested a merlot from Australia's Deakin Estate. When we
insisted on the Hart, she visibly turned up her nose before
stalking off to fetch it.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (909) 694-1000.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Champagne: In dramatic contrast to the Temet Grill, this
appendage of the Thornton Winery was friendly to a fault.
Unfortunately, it was also overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   A waiter promptly explained that they had been busier than
expected this Sunday evening and were regrettably out of all of
their specials. It was 7:03 p.m. _ that must have been some early
rush; that, or management planned poorly.
</P>
<P>
   As at the Temet Grill, a filet mignon entree got the highest
compliment at the table. The consistent superiority of beef at
these restaurants indicates that Temecula's cattle-ranch heritage
remains strong. (At the turn of the century, Walter Vail
established a sprawling, 87,500-acre spread in this valley, and his
family worked it for six decades.)
</P>
<P>
   Two cioppino entrees, meanwhile, looked no larger than appetizer
portions _ maybe the restaurant was nearly out of seafood, too, and
was stretching things.
</P>
<P>
   And the waiter, though personable and earnest, was obviously
flustered. He bustled away after taking entree and wine orders, not
bothering to ask if salads were desired (they were). And for one
guest, a promised side vegetable never materialized to accent an
entree.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Champagne's ambience is warm and inviting. A portion of the
kitchen is open to view, and the air of the entryway is filled with
enticing smells of the cookery. It is also perched on a ridge,
affording nice views to the north for those fortunate enough to
secure window tables.

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Eager to put the Salt Lake City bidding
crisis behind it, the International Olympic Committee Wednesday is
expected to expel six members accused of improperly accepting cash
and gifts during the campaign for the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   If the 91-voting members approve the expulsions, it would be the
first time in 105 years that the IOC has forced any of its members
to give up their positions.
</P>
<P>
   Each accused member will have 20 minutes to address his
colleagues before the committee votes. A two-thirds vote, which
will be taken by secret ballot behind closed doors, is needed for
removal. The accused members will not be allowed to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The members recommended for expulsion are Siuli Paul Wallwork,
Western Samoa; Agustin Arroyo, Ecuador; Jean-Claude Ganga, Republic
of Congo; Zein El Abdin Ahmed Abdel Gadir, Sudan; Lamine Keita,
Mali; and Sergio Santander, Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Most have said they did nothing wrong and some have challenged
the legitimacy of the investigations that have condemned them.
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, the senior U.S. IOC member, predicted Tuesday
that the session would be an emotionally wrenching experience.
``It's going to be difficult,'' she said, describing her own
feelings as reminding the former Olympic rower of ``that flutter in
my stomach the way I did on the starting line.''
</P>
<P>
   But she nevertheless believes the membership will expel the six
members accused of violating their Olympic oaths. She said that the
IOC members, who have been given copies of the 55-page report by
the internal commission that investigated the Salt Lake City
allegations, should have all they need to expel their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reports are very, very clear if you read the report,'' she
said. ``Their actions were without honor.''
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz received a letter from Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
reminding her that Congress may act if the IOC does not take strong
enough measures during this week's emergency session.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the strongest terms, let me communicate to you my hope that
the IOC will move quickly to adopt reforms necessary to provide
transparency and accountability to the IOC organization and
processes,'' he wrote. ``Without such independent action, the
demand from Congress to act will be irrepressible.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain noted that the IOC enjoys special tax status that allows
it to pay no taxes as well as allowing corporate sponsors to write
off the cost of their sponsorships. McCain has said before that
these advantages could be removed if the IOC doesn't clean up its
act.
</P>
<P>
   IOC officials hope the gravity of expelling its members coupled
with clear indications that it will enact important reforms will be
enough to forestall an assault in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the IOC clearly has some resentment toward what it
considers the heavy-handed moralizing coming from the United
States, its leaders are aware of the importance to them of U.S.
television networks, corporate sponsors and now, politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Carrard, the IOC director general, acknowledged that
the IOC is paying close attention to events in Washington. ``We
have been following and reading the recommendations which we got
from various sources,'' he said. ``We believe that the action which
is being undertaken now should be of the nature to satisfy those
who are considering certain measures.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, IOC officials raised the prospect that Kim
Un-yong, the IOC member from South Korea who has received a severe
warning for his actions related to the Salt Lake bid, may not be in
the clear.
</P>
<P>
   Kim's case was left open by a special inquiry commission that
released its findings last week. Dick Pound, the commission's
chairman, said his panel needed more information to know if Kim was
aware that a $70,000 telecommunications job for his son in Utah was
underwritten by Salt Lake Olympic bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Kim has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz, who is a member of the executive board, confirmed
Tuesday that further action could be taken. ``There is still an
open case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another leading member who received a stern warning, Australian
Phil Coles, arrived in Lausanne on Tuesday and said he would not
resign mounting pressure in Australia for him to step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way, mate,'' a weary Coles told a reporter who asked if he
would step down.

<P>
   It's time for the first Sports on the Net awards for
sports-related Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, because the Academy Awards are less than a week away
... and some of us have already been eliminated from the March
Madness office pool.
</P>
<P>
   So, in no particular order, here is one Web surfer's winners
based on what's cool and functional:
</P>
<P>
   BEST MAINSTREAM SPORTS SITE: CBS SportsLine
(cbs.sportsline.com).
</P>
<P>
   CBS SportsLine, ESPN.com and CNN/SI have practically the same
format and features. The difference? CBS SportsLine's major
presence on America Online combined with its quick access to its
superstar sites, featuring Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods and
Shaquille O'Neal. CBS SportsLine also has a big international
section in cooperation with the London Daily Mail's Soccernet site,
which should delight soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees: ESPN.com, CNN/SI.com, MSNBC.com.
</P>
<P>
   BEST FAN SITE: Andrew's Dallas Stars Page
(rampages.onramp.net/(tilde)markstep/stars.htm).
</P>
<P>
   Of the many thousands of fan pages out there, few compare to
this father-son creation. Mark and Andrew Stepneski of Plano keep
this site's content and design fresher than some official sites.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees: Forty Niner Faithful (www.armanini.com/niners),
a clearinghouse of everything about the San Francisco 49ers; Packer
Palace (home.earthlink.net/(tilde)norbertn/packerpalace), with its
deco design, is the most entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OFFICIAL PRO TEAM SITE: San Jose Sharks
(www.sj-sharks.com).
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of official team sites have quicker load times, but
once the San Jose Sharks' official site gets in place, it's a
worthy visit. The non-frames site includes complete club
information, tons of interaction, submit-your-own-fan-site contests
(not something the holier-than-thou official sites usually do) and
multimedia connections. Of course, one would expect a team based
near Silicon Valley to produce a killer site.
</P>
<P>
   Other nominees: Yankees.com taps into its tradition effectively;
DenverBroncos.com pulls together its content and merchandising
nicely.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OFFICIAL SPORTS SITE FOR A SINGLE LEAGUE: NHL.com. The NHL
has great content and interactivity for the hardcore hockey fans,
along with features for young users (NHL4kids.com).
</P>
<P>
   BEST UNOFFICIAL SITE FOR A SINGLE SPORT: In The Crease
(www.inthecrease.com). In The Crease covers hockey from top to
bottom. It's a must-visit site for serious hockey fans, foreign and
domestic.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OFFICIAL COLLEGE SPORTS SITE FOR A SINGLE EVENT:
FinalFour.net (www.finalfour.net). If you're chained to the work
station, FinalFour.net offers an escape to March Madness, provided
your personal computer is powered with multimedia plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   BEST UNOFFICIAL COLLEGE SPORTS SITE: Greatest College Football
Finishes (www.nd.edu/(tilde)tmandell/finishestable.html). Ted
Mandell of South Bend, Ind., has brought together descriptions of
fantastic finishes, several with original broadcast audio files.
</P>
<P>
   And now for the awards that are usually given backstage:
</P>
<P>
   BEST MULTIMEDIA SPORTS SITE: Broadcast.com
(www.broadcast.com/sports). Dallas-based company has the market
cornered on multimedia, from March Madness to live bull riding.
</P>
<P>
   BEST USE OF GRAPHICS: Packer Palace
(home.earthlink.net/(tilde)norbertn/packerpalace). Discover the
many uses of Vince Lombardi's head as a graphic.
</P>
<P>
   BEST OUTDOORS SITE: The Mountain Zone (www.mountainzone.com).
Not a resource for anglers or hunters, but for things to do while
careening off the sides of mountains.
</P>

THE FINE IS WINE IN TEMECULA VALLEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Has sidebar slugged TEMECULA-DRIVING) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMECULA _ Go on a weekend _ but only if you must.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike its cousins to the north in Napa and Sonoma counties, the
Temecula Valley wine country is bracketed by two major metropolitan
areas _ Los Angeles and San Diego. Thus, some 18 million people
live within 100 miles of this narrow swath of vineyards in
southwestern Riverside County, and on most weekends it seems as if
a good percentage of them have crammed into the tasting rooms of
the 12 wineries here.
</P>
<P>
   If your schedule can be juggled to allow for a weekday visit,
that is a much more advisable course. Tasting rooms tend to be much
less crowded, and winery personnel have more time to relax, visit
and enlighten you on the history and traits of the wines they've
slaved to bottle.
</P>
<P>
   But even on busy weekends, this region has its charms. Most of
the wineries _ gargantuan Callaway the notable exception _ are
small, mom-and-pop operations, bottling only a few thousand cases
of wine per year. These micro wineries may dabble in a few sales in
nearby San Diego, but they don't even bother trying to crack the
daunting Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
   So the Temecula Valley is the only place to find some of these
wines. And several of them will reward you for your drive (about 90
miles from downtown L.A.).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most varietals do very well down there because of the long
growing period during the summer,'' said Tim Bekins, senior wine
buyer for the Trader Joe's chain of gourmet markets. ``The weather
is constant. They don't have to worry about rain destroying or
watering down the vineyards. It stays sunny so long down there. It
raises the sugar tremendously. That way, they have these fully ripe
fruits when they harvest. I think they do very well with cabs and
chars (cabernets and chardonnays).''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because most visitors from Los Angeles and San Diego
treat this wine region as a day trip, Temecula has plenty of room
for improvement in lodging and dining experiences. That was evident
during a three-day visit last month.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a guide to select wineries, lodgings and
restaurants. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WINERIES
</P>
<P>
   Callaway: This is Temecula's behemoth, bottling an estimated
260,000 cases annually (a winery spokeswoman said she wasn't at
liberty to divulge the actual figure; the only one of 12 Temecula
wineries unwilling to do so). Since its wines are on the shelves of
neighborhood Ralphs and on the menus of California-cuisine grills
throughout the state, name recognition is extreme, and Callaway
often fills every square foot of its cavernous tasting room.
</P>
<P>
   The wines here are outstanding, laden with high ranks by wine
magazines and silver and bronze medals from various county fairs
(including Los Angeles'). But the high quality of the wines is
about the only inducement to visit this winery.
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday, the tasting room was crowded and impersonal. On a
return visit the next day, it was empty and impersonal. Employees
seemed infinitely more interested in arranging a collection of
bottles and chattering over their plans for the evening than
engaging four visitors in conversation about their product.
</P>
<P>
   And when one visitor used up her allotted four tastes on
Callaway's superb array of white wines, she was rebuffed when she
offered to pay another tasting fee to sample a couple of the reds.
``Only one tasting per person,'' came the curt recitation of
company policy.
</P>
<P>
   Cilurzo: The antithesis of the Callaway experience.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, when Vince Cilurzo was a senior lighting director
for the ABC television network in Los Angeles, he and wife Audrey
sought an escape from the urban madness and found it here in a
parcel of the former Vail cattle ranch. In the spring of 1968, they
planted several rows of petite sirah grapes, and Temecula's first
commercial vineyard was born. (Eli Callaway, now of golf-club fame,
followed shortly with the region's first winery.)
</P>
<P>
   On the recent visit, Audrey herself conducted a tour of the
winemaking operation, looking as if she had just put aside her
work, wiped the grape juice off her hands and emerged from the
cellar to meet guests.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the tasting experience on both a Sunday and a Monday
was like walking into someone's kitchen, as Cilurzo employees
enthused over each bottle like doting parents.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey indicated a bottle of Cilurzo's 1997 Merlot Reserve. ``We
sent a barrel sample to Orange County (for last year's fair),'' she
said, ``and they called back and said, `When are you going to
bottle this?' Vince said, `Not for a while.' And they said, `Well,
we're not supposed to tell you this, but it's going to win a big
medal, but it will be disqualified if it's not in a bottle.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was promptly bottled. It promptly won a four-star gold medal
at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Hart: This winery is so unassuming it hasn't even gotten around
to paving its driveway off Rancho California Road, which made for a
spinning, splattering ride through the mud on a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, you're rewarded with a tasting room that is little
more than a corner of the actual winemaking operation, with
stainless-steel fermenting tanks and oak casks all around.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is accordingly friendly, and the wines _
particularly the 1996 Syrah and 1995 Zinfandel _ were well worth
the mud bath.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Palomar: Plan your day so that lunch is a picnic here.
Follow either a dirt driving road or a walking path from the
parking lot to a hilltop collection of picnic tables at the edge of
a citrus grove. The view to the east of Temecula's rolling hills
won't disappoint you.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will the tasting room, where Terri Bennett cheerfully
held forth recently, offering a wealth of information about the
effect of El Nino, the traits of Temecula's soil and the vines that
flourish in it, and the winery's experimentation with such European
vines as sangiovese from Italy's Chianti region, sirah from
France's Rhone Valley, and cortese, the northern Italy varietal
that yields such a delightfully crisp white wine.
</P>
<P>
   If you forgot to pack provisions for your picnic, don't despair.
Mount Palomar has a fully stocked deli where you can order
sandwiches or pick through the shelves and refrigerator cases to
assemble your lunch piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   Temecula Crest: Wine snobs beware of Gus Vizgirda and Jim Lyle,
who were playfully hosting the tastings at this picturesque winery
on the top of a hill.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a sip of Temecula Crest's 1997 Chardonnay, which
won a gold medal at the California State Fair, a patron furrowed
his brow and said, ``It's not as buttery as most.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We use oleo, actually,'' Vizgirda deadpanned. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
LODGING
</P>
<P>
   Temecula Creek Inn: If you're staying the night in the Temecula
Valley, do whatever you can to get a room here _ the other
accommodations in the region can't touch it for comfort and
serenity.
</P>
<P>
   It is tucked between a golf course and a steep bank that climbs
to the 15 Freeway, but surprisingly, no freeway noise bleeds
through the thick doors of the rooms. Inside are some clever
touches, including window shutters and closet doors constructed
largely of twigs. For maximal comfort, try to wangle your way into
a junior suite.
</P>
<P>
   The grounds include a seldom-used pool and spa, and on chilly
winter mornings the lobby features a fireplace that crackles with a
real-wood blaze, a giant basket of fresh apples and Los Angeles
newspapers (though none, strangely, from San Diego).
</P>
<P>
   Alas, availability can be at a premium, since the hotel has only
80 rooms, but Doug James of the front-office staff said there is a
plan to add 20 new rooms and upgrade the existing ones within the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Information and reservations: (909) 694-1000.
</P>
<P>
   Loma Vista Bed and Breakfast: The location can't be topped _ in
the heart of the wine country, at the crest of a hill, surrounded
by grapefruit groves.
</P>
<P>
   The service is cheerful, too, notably in the case of Sheila
Kurczynski, who owns and operates the inn with her husband Walt _
when he isn't off in Long Beach attending to his custom-car
business, Alterdyne.
</P>
<P>
   The Loma Vista's rooms are decorated to correspond to various
wine varietals, and there is a bottle of sherry and basket of fruit
in each one.
</P>
<P>
   Staying at a b&AMP;b, however, is like dropping in on your aunt and
uncle, and this kind of accommodation isn't for everyone. The Loma
Vista wasn't without its shortcomings one night last month.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 a.m., a puppy began whimpering to get in at a downstairs
door. It was pronounced. It sounded almost human. It precluded any
hope of sleep for nearly an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The inn's hot tub, meanwhile, was no warmer than tepid _ an
acute disappointment on a rainy night after a long day of
sightseeing. But worse, the contents of the tub were a kind of
chlorine cocktail _ perhaps 50 parts water to 50 parts chemicals
(or so it seemed). It bleached the pigment right out of one
swimsuit and left skin reeking of chlorine _ no exaggeration _ for
two days.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (909) 676-7047. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
DINING
</P>
<P>
   Baily Wine Country Cafe: This establishment has a reputation for
some of the best food in the Temecula Valley, and it proved worthy
of it during a lunchtime visit.
</P>
<P>
   Raves were voiced for the crab cakes, the baked brie and such
unusual dishes as butternut-squash soup.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this restaurant is located not amid the rolling
hills of the wine country, or anywhere near the winery itself, but
in a strip mall in town, by a Mobil gas station, a mattress store
and a Round Table Pizza joint. Ambience takes a severe beating in
such environs.
</P>
<P>
   Also, while the bill of fare understandably includes a broad
selection of Baily wines, an unmistakable conclusion was reached:
What Baily puts on the plate is vastly superior to what it puts in
the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (909) 676-9567.
</P>
<P>
   Temet Grill: The restaurant at the Temecula Creek Inn came
highly recommended, but hotel eateries are usually guaranteed a
steady stream of new customers and thus have no great compulsion to
lure repeat ones. The Temet Grill, unfortunately, fell solidly into
this category.
</P>
<P>
   The food _ with the exception of a perfectly prepared and
presented filet mignon _ was ordinary, while the service alternated
between inattentive and downright surly.
</P>
<P>
   When the wine order was taken, for example, our table of four
voiced a preference for a merlot that had been sampled just two
hours before at Hart Winery. The waitress contradicted us and
strongly suggested a merlot from Australia's Deakin Estate. When we
insisted on the Hart, she visibly turned up her nose before
stalking off to fetch it.
</P>
<P>
   Phone: (909) 694-1000.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Champagne: In dramatic contrast to the Temet Grill, this
appendage of the Thornton Winery was friendly to a fault.
Unfortunately, it was also overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   A waiter promptly explained that they had been busier than
expected this Sunday evening and were regrettably out of all of
their specials. It was 7:03 p.m. _ that must have been some early
rush; that, or management planned poorly.
</P>
<P>
   As at the Temet Grill, a filet mignon entree got the highest
compliment at the table. The consistent superiority of beef at
these restaurants indicates that Temecula's cattle-ranch heritage
remains strong. (At the turn of the century, Walter Vail
established a sprawling, 87,500-acre spread in this valley, and his
family worked it for six decades.)
</P>
<P>
   Two cioppino entrees, meanwhile, looked no larger than appetizer
portions _ maybe the restaurant was nearly out of seafood, too, and
was stretching things.
</P>
<P>
   And the waiter, though personable and earnest, was obviously
flustered. He bustled away after taking entree and wine orders, not
bothering to ask if salads were desired (they were). And for one
guest, a promised side vegetable never materialized to accent an
entree.
</P>
<P>
   Cafe Champagne's ambience is warm and inviting. A portion of the
kitchen is open to view, and the air of the entryway is filled with
enticing smells of the cookery. It is also perched on a ridge,
affording nice views to the north for those fortunate enough to
secure window tables.

<P>
   ASBURY PARK, N.J. _ ``What's up, Jersaay!'' screamed Matthew
Barlow, the long-haired singer for the heavy-metal band Iced Earth,
at the dark throng before him under the vast ceiling of the
Convention Hall here. It was the first night of the first annual
March Metal Meltdown and the crowd of mostly white working-class
teen-agers, dressed almost to a one in black, collectively
shuddered in response; the insulation in the hulking old building
was not working very well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little song about a guy who walked the earth about
2,000 years ago who went by the name of'' _ Barlow paused, then
growled, ``Messiah!''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the audience wore white face paint with inverted black
crosses on their foreheads; most wore T-shirts with band names like
Bloodfeast, Incantation and Hypocrisy printed in dripping,
illegible logos. Contrary to what might be expected, there were
plenty of women in attendance; the grimmer sub-genres of metal have
a lot of female fans, perhaps because the lyrics are not usually
aggressively misogynist.
</P>
<P>
   The fans had come from Eastern seaboard suburbs to hear the kind
of blasphemous stuff that has been driving parents absolutely crazy
for 30 years, since the emergence of Black Sabbath: songs about
witches, bloodthirsty warriors, devil worship, graveyards and the
secret cabalistic codes of long-dead civilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the bands were some the audience might never hear again,
among them the Swedish black-metal group Dimmu Borgir, or the
Norwegian Viking-metal band Enslaved, which performed in old Norse
tunics. There were 100 bands in all, spread out on three stages,
across two days of metal. Nonmetal diversions included Jasmin St.
Claire, an adult-film actress with eyelashes like blackboard
erasers who functioned as occasional mistress of ceremonies, and
two World Wrestling Federation wrestlers play-acting mortal
aggression in silent battle. Death-metal, sex stars, wrestling: the
subculture seemed to be flourishing.
</P>
<P>
   Metal has evolved at a creeping pace, its various splintered
genres hanging on through waxing and waning demand in the
marketplace. Metal used to be easily recognized: scary, sludgy,
pummeling stuff lacking any social or political agenda. Its current
status is uncertain because it can be unclear what metal is. Punk
and hip-hop have body-checked it from both sides, resulting in a
successful hybrid that promoters call ``heavy music.'' (Note the
absence of the word ``metal,'' with its bad-for-business loner
connotations.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Top 10 rock band Metallica crusades on behalf of
its own obscure tastes in metal, recording songs by British bands
of the early '80s who soldier on in front of European and Japanese
audiences with a bit of new-found respect. A half-dozen other
sub-genres _ fans love to come up with new prefixes to attach to
the word ``metal'' _ have small but devoted followings.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the March Metal Meltdown, the first underground
heavy-metal festival on the East Coast, grew out of the Milwaukee
Metalfest, a yearly ritual of pizza, beer and face paint that will
enter its 13th year this summer. The same Wisconsin-based promoter,
Jack Koshik, is behind both events; he compares them to the big
wrestling spectacles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milwaukee were Wrestlemania,'' he said, ``March Metal
Meltdown would be King of the Ring.''
</P>
<P>
   But March Metal Meltdown is clearly intended to grow into a
bigger moneymaker than Milwaukee, connecting new mainstream and old
underground metal as it does. The turnout, estimated by Koshik at
3,500, seemed slight for a festival with big-name headliners like
Sepultura and Biohazard; the Milwaukee festival, with far more
obscure bands, drew almost twice that number last year. The
festival was organized too late to run advertisements in the heavy
metal magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the enormous stylistic range in the music played turned
away more fans than it lured. Performing in the festival were four
bands from the early '80s genre which has geekishly been termed
N.W.O.B.H.M., for New Wave of British Heavy Metal; some younger
new-metal bands like Spineshank and Madball that work on the line
between metal and hardcore punk; black-metal bands (black as in
dark and dismal, with haunted-house keyboard arpeggios and growled
vocals _ this is where the face paint comes in) and straight
meat-and-potatoes, hard and fast death-metal.
</P>
<P>
   Velocity and rhythm determined one's place along the spectrum of
metal fandom. The N.W.O.B.H.M. bands have an old-fashioned,
thrashing and rolling bar-band rhythm. The young new-metal bands
play a fast, whomping, unfunky version of funk with barbed-wire
guitar tone and no solos. The music by black-metal bands has a
slow, sloppy feeling, like walking through a pond of eyeliner.
Death-metal, the fastest, sprints by with double-timed bass drums
making your heart palpitate; the preponderance of the little
boomlets you feel in your chest makes the music sound arrhythmic.
</P>
<P>
   Each kind of rhythm produces a different fan, but the clearest
difference at Metal Meltdown was between the black-metal fans and
the hip-hop-inspired devotees of new metal. Black-metal fans are
pallid and withdrawn, letting the theatrical shows of bands like
Sweden's Dimmu Borgir stimulate their morbid inner fantasies.
New-metal bands, with their heavy-handed, hip-hop-inspired
drummers, evoke a bullyingly physical feeling, and accordingly,
some of its fans are high school jocks. As everybody knows, jocks
and raven-obsessed romantic poets don't mix. (``Saturday Night
Live'' devoted a long-running skit called ``Goth Talk'' to this
notion.) Yet here they were, their constituents commingling in the
middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Why Asbury Park? Koshik said that it was merely central, between
New York and Philadelphia and convenient for all the suburbs in
between. But an unintended benefit of putting March Metal Meltdown
in the connected theaters on the boardwalk was that the places
themselves felt incredibly heavy metal: formerly palatial, now
dark, crumbly, moody. (Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band have
been rehearsing for a tour in the Convention Hall.)
</P>
<P>
   The theaters were full of floral-patterned ironwork and ancient
wooden doors. The structures have not been renovated or redesigned:
they have a raw look, with peeling paint and dim, fluorescent light
that threw a perfect hazy pallor on the crowd. And it was cold,
especially in the section between the two theaters where a third
stage had been built and record labels and fanzines had set up
their booths. For much of the weekend fans could see their breath
indoors.
</P>
<P>
   There is endless philosophical conversation in the culture of
heavy metal about whether the genre died and came back or whether
it had just been quiescent. The debate, in its various
trajectories, fills up most issues of underground metal fanzines
like Metal Core and Promethean Crusade, and festival musicians
chewed over the issue at news conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Graziadei, the singer from the punk/metal hybrid band
Biohazard, took issue with the idea of metal's ever having gone
away. ``It's not re-emerging,'' he said. ``It's redefining. Metal
and heavy music have never died. The industry has wanted to make it
seem like it died so that maybe they could revive it.'' (He may
have been thinking about recent VH-1 ``Behind the Music'' and
``Where Are They Now?'' segments depicting the the waxing and
waning market shares of passe heavy-metal bands as personal drama.)
``But there's always aggression, always pressure in people, and
heavy music has been a way to release that energy.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Wave of British Heavy Metal bands did not have such
ponderous axes to grind, other than poking fun at ``heavy'' bands
whose members are half their age; now in their 40s, most were happy
to have been invited. These were bands that toiled in working-class
towns of northern England and Ireland in the early 1980s; a few,
like Judas Priest and Def Leppard, made it to stardom, but most did
not.
</P>
<P>
   Raven, which found some recognition in the early '80s, came from
Newcastle, England. ``In Newcastle, the only rock bands were Raven,
Fist and Venom,'' said Raven's bassist, John Gallagher. ``But all
over the country each town had one or two bands, and pretty much
all of them ended up coming to some kind of notoriety.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We played in a circuit of working men's clubs,'' he said.
``People who were over 18 could join these clubs to get cheap beer
and play bingo. So we'd come on stage and go, `Aargh!''' _
Gallagher bobbed his head and mimicked power-chording a guitar,
then jerked his head up _ ``and then say, `See you after the
bingo!' We'd come off, they'd have 20 minutes of bingo where you
could hear a pin drop and we'd go back on again and go, `Aargh!'''
</P>
<P>
   The uptick of interest in the genre in the United States results
partly from the influence of Lars Ulrich of Metallica, an early fan
of the music. He has endorsed these bands by performing versions of
their songs with Metallica, including ``Blitzkrieg,'' by
Blitzkrieg.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Hasselvander of Raven and Davey Bates of Sweet Savage agreed
that Ulrich's advocacy was the main reason they were playing at an
American festival. Sweet Savage is one of the ultimate cult bands
of metal: it made only two singles and a small number of tours
before it disbanded. For Metal Meltdown, they played to a small but
devoted audience in the Paramount Theater here on Saturday night;
those who knew the songs filled up the first few rows and the rest
of the crowd looked on with mild curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk that Dimmu Borgir, the headliner of Friday
night's concerts, had lip-synched its way through its set. But it
was hard to tell because the vocals of the lead singer, Shagrath,
were so heavily treated with echo and delay effects, as well as the
processed monster-growl that remains a trademark of the black-metal
and death-metal genres. There were cold echoes around Convention
Hall; it was unusually quiet between songs. (There was no beer
available on Friday, and the sound engineering had been a comedy of
errors.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This one deals with temptation,'' proclaimed spike-booted
Shagrath, keeping a game face behind the white paint. ``And it's
called . . . `Reptile'!'' ``Glowing eyes, staring eyes,'' he sang,
``manifest of evil presence/with entities swept in disease and
decay/a fall from paradise beyond redemption/wrathchild's
afterglow.''
</P>
<P>
   But two of the new bands delivered the best sets of the weekend,
perhaps auguring that metal is changing in a way that is not merely
a watering-down. Candiria, from Brooklyn, made its complicated
stop-start compositions skitter all over the place, even using some
jazz rhythms. And the Puerto Rican band Puya moved with striking
smoothness between metal and salsa, teaching a crowd uninterested
in dancing how to clap in Latin rhythm.

TEMECULA WINE TASTERS LET SOMEONE ELSE DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMECULA _ Mount Palomar Winery is experimenting with European
vines and is bottling excellent yields _ a crisp white from the
cortese varietal, a smooth red blend of mourvedre and grenache.
</P>
<P>
   A short distance away, Cilurzo is pouring a superb 1997 Merlot
Reserve, made from the precious free-run juice that trickles out of
the wine press before the mechanism is activated.
</P>
<P>
   Callaway boasts of its '97 Pinot Gris, which received a rating
of 85 on Wine Spectator magazine's 100-point scale.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Temecula Valley wine country remains as
delightful as ever, even in winter, when the skies are often gray
and the vines bare and skeletonlike.
</P>
<P>
   A sip here. A taste there. Compare. Contrast.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that sampling can add up, and a day of tasting _ even
an ounce or two per glass _ is a threat to knock the unsuspecting
wine enthusiast for a loop.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're usually sampling a good 12 ounces at each place,'' said
Kurt Lundell, general manager of MVP Temecula Shuttle. ``They
(visitors) will go to at least four (wineries) in a day. It creeps
up on you real quick, that's for sure. We see that all the time. By
the time the third (tasting) tour is done, people are giddy,
tripping all over themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live here locally, and we prefer not to have people on our
streets who have been drinking wine. It's good for them not to
worry about who's driving, who's drinking, who's going to get in an
accident and kill themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Or someone else.
</P>
<P>
   As a direct result, Temecula _ which lies in southwestern
Riverside County, about 25 miles directly inland from San Clemente
_ is experiencing steady growth in a specialized industry:
designated drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Lundell's shuttle service is listed in AAA's California tour
book. Dave Wilson, with Destination Temecula, launched a van tour
four months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The region's yellow pages list no fewer than nine limousine
companies _ quite a fleet for a community with a population of
47,000. There's even a horseback outfit, JT's, that will get you to
the wineries along an interconnected series of trails.
</P>
<P>
   Local law enforcement welcomes these developments. In fact, the
Temecula police seem to have played a major role in fostering them.
</P>
<P>
   Temecula's 12 wineries are sprinkled along or near Rancho
California Road, just east of the 15 Freeway. Temecula's eastern
city limit lies at the very edge of the wine country _ and visitors
must pass through town on their way back to the freeway. According
to several limo and shuttle companies, Temecula police have been
known to set up sobriety checkpoints on Rancho California Road ...
on weekends ... at about 2 p.m. ... right at the eastern border of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious what they're there for,'' said Louis De Rosa,
owner of Esquire Limousine Service. ``They'll usually announce it
the day before, in the newspaper, but it's kind of a surprise for
the tourists coming in. They (the police) will do it about every
three months.''
</P>
<P>
   Two spokesmen for the Temecula police, Officer Lynn Fanene and
Sgt. Rod Crisp, insisted that the department's drunk-driver
vigilance is not specifically targeted to the wine-country
visitors, and Fanene said ``we don't have any stats'' on the
breakdown of who has been caught in the checkpoint web. Crisp added
that the wine-country visitors ``are not a major problem; we seem
to have more problems in town, with the bars.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fanene was emphatic in declaring the department's ``zero
tolerance for DUI,'' while also voicing an endorsement for shuttle
services that pick up tourists at their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   For visitors from the Los Angeles area, designated drivers can
be hired relatively easily in Temecula. All will pick you up at
your lodgings _ whether you've opted for the quiet seclusion of the
Temecula Creek Inn, the utilitarianism of the motels that cling to
I-15, or a bed and breakfast like the Loma Vista, in the heart of
the wine country.
</P>
<P>
   In the small parking lot of the Mount Palomar Winery recently,
Matt Petrie of Chicago climbed out of a van and said he'd ridden up
from a hotel in San Diego. ``It's something you don't want to take
a risk with,'' he said. ``It allows us to just sit back and relax
and enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most shuttle services charge by the hour. Lundell's company
offers Lincoln Town Cars for small parties ($35 per hour for one to
four people, plus 15 percent gratuity) and minivans for larger
groups ($50 per hour).
</P>
<P>
   De Rosa's limo service, which is recommended to guests of the
Temecula Creek Inn, accommodates up to eight passengers and can be
hired for $50 an hour (three-hour minimum). He also offers a
four-hour wine tour for $180 (plus 20 percent gratuity). Wilson is
attempting a different tack, charging by the person _ $51 _ for a
four-hour tour.
</P>
<P>
   At present, the fledgling service appears to be geared primarily
to the San Diego tourist, and, as such, travelers from Los Angeles
might encounter some snags in it.
</P>
<P>
   A person staying at a hotel in San Diego, for example, will get
door-to-door van service from his hotel. But the van will not stop
at Temecula hotels before it begins its tour of the wine country.
Instead, Wilson has contracted with the driver of an antique Ford
Model-T to ferry Temecula guests to and from their hotels. The
open-air jalopy might be fun for a quick spin around Temecula's Old
Town, but it could present a potentially harrowing ride from
lodgings several miles away _ especially if the weather is cold
and/or wet.
</P>
<P>
   And Los Angeles customers pay the same $51 rate as the tourist
who was collected at his hotel door in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The tour itself, however, was enjoyable on a recent Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   After gathering his passengers in Old Temecula, the
frontier-themed, curio-laden stretch of old Highway 395 just west
of I-15, Wilson eschewed busy Rancho California Road and instead
took a circle route to the wine country. He rattled off facts about
the naming of the valley by Pechanga Indians, the area's rich
history as a stop for the Butterfield Overland Stage in the
mid-1800s, and the presence of a deep notch in the coastal
mountains, which creates dramatic climate swings in Temecula _
cool, damp mornings, sizzling afternoons _ and a great life for
grapes.
</P>
<P>
   The tour encompassed three wineries, featured a tour of
Cilurzo's winemaking operation and included a picnic lunch on the
grounds of Temecula Crest Winery, the second-best picnic spot in
Temecula (Mount Palomar, with its secluded hilltop picnic area and
sweeping view to the east, reigns supreme).
</P>
<P>
   At Temecula Crest, host Gus Vizgirda lined up the glasses and
said, ``Are you tasting, Dave?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' came the reply, ``I'm driving.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a comforting response. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Time is running out if you want to be named to one of those
lists of most important or influential women of the 20th century.
Unless you discover a cure for one of the horrible diseases or
become world famous overnight (having sex with a famous man doesn't
count), the spots are pretty much secured by the likes of Mother
Teresa, Margaret Sanger and Toni Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   Most will have to settle for being among the unsung or at least
getting their honors in smaller venues, which is OK except then you
don't get your photo taken by Annie Liebowitz.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too late to declare this the century of the woman? Not to
ignore the major achievements by men in the last 100 years, but men
did start out with the advantage and held it at least for the first
two-thirds. Women started out the century not expected to have much
of an impact.
</P>
<P>
   The 21st century will begin with a more level playing field,
except for pay discrepancies and a few other challenges. But women
have managed to catch up quite a bit in the last 100 years and, if
we're lucky, by the end of the next there may be no need for
separate lists.
</P>
<P>
   There are some things we won't have to worry about achieving.
Many of the ``firsts'' have been taken care of, although we're
still waiting for the first woman president. Many of the 20th
century's high achievers among women were first-timers. The first
woman Supreme Court justice and secretary of state; the first woman
to fly solo across the Atlantic; the first to go up in space.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who don't get on lists made less visible but
significant contributions to women's progress. The first woman
hired on a construction crew, the first woman to run a car
dealership. Ordinary firsts won't make you famous, though they
might have gotten you a feature story in your local paper.
</P>
<P>
   To win the kind of acclaim that gets you on lists of essential
women you have to do something outstanding in the fields of
science, politics or literature. You have to contribute to the
greater good in a lasting way, which explains why they often
mention Billie Holiday, because she changed the role of ``girl
singer'' from accompanist to star and introduced a whole new jazz
sound.
</P>
<P>
   It does not explain why Madonna gets named as one of the 100
most important women of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Some influential names don't court fame but win it anyhow. Anita
Hill's accusations against her former boss focused the country's
attention on sexual harassment. Betty Ford certainly didn't plan on
becoming an activist for substance abuse and breast cancer
awareness, yet when the first lady showed her vulnerability she
made it safe for others to get help.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton shows up on
women-of-the-century lists. Monica Lewinsky does not.
</P>
<P>
   It's the women way back in the early 1900s that amaze the most.
That they could achieve anything besides dinner was a marvel,
considering how little society expected from them.
</P>
<P>
   Being educated was a risk. You might not find a husband if you
were too smart. You could be forced into an arranged marriage. You
were supposed to provide sex but weren't supposed to enjoy it, and
you had no choice in when to have your babies.
</P>
<P>
   Every March during Women's History Month there are stories about
women who defied social custom in order to use their talent and
brains. They struggled without advocates, the vote or unions. In
addition, they had to wear layers of annoying underwear and never
cut their hair.
</P>
<P>
   And they had a shorter time to get it done. Life expectancy for
women at the beginning of the century was 51, compared to 79 now.
</P>
<P>
   Even long after they were enfranchised, there were
gender-specific prohibitions for a woman who wanted more. Betty
Friedan got fired from her newspaper job for being pregnant.
Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was ridiculed by her law
professor for taking up a man's spot in class. Geneticist Barbara
McClintock's mother worried that her love for science would make
her unwelcome in society.
</P>
<P>
   But they all had their ways and they will translate well into
the next century. The legendary women of the 20th century, like
Oprah Winfrey and Billie Jean King, did not wait to be given what
they deserved. They were not shy, modest or repressed. They were
stubborn, spirited, smart and often loud.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the fact that Princess Diana keeps making
women-of-the-century lists, as do a number of movie stars, many
real achievers were not pretty, young or thin. They were not all
rich or white. They didn't set fashion trends, except for Amelia
Earhart's pleated trousers and Florence Griffith-Joyner's bicolor
running shorts.
</P>
<P>
   They were as crusading as Rachel Carson, as fearless as Dolores
Huerta, as tough as Shirley Chisolm.
</P>
<P>
   As to why Roseanne shows up on the same most-admired list as
Eleanor Roosevelt, it only proves that over the last 100 years,
women have also developed their sense of irony.

HOUSE DEMOCRATS AIM TO BOOST FEDERAL CHILD-CARE FUNDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Democrats began a push Tuesday to help
moderate- income people pay for child-care costs by proposing to
boost federal funding for child-care subsidies and making more
families eligible for child-care tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I repeatedly hear from my constituents that finding
affordable, high-quality, child care is virtually impossible,''
said Rep. Ellen Tauscher, D-Calif., chief architect of the
Democrats' child-care legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Day-care costs average $4,000 to $10,000 per child per year,
according to the National Women's Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation came under immediate attack from Republicans who
said states could put $3 billion of their unspent federal welfare
funds toward child care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government will spend around $13 billion this year
on child care,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., ``Clearly,
states already have far more federal dollars for child care than
ever before (and) they have substantial funds at their disposal
that could be used to pay for child care.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government began giving states money for child care
in 1997 as part of the Child Care Development Block Grant program,
which is funded at $3 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
   States are also allowed to allocate 30 percent of funds under
the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program for
child-care initiatives. The TANF program gives states $16.5 billion
annually for assistance programs for the poor. Both programs
replaced the federal government's welfare program that was scrapped
as part of 1996 legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing programs, most of the money goes to very
low-income families who are just coming off welfare and does not
reach low- and moderate-income families who also struggle with
child-care expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ben Cardin, D-Md., said a family of three earning $18,000
does not qualify for a child-care subsidy in his state. Each state
sets income guidelines for who qualifies under the various
child-care programs, but in many cases families earning more than
$20,000 annually do not qualify for assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Tauscher's plan, which is backed by the Democratic leadership,
would increase funding for the Child Care Development block grant
by $7.5 billion over five years and require states to target the
money toward low- and moderate-income people who are not coming off
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also:
</P>
<P>
   _Double the income limit to $60,000 for working parents to
become eligible for the Dependent Care Tax Credit. This credit
allows families to subtract up to $2,400 per child in child-care
costs from the amount of tax they owe, with a limit of $4,800 for
two or more children.
</P>
<P>
   _Allow all parents with children under 12 months to subtract up
to $1,500 in child-care expenses from their tax liability. This
credit would be available regardless of whether one parent stays
home.
</P>
<P>
   _Establish a tax credit for businesses to build or expand
child-care facilities. The credit would allow businesses to
subtract 25 percent of the cost from their tax liabilities, not
exceeding $150,000 annually. The bill would also allow five or more
small businesses to band together to provide child-care services
and receive federal and state matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   _Triple funding for a federal after-school program that provides
money for schools and community centers to help run after-school
programs. The program is currently funded at $200 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., said improving access
to child care is a top priority for Democrats and they will
continue to press for the enactment of legislation ahead of next
year's congressional and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
   During a House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources
hearing on child-care financing Tuesday, Johnson, the panel's
chairman, said funding for other programs would need to be cut in
order to pay for the Democrats' five-year, $24.6 billion plan.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week the Ways and Means panel released a
Congressional Research Service report showing that states have $3
billion in unused TANF, or welfare funds. But many states,
including California and Texas, do not have any unspent funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could Congress justify cutting other programs or
increasing taxes to gives states yet more money when so much money
is going unused,'' Johnson said.

LAMAR ALEXANDER: ALL AMBITION, NO VISION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although he has been campaigning furiously since he
lost the Republican presidential nomination in 1996, former
Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander is preferred by only 2 percent of
Republicans surveyed in this week's USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the message there, he doesn't get it. When Alexander
finally made it official the other day that he meant to try again
for the big prize in 2000, it was no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   What it was, however, was a puzzlement. Why is he running?
</P>
<P>
   Or to put it another way: Why should we care?
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, 58, tried to get attention two years ago by wearing a
folksy plaid shirt, in the style of Gary Hart. You got the
impression he wanted to wear a sweater and carry his own garment
bag, but Jimmy Carter had already pulled that stunt.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plaid shirt didn't do anything for his popularity,
Alexander has now mercifully reverted to standard business attire.
But he has found no other way to distinguish himself from a crowded
GOP field in which the candidates all seem to echo the same themes,
formed by the same partisan cookie-cutter.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is still saying the same things in much the same way
as he did in his 1996 race. If he has any understanding that the
issues and the country have moved on since then, he does not
indicate it. There is no evidence that new thoughts have percolated
in his brain.
</P>
<P>
   He does, however, have an instinct for the heat of political
battle, which he demonstrated recently by attacking the
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, for his espousal of
``compassionate conservatism.'' It was a clever expression with
good campaign potential, and Alexander immediately tried to stamp
it out by scorning its message as ``weasel words.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander is on the losing side of that one. Try explaining to
voters what's wrong with tempering basic GOP fiscal conservatism in
public policy with a little compassion for individuals. You can't
do it without sounding like a cold-hearted, right-wing ogre.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, the former president of the University of Tennessee
and Education secretary in the Bush administration, also has tried
to claim the mantle of chief education advocate. He said recently
he was ``the only one'' among the GOP candidates who could
effectively push education issues. Oh?
</P>
<P>
   This is a man who wants to kill the Department of Education,
eliminating the primary voice on behalf of school children in the
Cabinet and downgrading the subject to the local level where it
will get less national attention. Even the GOP-controlled Congress
has backed away from trying to kill the Education Department. The
idea is politically dead.
</P>
<P>
   His other proposals to strengthen education also are familiar
GOP refrains, from taxpayer subsidies for private schools to an end
to ``race-based scholarships'' and a rejection of proposed national
grading standards. We may be forgiven if we fail to see how this is
supposed to identify him as a uniquely wonderful champion of the
nation's children.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's campaign is mostly about running against
``obnoxious'' and ``arrogant'' Washington, which successful
presidential candidates of both parties have been doing for several
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander lives in Tennessee. But as a former Cabinet officer,
White House assistant and aide to Sen. Howard Baker, he has little
credibility as a Washington ``outsider.'' And if foreign policy
becomes a major issue, portraying oneself as outside the
information loop might not seem like a strong qualification for the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the anti-Washington rhetoric has begun to wear thin
with voters, who didn't like the brief government shutdown and
don't want to get rid of the bureaucracy _ they just want it to be
smaller and function better.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's remedy for Washington's ills doesn't address that.
</P>
<P>
   Instead he has stolen an idea from his mentor, Baker, an
otherwise sage statesman who long promoted the foolish notion that
in today's complex global community, Congress could revert to the
past and sit in session only half the year. During the other six
months members would return home as ``citizens,'' refreshing their
feel for daily constituent life and working for local companies. If
you believe this would not constitute a conflict of interest, I
have a bridge for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Alexander is for cutting taxes, the GOP mantra.
</P>
<P>
   He says abortion is wrong but does not favor a constitutional
amendment to ban it, as the 1996 GOP party platform does. That puts
him in the pool of the wishy-washy on the subject, along with
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Alexander's major problem is that he is stuck on tired,
stale issues and has nothing fresh to offer. In his announcement
speech, for instance, he lists term limits as one of his primary
goals.
</P>
<P>
   This is another concept whose time has come and gone. Perhaps he
has missed the anguish of GOP legislators who endorsed term limits
as candidates but now want to back out on their promise because
they have suddenly discovered the merits of seniority.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Alexander. He is all ambition and no vision.

JAMES BRADY JOINS CONCEALED-WEAPONS VOTE FIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   James S. Brady, the White House press
secretary who was shot during the 1981 assassination attempt on
President Reagan, came to Kansas City on Monday to implore Missouri
voters to reject a concealed weapons referendum on April 6.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proposition B is poorly written and would jeopardize the safety
of everyone, Brady told an audience at St. Vincent's Family Service
Center at 3030 Troost Ave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The armed society that Proposition B creates is filled with so
many loopholes that it literally would allow convicted criminals to
carry hidden Uzi pistols into bars, stadiums and onto school
property,'' Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is the kind of society the people of
Missouri want or need.''
</P>
<P>
   Brett Feinstein, a spokesman for Missourians Against Crime,
which supports the referendum, later took exception to Brady's
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, local law enforcement agencies who conduct the checks
can turn someone down and not issue a permit,'' Feinstein said.
``Nobody likes the fact that we live in a violent society. But
people have a right to protect themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincent's child care center serves mostly inner-city
families. Before introducing Brady, who suffered permanent brain
injury in the 1981 attack, center director Sister Berta Sailer said
she polled staff and children to see how many had lost a family
member to gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   Of 70 staff members, 30 had lost a relative. Of 200 children,
the number was 50. Those who said ``yes'' wore black armbands.
</P>
<P>
   One little girl had an armband on each arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's lost two family members, and she's not even 3 years old
yet,'' Sailer said.
</P>
<P>
   Brady said the right to carry guns would send a bad message to
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our kids to believe that guns provide solutions
to every problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein disagreed with Brady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody wants to see kids exposed to violence,'' Feinstein
said. ``But is it better that we allow people to be victims or that
we allow them to protect themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition B would allow mentally competent persons age 21 or
older to carry a concealed weapon if they've not been convicted of
a felony, if they're not known as a substance abuser and if they
have not displayed violent behavior in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   After passing a background check, applicants would be issued a
three-year permit after 12 hours of firearms training.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the proposal would help law-abiding citizens
protect themselves and their families against violent criminals.
They reject arguments that more guns mean more gun deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Crime, the proponents say, has gone down in states that have
conceal-and-carry rights, mainly because criminals don't know who
has a gun.
</P>
<P>
   But Brady and doctors from Children's Mercy Hospital and Truman
Medical Center rejected those claims Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is down everywhere, and it has gone down faster in states
without conceal-and-carry laws, said Denise Dowd, an emergency room
physician at Children's Mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missouri's crime rate is down 22 percent over five years _
that's more than states where people are allowed to carry guns,''
said Dowd, who has researched the effect of guns on society.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd why we would want to pass this.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of Proposition B are using a St. Louis area woman's
story that if she had carried a gun, she might have been able to
save herself from being raped.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to comment on the woman's contention, Dowd said the
question called for speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she would have had a gun, she might be dead,'' Dowd
answered.

   performing other tasks. The federal safety agency in December
cited DeBruce with 36 federal safety violations in connection with
the tragedy and proposed fines of $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce, which remains in business in Wichita and several other
U.S. locations, is contesting the federal safety agency's
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In its 30-page complaint, OSHA neither cited nor mentioned
Industrial Maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Federal safety officials in Kansas City and Wichita did not
return calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce founder and chief executive Paul DeBruce is careful not
to level blame directly at its maintenance contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I know is, it wasn't our light, and that it was attached
to the (machinery) they were working on,'' DeBruce said Monday.
``It certainly is puzzling. It shouldn't have been there.''
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce, however, stopped short of saying use of that type of
light in a grain elevator violated federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Nickel said her client thought the lamp met OSHA standards for
use in grain elevators.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Consumer Product Safety Commission
said tests and a consumer warning it issued in 1996 determined that
300-watt halogen bulbs could reach 970 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Electrical Code, cited in OSHA
grain-dust regulations, the ignition point for wheat and some other
agricultural dusts is 428 degrees.

   Federal prosecutors in Wichita, meanwhile, are continuing to
investigate the explosion for possible criminal violations, a
spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Jackie Williams said Monday.

of two workers who were killed, Jose Luis Duarte and Raymundo Diaz
Vela, asks for more than $75,000 in damages. Duarte worked for
DeBruce. Amador and Vela were employed by LSI Corp., a Wichita
company that supplies temporary agriculture industry workers.
</P>
<P>
   Under Kansas law, workers or their families cannot sue their
employers in cases of injury or death if they are eligible for
workers' compensation payments. Some states, including Missouri,
make exceptions in cases of negligence or willful acts, said Rupe,
the lawyer for Industrial Maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is pending in Topeka to allow similar exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rupe said, ``Industrial Maintenance is a victim
of the Kansas workers' compensation system'' as affected families
search for deep pockets to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employees of DeBruce have no other recourse except to
establish fault by non-employers,'' Rupe said. ``I would refer you
to the outcome of the OSHA investigation that supports what I
say.''
</P>
<P>
   In public statements, OSHA investigators have pointed to an
underground tunnel for grain conveyor belts as the likely spot
where the explosion originated.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator Vernon Grose told /{The Wichita Eagle/} last summer
that a seized bearing in that machinery caused friction and
generated enough heat to ignite grain dust.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce officials take strong issue with that and argue that
grain was not being moved in that area at the time of the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Rupe acknowledged that the halogen lamp was the property of
Industrial Maintenance. It was being used that day by company
workers in the headhouse, a central control area near the top and
center of the nearly half-mile-long structure.
</P>
<P>
   But Rupe said OSHA investigators clearly determined ``the blast
did not start there.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Rupe added, the lamp fixture was both turned off and
unplugged at the time of the blast. His client's employees, he
said, were in another area of the elevator at the time.

   high-tourist areas.
</P>
<P>
   Chrysler Corp.'s 15,000-square-foot Great Cars Great Trucks
center in the Mall of America in Minneapolis is like a 365-day auto
show. The center, which is more interested in building brand names
than selling cars, features concept cars, a Dodge Viper that
customers can sit in, and interactive films on the history of
Chrysler and current technology. It is the second most popular
attraction at the mall and draws up to 8,900 customers on Saturdays
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Wish Superstore, an Atlanta clothing store and skateboarding
store, has a live disc jockey on weekends. Through the week,
customers can sit in a 1970s-style lounge area and watch talk shows
on a vintage white plastic television.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with Wish Superstore say the attractions keep people
coming in, but they caution that too much entertainment can have
customers playing instead of buying. It's a store, not a lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Along with attracting customers, the entertainment retailers may
have an edge in attracting employees, especially in tight labor
markets such as Johnson County, where unemployment typically is 3
percent or lower. While other restaurants have complained about the
lack of workers, Rainforest quickly hired 340 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Retail analysts said the sheer wonderment of concepts such as
Rainforest Cafe would draw people several times. Then the challenge
becomes how to attract repeat business.
</P>
<P>
   And now that theme restaurants are opening in Kansas City,
Indianapolis and other smaller markets, the novelty appears to be
wearing off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Entertainment retail is probably a trend that is on the
downturn right now,'' said Wilson of /{Chain Store Age/}. ``It was
the hot industry term two years ago; it's much less so now. I
wouldn't say the industry is very hot right now on theme
restaurants at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Theme restaurants seem to prosper more in high-tourist areas,
where they have a constant flow of new customers.
</P>
<P>
   NBA City, a basketball-theme restaurant, is being built at
Universal Studios' CityWalk entertainment district in Orlando, Fla.
It will be divided into a dining area, a merchandise shop, and a
recreation area where customers can shoot baskets and play trivia
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. plans to take one of its ESPN Zone concepts
to Times Square in New York. The operations combine a restaurant
and bar with a sports screening room and 10,000-square-foot arena
for virtual and actual games. Staff members will get briefings on
sports news before each shift, and place mats with current sports
information will be updated daily.
</P>
<P>
   But even heavy traffic doesn't guarantee success. Often it comes
down to the food. Many of the themed operations concentrate more on
what customers are seeing than what they are eating.
</P>
<P>
   Television City and Fashion Cafe, two theme restaurants that had
planned multiple locations, recently closed at Rockefeller Center
in New York, and work on David Copperfield's Magic Underground on
Broadway stopped nearly a year ago. In 1998, Hard Rock Cafe saw its
sales drop 11 percent for stores open at least a year, and its
operating profit slipped 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And Planet Hollywood, which has said it wants to be a tenant in
Kansas City's Power &AMP; Light District, said in January that it would
cut costs and revamp its menu because it expected sales to drop as
much as 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson predicted that the Overland Park Rainforest Cafe would
draw phenomenal crowds at first but would have problems sustaining
that traffic on a year-round basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rainforest is great when you look at it, it's fun, those
gorillas and the rain and everything like that, but that's really
not enough,'' Wilson said. ``The content, or the product, in
Rainforest is the food, and I think most people think that the food
hasn't lived up to it.''
</P>
<P>
   But a Rainforest spokesman noted that /{Restaurants and
Institutions/}, a trade publication, recently named Rainforest its
top winner in the ``themed restaurant'' category. The listing was
based on a nationwide survey of 2,500 households and criteria that
included food, value, merchandise and service.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Golden, director of corporate communications for Rainforest
Cafe, said the restaurant should not be lumped into the same
category as other themed operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're profitable and we have been since day one,'' Golden
said. ``We do not depend on people knowing a movie star's name or a
model's name. We feel we are not a fad and are very much a trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kurt Barnard of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in New
Jersey sees the trend of themed restaurants waning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a novelty that worked beautifully because everyone
rushed to see all those things,'' Barnard said. ``They were
tremendously interesting, but now many of them are coming on hard
times. Once you've been there and done that, why go back? There's
no novelty left.''

LAWSUIT SAYS CONTRACTOR'S NEGLIGENCE CAUSED BLAST AT GRAIN
ELEVATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new lawsuit alleges that a contractor's negligence caused the
fatal DeBruce Grain Co. elevator explosion last year near Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   The contractor, Industrial Maintenance Inc. of Wichita, was
hired in 1998 to repair DeBruce's grain-dust collection systems in
the huge elevator complex. Industrial Maintenance was named as the
sole defendant in the case, brought by one injured worker and the
families of two others killed in the June 8 blast.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial Maintenance ``failed to perform this maintenance in a
reasonably prudent manner, resulting in the ... explosion,'' the
lawsuit alleges.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the company deny it did anything to contribute to
the blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way, no how,'' Alan Rupe, a lawyer for Industrial
Maintenance, said Monday. ``My client is without fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The new legal claim may lend support to a theory advanced by
DeBruce officials in recent weeks that a 300-watt halogen-light
fixture used by the contractor's employees might have generated
enough heat to ignite volatile grain dust. DeBruce officials said
the light was found later amid the blast debris.
</P>
<P>
   Specific acts of negligence were not detailed in the lawsuit,
filed Thursday in Sedgwick County District Court. The lawsuit also
did not specifically raise the halogen-light issue.
</P>
<P>
   Alisa Nickel, another Industrial Maintenance lawyer, said
federal safety investigators examined the halogen-lamp theory and
questioned company co-owner Randy Neises about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration discarded the
lamp, she said, after apparently determining the device was not a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she added, if the lamp debris ``is not showing heat
damage or explosion damage, that just supports our belief that the
lamp had nothing to do with the explosion nor was in any way an
ignition factor.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials for DeBruce, which is based in North Kansas City, said
they retrieved the lamp debris last August, and on Monday they
released photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are represented by former U.S. Attorney Randall
K. Rathbun of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a lot of concentration on DeBruce,'' Rathbun
said. ``This case will be about others that DeBruce hired. This
company was hired to upgrade the dust suppression and collection
system, and they just didn't do their job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rathbun would not comment on specifics of the case or the
halogen light, saying details would come later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only half the story is out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   DeBruce officials said Monday that Industrial Maintenance was
paid more than $60,000 for its rehabilitation work throughout the
elevator's grain-dust collection systems. That work was completed
in the months before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of the blast, three Industrial Maintenance employees
were at the grain elevator performing other tasks. MORE

MANY BUSINESSES OFFER RAZZLE-DAZZLE WITH THEIR RETAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOYCE SMITH  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not enough anymore to provide good products at a good
price. More and more, retailers and restaurateurs are trying to
entertain their customers, too.
</P>
<P>
   An example of that trend, the Rainforest Cafe, opened recently
in Overland Park's Oak Park Mall. Customers do more than eat in a
trendy restaurant _ they experience a complete tropical rain
forest.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the restaurant is a roaring, animated crocodile, its
tail twitching in a threatening display. Parrots squawk a greeting
as customers pick up their ``passports'' to the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Inside is a 2,392-square-foot retail shop. Diners enter the
restaurant by walking under a 5,500-gallon saltwater aquarium
archway.
</P>
<P>
   They dine in a simulated forest with more than 2 million leaves
and a view of the night sky as it appears in South America.
Animated rain forest animals, such as thumping silverback gorillas
and trumpeting elephants, frolic nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Rain walls and cascading waterfalls lend soothing sounds until
there is a clash of thunder, and lightning strikes overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rainforest Cafe is an extreme example of the ``entertainment
retailing'' trend. The most popular are the theme restaurants built
around rock 'n' roll, supermodels, movies, wrestling, sports
superstars and even college sports.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Wilson, senior editor of BEGIN ITAL Chain Store Age
BEGIN ITAL, a retailing magazine based in New York, said the growth
of electronic retailing, especially during the recent holiday
buying season, had forced retailers to make shopping and dining
more enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make the bricks-and-mortar store more of an
experience, more entertaining,'' Wilson said. ``That could mean
anything from having a great environment, real comfortable, having
wonderful service, or a more interactive, more stimulating store
environment that ties in with the products they sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Rainforest Cafe opened, Oak Park Mall customers
were checking it out. Their faces contained looks of amazement as
they watched the animated characters from afar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've outgrown Chuck E. Cheese's, and this is something the
whole family can do together,'' said Amy Boothe of Lenexa.
</P>
<P>
   Boothe's daughter, Ashley, 6, was transfixed by the live parrots
and the animated crocodile.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's cool,'' Ashley said.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Park Mall also is home to the new Build-A-Bear Workshop,
which lets customers pick out fake animal skins and watch the bears
being stuffed and sewn. Zany Brainy offers authors' readings and
brings in live zoo animals.
</P>
<P>
   Galyan's Trading Co. at Town Center Plaza in Leawood has a
rock-climbing wall where customers can try out merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Even small operations, such as Fritz's Union Station in Kansas
City, Kan., can draw customers and build their brand name through
entertainment retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz's delivers meals on a toy train and track. Its new
location in the Crown Center Shops will expand on that with even
more bells and whistles, figuratively and literally. The
state-of-the-art system is still being designed, but could help
turn the restaurant into a franchise operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a gimmick, but I know it brings people in; you can't get
in here on a holiday or Saturday,'' said Fred Kropf, co-owner of
Fritz's. ``It's such an attraction for a child, but also for
adults.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond offering a good time, entertainment retailers are
desirable, especially in shopping centers, because they generate
longer stays in the centers and increased sales, according to the
International Council of Shopping Centers, a trade group in New
York. Typically, the longer customers are in a mall, the more money
they spend, according to the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the five-story NikeTown in New York features
multiple rooms organized around specific sports, along with
interactive information on products and top athletes. All of the 12
NikeTowns are in high-tourist areas. MORE

favorite ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' seemed assured of becoming
the next giant hit among young people.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Tuesday night teen rival on UPN seemed likely to
struggle. ``Moesha,'' underpublicized and with no boost from any
hit show on its network (``Star Trek: Voyager'' and ``Dilbert'' are
UPN's only other hits), was in its fourth season and had new
competition from ``Buffy,'' ABC's ``Home Improvement'' and Fox's
``King of the Hill,'' all of which had moved to Tuesdays at 8.
</P>
<P>
   But Brandy, the pop singer who won a Grammy last month and stars
as Moesha, has kept her show steadily climbing. Indeed, ``Moesha''
has increased its audience since November while ``Felicity'' has
lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moesha'' averages a 2.5 household rating (each rating point
equals 994,000 homes) and a 2.4 rating among 18-to-34-year-old
women. But the latter number is up 33 percent from last year
(measured February to February).
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity'' still has a larger audience, a 3.5 average
household rating and a 3.6 rating among women aged 18 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doing fine, but it's clearly not the breakout hit they
had hoped for,'' Marc Berman, a media analyst with Seltel Inc. who
advises television stations, said of ``Felicity.'' As for
``Moesha,'' he said, ``on a network really having its problems,
it's holding its own, and that's pretty impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   But shed no tears for ``Felicity.'' WB is pleased; the show has
been picked up for a second season, starting next fall. Ms.
Russell's character will be in her second year of college.
</P>
<P>
   And Brandy, as Moesha, will go to college for the first time,
following, in that sense, in Felicity's footsteps.

   Brokaw in Moscow
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lot has changed in Moscow since Tom Brokaw scored
one of the biggest coups of his career in 1987 with his exclusive
interview with Mikhail Gorbachev, then the president of the Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   But Brokaw is still at his post as anchor of NBC News, and this
week he will travel to Moscow to conduct another interview
milestone, the first American television interview with Yevgeny
Primakov, Russia's current prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw said Tuesday that he hoped to conduct the interview
Thursday and to show portions of it on NBC's ``Nightly News''
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw said he had pursued the interview because of the
political and economic chaos in Russia and because he has known
Primakov for some time and has found him to be a fascinating
figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who was around in the Brezhnev era and the
Gorbachev era,'' Brokaw said. ``Then he turns up as Boris Yeltsin's
head of the KGB. He goes on to be foreign minister and now he's
prime minister. Most people were stunned when he survived Gorbachev
to work with Yeltsin. Now he's in a position of management for the
first time, and he's working under a leader who is either limited
in what he can do or else totally incapacitated.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond broaching the issue of Yeltsin's health, Brokaw said he
would ask Primakov questions in three main areas: ``Can anything be
done about the economic situation? What about the issue of the
so-called loose nukes? And then, the broad question of whither
Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   One difference between this interview and his 1987 encounter
with Gorbachev is the importance of the men involved, Brokaw said.
``Back then there was the sense that Gorbachev was a star of global
proportions,'' he said. ``But I have to say that when I interviewed
him I had no idea we were that close to the fall of communism.''

   The Night to Be Funny
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Al Franken knows he has one last shot at making his
comedy series ``Lateline'' a candidate for survival on NBC. As of
Tuesday night, the show, a satire of both television news and
politics, had six episodes left in which to find a following
sufficient for NBC to bring it back for new episodes next fall.
</P>
<P>
   Franken, whose second book, ``Why Not Me?'' is a current best
seller, said he hoped that a shift to Tuesday night would
reinvigorate the series, which had languished on Wednesdays in an
earlier trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``At last I think we're in a place where people are looking for
comedy,'' Franken said.
</P>
<P>
   The show's producers struggled with the decision about which
episode to bring the series back with, although they knew the
highlight of their season was almost surely an episode now
scheduled for March 30.
</P>
<P>
   That one, with the guest stars Rob Reiner and Martin Sheen, is a
mock documentary in which Franken's character, Al Freundlich, is
asked to do a cameo role in a film Reiner is making.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rob lets him change one line for the sake of credibility,''
Franken said. ``He keeps suggesting changes until he ends up
destroying the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC will measure ``Lateline'' against whatever new comedies it
develops when it decides in May what next season's schedule will
look like.

   Scientific Leaning
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ PBS plans a new ``Science at Its Best'' block on
Tuesday nights starting this summer, Kathy Quattrone, PBS'
programming chief, said in a speech Tuesday before the New York
chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nova,'' PBS' longstanding science program, will move to 9 p.m.
from its traditional 8 p.m. slot and will be bolstered by a bundle
of new lead-in programs at 8.
</P>
<P>
   These will include a 10-hour series, ``The Life of Birds with
David Attenborough,'' ``Stealing Time: The New Science of Aging,''
``Savage Seas,'' ``The Secret Life of the Brain,'' produced by
David Grubin, and a new installment of ``The Living Edens.''

POLICE COLLUSION IN A NORTHERN IRELAND MURDER WILL BE
INVESTIGATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 by JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The Northern Ireland police chief said Tuesday
that an independent police official from the British mainland and
agents from the FBI would investigate whether there was police
collusion in Monday's killing of a prominent Roman Catholic human
rights lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Rosemary Nelson, 40, was killed by a car bomb placed
by a Protestant splinter group, the Red Hand Defenders. The group
is dedicated to destroying the Northern Ireland peace agreement
approved 10 months ago to end 30 years of violence in the British
province.
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Irish Republican Army and the main Protestant
paramilitary groups have been observing a cease-fire while their
political representatives try to complete the agreement by this
Easter. Their work has been stalled by a dispute over disarmament
of the paramilitary groups, particularly the IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, Ronnie Flanagan,
said that David Phillips, a police chief in Kent County, England,
and FBI investigators would work on the case and look into
accusations that the Northern Ireland police had themselves
threatened Ms. Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence to substantiate collusion,'' Flanagan
said. ``There is no doubt about the professionalism'' of the
northern police force.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, responded
immediately that one British policeman could not be trusted to
investigate honestly the operations of another. They did not
mention the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   After the killing in the town of Lurgan, County Armagh, west of
Belfast, there were disorders in Catholic areas. But the North was
quiet Tuesday and political officials and police said it did not
appear that there would be more violent reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nelson was a leading advocate of Catholics accused of
terrorist offenses by the British government.

CARS DON'T FLY THROUGH KCI GARAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   It was a weeknight with not much
activity at the airport. The terminal where friends were arriving
on a flight from St. Louis was nearly empty.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because leaving a car on the terminal drive isn't an option, I
pulled into the parking garage. The time stamped on my
machine-issued ticket was 7:45.
</P>
<P>
   The friends' flight was on time _ a few minutes early, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collect your baggage,'' I told them. ``I'll go get the car and
meet you in front of the terminal.''
</P>
<P>
   I hurried back to my parking place, in a convenient slot on the
surface level. When I slipped behind the wheel, the dashboard clock
read 8:05 _ still 10 minutes left of the allotted half-hour of free
parking.
</P>
<P>
   Exit arrows led down a ramp to the level below and straight into
a horrific jam-up.
</P>
<P>
   To get back on the terminal drive would mean negotiating a kind
of serpentine maze _ first a series of left turns, complicated by
cars merging from the right, then up another ramp to the
toll-takers' booths. But the line wasn't moving _ not moving at
all.
</P>
<P>
   A soup of exhaust fumes filled the underground parking area.
Drivers were stepping out and peering ahead to see if they could
determine the cause of the blockage. I left my car, walked along
the stalled line and around three corners, all the way to the
front.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was immediately apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Of four toll booths at the exit, only two were staffed. The
lanes to the other two were barred.
</P>
<P>
   When I got back to my car, the line _ maybe 50 or 60 vehicles
long _ still hadn't moved. It eventually did move, of course. Given
enough time, even mountains move. But for every car that made it
out, two or three more joined the queue. There was no guessing when
the nightmare might finally end.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was my turn at the pay station.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the devil's gone wrong?'' I demanded of the addled young
fellow in the booth.
</P>
<P>
   From his body language and tormented expression, I got an
impression that he might be close to going berserk.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN BOLD``All these flights!''END BOLD he screeched.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes darted furiously back over the line.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN BOLD``And people _ people losing their tickets.''END BOLD
</P>
<P>
   Lost tickets can't be helped, I suppose. But the evening's air
traffic was, if anything, uncommonly light. Anyway, flights are
scheduled, predictable. Planes don't just drop in unannounced to
dump their passengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got four booths,'' I told the toll-taker. ``And only
two are operating.''
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN BOLD``Right. Two empty. We've called for some help, but
nothing's happened. Nobody's come.''END BOLD
</P>
<P>
   The toll-taker wasn't at fault. He was just a cog in a broken
system, caught up, as we all were, in somebody else's failure.
</P>
<P>
   He ran my parking ticket through his machine. And put out his
hand for payment. I had been back at the car well before my free
half-hour had elapsed _ but that was at five minutes after 8. The
time now was 20 until 9.
</P>
<P>
   I paid, though, without complaint, as the drivers ahead of me
had done. Nobody wanted a discussion. What we wanted was BEGIN BOLD
out! END BOLD
</P>
<P>
   My friends still were waiting when I pulled up at last on the
terminal drive. They'd spent about as much time standing there in
the cold on the sidewalk as they had spent in the air between St.
Louis and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   It's a small matter, I suppose. But a lot of people's time had
been wasted. They'd been inconvenienced for no reason and kept from
places they needed to be. And for good measure, some were made to
pay a fee just for waiting in line.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, isn't it, how we somehow can manage to run a pretty
fair international airport when we can't run a parking garage?

<P>
   ELI, West Bank _ From this entrenched Jewish settlement on a
bluff above the Palestinian territories, the vista is dotted for
miles around with what Israelis and Palestinians call ``facts on
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every hilltop bears a scattering of mobile homes,
evidence of the continuing and willful expansion of the Jewish
presence in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The hills are truly alive with the sound of hammers, buzz saws
and bulldozers as Israelis _ with the help of Palestinian laborers
_ dig into the land. They aim to sink their roots as deeply as
possible in the hope that the acres they occupy now will never be
turned over to the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they built the hill, we climbed on up,'' said Oria
Levinstein, 17, whose family moved from Eli, which is almost
suburban, into a tin shack on a barren hillside nearby. ``We felt
like pioneers. At first it was horrible _ no water, no electricity.
But now we have our trailers, and it's gorgeous. Look at this view!
At night you see all the land of Israel. What, we should let the
Arabs have it?''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Palestinian leaders have criticized the growth of
Jewish settlements in the West Bank, particularly in the stretch of
rocky hills between the Palestinian cities of Ramallah and Nablus.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last few days, American diplomats have turned up the
pressure on Israel to contain the expansion, butting heads with the
Israelis in a war of words played out through the media. Last
weekend Dennis Ross, the American envoy to the Middle East peace
talks, in an unusual public rebuke, called increased settlement
activity ``very destructive to the pursuit of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, defying the
American criticism, visited a West Bank settlement and vowed, ``We
want it to be bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday the American Embassy in Tel Aviv issued a pointed
statement in response. ``We have been troubled by Israel's
expansion of existing settlements well beyond their periphery,''
said Larry Schwartz, the embassy spokesman. ``These activities
prejudge and predetermine issues that were to be reserved for
permanent-status negotiations by changing realities on the
ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The embassy statement was issued as Ross was flying to Madrid to
see the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, in a meeting scheduled at
the last minute. Ross was expected to press Arafat to delay a
declaration of statehood beyond May 4, when the original
Israeli-Palestinian peace accord expires.
</P>
<P>
   Some Palestinian officials said they believed the American
criticism of Israel was timed to make Arafat more receptive.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Israeli-Palestinian peace memorandum, negotiated
at the Wye Plantation in Maryland last fall, prohibits both sides
from taking unilateral actions to jeopardize their understanding.
The Americans, who brokered the agreement, see both a May 4
statehood declaration by Arafat and continued settlement expansion
by Israel as unilateral acts that would violate the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis contend that they are expanding settlements based
on the natural growth of the 140 communities; they say the
settlements are theirs to expand until their future is decided in
the final-status negotiations, which have not yet begun. Indeed,
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon counseled the settlers last fall to
make haste by ``grabbing hilltops'' before land was turned over to
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans and the Palestinians contend that the
expansion is carving out new Jewish communities, either by
occupying new land or by turning makeshift communities into more
established settlements by replacing trailers with houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we close our eyes to these facts on the ground, they will
become a reality we cannot negotiate away,'' Ahmed Qurei, the
speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council, said at a recent
meeting. ``We cannot sit in our houses and watch the bulldozers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, though, Palestinian protests have been restrained. When
one Palestinian legislator suggested forbidding Palestinian
laborers to work on the settlement projects, another scoffed,
saying, ``Not until they have an economic alternative, like our own
construction projects.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Embassy closely monitors settlement activity, but
does not release any data.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli and American peace groups say 16 new settlements
have risen in the five months since the Wye accord was signed at
the White House. The trailer communities, blocks of white
rectangles atop the highest hills, are as conspicuous as the banks
of new house frames that stand beside the established communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is very simple,'' said Mossi Raz, the general
director of Peace Now in Israel. ``The settlers go to a hill, most
of the time next to the settlement where they live and in some
cases outside the boundaries. They put up some trailers. They build
a road to the place. And nobody does anything about it, not the
police, not the army.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the last five years, the settler population has grown at a
rate of about 9 percent a year, to 170,000 Jews living amid
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. Peace Now says the vacancy
rate in the established settlements hovers around 8 or 9 percent,
negating the argument that there is need to expand.
</P>
<P>
   But Pinchas Wallerstein, chairman of the Yesha Council, the
umbrella settlers' group, said the empty residences represent
natural turnover. He also said he hoped to see faster growth after
the end of this school year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it will increase by 11 or 12 percent this year,'' he
said. ``But I don't know that there are a lot of people who will be
willing to pay $100,000 for a house in the middle of an area where
the political situation is unstable. I can give them a narrow
caravan, but if they want to live in a permanent house, they have
to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallerstein discounted most of the new hilltop communities.
``They are not expansion,'' he said. ``They are very young fellows
or families who stay there to make a point, but the living
conditions are too difficult. There is growth in the settlements,
but it is not in the hills. What is important to us is to grow in a
way that connects areas of Jewish sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited as an example a six-month-old outpost of four families
between Eli and Shilo, called Givat Harel, in an area at the center
of the West Bank that is experiencing the greatest growth.
</P>
<P>
   Eli is 14 years old and home to 400 families, both religious and
secular, about 20 percent of whom are new immigrants. A sign at the
foot of the hill promises houses ``With Cable!'' whose prices start
at $49,000. The town director, Lior Shtul, boasts of the short
commute to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who come here for quality of life, and those
who come for that plus ideology,'' he said. ``Both ways, we grow.
We continue to build. This government comes and this government
goes, and nothing changes but what sits on the ground.''

</P>
<P>
   RACHEL-GRIFFITHS-FILMS (Hollywood) _ Even before she made her
first movie, Rachel Griffiths' face was famous. She first realized
this back home in Australia while sitting in a Melbourne movie
house watching Martin Scorsese's 1991 remake of the thriller ``Cape
Fear.'' In it, Robert De Niro's oily convict stalks a teen-ager
played by Juliette Lewis, who has the same high forehead as Ms.
Griffiths, as well as the same full mouth, large eyes and short
dark hair. In the business of acting, such look-alike recognition
can be a minus when just starting out. But with a co-starring role
in the international hit ``Muriel's Wedding'' three years later,
Ms. Griffiths made the first big step toward helping the public
connect her own name to her face. For her role as Muriel's
party-girl sidekick, Ms. Griffiths took home her country's version
of the Oscar for best supporting actress and wound up with
theatrical representatives wrangling deals for her around the
globe. By Margy Rothlin. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   MONTENEGRO-OSCAR (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ The first time it
occurred to Fernanda Montenegro that she could ever win an Academy
Award for best actress was at the Berlin Film Festival early last
year, before she and the film, ``Central Station,'' had won the
festival's top prizes. At breakfast one morning, the movie's
producer, Arthur Cohn, turned to her and said: ``You know, you're
going to get an Oscar nomination out of this.'' Since Cohn has five
Oscars of his own for foreign films and documentaries, his opinion
is not to be dismissed lightly. But the odds would seem to be
stacked against her. At age 69, Ms. Montenegro has acted in just
nine movies, and until ``Central Station,'' in which she plays an
embittered former schoolteacher who becomes a letter writer for
illiterate people in order to eke out a precarious living, only a
couple had been released in the United States. By Larry Rohter.

   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHTICK-DANCE (New York) _ Talk about a tough crowd. Last fall,
the choreographer Danial Shapiro invited some friends and
colleagues to a preview of his new solo, ``Shtick,'' at the
Southern Theater in Minneapolis. Set to klezmer music and Henny
Youngman jokes, the dance was conceived as an upbeat sequel to his
1996 elegy about Jewish ghettos and concentration camps, called
``What Dark/Falling Into Light.'' With the first public performance
just two nights away, Shapiro was looking for a pat on the back,
and maybe a little constructive criticism. Instead he learned what
a lonely place the stage can be. By Christopher Reardon.
</P>
<P>
   BAHAI-CARNAVAL (Salvador, Brazil) _ In Salvador, the capital of
Brazil's state of Bahia, which has one of the richest carnival
traditions in the new world, all the connoisseurs of Bahia's
Carnaval have the same thing jotted down in their agendas: to
attend the start of the Ile Aiye parade. Ile Aiye (pronounced
Ee-leh Eye-eh) is one of the various carnival organizations, called
blocos, that sponsor floats and parades throughout the six-day
street festival that engulfs this city. But of all of them it is
perhaps the purest. Its percussion-and-voice band has refused to go
pop, sticking to the slow, stately Ijexa rhythms _ an African sort
of samba associated with the Afro-Brazilian religion of candomble.
It insists on walking through the streets rather than riding on a
sound truck the way other bands do. By Ben Ratliff.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THEATER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   RED-THEATER (New York) _ He is wry and witty, the very picture
of a promising young playwright, with his blue jeans, his black
leather jacket and his California cool. But in his mind's eye, he
is still clumsy and awkward, a gawky crow craving acceptance from a
tribe of graceful sparrows. And it is this metaphor, he says, that
best reflects his existence as a gay Chinese-American writer
struggling to succeed in a white world. ``It's how I see myself in
America, living on the periphery and longing to be in the midst of
it,'' said Chay Yew, 33, one of a handful of critically acclaimed
Asian-American writers actively working in the theater in this
country. ``It's like when you go to a bar,'' said Yew, whose newest
play, ``Red,'' opens on Tuesday at the Manhattan Theater Club Stage
2. ``You see all these guys. They're having a good time and you
want to be like them. But you know you never can. By Rachel L.
Swarns. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   CLOSER-THEATER (Undated) _ The British dramatist Patrick Marber,
34, new play ``Closer'' is a bitter, darkly comic prize-winning
English play about sex and longing. Underlying themes of betrayal
and competition are signified early on in a notriously ribald scene
in which two male strangers correspond in a cyberspace chat room,
one posing as a sexually hungry woman, the other happy to believe
it. The play, which won the triple crown in England _ the Olivier,
The Evening Standard and the Critics Circle awards _ opens on
Thursday at the Music Box Theater on Broadway. By Andrea Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   BLACK-WOMEN-PLAYWRIGHTS (Undated) _ While it is true that black
women playwrights are being produced in major Off Broadway and
regional theaters, they have yet to obtain the kind of consistent,
high-profile presence and voice accorded African-American women
today in popular music and fiction writing. The reasons offered for
why there is no female equivalent, for example, of the eminent
black playwright August Wilson on Broadway have to do not only with
the vagaries of an outsize talent but also the difficulties that
have always faced women _ but especially black and other minority
women _ in the theater. They include what has become a truism in
recent years, that straight plays do not attract Broadway
audiences, and that to do so successfully they have to offer broad
themes that mass audiences can relate to; that a number of small
theaters that nurtured talent, both black and white, have closed at
a time when government financial support for the arts is dwindling;
that there is a perception of artistic and financial risk in
mounting plays by blacks and women; that in the male-dominated
theater world, women have traditionally had difficulty finding
mentors and producers. By Felicia R. Lee. Photo.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SANTA-FE-MUSIC (Undated) _ What began as a New York appearance
by performers of the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival has evolved
into a virtual weekend in the historic capital of New Mexico: a
three-day musical and cultural holiday, beginning on Thursday,
mostly within the confines of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. And
as befits Santa Fe, where controversy flows back through history to
the city's founding in 1610, the music is likely to be accompanied
by a note of political discord. By Lawrence B. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DIEGO-RIVERA-ART (Cleveland) _ The big Diego Rivera
retrospective, organized by the Cleveland Museum of Art with the
Consejo Nacional para la Cultura y las Artes and the Instituto
Nacional de Bellas Artes in Mexico City, leans particularly on his
early years, before Rivera returned from Europe to Mexico and
started painting the murals for which he rightly became most
famous. The point: that the murals have obscured the value of his
previous work. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TELEVISION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TV-ITS-LIKE (Los Angeles) _ In the ceaseless civic sniping
between New York and Los Angeles, everybody always talks about the
weather, but nobody ever does anything about it. Until now. In what
at first appears to be a new skirmish in this culture war, the ABC
sitcom ``It's Like, You Know ...'' surveys the L.A. landscape _
where the people are as convertible as the cars they drive _ and
quickly runs up the flag of surrender. What charms beyond the
weather this city holds for its tired, its poor, its brain-dead,
non-softball-playing huddled masses are to be revealed,
elliptically, during a six-week trial run of ``It's Like, You Know
...'' beginning this Wednesday night at 8:30. By Bruce Newman.
</P>
<P>
   TV-RECKLESS (Undated) _ ``Reckless,'' is a production of Granada
Television presented last year on ``Mobil Masterpiece Theater,''
starring Francesca Annis, the acclaimed British stage actress, and
Robson Green, a heartthrob from northern England who is one of
Britain's most popular television actors. Ms. Annis is 54; Green is
34. The six-hour series, which also features Michael Kitchen as the
arrogant, philandering husband, was a huge hit in England. When it
was broadcast here in early 1998, The New York Times critic Caryn
James called it ``a deliciously tangled story of passion,
infidelity and civilized revenge.'' ``Reckless'' was such a success
that Granada made a two-hour sequel. ``Masterpiece Theater'' begins
rebroadcasting the original series on PBS next Sunday night,
followed by ``Reckless: The Sequel'' on April 18. By Jill Gerston.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ANTIQUES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SUGIMOTO-ART-ANTIQUES (Undated) _ Most people view the things
they collect as a diversion from what they do for a living. But for
the Japanese photographer Hiroshi Sugimoto, 51, the traditional
Japanese art he collects is absolutely essential to the art he
creates: compelling images of seascapes, waxworks, life-size
Buddhas and the gilded interiors of motion picture palaces. While
Sugimoto's photographs are exhibited widely, the art he collects is
rarely displayed, even in his homes in Tokyo and New York. Now he
has lent three pieces to ``Crosscurrents: Masterpieces of East
Asian Art from New York Private Collections,'' an exhibition that
opens on Wednesday and remains through July 11 at the Japan Society
Gallery in Manhattan. By Rita Reif.

   STERKFONTEIN CAVES, South Africa _ Deep in the dark, dank
caverns here, Dr. Ronald J. Clarke, a man with a long list of
academic credentials, is at work.
</P>
<P>
   He is sprawled against a rock face, lying on an old camping
mattress, his tools scattered on a nearby ledge: a few sharpened
nail punches, some dental picks, Super Glue, a old jam jar full of
lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   With a rusting hammer and his tiny chisels, he tap, tap, taps,
gentle millimeter by millimeter, chipping the rock away from around
his discovery. Embedded in the stone is a skeleton perhaps 3.6
million years old _ a skeleton that may help answer some of the
enduring questions about human evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Already the skull has been exposed. The teeth, still shiny with
enamel, gleam under the spotlight an assistant holds. After a
morning's work, Clarke has cleared enough rock from the base of the
skull to insert a tiny pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at that,'' he said, almost breathless with wonder.
Despite all the movement of rock around it, the delicate skull _
completely hollow _ has remained whole.
</P>
<P>
   Such work might try the patience of some. But Clarke uses words
like ``exciting'' and makes clear in a very polite way that he
would rather be chipping than talking. Behind his discovery _
front-page news around the world last December _ is a kind of
detective story that begins in a storage room in 1994 and included
an inch-by-inch search of a 30-foot-high cavern to look for a spot
about the size of a quarter that would match a piece of broken
shinbone.
</P>
<P>
   After the discovery, the international press descended here, the
experts debated and Clarke was distracted from the caves, where he
has worked for more than two decades. Nowadays he is back at work _
slowly, slowly trying to extract the precious skeleton, hoping that
his calculations, which led him to the conclusion that he had found
a truly whole skeleton will be borne out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a bit worrying,'' he admitted, as he used a soft
artist's brush to push away the fragments left from his digging.
``It's a big responsibility to be telling the whole world that the
whole thing is in there. Now I've got to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing about the caves to announce the magnitude of
the find, which many scientists have likened in import to the
discovery of the famous ``Lucy'' skeleton in Ethiopia in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The Sterkfontein caves are about a 45-minute drive from downtown
Johannesburg. There is a modest sign announcing the tourist
entrance, where there is a cheery little tea room that is not very
busy.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke's base of operation, a large tin-roofed shed with neatly
labeled boxes and tables full of prehistoric bones, is down an
unmarked gravel path. When the excavation is through, scientists
hope they will be able to match hip structure with leg bones and
brain capacity for the first time, and thus understand far more
about what this four-foot-tall creature was capable of.
</P>
<P>
   But Clarke does not even have the $170,000 he needs to keep his
operation going until the end of the year. As he was busy
unearthing the first bones of his discovery, he was also scrambling
for a job.
</P>
<P>
   After years at the prestigious University of the Witwatersrand,
Clarke was informed in early 1998 that his contract would not be
renewed. The decision was made by the head of the University's
paleo-anthropology research groups, Dr. Lee Berger, a flamboyant
32-year-old American regarded as an able fund-raiser for the
discipline, which is chronically in need.
</P>
<P>
   Berger did attend Clarke's news conference in December, praising
his colleague warmly and calling the discovery a ``fossil
comparable to no other.'' But later he refused to comment on his
role in Clarke's ouster from the university. In the past, he has
said that Clarke's skills were ``not so special'' and that his
methods were old fashioned and expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke has since been hired by the Johann Wolfgang Goethe
University in Frankfurt, which has agreed to let him keep working
at Sterkfontein, a set of limestone caverns that have yielded
numerous fossils over the years. Witswatersrand officials say now
that they want to bring Clarke back to the university. They have
also set up a special committee to examine how best to administer
the research at the caves in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider the caves a unique resource and Dr. Clarke as
uniquely capable of continuing the work there,'' said Barry V.
Mendelow, the university's executive director of research.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Sterkfontein caves have been an ideal time capsule. The
theory goes that the caves were a popular shelter 3.5 million years
ago, a place where many animals came to eat their prey, leaving the
bones behind. The caves also had small, concealed openings
perfectly suited for the unwary to fall into.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, as water dripped through the stone, the lime
deposited itself onto whatever debris and bones were inside,
encasing them in a rock-hard layer. More than 600 hominid fossils
have been found here, including the adult skull of an
Australopithecus africanus, which was found in 1947 and has come to
be known as Mrs. Ples.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, however, there has been nothing close to a complete
skeleton. The caves were mined for lime in the early part of the
century and much of the work at Sterkfontein has been sifting
through the debris the miners blasted out.
</P>
<P>
   The road to Clarke's discovery began with an academic's
question: Why were there no hoofed animals in the lower chambers of
the cave? He decided to look again at the bones taken from this
area, thinking they might offer an answer.
</P>
<P>
   What he found astonished him. Among the fossils thought to be of
animals was a foot bone that clearly belonged to a hominid. How it
had been misidentified he cannot understand. A further search found
more such bones, a discovery that was later nicknamed Little Foot.
It was significant because it showed a creature that could walk
upright, but still had the ability to climb trees.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Clark chanced to be looking in another
cupboard for some hominid fossils when he spied a box labeled
monkey bones. Inside, however, he found more mislabeled bones,
including a white bone that was the mirror image of Little Foot.
</P>
<P>
   He began to search through more bags of bones from the area
until he had found most of the creature's two feet, ankles and
shinbones, snapped off about halfway up. Such a discovery, Clarke
felt sure, meant that the rest of the creature still had to be in
the cave.
</P>
<P>
   But finding it seemed no easy task. The cave walls are jagged
and crumbling, and there is no natural light. He made a plaster
cast of one of the shinbones and sent his assistants with
flashlights to search for the cross section of its other half.
Amazingly, it took his aides, Nkwane Molefe and Stephen Motsumi,
only two days to find a match.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in the mud in excruciating positions, the team scraped
and chipped, moving up the skeleton, until they came to a dead end.
The thigh bones were broken in half and went no further. After
studying the rock formations, Clarke finally deduced that a shift
of the rocks nearby had dropped the rest of the skeleton to another
level. But month after month went by without anything more being
found.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, the diggers began scraping at a bone _ the
skull.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cave, Clarke is now looking for the vertebrae. He
says it will probably take him until the end of the year to get the
whole skeleton out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so cruel if it wasn't all there,'' he said.

THE MAN WHO CHANGED THE PRESIDENCY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY SWINDELL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some believe that William Jefferson Clinton will be remembered
historically as a president who was impeached but not convicted.
Others say he'll be immortalized as a sex maniac. However he may be
recalled, Clinton may be most significant historically as the man
who changed the presidency, or caused it to be weakened.
</P>
<P>
   A recent and provocative major article in Newsweek considered
the likely effect of the Clinton impeachment on four disciplines:
the law, the media, the workplace and our children. The theoretical
findings were sufficiently interesting, but the presidency itself
may prove to be the institution most affected, most changed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is dazzling proof that a person may simultaneously be
remarkably intelligent and profoundly stupid. He should have known,
as we all do now, that privacy no longer exists in American life.
This is the Age of Information, technology is our new religion, and
it's too easy to get the goods on anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the scene in ``Sleepless in Seattle'' in which Meg Ryan
employs a computer to research the Tom Hanks character she hasn't
even met, and immediately learns enough about him to know she loves
him?
</P>
<P>
   Considering what we are now learning about our president's
purple past, we may conclude that the Republicans really screwed up
in 1992. If they had done their investigative homework, they could
have neutralized early a Bill Clinton who surely was more
vulnerable than poor Gary Hart.
</P>
<P>
   They'll know better next time; they know better already.
Republicans and Democrats alike presently are probing
comprehensively the pre-gubernatorial, premarital, pre-everything
experience of one George W. Bush _ the one party seeking
affirmation, the other in quest of Achilles' heel.
</P>
<P>
   Henceforth it will be rather more difficult to secure a major
party's presidential nomination if the aspirant has a skeleton in
his closet or a bat in his belfry or a complex odyssey below his
belt line.
</P>
<P>
   Count on both party nominees in the 2000 presidential
sweepstakes being certified squeaky-clean. And after one of them
wins the election and takes office, he (she?) will be monitored as
never before.
</P>
<P>
   Compared, say, with passing muster to assume a Cabinet post or
other strategic federal function, it lately has been easier to
become president of the United States. Once nomination has been
secured, all it takes is pulling in more votes than your opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Federal appointments used to be rubber-stamped. What the
president wanted, the president got. The historical turning point
probably was Richard Nixon's failed attempt to get Clement
Haynesworth seated on the Supreme Court. The House and Senate
inhaled newfound power in that adventure and ever since have
relished investigating presidential choices for Cabinet, court and
top diplomatic positions.
</P>
<P>
   Those aspiring to the presidency now will be dissected, tracked
literally from birth _ perhaps not by lawmakers but certainly by
the media as well as by partisan interests.
</P>
<P>
   If our present information tools had been available then, would
Warren Harding, say, have been cleared for a presidential run? Or
even John F. Kennedy?
</P>
<P>
   Of relevance to all this is a new literary entertainment by
Richard Shenkman, a decidedly offbeat historian. His ``Presidential
Ambition'' is an account of how our bygone presidents ``gained
power, kept power, and got things done.'' It is a big parade of
presidents getting away, if not with murder (although some surely
have tried), with almost everything else _ but not in bourdoirs
primarily.
</P>
<P>
   Shenkman's White House saga is both an expose of presidential
skullduggery and a glorification of presidential chutzpah. Onward
from Thomas Jefferson, whose consummation of the Louisiana Purchase
certainly was unconstitutional, presidents often have abused their
power for what they believed was the good of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Jackson, James Polk, Abraham Lincoln, Grover Cleveland,
Woodrow Wilson, Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman _
these now etched historically as superstar chief executives all
displayed strength by exceeding the specified boundaries of their
assigned role.
</P>
<P>
   They, and lesser presidents as well, also told lies. Their
prevarications were not always pragmatic, although they were rather
different in character from Clinton's lies. And there's no evidence
that Warren Gamaliel Harding ever had to lie about having fathered
an illegitimate child, because Harding was in his grave before the
fact was known.
</P>
<P>
   After Harding's somewhat shadowy and unexpected death in 1923,
Nan Britton _ his mistress in that well-known White House cloakroom
_ published a ``novel'' called ``The President's Daughter'' that
failed to gain for her such wealth as Monica Lewinsky surely will
attain.
</P>
<P>
   When our nation went ``back to normalcy'' for a Harding
administration that amounted to government by crony, the
president's raffish inner sanctum knew all about Britton. So did
Florence Harding, the wronged wife. But the American people
couldn't know _ primitive investigative journalism bypassed the
presidency because it was a sacred trust.
</P>
<P>
   It truly has been that. For more than 200 years, Americans have
beheld their presidency with awesome reverence, but that will
change _ is changing already.
</P>
<P>
   Expect future editions of Congress to hold presidential
aggressiveness firmly in check. In the new millennium, presidents
will be sorely challenged to gain power, to keep power and to get
things done. That will be the everlasting legacy of Bill Clinton.

GROWTH FORECAST FOR SOUTH KOREA; RECOVERY FOR OTHER ASIAN NATIONS
UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ South Korea is the only sizable Asian economy that
appears to be pulling out of the region's economic crisis, although
its unemployment rate has risen and shows no immediate sign of
declining, the International Labor Organization said in a study
released here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The ILO, a U.N. specialized agency, said the financial collapse
had resulted in the loss of 24 million jobs in East and Southeast
Asia, with Indonesia having suffered the largest losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Indonesia, one out of five jobs was lost late last year,
leading to 5 to 6 million'' people becoming unemployed, Eddy Lee,
an ILO economist, said in a briefing. The agency's study is an
updated version of a 1998 report on Asian employment problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lee said that recovery was uncertain not only in Indonesia, but
also in Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Extensive Asian business failures had resulted in the jobless
ranks' nearly doubling in Hong Kong, China and the Philippines, the
ILO said. Others, like South Korea, saw the jobless rate more than
triple _ to 7.6 percent last year from 2.5 percent in 1996, and
reaching 8.5 percent at the end of February, the ILO said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Korea clearly bottomed out at the end of last year,'' Lee
said, forecasting that despite the increased joblessness, there
would be growth in output as great as 2.5 percent in South Korea
this year.
</P>
<P>
   While unemployment levels have not fallen in any Asian country,
Lee continued, ``the rate of increase has slowed down
considerably.''
</P>
<P>
   The ILO is urging Asian countries to create unemployment
insurance, and to increase spending on social assistance. It has
offered to help design such programs.

 &HT;    FCC to phone companies: Show us the equipmentBy Michael E.
Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Billions of dollars in phone equipment is missing,
says the Federal Communications Commission.
</P>
<P>
   No it isn't and besides it doesn't matter, answer the regional
phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has released an audit by its staff, which shows the
phone companies cannot account for about $5 billion of the $47
billion in ``hard-wired'' equipment that they have been carrying on
their books. The agency has announced no punishment, but suggests
that the companies write off the investment.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth is listed by FCC auditors as having $721.2 million in
assets its cannot account for, about 3.3 percent of the asset toal.
The worst offender, according to the FCC, was Bell Atlantic, with
$1.56 billion, or about 11.6 percent of assets, ``missing.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth _ like the other target companies _ rejects the
audit's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is flawed, faulty and badly done audit that came to a bad
conclusion,'' said BellSouth spokesman Bill McCloskey. ``Even if we
wrote it all off, there would be zero impact on rates. We are under
price caps in all nine of our states.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts too seemed unconcerned. Joseph Barthel of Fahnestock
wrote the audit is ``audit of the RBOCs is no serious threat to
their financial performance.'' He called it a ``ridiculous game of
'Gotcha!' at the FCC.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts at Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. wrote that the audit reports are
``a publicity, not a financial problem'' for the phone companies.
They too concluded that the audit should not affect prices for
phone service.
</P>
<P>
   But competitors say consumers should care.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom spokesman Joe Paluska said that even if rates
cannot rise, it may mean that BellSouth is reaping more profits
than are justified by its costs. ``These inflated investments were
used to develop those price caps.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC has thus far taken no action on its staff report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the story is over,'' Paluska said.

 &HT;    Women claiming a stronger presence in investment clubs
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investing used to be dominated by men.
</P>
<P>
   No longer.
</P>
<P>
   One telling sign: Women now make up 68 percent of the membership
of the National Association of Investors Corp., which represents
733,000 individual and investment club members.
</P>
<P>
   There's also evidence women make better investors than men,
according to data compiled by the NAIC, based in Madison Heights,
Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, about 70 percent of the NAIC's members were
men.
</P>
<P>
   What's changed?
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend has closely followed the number of women who entered
the work force,'' explained Jonathan Strong, the NAIC's manager of
membership development. ``And those women are searching for ways to
learn about investing and how to take charge of their financial
future.''
</P>
<P>
   That can be daunting, if you're on your own. So many have banded
together in investment clubs, pooling their money to buy stocks
under the NAIC's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Women-only clubs now comprise 50 percent of the NAIC's 37,401
investment clubs nationwide. Men-only clubs make up only 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed-gender clubs also are growing in popularity, accounting
for 40 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a clear increase in the popularity of husband-wife
clubs (spouse group clubs) and clubs that are formed from
individuals through work,'' Strong said. Spurring the latter is the
fact many employers are asking workers to decide where to invest
their funds for retirement though 401(k) plans, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``So people want to learn about investing and how to manage
their money,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   Women-only clubs tend to outperform men-only and mixed-gender
clubs, according to NAIC data.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997-98, for example, the average compounded annual
lifetime earnings rate for all-female clubs was 23.8 percent,
compared with 19.2 percent for all-male clubs. The rate for
mixed-gender clubs was 21.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The NAIC found women-only clubs do better for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   _ They tend to buy stocks at better prices than men-only clubs.
After deciding what stock to buy, men-only clubs usually buy at
current market prices. Women-only clubs raise an additional
question before buying: ``What should we pay for it?''
</P>
<P>
   _ Women-only clubs aren't inclined to buy on investment tips, as
men-only clubs do.
</P>
<P>
   _ Women-only clubs have more patience. They hew to a
``buy-and-hold'' strategy and are more willing to ride out the
rough times to realize a profit on an investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's investment clubs typically follow NAIC's long-term
investment philosophy by the book,'' Strong said.
</P>
<P>
   The clubs generally follow four principles when investing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Invest a set amount regularly, regardless of market
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reinvest all dividends and capital gains for compound growth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy growth stocks _ companies whose sales and earnings are
increasing at a rate faster than its industry.
</P>
<P>
   _ Diversify. Invest in different industries and different-size
companies.

 &HT;    Cracking 10,000 _ What happens next?
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Okay, what next?
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Dow Jones industrial average has traded above
10,000 for the first time, investors would like to know if it will
close above that benchmark level any time soon, drop back or go
even higher.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is probably, ``All of the above,'' which leaves open
the matter of sequence.
</P>
<P>
   Big upward moves in stock averages tend to be followed by at
least small setbacks _ especially when the market passes one of
those historic milestones.
</P>
<P>
   The early history of the Dow's 1,000-point moves certainly is
not encouraging in that regard.
</P>
<P>
   The index plunged 42 percent in the two years following its
first close above 1,000 on Nov. 14, 1972, in the worst bear market
since the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Dow closed above 2,000 for the first time on Jan. 8
and on Oct. 19 was down by 13 percent after the stock market's
worst crash ever.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dow's first close above 3,000 on May 30, 1991, was
followed by a 4.6 percent slide that didn't end until Dec. 12,
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, the picture substantially improves. The Dow
has posted gains of as much as 25 percent (en route to 5,000), and
most recently, 10.7 percent (rising to 10,000 Tuesday before
falling back.).
</P>
<P>
   But every stock research report and mutual fund prospectus
contains a statement that past performance is no guarantee of
future behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are especially concerned that the Dow and the broader
S&AMP;P-500 indexes are the only ones making new highs, while the
Nasdaq composite and the Russell 2000 _ both of which contain lots
of smaller companies and technology stocks _ appear to be stalled.
</P>
<P>
   To market technicians, that is a sign the market lacks breadth.
</P>
<P>
   Interstate/Johnson Lane analyst Ricky Harrington calls the
performance gap between big and small stocks ``the market's most
serious weakness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, 48 percent of all New York Stock Exchange stocks
are down 30 percent from their most recent highs,'' said
Harrington. He argued that this is the kind of situation that
usually occurs at market tops _ from which stocks sell off.
</P>
<P>
   But Ralph Acampora, strategist and market technician for
Prudential Securities, believes the Dow _ and the market _ are on
the first leg of a new bull market that started last October when
the 1998 correction ended.
</P>
<P>
   According to Acampora, the significance of the Dow's rise was
not that it crossed 10,000 _ ``That's just a number,'' he said _
but that it was carried there by stocks of good quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bull markets start that way,'' said Acampora, who first
predicted that the Dow would reach 10,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus among analysts is that as long as the economy
stays healthy, with minimal inflation and falling interest rates,
the stock market will continue to rise.
</P>
<P>
   This outlook is especially the case given the
``liquidity-driven'' nature of the market, as oceans of money flood
into stocks via individual mutual funds, 401(k) plans and other
pension systems. This in turn is being fed by the huge post-World
War II baby boom generation as it reached middle age with an eye on
retirement. Foreign investors add to the buying momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Total stock market assets in mutual funds rose from $245.8
billion in 1990 to $2.4 trillion _ an 876 percent increase _
according to the latest numbers from the Investment Company
Institute reports.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see no reason to think this momentum will change,
barring some unpredictable outside event such as a Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident, they say, that the economy has expanded
without interruption over that same period that the Dow has gone
from 3,000 in April 1991 to where it is now _ the longest peacetime
expansion in U.S. economic history.
</P>
<P>
   The economy has given investors a relatively inflation free
environment of predictable growth that has made investing in common
stocks less risky _ as well as more attractive than bonds, whose
yields have steadily declined.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the wealth created by rising stock prices has buoyed
consumer and investor confidence, supporting a spending spree that
has, in turn, fueled the economy's growth.

 &HT;    Dow average often mirrors events in U.S. history
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dow rises, the Dow falls, the Dow remains unchanged, but
most of all, the Dow makes news _ and in the latest case, history.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, of course, is the Dow Jones industrial average. Why it
should get so much attention is a matter of considerable debate,
between those who see the Dow at 10,000 as historic and those who
see 10,000 as ``just a number.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the Dow's detractors have to admit that, more than any
other Wall Street indicator, it has become synonymous with ``the
stock market,'' a fixture in the conversations of everybody from
taxi drivers to sales clerks to corporate chief executives to
presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Who talks about the S&AMP;P-500, or the Nasdaq composite?
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the Dow's singular status is its age. At 103
years, it is by far the oldest and best known of the world's stock
market indexes.
</P>
<P>
   And if nothing else, the Dow is a survivor. Consider the
publicity it has gotten in just the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   True, the index is comprises a mere 30 stocks in a universe of
some 10,000 public companies. For that and other reasons, the index
has been derided over the years as obsolete and misleading, not a
true barometer of investment trends.
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the Dow.
</P>
<P>
   The index dates from 1896, the invention of Charles Henry Dow, a
founder of Dow Jones &AMP; Co. After a dozen years of experimenting, he
had settled on an index that averaged the prices of a dozen
railroad and manufacturing stocks.
</P>
<P>
   (Jones, incidentally, was Edward Davis Jones, who helped found
what is now Dow, Jones &AMP; Co., publisher of The Wall Street Journal,
whose staff maintains the index.)
</P>
<P>
   The Dow has been adjusted and revised constantly by Journal
staffers over the years, to 20 stocks early on, and in 1928 to 30
industrial companies.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the makeup of the index was revised by adding
non-industrial stocks such as J.P. Morgan and Sears, to reflect the
range of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its small size, critics of the index don't like
the way it works. As a price-weighted index, higher-priced stocks
have a greater impact on the average than do movements of
lower-priced stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its faults, the Dow has become almost a universal
timeline of historical as well as economic events in the 20th
century. It has responded to war and peace, to booms and busts, and
survived crashes in 1929 and 1987 en route to 10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, the Dow has become an icon for a decade of
astonishing wealth and remarkable growth, marking with its
100-point and 1,000-point benchmarks the rise of Uncle Sam in the
post-Cold War world.

   ATLANTA _ Perched in a metal frame near the wall of the vast
room is a machine that has been used to test circuit boards coming
off nearby assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hayes Corp. has not made modems for several months, the
tester is poised for work, one of many devices designed to run
continually whose lighted panels gaze unblinking at the empty
aisles between the rows of machines. The factory is still crowded
with machines, and the air is still filled with the drone of the
heating system. But gone are the hundreds of employees that once
churned out thousands of modems from these lines.
</P>
<P>
   On the tester's computer screen, there is a request for the
user's name. Someone has typed ``floor.'' Next to that is a space
for a password. But that is blank, as if a Hayes worker had started
to log on and then walked away.
</P>
<P>
   The Norcross, Ga.-based company is now defunct, its last assets
to be auctioned off starting at 10 a.m. today and continuing
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Interested bidders got a chance Monday and Tuesday to see the
offices, warehouse and factory, to preview the items they can bid
on this morning. What they saw was the residue of a 21-year
business.
</P>
<P>
   Co-founded by Dennis Hayes, a Georgia Tech graduate student, the
company went from garage operation to national player in a new
industry that paralleled the boom in personal computers. Analog
modems let PC users connect to each other or to the home office,
radically adding to the value of their desktop machines. As the
Internet was discovered, the shrill cry for connections sent modem
sales into the tens of thousands and then the millions.
</P>
<P>
   D.C. Hayes Associates became Hayes Microcomputer Products,
setting the technical standard for the industry. Sales ballooned,
even as rivals rushed into the fray, stealing shares of the growing
market.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes shrugged off the competition. Who cares about market share
when sales are jumping past $200 million a year? Hayes was a rising
star in Atlanta's growing high-tech constellation, employing about
1,200, and Dennis Hayes was repeatedly named entrepreneur of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   But costs surged faster than sales, losses mounted and in late
1994, Hayes officials called a press conference at Comdex to
announce they had filed for bankruptcy protection. In Chapter 11,
Hayes faced several buyout offers _ including a $140 million bid
from Diamond Multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hayes pleaded with the federal judge for the right to
keep his company and learn from his mistakes. He projected solid
sales growth and surrendered daily operational control. The judge
let Hayes reject the takeover efforts and sent the company out of
bankruptcy. For several quarters, the shiny predictions held, but
then the company stumbled again _ unable to overcome either market
confusion or strong competition from U.S. Robotics.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, Hayes announced a merger with Access Beyond, a
small Maryland company which specialized in connecting mobile
workers to the office. But the deal went sour. Contracts to build
new digital modems were still too small to turn the company around.
Sales of analog modems continued to lag, while Dennis Hayes feuded
with Access Beyond CEO Ron Howard, who had been tapped to run Hayes
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Hayes Corp. filed for bankruptcy protection again.
But this time, there was to be no triumphal emergence.
</P>
<P>
   In November, hundreds of workers were laid off and most of
manufacturing closed down. In late December, Howard and bankers _
already owed about $20 million _ disagreed about how to keep the
company funded. The plug was pulled, the funding ended, the rest of
the company shuttered.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Hayes corporate offices have been largely emptied,
files and papers tossed into bins and carted away by employees of
Emerald Asset Management, which is conducting the auction. On some
walls, a few hangings remain. Many others are left studded with the
pegs that once held pictures and posters and charts. Scores of
chairs are clustered in odd places.
</P>
<P>
   Against one wall, a row of plants is lined, including several
small trees that loom around the doorway. On the counter is a
phone, unconnected. On a table is a pile of paper clips. Nearby,
stands a quartet of wine glasses, the reason for celebration long
forgotten. Hayes Corp. hardly looks like a company that churned out
millions of modems, the juggernaut that dominated the industry
during the 1980s. It hardly looks like a company at all.
</P>
<P>
   Except on the factory floor.
</P>
<P>
   Showing a visitor around the four-building Hayes Corp. campus,
R. Nuri Otus, president of Emerald Asset Management, waved a hand
at the assembly line and praised the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very well-designed facility. That is why I'm
surprised no one came and bought Hayes. It has brand recognition.
It has quality recognition. Everything about Hayes was head and
shoulders above everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   But no ``white knight'' emerged. Instead, the company's
intellectual and other assets have been put up for sale in an
attempt to raise the money needed to pay back Hayes Corp.'s
creditors.
</P>
<P>
   An auction in Manhattan disposed of some corporate pieces,
including some technology and overseas units. Howard and another
former executive bought one piece, a technology similar to that of
Access Beyond. But for the sell-off of hard assets in Norcross,
Emerald was contracted. One of the 10 largest asset management
companies in the nation, Emerald does about 30 auctions a year,
Otus said.
</P>
<P>
   Most are not business liquidations. Instead, Emerald is often
asked to sell unused or out-of-date machines by the likes of Apple
or IBM. Those clients, in good financial shape, just need to unload
inventory to empty warehouse space and clear the books.
</P>
<P>
   Coming to Hayes, on the other hand, is like walking into a ghost
town, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Otus nodded at the apparatus that remained and wondered why he
was selling much of it piecemeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody could walk in today and begin building modems within
a few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   The auction is intended to raise money toward paying off the
staggering debt Hayes amassed as it went under. Many employees of
the corporation were also promised bonuses if they stayed after
Hayes hit trouble. When the final layoffs came, many also expected
the same kind of severance packages that were paid to previously
laid-off employees. Those payments were not made.
</P>
<P>
   So while bargains may be had here and there, that isn't the
auction's prime function, Otus said. ``It's not my job to give
bargains. It's my job to get as much money as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   How the money is dispersed is up to the federal bankruptcy court
in Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Otus toted up the money expected from the auction, along with
that from previous sales of corporate assets and the trickle of
payments from former customers. Ex-employees should not assume they
will never get anything, but they should also be patient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the employees will see something. It won't be for
12, 24 or 36 months, but I do think they will see something.''

CLINTON PROPOSES $70 BILLION IN DEBT RELIEF FOR POOR AFRICAN
NATIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Calling for a new economic partnership with Africa,
President Clinton on Tuesday urged the international community to
expand debt-relief programs for impoverished African nations, a
proposal that could result in $70 billion worth of loans being
forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech opening a U.S.-Africa ministerial meeting in
Washington, Clinton suggested financing the additional debt-relief
partly through the sale of gold reserves held by the International
Monetary Fund. The president's remarks sent the price of gold to a
6 1/2-week low.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of congressional support for Clinton's African
initiative last year and wariness abroad for selling IMF gold to
provide debt relief, the prospects of winning support at home and
abroad for his proposal appeared to be a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal outlined Tuesday was similar to Clinton's plan,
unveiled during his four-nation tour of Central American last week,
to bolster the economies of emerging democracies and provide
additional markets for U.S. exporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more debtor nations commit to sound economic reforms, the
more creditor nations must be willing to forgive,'' the president
said. ``It is a principled and pragmatic approach, based on what
will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal would expand a World Bank debt-relief program
called the Highly Indebted Poor Countries plan. Begun in 1985, the
program is designed to help relieve poor nations, mostly in Africa,
Central America and South America, of the debt they owe foreign
governments and international lending institutions.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech at the State Department, Clinton tried to
reassure government ministers from 46 African nations that he is
working to fulfill the promises he made during his historic
six-nation tour of the continent one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too much of this century, the relationship between the
United States and Africa was plagued by indifference on our part,''
Clinton said. ``We have been too separate and too unequal. We must
end that by building a better common future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that forgiving the debts of poor nations was
essential to their economic and political reform efforts. ``Our
goal is to ensure that no country committed to fundamental reform
is left with a debt burden that keeps it from meeting its people's
basic human needs and spurring growth,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   A cautionary note was sounded by Youssour Ouedraogo, foreign
minister for Burkina Faso and council chairman of the Organization
of African Unity. While endorsing debt relief, Ouedraogo said it
might be insufficient because economic growth experienced in most
African nations has not improved living conditions there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results of growth, Mr. President, are still absorbed in
large part by debt repayment,'' Ouedraogo said. ``It is time then
to go to the heart of the matter, debt cancellation.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointed out that his budget proposal for 2000 includes
$237 million in debt relief for the poorest African nations. The
current budget includes $245 million in debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The president said that he will urge leaders of the world's
seven wealthiest, industrialized nations to forgive loans rather
than reschedule repayment of the debts, as is commonly practiced to
provide relief to debt-laden nations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pledged U.S. support, which must be cleared by Congress,
for gold sales by the IMF to help with loan forgiveness in Africa.
The IMF holds about $34 billion in gold at current prices. In
addition, the president said, the United States and other developed
nations would help finance the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Clinton's speech, the price of gold for April
delivery fell to just under $284 an ounce in London, down $3.80.

SECURITY BEEFED UP FOLLOWING SPY ALLEGATIONS, SENATE TOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has beefed up security
at nuclear weapons facilities in the wake of allegations that a
U.S. scientist gave atomic secrets to China, Energy Secretary Bill
Richardson told a Senate panel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
Richardson said his department now requires mandatory polygraphs
for all employees with access to sensitive information.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant because (only) one other agency does this,
and that is the Central Intelligence Agency,'' said Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has taken other steps, including assigning
counterspies at all three major U.S. nuclear weapons labs to thwart
future spying, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson added that the agency has doubled its
counter-intelligence budget while consolidating the spy-hunting
efforts in one office headed by Edward Curran, a 35-year FBI
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that at our weapons labs, right now, we have strong
security procedures,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services
Committee, praised Richardson for moving quickly to tighten
security over nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that the actions you personally have taken
during the brief period of your administration as secretary have
been timely and prudent,'' said Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, has
been energy secretary since last August.
</P>
<P>
   The department had long been lax in its supervision of the labs
and failed last year to file a congressionally mandated annual
report on the status of security at the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking over last summer, Richardson reinstated
background checks of all foreign visitors, a step the FBI had
recommended in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson took that and other measures in response to
Presidential Decision Directive 61, an order issued by President
Clinton in February 1998 to boost security at the labs.
</P>
<P>
   The order was prompted by an FBI investigation detailing the
possible theft by China of U.S. nuclear warhead design secrets. The
alleged espionage took place in the 1980s. Richardson said the FBI
probe got under way in 1995. Other administration officials have
said it officially started in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A computer scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New
Mexico was fired March 8 after refusing to cooperate with FBI
officials. The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, a Taiwan-born American, has
not been charged.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, who earlier Tuesday met with committee members for
more than two hours in a closed session, said the administration
won't know the extent of the damage from the alleged espionage
until the Central Intelligence Agency completes an investigation
next month.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the indications are that the spying may have hurt
national security. ``It's serious. It's inexcusable. Compromises
did happen,'' Richardson said. Intelligence experts say the
security breach may have allowed China to develop longer-range
missiles carrying more accurate multiple warheads.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing Richardson defended a controversial program that
allows foreign scientists to tour the nuclear weapons labs, noting
the agency's current practice of conducting background checks on
the scientists.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate
Intelligence Committee, urged the administration to stop the
program for the time being.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our labs are not as secure as they should be,'' Shelby said.
The administration ``should put a moratorium on the exchange of
people coming into our labs and our scientists going to their labs
and perhaps giving them information,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the General Accounting Office, the congressional
investigative arm, concluded in 1997 that thousands of foreign
nationals had been allowed into Los Alamos and the Sandia National
Laboratories in New Mexico and California's Lawrence Livermore
National Laboratory. The report said scientists from China, Russia,
Iraq, Iran and Libya were among them.

BOB NEWHART _ STILL A STAND-UP COMIC

 BY JOHN BECK Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At 69, Bob Newhart is finally revealing one of his coveted trade
secrets to stand-up comedy _ call it an ode to the power of
porcelain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best routines I ever wrote, I wrote in a john, I think,''
he says in his usual deadpan delivery. ``There should be a book on
it, but I think if someone researched it, most of the great ideas
since the beginning of time probably came out in the john.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all places, why the bathroom?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there's nothing to distract you. If you've been in one
john, you've been in all the johns in the world. So your mind is
kind of focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken in context with the past 40 years of his career, this may
be one of the dirtiest jokes the comic has ever told in public.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Newhart, the buttoned-down, guy-next-door icon of American
comedy, using toilet humor? It might not make it to the stage, but
any appearance by Newhart promises to deliver plenty of fresh
insights to complement his tried-and-true bag of gags.
</P>
<P>
   He said his shows usually include one or two routines from his
old records. ``Some people show up for that and then it's just more
kind of observational about this world we live in and what a
strange place it is and how strange we are really. You know, stand
back and look at ourselves and see ourselves for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a round of psychotherapy with Bob _ sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the time Newhart spent on television sitcoms, stand-up
comedy is an art form he never really left. Even while taping ``The
Bob Newhart Show'' in the 1970s, he still toured the comedy
circuit. ``Looking back, I still don't know how I did it, but we
would do three weeks (on the sitcom) and then be off two weeks and
I'd go to Vegas and play two weeks there and come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The sitcom business offered plenty of chances to hone his
stand-up shtick as he concocted a warm-up routine each week for the
live audience that watched the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine ever not doing stand-up, as long as my health
holds up,'' he said. ``It's either the second greatest or the
greatest feeling in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And the greatest? It depends on the person, maybe ``the laugh of
a child?'' he says, breaking into a wry chuckle that hints at other
possible contenders.
</P>
<P>
   As Newhart talks on the telephone from his mansion in Bel Air,
Calif., it's hard not to picture him gesturing on the other end _
the raise of a paranoid eyebrow, darting eyes, rubbing his weary
forehead as he rambles forth on one of his one-man phone
conversations conjuring the persona of Abe Lincoln's PR Man or Sir
Walter Raleigh's sarcastic boss or a rookie security guard who must
call his boss to report that King Kong is climbing the building.
</P>
<P>
   Newhart still remembers the night in 1964 when he dreamed up the
Kong routine while eating dinner with his wife and Carol Burnette
and her husband at the Top of the Sixes in New York:
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we were seated, I was looking at the Empire State
Building, and then it just came out. ... I was thinking about two
things that had happened to me and converging them on this one
event. Like I had always undergone those job-orientation programs
and nothing that they told you would happen ever happened. And then
I thought what would it be like if the night King Kong climbs the
outside of the Empire State building was the first night for a new
guard and he's got to call his boss and say, `A situation has come
up.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After completing Army service in the 1950s, Newhart worked as an
accountant and copywriter in his hometown of Chicago. Polishing his
act by taping ridiculous phone conversations with a friend, he
worked through the kinks of hit-and-miss stand-up routines,
learning to fluctuate between his comic persona and his real life.
</P>
<P>
   Even now the distinction is thin: ``There's a very slight change
in my voice so that it's Bob Newhart the stand-up comic, not Bob
Newhart the person. It's a schizophrenic kind of existence.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding a tide of nightclub laughs in the late 1950s, Newhart was
discovered by a Chicago DJ who introduced him to the head of talent
at Warner Brothers Records.
</P>
<P>
   The budding comic immediately connected with college kids when
he released his first album, ``The Buttoned-Down Mind of Bob
Newhart,'' in 1959 _ the first comedy album to hit No. 1 on the
charts. He cut seven more albums, eventually capturing the record
for longest simultaneous No. 1 and 2 album rankings on the
Billboard charts _ a feat he held for 35 years until it was broken
by Guns-n-Roses.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Newhart appeared on television shows like ``The
Entertainers'' and ``The Hollywood Palace.'' He landed parts in the
films ``Hell is for Heroes'' and ``Catch-22'' before launching
``The Bob Newhart Show'' in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could go back to the fun it was,'' he says. ``I loved
the process of a sitcom, coming in Monday and the script wasn't
quite right, and then Tuesday maybe a rewrite, and make some
suggestions on Wednesday, and then Friday you're there in front of
a live audience and it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Newhart followed his debut show with an equally successful
eight-season run as Dick Loudon, the New York writer turned Norwich
innkeeper in ``Newhart.'' But by the early 1990s, his sitcom career
fizzled out with short-lived sitcoms like ``Bob'' and ``George and
Leo,'' in which he teamed up with Judd Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he can't imagine doing another sitcom. ``You never say
never, but it takes so much out of you when the last two haven't
worked. You put so much of yourself into it and then to go through
that again. It's very emotional. Tuesday morning was always _ how
were the overnights? We're down a 10th of a point, we're up a 10th
of a point. You go through a whole year of that and you're pretty
much worn out.''
</P>
<P>
   An avid ``channel surfer,'' the immutable Newhart says the
original sitcom format vanished years ago with the loss of live
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing I lament _ they should find a different name for
sitcoms today because a sitcom to me was `I Love Lucy' and `The
Mary Tyler Moore Show' and `The Honeymooners,' all those great
shows with a live audience. ... If you listen today, it's all laugh
track. It's not a sitcom. They're non-audience sitcoms. That's the
easy way. You just do it. There's no one there. No one's testing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Embarking on his latest project, Newhart is planning a
retrospective tour, showcasing highlights from the funniest moments
of ``The Bob Newhart Show'' and ``Newhart.'' It's a testament not
only to the endurance of his sitcoms, but to his dry, unsung sense
of humor that may have been overlooked by 1990s television
audiences, but continues to draw crowds to his stand-up
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, he taped ``Off the Record,'' a video recording
of his live comedy routine. ``If you look at the audience, they're
like 35 to 40 years old, and it works in exactly the same places it
did 30 years before. That's what I find to be interesting _ some of
them weren't even born when I first recorded some of that stuff.''

NEWS ANALYSIS: EUROPEAN CRISIS PAVES WAY FOR MORE ACCOUNTABILITY
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Long preoccupied with establishing a single
market, introducing a common currency, even talking bananas with
the United States, the European Union on Tuesday discovered that
its lack of attention to the theme of democracy could have
devastating consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Although the abrupt resignation early Tuesday of the entire
executive leadership of the 15-nation European Union was formally
linked to charges of fraud and gross mismanagement, it clearly
reflected a deeper malaise. As the size and power of a united
Europe has grown, the democratic accountability of its
Brussels-based leadership has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans have discovered that there is now real power in
Brussels, and they are saying they want more democratic controls,
more transparency, and more rigor,'' said Jean-Marie Guehenno, a
French diplomat and expert on European affairs. ``That is the true
significance of this collective resignation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Santer, the 61-year-old Luxembourger who is president of
the European Commission, and his 19 fellow commissioners, quit
after a 144-page report by an independent panel of experts found
that the Union's $100 billion annual budget was mismanaged and said
that it was ``becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the
slightest sense of responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   This amounted to an extraordinary accusation against the
officials responsible for upholding the treaties of the European
Union. But it reflected a growing perception that the
commissioners, who are appointed by national governments and
oversee a bureaucracy of 17,000 people, have enjoyed powers
inadequately balanced by democratic oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Their resignation ushered in what French President Jacques
Chirac called ``an unprecedented crisis.'' It comes at a time when
Europe's common currency, the euro, is still in its infancy;
decisive reform of the European budget is being discussed in
preparation for next week's meeting of European leaders in Berlin;
and trade frictions with the United States are intense.
</P>
<P>
   Tension and anger were apparent here on Tuesday in a city that
has often been derided for calling itself ``the capital of
Europe,'' but seemed vested at last with some of the cut and thrust
of big-power politics.
</P>
<P>
   Santer counterattacked vigorously, calling the experts' report
``distorted,'' vaunting his success in introducing the euro at the
beginning of this year, and saying the cases of fraud were old,
minor or unproven. He made it clear that he hopes to be reinstated
by national governments, along with other commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   But resorting to unusually blunt language, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder made
their contempt for Santer clear as they spelled out a conviction
that a turning-point for Europe has been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in London, where he met Tuesday with the German
Chancellor, Blair said the former Luxembourg prime minister should
pack his bags and make way for a ``real political heavyweight.''
Schroeder waved away Santer's aspirations by saying that the
identity of a replacement would be discussed in Berlin next week.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's call for a ``political heavyweight'' appeared
particularly significant. Just four years ago, when Santer was
appointed, Britain seemed intent on imposing a political
lightweight in Brussels because it saw such an appointment as one
guarantee against strong moves toward European federalism.
</P>
<P>
   But since then, Britain has moved somewhat closer to Europe,
albeit cautiously, and has been in the forefront of new calls for
the development of a European defense arm. At the same time, with
the introduction of the euro, the Union has gained a new stature
and momentum that even Britain has been obliged to recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The current crisis seems to lie in the disparity between this
development of the Union into a powerful entity with its own
supranational currency and the absence of any meaningful reform to
increase democratic controls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is the time to carp at the content of the
report,'' said Sir Leon Brittan of Britain, the commissioner
responsible for trade. ``What is needed now is comprehensive root
and branch reform of the Commission.''
</P>
<P>
   With vested interests strong, such reform would probably only be
possible with an extremely strong commission president. Among the
names being mentioned here were former German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, former Italian
Prime Minister Romano Prodi, and the Secretary General of NATO,
Javier Solana of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   But the job is normally fiercely contested among member states,
and it appeared unlikely that any decision could be taken before
the Berlin meeting, at the earliest. The terms of Santer and the
other commissioners were supposed to run until the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The report found commissioners hiring relatives, exercising
little control over budgets and, even, in the case of Edith Cresson
of France, the commissioner responsible for education and youth
programs, employing a home-town dentist and his son on large
salaries to do work for which they had no apparent qualification.
</P>
<P>
   In all, auditors have found close to $1 billion in European
spending for which there appears to have been no proper accounting.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cresson's apparent contempt for mounting evidence against
her in recent months did much to fuel a sense of European outrage,
beginning in a European Parliament that long appeared laughably
powerless but now appears to be finding its teeth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The European Union has no constitution, so it advances and
changes in reaction to crisis,'' said Jonathan Eyal, a London-based
foreign policy expert. ``This is such a crisis and it will insure
that future commissioners are not fading national politicians for
whom a place has to be found somewhere. It also marks the arrival
of the European Parliament as a real force for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many commissioners, like Ms. Cresson, or Neil Kinnock of
Britain, the former Labor Party leader, are major national figures
who have arrived at a point where they have little political future
in their own country. Like many of their predecessors, they have
come to Brussels to end their careers rather than build them.
</P>
<P>
   That now seems likely to change. So, too, will the importance of
June elections to the 626-member European Parliament, which was the
driving force behind the initial investigation after a Dutch
auditor first revealed the commission's long failure to tackle
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Commission must leave now and not in nine months time,''
the Parliament's president, Jose Maria Gil-Robles, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, it was clear Tuesday that resistance to change would be
strong. Indeed, a cultural clash between a rigorous and reformist
northern Europe and a southern Europe that has been a major
beneficiary of European grants and subsidies appeared evident.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian and Spanish governments said Tuesday that the
commission should be allowed to complete its term, and Portugal
also gave guarded support for this position. Yves Thibault de
Silguy of France, the commissioner responsible for the euro, said
the report had merely revealed ``a few malfunctions'' and should
not obscure the Commission's achievements.
</P>
<P>
   But Scandinavian countries, traditionally vigilant over the way
tax money is spent, said the resignations should open the way for
sweeping reform, a position shared by Britain and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst possible thing would be if the Commission was
reinstated,'' said Joachim Krauze, a German expert on European
affairs. ``For the first time, the commissioners have been shown
that they will be held responsible. They have to realize that
democratization is coming at a European level.''

JUDGE REFUSES TO BLOCK ENFORCEMENT OF PROP. 16 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NCAA received another legal setback Tuesday when a federal
judge denied a request to delay the enforcement of a court order
wiping out minimum standardized test scores as a requirement for
freshman eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   US District Judge Ronald Buckwalter, who had issued the initial
order last week, denied the NCAA's request for a delay in a ruling
that technically could affect NCAA teams now participating in
postseason hockey and basketball tournaments as well as those just
beginning their spring seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Buckwalter's ruling last week struck down Proposition 16, which
required freshman athletes to have a high school diploma and a
minimum grade point average in 13 core academic courses, with the
GPA contingent on an indexed, sliding scale with scores on either
the Scholastic Assessment Test or the American College Test.
</P>
<P>
   Students scoring lower than 820 on the SAT or 16 on the ACT,
regardless of their other academic credentials, were ineligible for
the first year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said using test scores to determine initial eligibility
was racially and culturally discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   Buckwalter's ruling, prompted by four black athletes who filed
suit against the NCAA, supported that contention.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA indicated it will appeal the decision, but the concern
is what happens now with teams that are still competing for
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Schools conceivably could use Prop. 16 athletes immediately if
they met the school's academic eligibility requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each school has its own standards,'' said Boston College
basketball coach Al Skinner Tuesday. ``Each school has its own
mission. What's happening is that (the NCAA is) trying to make
everyone the same. That's just not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the standards differ, some schools admit Prop. 16
students and some do not.
</P>
<P>
   Temple coach John Chaney, for example, has been a vocal critic
of Prop. 16. Would he now use a player who previously was declared
ineligible? A possible deterrent to such an action, though, is the
uncertainty of the appeal outcome. If the ruling were overturned,
schools using partial or non-qualifiers could be subject to
forfeiture of games and loss of revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Schools such as BC and Duke, who as a rule do not admit Prop. 16
athletes, would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy for the ruling,'' said Skinner, ``because we all
felt test scores were not true barometers. What I thought was
unfair was not the initial ineligibility, but the loss of a year's
eligibility.''

PRESSURE IS ON DAFOE _ ESPECIALLY ON THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He's the last line of defense, the man who on occasion
has to make up for the mistakes of his teammates. But when Bruins
goalie Byron Dafoe gets beaten, the result shows up on the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with his team in crunch time, vying for the eighth and
final playoff position in the Eastern Conference, and with the
Bruins in Toronto Wednesday to take on high-flying Mats Sundin,
Curtis Joseph, &AMP; Co. for the first time at the Air Canada Centre,
that pressure is magnified, especially on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, down the stretch the goals become more important
and the starts of the games become more important,'' said Dafoe
after Tuesday's practice at Ristuccia Arena. ``(Earlier in the
season) there were times when it would take us a period to get into
a game, but we don't have time for that now and so as a goaltender,
you just have to be prepared from the drop of the puck and play
each period as if it were the start of overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, called ``our team MVP who gives us a chance to win every
night,'' by captain Ray Bourque, sports a 2.16 goals against
average and .923 save percentage (fifth best in the NHL) to go
along with seven shutouts (second best in the league). His
counterpart in the Toronto net, Joseph, is the man who has carried
the 37-25-5 Leafs into fourth place overall in the Eastern
Conference, according to Bruins coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a confident team right now and Curtis Joseph is the
guy who's kept that club where they're at,'' said Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph didn't have to work very hard the last time the Bruins
played in Toronto, Jan. 9, their last stop at Maple Leaf Gardens,
when Toronto ran out to a big first-period lead and blasted the
Bruins, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were embarrassed,'' said Burns. ``I had to call a timeout
two minutes into the game, otherwise it would have been 10-0. We
didn't have Ray then, but now we have to go in and put that all
behind us and be confident.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins don't have to do anything flashy to erase the bad
memories of that shellacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have to be consistent,'' said Dafoe, ``just the like
the teams we're fighting with. It's pretty much us, the Rangers and
Florida, and we've got similar schedules. Every game is a must win
for us and for them. I'm not worried about our schedule. We can
beat any team in this league. We're trying not to look behind us,
but sometimes we have to.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say about our last game up here is that we weren't
ready and they were. They jumped right out at us, 4-0, in the first
15 minutes. Now it's a different story. We're playing for our
playoff lives right now. We don't care that it's a new building or
anything like that. We're looking for the 2 points. I don't care
where it is or who it's against.''
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, more than any other Bruin (except backup netminder Rob
Tallas), will have some quick learning to do at practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, the new rinks are all very similar as far as the
boards and how the bounces are, but you never know,'' said Dafoe.
``We'll take some time to do some wraparounds at practice. It
sounds like it's an unbelievable building. So it'll be kind of neat
to play there.''
</P>
<P>
   He knows that getting some pucks past Joseph will be a challenge
for his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll make the big save, and I think that's why they've done
so well this year,'' said Dafoe. ``He's allowed their offense to
take more chances because they expect him to make that big save on
a two-on-one or on a breakaway and he's done that all year for
them, and that's enabled their offense to explode.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe says his adrenaline will flow a bit more with a quality
goalie like Joseph at the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know it's going to be a tougher game against certain
goalies,'' he said, ``but Toronto has much more than him. We're
going against one of the best offenses in the league. You have to
be on your game from the get-go and you know you're going to be
facing more shots.''
</P>
<P>
   But, said defenseman Kyle McLaren, the Leafs will be facing a
pretty fair netminder as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron has played well all year and he's really stepped up his
game the last few weeks,'' said McLaren. ``If we can help carry him
going into the last couple of weeks and build off him and get our
offense on a roll again, I think we're going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins went through a spirited hourlong workout Tuesday at
the Wilmington practice arena before taking a 3 p.m. flight to
Toronto. Defenseman Don Sweeney was absent ``for personal
business'' according to Burns, but will play . . . The coach looks
at Boston's strong points as its power play, penalty killing (best
in the NHL), and goaltending, ``but we've got to get better
five-on-five,'' said Burns, whose team will have two days off after
the Toronot game before playing Saturday at home against San Jose .
. . The Bruins will have their eye on Sundin, Toronto's leading
scorer (24-44_68), said McLaren. ``They're a good team all around,
but Sundin's their main guy,'' he said, ``and if we can shut him
down and limit his opportunities, we'll have a good chance of
winning the game.'' . . . Winger Anson Carter on the last 16 games
of the season: ``Whether you win or lose, you have to put it behind
you and focus on the next game. Our veterans and our coaching will
be important. There's definitely a calming effect there, but I'm
also pretty excited. I like this time of year. This is the fun part
of hockey when all the games mean something.'' . . . Bourque said
the Bruins are as healthy as they've been all season, ``which
should help us bring our best game out there every night.''

ARIZONA, TEXAS SENATORS DECRY CLINTON PROPOSAL NOT TO ADD MORE
BORDER AGENTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Immigration and Naturalization Service chief Doris
Meissner said Tuesday that the Clinton administration will add no
new Border Patrol agents next fiscal year, incurring the wrath of
Texas and Arizona senators who said more are needed to stem the
flow of illegal immigrants and drugs through their states.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee, Meissner
said President Clinton believes the current force of nearly 9,000
Border Patrol agents is adequate. She defended Clinton's proposal
by saying the Border Patrol would be strengthened not by more
agents but by Congress approving the president's proposed $50
million in enhancements, including high-tech cameras and tracking
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner's call for no additional patrol officers in fiscal year
2000, which begins Oct. 1, follows her announcement last month that
INS plans to hire 1,000 new agents by Sept. 30. Texas will receive
500 of the new patrol agents, bringing to 3,933 the number of
officers on the state's border with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has decided to take a breather for a
year,'' Meissner said in explaining the year-to-year shift in her
agency's hiring of patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and Sen. Jon Kyl,
R-Ariz., mocked Meissner's explanation and said 9,000 agents are
insufficient to thwart immigrants and drug couriers determined to
enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, a subcommittee member, said Meissner's testimony
reminded her of 1997, when the INS chief also told the subcommittee
that the administration needed a breather. At that time, the
president proposed budgeting only 500 agents after Congress had
authorized 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The border in Texas was a sieve,'' Hutchison said in
explaining her opposition to the president's request then. Clinton
increased his request to 1,000 agents, but only under heavy
congressional opposition, the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison also disputed Meissner's view of INS technology,
saying that state-of-the-art cameras and tracking devices are no
substitute for having agents ready to respond when the technology
detects illegal immigrants. ``The chances of (agents) actually
getting there in time is not terrific,'' the senator said. She
urged Meissner to add more Border Patrol officers next year.
</P>
<P>
   Kyl, noting the non-stop flow of illegal immigrants coming
through Arizona, protested the president's refusal to endorse
additional agents. ``Nobody else at the border is taking a
breather,'' said the senator, who is not a subcommittee member but
attended the panel's hearing and questioned Meissner.
</P>
<P>
   The INS chief responded that Clinton's decision should be
interpreted not as an easing of border enforcement but rather as an
opportunity for the agency to improve the talents of its agents.
Nearly 48 percent of Border Patrol officers have fewer than three
years of experience, Meissner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a year of consolidation, INS will be able to ensure that
we maintain our current authorized strength, while continuing to
safeguard the highest standards of law enforcement professionalism
for this new workforce by building their experience and
effectiveness,'' Meissner told the Subcommittee on Commerce,
Justice, State and the Judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, Meissner's superior at the Justice
Department, gave the subcommittee a similar message during her
appearance before the panel last week.
</P>
<P>
   But Meissner, under questioning from Kyl, conceded that she had
urged the president to approve 1,000 new Border Patrol agents for
fiscal year 2000, but the White House balked. That admission drew
sympathy from Hutchison, who called Meissner ``a good soldier'' by
taking fire for Clinton's decision to seek no new agents.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner testified before the subcommittee in defense of the
president's proposed $4.27 billion budget for INS in fiscal 2000.
That funding would represent an 8 percent increase from the
agency's $3.9 billion budget for fiscal year 1999, which ends Sept.
30.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed budget includes $50 million to fund the Border
Patrol, $20 million to support enforcement of immigration laws
within the United States, $16.8 million to transport illegal
immigrants and $6 million to staff 87 positions at three new land
border ports of entry in Texas: Eagle Pass, Los Tomates and Laredo.

CELTICS LOOK TO POTAPENKO'S BLOCKING ABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The newest member of the Celtics went through a 2
1/2-hour practice and film session Tuesday. Then came the hardest
part: meeting a sizable press corps that had coach Rick Pitino
wondering whether the playoffs had started.
</P>
<P>
   Before acquiring Vitaly Potapenko last week, the Celtics' two
biggest interior weaknesses were rebounding and shot-blocking. Now
that they have Potapenko, their two biggest interior weaknesses are
rebounding and shot-blocking. He's not known for either, but he is
a wide body who won't be moved around like a coat rack, which is
something the Celtics have lacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very strong man,'' Pitino said. ``He also keeps his man
off the glass. This is one of our best acquisitions for the needs
of this basketball team.''
</P>
<P>
   Added general manager Chris Wallace, ``Yeah, we need to have
stronger rebounding and we need some shot-blocking, but this was
the best alternative that we could see on the horizon in terms of a
big body.''
</P>
<P>
   Potapenko turns 24 Sunday. He has been in the United States only
a little more than four years, the last four in Ohio and the last
two in Cleveland. (He still hasn't been to the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame, but we won't hold that against him.) He grew up in Kiev
first as a volleyball player _ his sister still plays the sport _
and turned to basketball when his expanding size made that move a
wise decision.
</P>
<P>
   He is 6 feet 10 inches, weighs 273, and is Bunyanesque in
strength. Asked how much he bench-pressed, he grinned and said, ``A
lot.'' His father, Nikolay, is a 6-3 construction manager back in
Kiev and his mom, Anna, is a housewife. She's 5-7. He said his
paternal grandfather is 6-7 and there are some big aunts and uncles
as well. His sister is 5-11. He sees his parents at least once a
year, but added, ``I'm too busy to get homesick.'' He's single and
the possessor of a new, six-year, $30-something million contract,
but doesn't sound like the kind of guy who'll appear in the gossip
columns.
</P>
<P>
   He played for the Soviet Union's national junior team and for a
club team in Kiev while he attended Kiev State. (Honest.) A Wright
State bird dog got him to come to the Dayton school and he spent
two years there, working on his game _ he was all-conference both
years _ and his English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picked most of it up at college,'' Potapenko said Tuesday at
the Celtics' practice facility at Brandeis University, of his
English, which is pretty good. ``I had a lot of tutoring lessons. I
had no other choice. No one spoke Russian there. So it made me
learn English faster.''
</P>
<P>
   He exploded on the NBA scene during the predraft camp in Chicago
in 1996. No one could match his strength and he showed a decent
offensive game around the post. Before the camp, he was seen as a
second-round pick. Agent David Falk then got him a trainer, and it
paid off: He ended up going 12th to the Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   He's aware of the Celtics' history and tradition, mentioning
Bill Russell and Bob Cousy as great players along with the Big
Three, whom he watched on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch them a lot,'' he said. ``I'm proud to play for
this team. Very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for a glass-eater against the Clippers, when ``V,''
as the Celtics call him, makes his first FleetCenter start as a
Celtic. He averaged only 3.3 rebounds a game in his first two
years; it's up a bit this year, mainly because of the increased
playing time he got after Zydrunas Ilgauskas's season-ending
injury. Over that same span, he blocked 62 shots in 160 games.
</P>
<P>
   But regardless what he does, you can't miss him. That's why he's
here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Andrew DeClercq, the Celtics also gave up a No. 1
pick to get Potapenko, and Wallace explained how the deal works.
Boston has protection for the first three picks this year; the Cavs
must notify them of their intention 10 days before the draft. If
Cleveland passes this year, the pick is not protected in 2000. The
Cavs also can pass on that one, but they then have to take the
Celtics' 2001 pick . . . Former Celtics assistant Don Casey coached
his first game Tuesday as John Calipari's replacement in New
Jersey. He had no assistants; they all were fired along with Cal.
Casey has hired former NBA coaches Jimmy Lynam and Eddie Jordan as
assistants, but they won't join the team until Wednesday. Tuesday
Casey had scout Hal Wissel and former player/radio man Mike O'Koren
help him on the bench . . . Pitino on the Clippers: ``This team is
10 deep and as talented as anyone we can play. You look at teams at
how they are playing now. This team can beat you. They had Seattle
beaten and Portland beaten and they did beat Sacramento.'' . . .
Pitino said Paul Pierce re-sprained his right ankle Tuesday but was
OK. ``He's still not there physically, but he's 100 percent
mentally,'' the coach said. Pitino also preened a bit over
Kentucky's win over Kansas last weekend. He won a bet with Pierce
and the rook will have to wear a Kentucky shirt at Wednesday's
shootaround. ``I pointed out a graphic during the game that noted
Kansas had played Kentucky 21 times and it was 18-3 (for
Kentucky),'' said Pitino. ``I took advantage of his lack of
experience.''

SHARON SAYS `NEVER' TO CONCESSIONS ON JERUSALEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Renewing a battle for control of this city that is
as ancient as the city itself, Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel
Sharon Tuesday declared Jerusalem ``forever the capital of the
Jewish people and the state of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   With his words, the hawkish former general moved a thorny issue
into the forefront of the faltering Israeli-Palestinian peace
process and Israel's upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel will never make any concessions on Jerusalem _ never,''
thundered Sharon at the King David Hotel after meeting with a group
of foreign ambassadors. He was responding to what the Israeli
government took as a diplomatic slap in the face by the European
Union, against the backdrop of an ongoing debate over the position
of the United States, which officially does not recognize Israel's
sovereignty over the city.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the European Union, insisting that Jerusalem is
officially separate from Israel, rejected a request to halt
meetings with Palestinians in historically Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 United Nations Resolution 181 called for international
control of Jerusalem, which is holy to Judaism, Islam, and
Christianity. But Sharon Tuesday pronounced the resolution ``null
and void,'' noting that Arab states rejected that resolution more
than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, most of the world's nations do not recognize Israeli
sovereignty over Jerusalem, saying the city's status is unresolved.
Technically, this includes the United States, said US Embassy
spokesmen Larry Schwartz. That is why the US Embassy to this day is
in Tel Aviv, not Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US believes the ultimate status of Jerusalem will be
resolved in permanent status negotiations. It was the Israelis and
Palestinians who agreed to this, and we have to respect that,''
Schwartz said.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwartz added that the official US policy is in flux. In
1995, both chambers of Congress overwhelmingly passed the
``Jerusalem Embassy Act,'' which mandates construction of a new
embassy in Jerusalem _ with a deadline of mid-May. With that
deadline looming and no plans in sight for a ground-breaking,
Schwartz said President Clinton is expected to request a waiver, on
the grounds that that the United States should do nothing that
could undermine the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Under the historic 1993 Camp David peace accord, the Israelis
and Palestinians agreed that the future of Jerusalem would be
decided in ``final status'' talks, which have yet to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Israel sees Jerusalem as its eternal and indivisible capital.
The Israelis captured the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including
the Old City, from Jordan during the 1967 Six Day War. Israel
annexed Jerusalem shortly afterward, and the image of Jewish
paratroopers at the Western Wall is seen by many Jews as a miracle
that returned the Old City to Jewish rule after a 2,000-year
diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, however, see East Jerusalem as illegally
occupied territory and the capital of their own future state.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian legislator Hanan Ashrawi said Sharon's comments make
it clear the Israelis have no intention of negotiating the future
of Jerusalem as they agreed to in the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
   She called Sharon's rejection of UN Resolution 181 ``outrageous
and illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   German ambassador Theodor Wallau, whose country holds the
rotating presidency of the European Union, said after meeting with
Sharon that the status of Jerusalem ``is obviously a very sensitive
issue. . . . The EU has no interest to preempt the outcome of these
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharon, who fought for control of Jerusalem in the Israeli-Arab
wars of 1948 and 1967, said, ``It's very hard to imagine that after
all those years we again have to struggle for Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   In what some analysts said was an indication that Sharon's
statements were geared toward Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
reelection campaign, Sharon added that, ``If it is our government,
led by Mr. Netanyahu, the negotiations over Jerusalem will be very
short. There will never be any negotiation on Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   The other candidates in the race, especially the more liberal
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, have taken similarly hard lines.
</P>
<P>
   A joint Israeli-Palestinian public opinon poll published Tuesday
found 91 percent of Palestinians would reject any final agreement
in which Jerusalem becomes the undivided capital of Israel, while
70 percent of Israelis said they would oppose any accord declaring
East Jerusalem capital of a future Palestinian state.

IRISH OFFICIALS VIE TO BASK IN WASHINGTON'S EMERALD GLOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Once, it was just the Ambassador of Ireland in a
small White House ceremony. Then, in the years that followed the
Irish Prime Minister joined in. And then, some time around 1994,
March 17 began exploding into a weeklong party across Washington,
with dozens of officials from the Emerald Isle flying in to
celebrate their national holiday in another nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Has President Bill Clinton co-opted St. Patrick's Day?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, according to some congressional members and officials from
several embassies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year, the celebration in Washington keeps getting bigger,
and the circle of dignitaries keeps getting wider, particularly
from Northern Ireland,'' agreed Adrian O'Neill, spokesman for the
Embassy of Ireland. ``President Clinton has _ given the fact that
Ireland is such a cornerstone of his foreign policy _ built up the
event. The White House started this tradition on his watch. People
back in Ireland now feel this is the place to be on St. Patrick's
Day.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Irish generally honor St. Patrick's Day with
less hoopla and green beer than Irish-Americans. There, it is a
religious holiday, and a sober one at that.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, even as a younger generation of Irish has
begun to revel in the holiday a little more, the celebration in
Washington has evolved into a mandatory event for anyone seeking
political advantage back in Ireland, according to both American and
Irish officials. A photo op with Clinton can earn far more
political capital than any visit to a local pub.
</P>
<P>
   And after last year _ when the annual St. Patrick's Day event in
Washington immediately preceded the Good Friday peace accords _ the
significance of the Capitol trip became even greater. Officials are
openly hoping this year's festivities will offer neutral ground to
sparring Irish factions, which have deadlocked over how to proceed
toward an independent government, and which two days ago were
shaken by a deadly car bomb in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides a good focus for people,'' said Peter Reid, an
official at the British Embassy. ``They're all brought together in
a different environment...and it can lead to a big change in their
willingness to mix with people.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the top brass are all here: Irish Prime Minister
Bertie Ahearn, Northern Ireland Secretary of State Mo Mowlam, First
Minister David Trimble of the Ulster Unionist Party, John Hume of
the Social Democratic Labor Party and Gerry Adams of Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
   And they are joined not just by a corps of deputies and
assistants but by dozens of competing political factions and
non-governmental organizations, including women's groups and local
mayors, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list is endless,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   So are the parties. More than seven separate official St.
Patrick's Day events are occurring within a 12-hour stretch
Wednesday, following a huge gala Tuesday night by the American
Ireland Fund honoring Senator Edward M. Kennedy. The central event
takes place at the White House Wednesday evening, where Irish Prime
Minister Bertie Ahearn will be honored in front of some 950 guests
_ at least 200 more than last year, and approximately one-third of
them straight from Ireland, according to O'Neill
</P>
<P>
   The White House, frustrated by so many guests, asked Irish
officials to reduce the list a couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it keeps on kind of growing,'' O'Neill said.

over how to increase U.S. trade with Africa, President Clinton
invoked the words of Abraham Lincoln Tuesday in calling on
lawmakers to rally around the White House approach.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot afford a house divided,'' Clinton admonished,
paraphrasing the powerful, Biblically-based rhetoric Lincoln used
to describe an American nation split by pro-slave and anti-slave
factions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Africa,'' said Clinton, ''needs action now.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks during a 20-minute speech to delegates
attending the first-ever U.S.-Africa Ministerial. The meeting at
the State Department this week groups U.S. cabinet-level officials
with nearly 200 of their counterparts from 46 sub-Saharan African
states.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also called for the cancellation of some $70 billion in
long-term debt owed to wealthy nations like the United States by
developing countries, like those in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is seeking $237 million in African debt relief next
year, on top of the $245 million in such relief already contained
in this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message I want your leaders to take home is this is a
partnership with substance backed by a long-term commitment,''
Clinton said. ''This is truly a relationship for the long haul.''
</P>
<P>
   High on the agenda is the goal of trying to link the
impoverished but resource-rich continent with the promise of the
global marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago next week, Clinton made an 11-day swing through
Africa, vowing to lift trade restrictions as a way to help promote
U.S.-Africa trade.
</P>
<P>
   The legislative vehicle for those changes, the so-called Africa
Growth and Opportunity Act, has stalled on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The Act passed the House last February, 233-186, but then
languished in the Senate Finance Committee amid political haggling
over whether to attach additional free-trade legislation to the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's back before the House Ways &AMP; Means Committee, awaiting
a recommendation for a second vote by the new House elected last
November.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is controversial not because of race, but because it
touches on one of the most sensitive political issues of the era:
trade.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, many black members of Congress in an awkward position.
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., want, in theory, to support
increased trade with Africa, but are reluctant to go along with
certain provisions of the growth and opportunity act because, like
any trade-expanding legislation, it's seen as threatening to some
of their traditional constituents in organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., hail from southern
states where parts of the bill are opposed by influential textile
companies, which fear the bill could result in painful new
competition from low-cost African rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis and Clyburn, both of whom are black, favor an alternative
bill put forth last month by Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D-Ill., the
son of the civil rights activist, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who is
the special White House envoy for democratization in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the Jackson bill, called the Human Rights,
Opportunity, Partnership and Empowerment for Africa Act, or HOPE
for Africa Act, would treat textile imports differently from the
White House plan. It would also cancel the debt owed to the United
States by sub-Saharan African countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support for our bill is growing every day,'' said younger
Jackson's press spokesman, Frank Watkins, who said that, just three
weeks after its introduction, the bill already has 56 co-sponsors
-- backers willing to put their name on the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, White House aides grumble that Jackson's bill is
dividing the support for Africa trade liberalization, helping, in
effect, opponents of increased trade with Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're empowering our opponents, who don't want to do
anything for Africa anyway,'' asserted one administration official,
speaking on background. ''It's infuriating the Africans and just
causing unnecessary divisions in the African-American community.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's office responded, however, that his legislation is
picking up steam not because it's breeding divisiveness, but
because it addresses serious flaws in the administration's
approach.
</P>
<P>
   And, said Watkins, if the White House backed legislation,
sponsored in the House by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., and 74
others, Republicans and Democrats, is defeated, that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is better to do nothing,'' said Watkins, ''than to pass
(the African Growth and Opportunity Act).''

CLINTON TO UNVEIL OWN MEDICARE PLAN AS PANEL FAILS TO AGREE ON
PROPOSAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton promised Tuesday to craft his own
plan this year to keep Medicare solvent as a bipartisan
congressional commission charged with overhauling the elderly's
government health insurance program broke up without reaching
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although Clinton praised the panel headed by Sen. John Breaux,
D-La., and Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., for making a ``valuable''
contribution to the debate, he said he could not support its plan
to save Medicare by increasing competition among providers.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was endorsed by 10 of the panel's 17 members but did
not secure enough votes to be passed out of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would soon offer his own Medicare reform plan
that would include coverage for prescription drugs and use up to 15
percent of projected budget surpluses during the next 10 to 15
years to help keep the program afloat beyond 2009, when it is
expected to run out of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it clear that I believe we owe it to the
American people to make an agreement this year,'' he said. ``And
I'm going to do my dead level best to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton said the commission's work had produced some
``very strong elements'' that ought to be seriously considered as
part of a final Medicare package, he objected to a provision that
would raise the eligible age from 65 to 67.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the plan has the ``potential to increase premiums''
beyond normal inflation rates for seniors on fixed incomes and does
not provide for ``an adequate, affordable prescription drug
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But most important of all, it fails to make a solid commitment
of 15 percent of the surplus to the Medicare trust fund,'' Clinton
said. ``Even if all the changes recommended by the commission were
adopted, because of the projected inflation rates and health care
costs, it would not be sufficient to stabilize the fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders were quick to criticize the
president for not supporting the commission's work more fully. But
they gave little support of their own because of competing
GOP-sponsored proposals that are likely to be offered in Congress
over the next few months.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also expressed little interest in trying to
address Medicare problems until Congress acts to preserve the the
Social Security program.
</P>
<P>
   For example, House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said it
was a ``crying shame'' that the commission adjourned after failing
by one vote to recommend a reform plan to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged to reporters that few of the panel's
proposals would have been included in the 2000 budget Congress is
working on now because of the GOP's priority to shore up Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first job is to save every dollar of the payroll taxes for
Social Security ... and then give ourselves the time that it would
take to work out the legislative details of a (Medicare)
solution,'' Armey said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said it would have been ``nice'' to have the panel's
recommendation as a ``departure point'' for consideration as
Congress begins to look at other proposals, including the
president's and one Texas Sen. Phil Gramm hopes to unveil. Gramm
said his proposal will include additional assistance for
prescription drugs and will save $100 billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 17-member commission fell short of the 11 votes
needed to recommend its reform plan, Breaux and Thomas said they
would likely act on their own to introduce it in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got is very important,'' Breaux said, predicting
that the commission plan could get 60 votes in the Senate. ``We've
changed the debate in a major, major way.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the commission plan, retirees would have been able to
choose from a list of coverage policies at different price ranges,
just like private health insurance companies offer. Drug coverage
plans would have been offered as well, but at additional costs.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux and Thomas insisted that raising the eligible age would
have helped keep Medicare solvent through at least 2017.

FORBES, HAT IN RING, TAKES ANTI-TAX PLEDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ After launching his presidential campaign on the
Internet Tuesday, Steve Forbes became the first candidate to sign
the state's famous anti-tax pledge, promising not to raise taxes
for individuals or businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But as he stood with his back to the state capitol and touted
his proposal to eliminate the current federal tax code and
institute a 17 percent flat tax, protesters from Boston began
chanting ``billionaires for Forbes'' and waving banners that said
``Tax cuts for me, not my maid,'' and ``Because inequality isn't
growing fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Forbes ripped some of the posters out of the
demonstrators' hands and tried to hustle them away from the
television cameras. The candidate himself dryly acknowledged
``those who are skeptical'' by saying they needed remedial
education.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of taxes has always inspired great passion in New
Hampshire, where there is no income tax and no sales tax. Most
state and local politicians here have felt compelled to sign the
well-known pledge, popularized by the late publisher of the
Manchester Union-Leader, William Loeb. Tuesday, Forbes said he
hoped all candidates for elective office would follow his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be pressure, always be excuses, for imposing
more burdens on the people of New Hampshire,'' he said. ``In
Washington, they always have excuses on why they must impose more
burdens on all of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Collins, co-director of United for a Fair Economy, an
economic research group in Boston, said he and his protesters are
concerned that Forbes' proposals would lead to greater economic
disparities in the nation. Collins said the protest would be
repeated when Forbes arrives in Iowa later this week, and in other
cities around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' second run for the Republican nomination will be just as
heavily focused on taxes as the first. But as he continues to push
for a 17 percent flat federal income tax, the Granite State's
typical resolve against taxes is no longer quite so solid.
</P>
<P>
   An income tax bill was recently approved in the House with the
support of many Republicans representing poor school districts in
need of state dollars. The Senate could pass the measure, too, but
Governor Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, has promised to veto it.
</P>
<P>
   The issue seems to have galvanized Forbes, who plans to
demonstrate his disdain for taxes come April 15, when tax returns
are due. His campaign will stage a reenactment of the famous
``Stamp tax revolt of 1765'' in Portsmouth, replete with fife and
drums, as well as a casket in which to bury the federal tax code,
which Forbes calls ``corruptingly complex.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Forbes placed fourth in New Hampshire, behind Patrick
J. Buchanan, Bob Dole and Lamar Alexander. His television ads,
however, nearly sank Dole's campaign here, and he drew great
interest for his conservative, economic themes.
</P>
<P>
   The multi-millionaire publisher has tried to broaden his appeal
during the last three years, also focusing on social issues, such
as a strong anti-abortion stance. And in this first-in-the-nation
primary state, he has courted activists and put together a seasoned
group of political strategists.

WORK OF CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYERS CHILLED IN WAKE OF BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ Sitting in his Andersonstown law office Tuesday, Barra
McGrory was a jumble of emotions.
</P>
<P>
   He mourned his colleague, Rosemary Nelson, killed the day before
by a bomb planted by Protestant extremists. He admired her dogged
advocacy for human rights, and it sickened him to think what her
husband and three children were going through.
</P>
<P>
   And he couldn't help but wonder if he was next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think every lawyer who's been involved in human and civil
rights work here feels the same way,'' said McGrory, one of the
leading defense lawyers in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, 40, an outspoken advocate for Irish Catholic
nationalists who claim unequal treatment at the hands of Northern
Ireland's police, was killed Monday when a sophisticated bomb
planted under her car exploded. A loyalist paramilitary group
opposed to the Northern Ireland peace process claimed
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's murder cast a pall over St. Patrick's Day festivities
here and in Washington, where Northern Ireland's political leaders
have gathered for a White House party Wednesday with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   It also sent a chill through the legal community here, and it
revived unanswered questions about the unsolved murder of the only
other lawyer in Northern Ireland to have been killed because he
represented combatants in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, loyalist assassins broke into the home of Belfast
lawyer Patrick Finucane and shot him to death as he ate dinner with
his wife and children. Finucane had regularly defended Irish
Republican Army members.
</P>
<P>
   Finucane's murder came just days after a British cabinet
minister suggested that some lawyers were unduly sympathetic to IRA
members they defended. While the minister didn't single out
Finucane, his work as the busiest defense lawyer in Belfast made
him a target, colleagues say. Afterward, allegations surfaced that
some detectives had encouraged loyalists to kill him.
</P>
<P>
   The probe into Finucane's murder ended inconclusively, with no
charges, and in recent years Nelson had been an outspoken advocate
for a new investigation. She replaced him as the most high-profile
defender of Irish republicans who support the IRA and Irish
nationalists in general, including those in the town of Portadown
who have sought to block Protestant bands from parading through
their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   That made her an enemy of the police. Nelson had charged that
police officers routinely harassed her, beat her and threatened to
kill her. Her complaints were the basis of a United Nations report
last year that criticized police and called for a new investigation
into Finucane's murder. Her complaints are also the subject of a
report by a civilian commission scheduled for release Friday.
Sources familiar with its contents say the report is highly
critical of the police.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, are claiming
that Nelson's murderers were assisted by police. Graffitti have
sprung up making the same allegation. Sinn Fein wants the Royal
Ulster Constabulary to be disbanded, saying the force, which is 93
percent Protestant, is irremediably biased toward unionists who
want to remain part of Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Those making the allegations, such as Sinn Fein councilor John
Dowd, have no hard evidence, but they pointed to circumstantial
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   First, they pointed to motive. Among Northern Ireland's
attorneys, none was more vociferous in criticizing the police than
Nelson. She had also embarrassed them, winning acquittals for IRA
suspects who were charged on flimsy evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Dowd and others point to the sophistication of the bomb.
The group that claimed responsibility, the Red Hand Defenders, has
never displayed the capability of using a so-called ``tilt'' device
that detonates the bomb when a car slows down. Sinn Fein leaders
and others argue that the sophistication of the bomb shows that
either it was prepared by members of the larger loyalist groups
that claim to be honoring a cease-fire, or the killers had help
from rogue British agents who don't want the peace process to work.
</P>
<P>
   McGrory and most other lawyers aren't making allegations they
can't substantiate. But many believe the police are incapable of
carrying out an impartial investigation, so deep was the mistrust
between Nelson and the police.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Ronnie Flanagan, chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary,
recognized the perception problem within hours of the murder. In an
unprecedented move, he asked that the investigation be controlled
by an outside law enforcement agency. Tuesday, David Phillips,
chief constable of the police in Kent, England, was appointed to
lead the probe. Flanagan also asked the American FBI to provide
forensics assistence.
</P>
<P>
   Flanagan said his move was ``no reflection'' on the integrity of
his officers. ``It's a reflection on the sensitivity I must show,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGrory was heartened by Flanagan's move, saying it ``shows how
far advanced the peace process is.''
</P>
<P>
   Already stalled by a dispute over the IRA's refusal to turn in
weapons and the unionists' refusal to form a local government until
the IRA begins disarming, the peace process was not helped by
Nelson's murder. Hardliners, including Duffy, who is free today
only because of Nelson's legal acumen, will be even more reluctant
to disarm, saying they need weapons to protect their neighborhoods
from loyalists like those who killed Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   For lawyers who challenge the system and the police, these are
scary days. McGrory was on the phone Tuesday to other lawyers. They
grieved for Nelson and her family, including her 8-year-old
daughter Sarah, who was at a nearby school and heard the explosion
that killed her mother.
</P>
<P>
   But Barra McGrory said they also compared notes about the
danger, about precautions. For McGrory, it was an unsettling case
of deja vu. Ten years ago, he remembers, his father, Paddy McGrory,
was the dean of the local defense bar. Although he was a man very
much against violence, he took to carrying a gun for protection in
the wake of Pat Finucane's murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pat Finucane was murdered, a lot of lawyers comforted
themselves in that it was a one-off, that the revulsion that
followed made the targeting of lawyers off limits,'' Barra McGrory
said. ``But Rosemary's murder changes everything. People are
frightened. They don't know where this is going. This is an attack
at the very heart of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrory says it would be fitting if Nelson's murder led to a new
investigation into Finucane's killing. In the meantime, while he
doesn't consider himself brave, McGrory has no intention of giving
up his work. He will continue taking cases that anger the
authorities, using the law instead of violence as an instrument of
change.
</P>
<P>
   It's what his father would have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what Rosemary would do,'' he said.

WHO IS KILLING THE WOMEN OF JUAREZ?
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by JUAREZ-FACTORY) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ Only two years before, Sagrario Gonzalez
and her family came north with great hope, fleeing the desperate
poverty of the Mexican interior for the deceptive promise of huge
foreign factories hiring near the border.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Joads of John Steinbeck, the Gonzalez family found
only heartbreak in the promised land. The teen-age girl, her
father, and an older sister immediately found jobs at the same
Juarez factory, a maquiladora, making electric components for
General Electric. But the assembly line paid only $3 a day, not
nearly enough to secure decent housing for the family of nine.
Their dwelling became instead a four-room shack without heat or
running water in one of the hemisphere's worst slums, the lights of
bountiful El Paso teasing them from the other side of the Rio
Grande.
</P>
<P>
   Then, almost a year ago, on April 16, Sagrario never came home
from her day shift. She was last seen downtown, changing buses with
an army of other factory workers, many of them teen-age girls like
herself who were new to the city, walking alone amid the drug
pushers and prostitutes down Juarez's most dangerous avenues. Two
weeks later, ranch workers found Sagrario's body, lying in a field
east of Juarez, still wearing her burgundy maquiladora smock. The
17-year-old had been raped and strangled and stabbed five times.
</P>
<P>
   By then, it was a common fate _ scores of other girls and young
women had been snatched away into the desert in the past six years,
raped, tortured and killed. Their bodies had been dumped amid the
cactus, their bones picked clean by the coyotes, and bleached white
by the sun. Almost all the victims were poor. Maquiladora smocks
often turned up with their remains.
</P>
<P>
   And the scourge continues. Every few weeks, a new body turns up,
another dream of a better life transformed into the ultimate
nightmare. In the tar-paper dwellings of the Juarez slums, votive
candles still flicker at the feet of Our Lady of Guadalupe, patron
saint of the nation's poor. But in the Gonzalez home, that age-old
devotion is overshadowed by the spectral presence of Sagrario, the
pretty brown-haired girl whose portrait hangs from almost every
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Her family clings to their faith in the Virgin, they say, but
only with great effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' says Sagrario's older sister, Guillermina, ``it's
hard not to ask the Virgin, `Why?' ''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Few things convene American journalists like the prospect of a
serial killer, and as such crime sprees go, the numbers from Juarez
are staggering. Since 1993, Mexican authorities say, 174 Juarez
women have been slain, many of them by husbands or boyfriends,
pimps or drug dealers. But police categorize about a third of the
killings as sexual homicides, crimes typically committed at random,
therefore making leads scarce, the type of deeds attributed to the
Theodore Bundys of the criminal universe. The Juarez victims range
in age from pre-teens to late 20s. Many other girls and young women
are missing.
</P>
<P>
   Police hoped the spree would end in 1995 with the arrest of
Sharif Sharif, an Egyptian chemist living in one of the city's
wealthiest neighborhoods who has a history of sexual violence in
the United States. A year later, investigators hauled in seven
members of a Juarez street gang allegedly hired by Sharif to commit
more killings, part of a plan to deflect suspicion from him, police
maintain. Last week, a Mexican judge sentenced Sharif to 30 years
in prison for the rape and strangulation of a 17-year-old Juarez
girl. A similar verdict is expected soon against members of the
gang called The Rebels. Investigators believe Sharif and The Rebels
are responsible for as many as 17 slayings.
</P>
<P>
   But the carnage has continued since their arrests. More women
were killed in 1998 than during any other year since 1993. This
year, in early February, the body of an unidentified young woman
who had been raped and strangled was found dumped in a soccer field
on the edge of town. One morning late last month, 13-year-old Irma
Angelica Rosalez Lovano was fired from her job in a maquiladora,
then set out alone for her home in a colonia shack. Her body was
discovered six hours later near a drainage ditch, her pants pulled
to her knees, a plastic bag over her head.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now concede that one or more serial killers might
still be at work. Four criminal profilers from the FBI have arrived
from Quantico, Va., to offer assistance. Grieving relatives and
women's groups continue to meet one day every month to comb the
desert for additional victims. Pressure to solve the crimes from
the media and a growing feminist movement remains intense.
</P>
<P>
   Juarez thus continues to be a popular destination for the
American press. Reporters from The New York Times have come twice
in the past year, joining journalists from Chicago, Los Angeles and
Houston, the Cable News Network and ABC's ``20/20,'' among others.
An apocalyptic profile emerges from their stories, one that seems
to confirm sinister notions of many Americans toward Mexican border
towns: of societies out of control, havens of corrupt police,
street gangs, warring drug cartels, child prostitutes, and now,
serial killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the devil is scared of living here,'' a Juarez fruit
vendor is quoted as saying in a 1996 Harper's magazine article.

COMMENTARY: PROTESTING POLICE BEHAVIOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On Monday morning I asked former Mayor David Dinkins
if he was going downtown just to demonstrate, or to commit an act
of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The latter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you plan to get arrested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the idea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, bundled up against the cold and a
strong wind blowing through the courthouse complex in lower
Manhattan, Dinkins joined Reps. Charles Rangel and Gregory Meeks, a
couple of City Council members, the Rev. Al Sharpton and others to
protest the killing of Amadou Diallo and a pattern of police
misbehavior that has angered and frightened many New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   They gathered outside the Supreme Court Building. Buffeted by
the wind and standing in inch-deep slush, they spoke quietly to
reporters about their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Dinkins said he believed that under Rudolph Giuliani the Police
Department had come ``dangerously close to adopting the philosophy
that the ends justify the means.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited as an example the tens of thousands of people, most of
them black or Hispanic, who are stopped and searched illegally by
police officers. He said: ``If the police roust 10 people and find
something on one of them, they think that justifies abusing the
rights of the other nine. It doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, usually brassy and quick with a quip, seemed more
thoughtful and restrained on Monday. He said he would like to hear
the ``decent men and women of the Police Department, who are in the
vast majority, shatter the blue wall of silence'' and speak out
against misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make a special appeal,'' said Rangel, ``to the tens
of thousands of courageous police officers who work hard on our
behalf every day not to allow this contamination of their
department by the few. When these good officers see wrongdoing, we
need to hear them say that they won't tolerate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by a crowd of reporters and photographers, the
protesters made the short walk from the Supreme Court building to
Police Headquarters, where they had to work hard at getting
arrested. The Giuliani administration clearly saw the protest as an
embarrassment. Administration officials seemed uncertain about how
to respond.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters linked arms and blocked the entrance to Police
Headquarters. There they stayed in the bitter cold for the better
part of an hour. Sharpton, clearly exasperated, reached for a
microphone and, in effect, demanded to be arrested. Finally the
protesters entered Police Headquarters, refused to leave, and were
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later they were led out of the building in small
groups and taken to the Seventh Precinct stationhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty heavy,'' said a reporter as the 71-year-old
Dinkins, his hands cuffed behind his back, was led away with Rangel
and Sharpton, who were also in handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   If Mayor Giuliani understood any aspect of what was going on,
including the depth of genuine emotion behind the protest, he
didn't let on. He told reporters: ``This is a great publicity stunt
_ can't you figure it out? It's a publicity stunt, and you are, as
usual, sucked into it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News said in an article that Giuliani had met with the
paper's editorial board and asserted, in the paper's words, that
``the biggest beef New Yorkers have with the cops isn't that
they're brutal _ it's that they're rude.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes. That must be it. The cops are rude. It was awfully rude
to turn Abner Louima upside down and shove a wooden cylinder so
deep into his rectum he almost died. That was very rude. And it was
ruder still to corner Amadou Diallo and shoot and shoot and shoot
and shoot and shoot until he was very, very dead. That was really
rude.
</P>
<P>
   And Lani Soto, a Brooklyn high school student whom I interviewed
a few weeks ago, thought it was quite rude when a uniformed officer
pushed her up against the doors of a subway train and got his kicks
fondling her sexually. And John Padilla, who had done nothing
wrong, thought it was rude for a police officer to slam him
face-first to the sidewalk with such force he was blinded in one
eye.
</P>
<P>
   Rude.
</P>
<P>
   This mayor will never get it. Which is why it's so important for
other New Yorkers to take up the slack.

NORTH KOREA SAYS IT WILL ADMIT US WEAPONS INSPECTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ North Korea agreed Tuesday to allow US inspectors
into an underground suspected nuclear weapons complex, ending a
diplomatic standoff that threatened to undermine American efforts
to halt Pyongyang's atomic ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, for its part, offered to grant crop
development assistance to the impoverished nation, which is facing
severe food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just reached an agreement in New York with the North
Koreans on access to the suspect underground site at Kumchang-ni,''
US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said in a statement
Tuesday. ``It will enable us both to confirm and monitor the
current and future use of the suspect site.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord has eased American anxiety prompted by intelligence
reports that the world's most secretive Communist government had
restarted a nuclear weapons development program it had abandoned in
1994 following an agreement by the United States to help the
country modernize.
</P>
<P>
   Last year US intelligence began suspecting the Koreans resumed
the operation after thousands of workers were detected on satellite
at the Kumchang-ni facility, which has been linked to its former
weapons program.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also announced that the Koreans had agreed to American
demands for talks aimed at limiting that country's missile
development program. Last summer North Korea launched a three-stage
missile over Japanese territory. The test alarmed American
intelligence agencies, who have since estimated that Pyongyang is
on the verge of perfecting a missile capable of striking Hawaii or
Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials insisted the agreement was not a
direct food-for-access exchange. State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said Pyongyang's action freed the Americans to approve a
``very modest potato project.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not agree to North Korean demands for ``compensation,''
Albright insisted. But ``removal of our suspicions concerning
Kumchang-ni would enable us to resume progress in our
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord permits an American arms control team to make
multiple visits to Kumchang-ni. The first visit will begin in May
of this year. A second trip is scheduled for May 2000. But a senior
US official said that the US obtained a commitment to conduct as
``many visits as necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea denied that it is developing nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has nothing to with nuclear activities,'' said North Korean
Vice Foreign Minister Kim Gye Gwan. ``The site is related to
sensitive national security purposes.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was struck between Kim and US envoy Charles
Kartman, came after three weeks of shuttle diplomacy in New York,
Washington and Pyongyang. A senior US official said it removes
``the boulder out of the middle of the road'' to improved relations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   The cornerstone of US relations with North Korea is the 1994
Agreed Framework pact. That accord obliges the United States to
raise $5 billion, primarily from Japan and South Korea, to build a
pair of light water reactors in North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, meanwhile, has been supplying North Korea
with hundreds of millions of dollars in heavy fuel oil to power the
country's industry.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, Pyongyang agreed to halt the development of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, the North Korean leadership has periodically
threatened to break the accord, charging that the United States has
failed to meet its obligations to ease crippling economic
sanctions.

`FULL MONTY' WHETS ACTOR'S APPETITE FOR THE OFFBEAT  
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Robert Carlyle is devouring the world.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that statement is a little overstuffed. But the 38-year-old
Scottish actor has swallowed up some prime roles recently,
including the next James Bond movie villain and the wastrel father
of Frank McCourt in the film adaptation of his best-selling memoir
``Angela's Ashes.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Glasgow house painter clearly is capitalizing on the
success of ``The Full Monty,'' in which he played a likable,
divorced dad who got his unemployed buddies to stage a male strip
show. The naughty-yet-empowering comedy gobbled up some $211
million worldwide, which made it the most successful British
production in history. It also was served a plateful of Oscar
nominations, including a surprise best picture nod, and won for its
musical score.
</P>
<P>
   By now you're wondering, what's with all the eating metaphors?
They're because, for all his obvious bankability, Carlyle chose to
take a year off after ``Monty'' madness to assess his career, then
resumed work with, of all things, ``Ravenous,'' a comic cannibal
western.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that's confidence. Or maybe it's just the kind of thing a
guy who really doesn't care about movie stardom does because it
intrigues him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never, ever choose a project or turn a project down
because of what I thought it was going to do financially,''
Carlyle, a sandy-haired, compactly built man, says in a strong
Scottish burr. ``That's not the way for me to go about it. It's the
elements that are in place _ the director, script, cast _ that's
why I'll do any piece. Not because of what it may do, or may do for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a main element fell out of place soon after
``Ravenous'' started filming in the Czech Republic. Milcho
Manchevski, the acclaimed Yugoslavian director of ``Before the
Rain,'' was let go several weeks into production, stranding Carlyle
and an eclectic group of co-stars _ Guy Pearce (``L.A.
Confidential''), Jeremy Davies (``Saving Private Ryan''), Jeffrey
Jones (``Amadeus''), David Arquette (``Scream'') _ on snow-covered
mountain sets.
</P>
<P>
   Partly through Carlyle's urging, the English director Antonia
Bird, with whom he'd made the controversial ``Priest'' and two
other features, came to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like working with Robert because he's a chameleon,
and I think all great actors are chameleons,'' Bird says. ``He
always surprises me, his imagination and his ability to get under
the skin of a new character and show you something that you've
never seen before.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting choice of words, under the skin, considering the
scenario on the, um, table. ``Ravenous'' is set shortly after the
1840s war with Mexico, at an isolated fort in California's Sierra
Nevada. A strange visitor, Carlyle's Colqhoun, stumbles into the
stockade with an alarming tale of getting lost in the snow with a
pioneer party, taking refuge in a cave and, when food supplies ran
out ...
</P>
<P>
   Before you can say Donner Party, Colqhoun has gone Weendigo on
the small garrison, deriving, like the Indian legend, supernatural
powers from consuming the flesh and blood of other humans. As if
this bizarre mixture of horror and history wasn't intriguing
enough, Carlyle adds that its implicit social satire _ a quality
that connects much of his work, from Ken Loach's class comedy
``Riff Raff'' to the trippy ``Trainspotting'' to ``Monty'' _ was
the project's main attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much about playing a cannibal that was
interesting,'' he notes, relievingly. ``It was more the underlying
themes of the piece. The fact that it was set in California I found
very, very amusing, because the state is very identified with the
desire to have the body beautiful, with cosmetic surgery and the
live-forever kind of ethic. This guy is kind of the first
Californian, saying much the same stuff with a kind of twisted,
satiric voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's a lampoon of expansionism and consumerism. As one of
the characters says, the country is stretching out its arms and
consuming all it can. Nothing much has changed, really, since those
times.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the discovery of social criticism in drama that first
inspired Carlyle to act. ``The catalyst was, a friend of mine gave
me a copy of `The Crucible' when I was 21,'' he recalls of Arthur
Miller's play about the Salem witch trials, which was considered a
thinly veiled attack on the anti-communist hysteria of the 1950s.
``I read this thing and I just thought, `How wonderful to be able
to talk about one thing but disguise it as sort of another.' In a
sense, that's what I've been doing my whole life ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlyle attended drama school for three years and appeared in
amateur productions around Glasgow before moving up to professional
theater. In 1990, he started his own theatrical company, Rain Dog,
where he served as artistic director for five years and remains an
associate.
</P>
<P>
   Carlyle is quick to point out that, for all his commitment to
politically engaged work, he places a high premium on enjoying
himself, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``My way into the whole thing (of `Ravenous') was to try and
have as much fun as possible and savor that character,'' he says.
``This guy will not only eat your leg, he'll tell you why he's
doing it, so I tried to put the tongue firmly in cheek.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlyle describes ``Plunkett and MacLeane,'' an upcoming release
in which he plays an 18th-century British highwayman, as ``fun,
swashbuckling action.''
</P>
<P>
   As for ``The World Is Not Enough,'' in which he plays the
nemesis of Pierce Brosnan's James Bond, Carlyle cheerfully reports
that he's going for ``a blow-up-the-world villain rather than a
dominate-the-world one. He has a bullet in his head, so he's
actually dying from the beginning. That makes him very difficult to
kill, because he has no fear and, as a result of this injury, his
pain senses are closing down and he doesn't feel anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, he's sort of a slippery customer,'' Carlyle notes. ``It's
hard, though. You look at the people who have played these parts
through the years _ people like Robert Shaw, Christopher Walken,
etc. _ and in order to be a part of that group, I just have to try
and make it as memorable as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a bit of ethnic pride involved in the assignment, too.
Before Carlyle and fellow Scot Ewan McGregor emerged from
``Trainspotting'' as major stars, original Bond Sean Connery was
pretty much Scotland's sole movie standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go and see the Bond films with my father, and Sean
Connery was the only actor that sounded like me up there,'' he
recalls. ``The link between Connery and Bond and acting and Scots
is fundamental. It's like taking part in some kind of history piece
for us. It's part of your psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlyle maintains a home in Glasgow with his wife, Anna, a
makeup artist. And, although he's Caledonian to the core, he tried
to bring a kind of Celtic cousin empathy to his portrayal of the
dissolute Irishman Malachy McCourt for the film version of
``Angela's Ashes,'' which co-stars Emily Watson and, like the Bond
film, will be released at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very harrowing story,'' Carlyle concedes. ``Everyone
who I told I was playing the father said, `Oh, he was such a
bastard.' But of course the children, nor Angela, never had a bad
word to say about the guy their whole lives. His crime was that he
couldn't face his responsibilities, he couldn't accpet the fact
that he had children to look after. He was fond of drink, and that
took him off in a different world.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what I tried to do with this part was to soften the
character to a certain extent, so it let the audience enter his
pain as well. It would be wrong, I think, to paint Malachy McCourt
as the villain of the piece. The villain of the piece, for me, is
the society that allowed that whole situation to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Irish poverty in the first half of the century is truly a world
away from the millennial media stardom on the cusp of which Carlyle
now finds himself _ a world of hype, he hopes, he'll maintain the
good sense to navigate successfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say I was surprised by `The Full Monty's' success is an
understatement, really,'' he acknowledges. ``If I knew it was going
to be that big, I could make a living buying lottery tickets. You
just don't know about something like that, and when it becomes a
phenomenon, it kind of overtakes you.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, when it happened, I kind of held back from it. There's a
body of work, some 15 films, in Europe, and I didn't want to come
across to Los Angeles and be The Chap From `The Full Monty.' Not to
take away from that or detract from that in any way, but it just
ain't the sum total of who I am.''

WHITE HOUSE AGREES TO LIMITED MISSILE DEFENSE PLAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House agreed to a bipartisan compromise
plan Tuesday that would allow the development of a limited
missile-defense system if it does not conflict with efforts with
Russia to reduce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the White House to embrace a compromise bill
offered by Senate Democrats and Republicans all but assured passage
in the Senate on Wednesday of a bill calling for the deployment of
a ballistic missile-defense system ``as soon as is technologically
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The House was expected to take up a similar measure later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House decision to back the development of what would
amount to a scaled-back version of the old ``Star Wars'' missile
defense plan, which followed years of opposition from Clinton. He
repeatedly had threatened to veto such a plan out of concern that
it would amount to a violation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty
with Moscow and cost too much to actually build.
</P>
<P>
   But an amendment adopted Tuesday by the Senate on a vote of 99-0
specifically tied development of the system to continued arms
reduction efforts with Russia and set no specific funding levels
for the project. The appropriations figures will be determined
later in the year if both the House and the Senate agree to move
ahead with development.
</P>
<P>
   The language also leaves the final decision on deployment up to
the president.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to reverse what amounts to a long-standing Clinton
administration policy followed on the heels of successful ballistic
missile tests in North Korea and Iran, and reports that China has
obtained U.S. technology that could help Beijing build more
accurate nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Those disclosures caused some Democrats to re-examine their
opposition to a missile-defense system. But they continued to
insist that their support does not extend to an expensive
``umbrella-like'' missile defense plan that was the focus of the
``Star Wars'' debate during Ronald Reagan's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Carl Levin of
Michigan, who joined with several Republicans to fashion compromise
language, said the bill the Senate will vote on Wednesday
recognized ``the threat'' of a missile attack from a rogue nation
is more real than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill will provide guidance for later appropriations and
development authorization. It contains no schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., chief author of the missile defense
bill, said the language tying deployment to offensive reductions is
a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strengthens the bill,'' he said, noting that ``defenses and
offensive reductions are not incompatible.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House embraced language in the bill that does not set
out specific funding for the project. Under a provision offered by
Cochran and Sen. Bob Kerry, D-Neb., appropriations for the project
will be determined year-by-year through normal budget channels in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As the Senate took up the missile defense bill Tuesday, Senate
Republicans were quick to draw attention to the latest reports that
China may have used U.S. technology pilfered from the government's
Los Alamos facility in New Mexico to enhance its missile guidance
and delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the People's Republic of China has more than a dozen
missiles aimed at American cities,'' Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., said as the Senate began debate.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the lack of a national missile-defense system was
the ``Achilles' heel'' of the nation, leaving it vulnerable to
attack.

 &HT;    Advice offered on how to seek capital
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If everyone indeed has 15 minutes of fame,
entrepreneurs want theirs at venture capital forums, the singles
dance of financing. There, a handful of companies looking for money
pitch to crowds of investors looking to grow their money.
</P>
<P>
   How that 15-minute presentation is made varies according to
who's making it. Some hug the lectern and read slides; others prowl
the stage as if they prepped by watching late-night infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, Beverly McDonald, a partner with SocketPR, a
public relations firm, talked to about 30 people about how to
fine-tune that pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them would be in the spotlight Tuesday pitching to this
week's Red Herring venture capital forum held at the same hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Others hope for a chance to pitch their companies next year.
They were a hungry and motivated audience.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said the important part of the presentation is what is
said, not how it's said: content over technique.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, she said, is to sufficiently intrigue the money people
so they will talk to you afterward. The 15-minute presentation is
the first contact. If it goes well, it can lead to follow-up talks,
due diligence and ultimately, checks cut.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the choice between a good public speaker or a
passionate technology person, McDonald advised letting the best
public speaker make the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of noise,'' McDonald said. ``We're looking for
ways to break through the noise.''
</P>
<P>
   To help, McDonald offered these tips for would-be presenters:
</P>
<P>
   _ Assume most in your audience are financial people, venture
capitalists or other types of investors. You don't want to clutter
your talk with too many details about money, but the venture
capitalists will look for some. A basic rule: If the numbers look
good, use them. If they don't, don't.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep in mind the technology actually gets the least attention.
Most of the focus will be on your ability to get the product ready
for the market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't hide behind the lectern. At this point, you're selling
yourself. Get out from behind the lectern and let people see who
you are. Don't use slides as a crutch, and don't use slides riddled
with bullets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bring a sample agenda that identifies the problem, tells what
your product is and tells how it solves the problem. What chance
does it have to grab a chunk of the market? Point out what makes
you different and say it simply. Don't demonstrate the product. If
you must, show one or two things that separate you from the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speak from your heart. You're putting everything on the line _
your home mortgage, your kid's college tuition. Tell the story of
how you developed the product. If you woke up in the middle of the
night and just had to get it on paper, say that. Let the audience
see your passion for your product and your company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mention money and pricing model, even if you don't have one
yet. If you ignore it, the money people assume you don't realize
its importance. It's not just about your product, but how you're
going to get it to market and how you're going to service it. At
this point, the product is the least important thing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finish early: It saves time to answer questions, get cards and
meet people. Take 10 or 12 minutes out of 15. For the most part,
you're looking for people in the audience who might not have that
day's schedule filled up. They will decide if they want to meet
with you in the first five minutes of your talk.

STILL ON THE LIFE-OR-DEATH WAITING LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By ADAM KRAMER  
 c.1999Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every day Michael Liebert lives with uncertainty. He
has been on the waiting list for liver and kidney transplants for
more than two years.
</P>
<P>
   As he waits, his body is slowly deteriorating. His eyes seem to
be sinking into their sockets and his skin is yellow from jaundice,
a symptom of liver failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I handled the 15 years of dialysis well,'' said Liebert, 55,
who is president of his temple and working on procuring financing
for a Broadway musical. But now, a vein keeps narrowing near his
elbow and above the shoulder, causing excruciating pain.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the New York City man, like that of 50,000 other
Americans awaiting organ transplants, may hinge on a new federal
policy that would change the way organs are allocated. Right now,
organs are distributed regionally _ meaning that a heart from a
donor in, say, New Jersey, would go to someone in that state even
if there were a patient in New York who needed it more.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a large disparity in waiting times between
regions, since some areas have fewer donors than others. According
to a government report released last month, patients in New York
City waited nearly 10 times as long for transplants as similar
patients just across the river in New Jersey - 511 days compared to
56.
</P>
<P>
   New federal regulations that were passed in April 1998 would
have corrected that by giving the sickest patients priority, no
matter where they live. But after public uproar, congressional
leaders and the Clinton administration agreed to a one-year
moratorium on implementing the new rules. By Oct. 21, 1999, the
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network must present a new
policy for organ allocation to Health and Hospital Services, which
will go into effect 90 days later for livers, and one year later
for all other organs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new allocation system will operate more fairly to reduce
the disparity and waiting times,'' said Charlotte Mehuron, director
of communications, Health Resources and Services Administration.
``It is a system based on a medical rationale and sound medical
judgement, not artificial geographic boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees. The United Network for Organ Sharing, a
private non-profit group, has maintained the transplant waiting
list since Sept. 30, 1986; officials there say it works well.
``There is one waiting list,'' said spokeswoman Esther Benenson.
``First the transplant doctor looks locally for the organ, then if
there is not an organ, there is a regional search and then a
national one.''
</P>
<P>
   According to UNOS, the problem with the new government policy is
that some transplant centers take much sicker patients than others,
and some have many more patients. This would mean that they would
get the majority of organs, which in turn could force the closure
of smaller transplant centers. And if a patient does not live close
enough to a transplant center, they would have to move, causing
emotional and financial stress.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some experts have argued that the sickest patients
are not always the best candidates for organ transplant because
they do not always have the strength to pull through the surgery _
meaning that the organ, which could have been used to someone with
a better prognosis, would be lost. According to an UNOS study, a
national list would cause 600 to 700 more people to die every year
than under the present system.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments on the allocation of organs would be moot if there
were enough organs for the people who need them. According to UNOS,
there were 50,047 people on the organ transplant waiting list last
year and 20,360 transplants were performed, while 3,916 people died
waiting. An estimated 12 people die every day while waiting for a
transplant, while every 16 minutes another name is added to the
waiting list, according to the non-profit Coalition on Donation.
</P>
<P>
   Liebert's problems started at birth, when a genetic disease that
destroyed his kidneys was diagnosed. Through 15 years of dialysis
and blood transfusions, he contracted hepatitis, which caused
cirrhosis of the liver. Organ transplants are his only option. But
until recently, no hospital would even consider a kidney transplant
on a patient with hepatitis B because of the potential side effects
_ liver cancer and the flaring up of the hepatitis. Therefore, he
has to spend three and one-half hours, three days a week, at the
hospital on a dialysis machine. He also has to go to physical
therapy three days a week in order to lead a somewhat normal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a miracle of modern medicine,'' Liebert said. ``I have
real bad plumbing inside, and doctors said I wouldn't see my second
birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the lack of organ donations are threefold. Some
families hesitate for religious reasons _ even though most
religions allow for organ donation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all for it,'' said the Rev. Brian McSweeney of the
Archdiocese of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, many people believe that if they agree to donate a
loved one's organs, hospital officials will let that person die
instead of doing everything possible to save him _ which,
transplant officials insist, is not the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to understand that everything will be done to keep
them alive,'' said Marilyn Winn, director of programs for the
National Kidney Foundation of Indiana chapter.
</P>
<P>
   The third reason for lack of organ donors is a bit of a
Catch-22. A person who signs an organ donor card does not get final
say on what happens to their organs. A hospital will not take the
organs even if there is a donor card, unless family members agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``For liability purposes a hospital needs to have the next of
kin sign off on a donation,'' said Maria Falcon, of the National
Kidney Foundation of New York. ``People need to have a witness when
signing an organ donor card, and say these are my wishes once I
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Mehuron, ``It is very heartfelt when people say, 'It was
comforting to know that their loved one continued on helping
another person to lead a productive life.'''

AN APPETITE FOR ITALIAN CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By JEANINE PREZIOSO  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Vitttorio Capotorto, a burly man with thick gray
hair, blue eyes and a Roman nose could be mistaken for an ancestor
of the Austrian Habsburg Dynasty that occupied 18th-century
northern Italy. But he is from Puglia, a region in the South, a
fact he hesitates to admit. While few contest the warmth and
natural beauty of Sicily, many northern Italians, and Americans,
believe southern Italy has no culture.
</P>
<P>
   And in America, Italian culture has been far too often
associated with ignorance and buffoonery, not to mention myriad
``Godfather'' imitations; a fact not lost on Capotorto. He blames
an initially poor, strictly blue-collar work ethic for a
malnourished Italian-American culture. He wants to fill the void
with his vision of theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is Italian-Americans wanted to learn English,
work, establish themselves in society,'' Capotorto said. ``This
killed the other parts of the men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he has plans for a multifaceted arts center. Capotorto, who
began putting on plays in Italian with Columbia University students
in 1997, now has a company of almost 13 working actors. But his
creative vision lacks a home. The performances are usually held in
high school theaters. The group, through the Department of Citywide
Administrative Services, is looking for its own space in midtown
Manhattan. Capotorto envisions a building large enough to house two
theaters, one for dance and theatrical performances, and the other
for film. He also envisions a cultural library, cafeteria,
conference room and exhibition space for art.
</P>
<P>
   Tucked away in a small office at the top of an old brownstone on
Restaurant Row in the theater district, is the home of La Bottega
Dell'Arte, the seed of what could become the Lincoln Center of
Italian performing arts in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Capotorto founded the company in 1997 as a theater experiment at
Columbia University. The 57-year-old Italian director, who speaks
little English, went to the Italian Department's acting chairwoman,
JoAnn Cavallo, and proposed establishing a theater group. She not
only agreed to his proposal but also asked him to teach a
three-credit course called the Italian theater practicum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to do contemporary plays from southern authors,''
Capotorto said. ``Not that we want to ignore Machiavelli and
Pirandello.''
</P>
<P>
   A chance encounter brought Capotorto together with Vittorio
Lattanzi, a successful restaurateur. Capotorto invited Lattanzi to
his production of ``Le Bugie con le Gambe Lunghe,'' or
``Long-Legged Lies,'' by Eduardo De Filippo, playwright of things
Neapolitan, at Columbia's Casa Italiana, on Dec. 3, 1997. Impressed
with the turnout and with what he saw, and homesick for his own
culture, he offered to produce Capotorto's endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured since he had such success with student actors, we
could do much better with real actors,'' said Lattanzi, 57, who
serves as the company's president.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, the company performed ``Long-Legged Lies'' again,
as the newly formed La Bottega Dell'Arte. In November, the company
put on three one-act plays by Italian playwrights. In December, a
production of Machiavelli's ``Mandragola'' followed a performance
of music, including a repertory of operettas, original dance and
theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no real center for the Italian performing arts in New
York, no real outlet,'' said Francesca Pennisi, 31, a coordinator
at La Bottega who recently got her Ph.D. from Yale University in
Italian language and literature. ``There's more an awareness of
cuisine and language. We want to expand people's vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gardaphe, professor of Italian studies at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, said the theater had a
timely message. People are tired of the stereotypes and long for a
deeper understanding of Italian culture, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italians are very good at repressing themselves,'' he said.
``If this theater allows the true Italian subconscious to come
through, it will succeed. If it does not just make people laugh,
but makes them think, it will succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   The next play will be ``Sabbia'' or ``Sand'' based on the life
of Nicolo van Westerhout, a turn-of-the-century Dutch composer who
was born and reared in Mola di Bari, Puglia, Capotorto's hometown.
Paolo Tartamella wrote the play; he is an Italian journalist who
works for America Oggi, the Italian daily newspaper. They are
scheduled to perform it in March at Brooklyn's New Utrecht High
School theater.
</P>
<P>
   While the creative side of the company is flourishing, the
administrative is less well-organized. La Bottega is searching for
an executive director and more money. The money they expected from
a fund-raiser held last December did not pan out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our budget barely covers the cost of the shows,'' Pennisi
said. ``We need to organize from within. We need a viable business
plan before reaching out for fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Marco Greco, 32, co-founder of the Belmont Italian-American
Playhouse, a small Bronx-based theater company, understands the
problems. He started his theater eight years ago and went out on
his own this year, after writing and performing a one-man play. The
success rate of starting a small theater company in New York is
about the same as the chances of opening a successful new
restaurant. Behind the scene seems to matter most, Greco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to knock the creativity, but you need some semblance of
administration,'' he said. ``I always tell anyone who's thinking of
starting a theater, whatever money you have in the bank, pay the
administrator. People want to receive a thank you note for the
money they donate. There has to be a genuine accountability for the
donations.''
</P>
<P>
   But Capotorto is focused on his mission. ``When Italian
immigrants came to the United States they were more concerned with
working to keep themselves alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mentality was one derived from the fear of starvation,''
he said. ``If there's one piece of bread, we don't think to split
it. I think, instead to take it all for myself. What became a
greediness of material desires manifested itself over the years
into an intellectual greediness. We must unite now.''

   NEW YORK _ If you live or work in Manhattan, you walk through
their line of vision every day. And even your most private actions
may not escape the thousands of silent observers that keep an eye
on you.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the number of surveillance cameras in Manhattan
has increased dramatically, and New Yorkers appear to have scant
awareness of their presence. Places that used to seem like private
settings _ elevators, empty street corners or quiet parks _ have
become public thanks to monitoring by cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely been a major, major proliferation of video
cameras in the last five years,'' said Dov Hykind, a Republican New
York State Assemblyman who wants to open public hearings on the
issue of video surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Although police officials insist the cameras help to fight
crime, Hykind and other critics raise questions on whether that
need outweighs the intrusion into the activities of unsuspecting
citizens. ``I think we need to take a much closer look at things,
and not wake up one morning and find out that wherever we walk,
wherever we stand, wherever we sit out there in the public there is
a camera trained on us,'' Hykind said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Civil Liberties Union recently counted 2,397
cameras in Manhattan, with the greatest concentration in the
financial and theater districts.
</P>
<P>
   NYCLU volunteer Chris Johnson said that the goal was ``not a
matter of saying that it's right or it's wrong, but that some
discussion should take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the NYCLU criticized New York police for installing
video cameras in Washington Square Park, which police said was a
strategy to curb the park's rampant drug dealing. Police say the
strategy has worked, and the cameras are still in place.
</P>
<P>
   The NYCLU, however, contends the cameras are an example of
unnecessary police encroachment on the lives of innocent people as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Surveillance cameras go unnoticed in many parts of the city.
Shoppers emerging on a recent day from the busy 7th Avenue and 34th
Street subway station just outside Macy's department store
expressed surprise that they were being observed by two cameras
visible one floor above them.
</P>
<P>
   When the camera was pointed out to him, passer-by Pierre
Elliott, 27, looked up and said: ``These are the slow beginnings of
a dictatorship. In five more years, they're going to be
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, housing projects across the city are filled with police
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we have about 500 cameras deployed'' in housing
projects, said Joseph Dunne, Chief of the NYPD's Housing Division.
He added that installation had begun on another 800.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras have been effective in preventing crime, he said,
and for aiding investigations. In the first seven months after
cameras were installed in Brooklyn's Albany projects, there were 12
arrests stemming from camera footage, he asserted. In Harlem's
Grant projects, crime has dropped 25 percent in the two years since
cameras began recording crack use, violent assaults, robbery and
vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that this technology goes a long way to making public
housing what it was always intended to be,'' Dunne said, ``safe and
cheap housing for people who need a little help.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the workplace, fears that unsuspecting employees are
being videotaped using office bathrooms, or that street cameras may
tilt to see into apartment buildings have fueled criticism from
advocates for personal privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hill, President of FirstWatch, an Ottawa-based surveillance
firm, said that in his experience, court cases have determined that
in public places, people have little right to privacy. ``If you're
in public, you're fair game,'' he said. ``That even goes for public
washrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties aside, there is also the question of cost. Mark
Ventura, a security consultant, said that one camera typically runs
around $10,000, with installation.
</P>
<P>
   That would put city costs for watching millions of Manhattanites
at a minimum of $4 million if the NYCLU count is correct.
</P>
<P>
   Without confirming the figure, Dunne said, It is all ``money
well spent,'' and inevitable, Dunne said. ``We're lagging behind
many, many other municipalities and governments.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City is not the first place to embrace surveillance
cameras as a crime deterrent. Municipal governments in Britain,
like the town of Newcastle, have been monitoring city streets since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Hykind, a well-known conservative in the Assembly, is not
convinced that video surveillance should be so far-reaching. The
need for debate, he said, is demonstrated by his sharing a platform
with a group that he rarely aligns with on issues, the NYCLU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the two of us _ us doing something together _ will
speak volumes of the fact that all of us should be concerned,''
Hykind said.

FOR THE LOVE OF LLAMAS: BREEDING GROWS IN U.S.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ For Dana McCullough, it was something about
the calm, dewy-eyed gaze. ``The way they look at you,'' she said,
recalling her first encounter with a llama. ``They just fascinated
me.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough, who now keeps a herd of 20 on her ranch in Elk City,
Okla., started out 11 years ago as an enthusiast with four llamas,
but quickly became an addict. ``They're like potato chips,'' she
said. ``You can't have just one or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Backstage at the Southwestern Llama Show here, McCullough runs
an industrial-size blow dryer over Kristi, a squirming,
chestnut-colored two-year-old. ``They're so observant,'' she said.
And curious. ``If I put something in the middle of the pasture,
they have to go check it right out.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, she realizes, understands her hobby. ``Mostly
people ask: 'What do you do with llamas? What are llamas good for?'
'' One man, she said, wanted to know a bit more: ``How big are the
eggs they lay?'' McCullough shook her head. ``I guess he was
thinking they're ostriches.''
</P>
<P>
   Llama breeding is a growing industry in the United States. The
International Lama[cq] Registry, which tracks the animals'
pedigrees, listed more than 120,000 llamas in the United States at
the end of 1998, compared with approximately 40,000 in 1991. With
92 exhibitors from 25 states showing more than 400 llamas, the Fort
Worth show, which includes an auction, is the largest in the
country strictly for llamas, said the show's organizer, Carol Ann
Tallmon. Two larger shows also include alpacas, a smaller, slightly
woollier cousin of the llama.
</P>
<P>
   One of the oldest domesticated animals in the world, llamas can
be bred for their wool or as pack animals, and a bred female can
sell for $3,500 or more. Stud-quality males sell for $1,500 and up
and command anywhere from $100 to $5,000 in stud fees, said the
trade group's registrar, Jan Wassink. Still, many owners think of
their llamas more as pets, or even family members, than as
livestock. Whether it is the big, expressive eyes, the lush fur, or
the quirky, inquisitive personalities, owners display an attachment
toward their llamas that, to the uninitiated, might seem to border
on the obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kind of get to be like children,'' said Jerry Mitchell,
who has brought llamas to Fort Worth from Tuttle, Okla., for four
years. Mitchell, who started out five years ago with two llamas,
now has a herd of 30, but he cannot bring himself to sell any of
his animals just yet. ``I'd probably give her up before I'd give up
a llama,'' he joked, gesturing toward his adult daughter, who is
busy tending her own llamas.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the arena, a costume contest was under way. A llama in a
plastic cap peered through a shower curtain at the competition: a
turkey and a cowboy. Nearby, a medieval damsel was unwinding after
her turn in the ring. The next day's events were the halter
classes, where llamas were judged on their wool and their build
rather than their fashion sense.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the action, though, was back by the stalls, where llamas
pad behind their owners on rope leashes or stand with varying
degrees of patience as they were blow dried, combed and spritzed
with conditioner to make their fur soft and shiny.
</P>
<P>
   It takes two days to wash a llama, said Walter Cardenas, the
manager of American Llama Farm in Fort Worth. To thoroughly wet a
llama requires two painstaking hours of parting layers of wool with
one hand while working a hose with the other. Washing requires
about a half-gallon of shampoo _ Cardenas, like many breeders,
favors Suave because it's inexpensive _ and drying takes 24 hours,
including four hours of blow drying one morning and four the next
day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Llamas may not enjoy baths, but Nell Graham, the owner of
Graham's Llamas, in Denison, Texas, said that her llamas
appreciated the grooming. ``They prance'' after being washed, she
said. Graham watched one of her llamas, Mistletoe, navigate an
obstacle course designed to simulate situations that a llama might
encounter on a trail. She smiled indulgently as Mistletoe, led by a
teen-age assistant, systematically refused to mount ramps, walk on
planks or back through an arrangement of poles. ``She says, 'I may
not do anything, but I look pretty,''' Graham concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine life without llamas,'' said Graham, who fell
in love with the animals at a petting farm in 1974. ``It keeps you
busy, and so many of my friends are llama friends.'' Llama rearing
is a full time job for her, but she scoffs at the idea of making
money at it. Shows, which have netted her a case full of ribbons
and llama-shaped trophies, are as much a social event as an
opportunity to promote her herd. ``I'm in it mostly for
enjoyment,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Hollywood may have discovered the animals' appeal: Disney
has announced plans for an animated film starring a llama. If some
owners are excited by the prospect, Mike Summers of Austin, Texas,
has reservations about the publicity. After the Disney movie ``101
Dalmatians,'' many families bought the dogs, only to give them away
after finding them too difficult to care for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have a Dalmatian that I got from the pound,'' he
said. ``My concern is the same thing might happen with llamas.''
</P>
<P>
   Llamas do at least have the advantage of being easy to get along
with. Like many owners, Summers regularly takes his llamas to
schools and nursing homes, where the animals demonstrate particular
solicitude for the elderly. ``Some of 'em almost get into bed with
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the area set aside for llamas to be sold in the afternoon
auction, Monte and Leslie Dickman from Thedford, Neb., had two
llamas ready to greet prospective bidders. ``What always excites me
is a new buyer, '' Mrs. Dickman said. ``There's something about
being a new llama owner and experiencing the joy they give you.''
And, she added, ``llama people tend to be a really neat group of
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dickman paused to look over her charges. ``How can we live
without llamas?''

NAILED: MINI-MASTERPIECES AT THE TIPS OF WOMEN'S FINGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By GEORGINA GUSTIN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some people would call them the 10 greatest
masterpieces in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. They are
only about two and a half inches long, don't hang on the wall or
stand on pedestals, and are not rendered in marble or painted on
canvas. Their asking price is a modest $18 to $25.
</P>
<P>
   These works of art are on the tips of 20-year-old Desiree
Henry's fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Henry is a salesperson in the museum's gift shop and every two
weeks she goes to a salon in her native Brooklyn where she spends
up to two hours as a ``technician'' files, molds, paints and
stencils elaborate designs on her acrylic-reinforced nails. This
week, her nails were white with pinkish highlights, a stenciled
purple geometric design and stripes of silver glitter, but after
Henry's next visit to the salon, her constantly shifting digital
exhibit would change again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't compare my nails with the art in the museum,'' Henry
said, modestly. ``But some people say they should be on display.''
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of women across the country, Henry puts a great
deal of time, effort and money into her nails. According to a study
done by Nails Magazine, the nail industry's largest trade
publication, almost $6.3 billion was spent on services in nail
salons last year. And of the estimated 250,000 salons in the
country, 85 percent create what is known in the industry as ``nail
art'' for their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technicians have been doing nail art for the last 20 to 25
years,'' said Cyndy Drummey, publisher of Nails magazine. ``But in
the last five or six years, we've really seen a boom.'' Drummey
believes this boom is the result of advances in nail art
technology. ``Once the nails got longer with acrylics in the last
20 years, and the colors got wilder, it gave rise to all the
possibilities with nail art.''
</P>
<P>
   Nail art, painstakingly rendered on the tiniest of canvasses,
can range from the relatively sedate to the stunningly bold. And
Drummey has witnessed the often-spectacular results at hundreds of
nail ``competitions'' held throughout the country where nail
technicians, most of them self-taught, have taken the developments
in the industry to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it,'' Drummey said. ``I've seen entire jungle scenes
with animals and smoke, and a carousel with moving parts. You have
to see it to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   Drummey explained the categories in which nail art competitors
are judged. ``At these competitions there is nail art and fantasy
nail art,'' she said. ``Nail art is done on the surface of the
nail,'' while fantasy nail art ``is literally bulding off that
platform.''
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy nail art, in which technicians use acrylic and
fiberglass to sculpt figures and shapes, yields some impressive,
even architectural results, but is not a practical adornment.
People whose nails receive fantasy treatment _ models on the
competitive circuit _ need help with everyday tasks like going to
the ladies room.
</P>
<P>
   Chesley Phillips, president of Nails of America, an 1,800-member
group that works to establish standards for the industry, attends
30 nail competitions a year. Phillips said some industry
professionals went from competition to competition trying to rack
up points for Nails magazine's ``Top 25'' nail technicians list.
``They travel around the country campaigning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nanda Khin, a 33-year-old salon owner from Windsor, Ontario,
Canada, has been one of the most consistent competitors on the nail
art circuit and often ends up on the Top 25 list. Windsor is a town
of 200,000 people about half an hour's drive from Detroit, the city
that Cyndy Drummey calls the nail art capital of the world. (Khin
insists that Windsor is in fact the true nail art capital. ``People
know you're if you're from Windsor,'' she said. ``They can tell by
your nails.'')
</P>
<P>
   But while Windsor may well be a paradise of nail art, there are
others. (The borough of Brooklyn is home to hundreds of nail-art
salons including Hope Nails, Happy Nails and Love Nail, as well as
the more ominously named Nail Attitude and Nail Trap.) And Khin is
easily lured across the border to nail competitions in the United
States, some of which are held thousands of miles away from her
home.
</P>
<P>
   The designs in Khin's nail art oeuvre range from tropical
landscapes to safari-inspired wildlife, but Khin attributes her
success on the nail-art circuit to her meticulous technique. ``I
like to be really, really neat,'' she said of her work. ``I look at
the nails I've done, and I know they're mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Nail art is also a point of personal pride for Desiree Henry,
who makes certain sacrifices not only to have her nails artfully
painted, but to live with such long nails. ``They sometimes get
caught in the register,'' she said. ``And sometimes I can't pick up
coins off the counter or the floor.'' And once, Henry said, she
slammed her front door on one of her nails and broke it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like them long, you adjust your lifestyle,'' Drummey
said. ``There are creative ways to avoid breaking them.'' (Some
methods include dialing the phone with the end of a pencil or using
devices specially designed to open cans or fasten buttons.) ``You
learn to do things with your knuckles,'' Drummey said.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Lowerey, another salesperson at the museum, insisted
that her two-inch nails, which she changes depending on her outfit
or mood, rarely interfere with her lifestyle. ``I don't know why
people say, 'How can you do things?''' she said. ``For me it's not
hard. It's nothing. I don't think it's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite her lackadaisical attitude, Lowerey echoed a
sentiment felt by all nail art aficionados: Breaking a masterpiece
will really ruin your day.

THE GOLDEN GLOVES: BOXERS FIGHT FOR A DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired.  
 By ADAM KRAMER  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service   ``Watching a fight on television
has always seemed to me a poor substitute for being there. For one
thing, you can't tell the fighters what to do. When I watch a
fight, I like to study one boxer's problem, solve it, and then
communicate my solution vocally.'' -- A.J. Liebling
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Get off the ropes,'' screamed a fan, wearing a red
hat and a Golden Gloves championship chain around his neck, as a
young fighter absorbed his opponent's blows. ``Come on, use your
jab.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Box!'' screamed another fan in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Golden Gloves _ one of the biggest and most
celebrated amateur boxing tournaments in the world _ was beginning
its third day and the audience was going wild, while moving to the
rhythm of the fight. In the ring, the weak-kneed fighter leaned
against the ropes with his arms on his side and a glassy look in
his eyes. The referee had stepped in front of him to give a
standing eight count, after his opponent fired shot after shot in
rapid succession. The young boxer never recovered and the fight was
over, stopped in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of leather hitting open palms echoed off the
cinderblock walls at the back of the Police Athletic League
gymnasium on Longwood Avenue in the Bronx, as trainers warmed up
their fighters, shouting encouraging words. More than 300 people
filled the multipurpose gym, to watch some of the best amateur
fighters in the metro area, and perhaps hoping to catch an early
glimpse of the next Sugar Ray Robinson or Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   The gym walls were painted orange, yellow, blue and covered with
murals painted by neighborhood kids, adding some warmth to its cold
feeling. Above the exit was a Police Athletic League sign, which
said, ``In some neighborhoods, kids have no PAL's except us.''
</P>
<P>
   Every January for the past 72 years, amateur boxers have
converged in gyms like this across the country with a single motive
_ to fight their way to stardom. A victory at one of the Golden
Gloves Tournaments qualifies a fighter for the nationals, and then,
with a bit of luck, Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, the brainchild of then-Chicago Tribune sports
editor Arch Ward, who designed the amateur tournament to help youth
and promote competition, blossomed under the sponsorship of the
Chicago Tribune and The New York Daily News. Today, a newspaper, a
radio or television station, or a civic organization sponsors the
regional Golden Gloves tournaments throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been said that the real reason for newspaper
sponsorship of the tournament was to give papers a way to fill up
the sports pages during the winter months, after the football
season and before the start of baseball's spring training. More
important, the Golden Gloves provided amateur boxers with a venue
to showcase their skills and gave them hope of using boxing as the
means to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year sitting at ringside, I can tell where the new
immigrants are coming from, just from their accents,'' said Bill
Farrell, a New York Daily News staff writer who has covered the
Golden Gloves for the past 13 years. ``In the 80's, the fighters
were from the West Indies, but in the past five years they are from
Mexico, West Africa, Central America, and Central Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of boxers fighting in the tournament continues to be
strong: 500 registered for the most recent New York City
tournament, which divides the fighters into two divisions. The
novice class is for the fighters who have never fought in
competition, and the open class is for those fighters who have had
previous ring experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas amateur boxing is picking up, and in others it
is declining,'' said Ray Rinaldi, boxing trainer and New York State
Golden Gloves delegate. ``But throughout the country, with the
Olympics coming in a year, the number of kids signing up to learn
how box is increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that never changes is the crowd. Fans have not lost
their energy or the thrill of watching the matches hosted in their
community. Where else could a true fan sit at ringside and watch 10
fights for $10?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two bucks, I won the last fight!'' said a middle-aged man
dressed in a T-shirt, jeans, suspenders and mud-encrusted boots,
who was betting on the matches with his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the guy wearing the blue this fight,'' he said to his
friend who was wearing a sweater and jeans, with hair the color of
a smoker's hands stained with tar and nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   One row up, Eric Kelly, winner of the 1998 New York Golden
Gloves, junior Olympic under-19 championship, and one of the top
fighters in the United States at 156 pounds, was watching the
fights. He would be defending his title later in the tournament,
but in the meantime was attending all of the fights with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost another one,'' said Kelly, referring to a fight in
which another boxer from his Bedford-Stuyvesant boxing club had
been defeated. ``We're zero for five.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, 18, is a personable and cocky high school senior, who has
been fighting since he was 10. He spends two hours a day, five or
six days a week, in the gym, then goes home and does sit ups and
push-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Eric does is study and box,'' said Harold Kelly, Eric's
father. ``He has been real disciplined since he was a baby; it is
not taught. He has been good all his life, and gets supported 100
percent by his mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric's goals are simple if lofty: win the Golden Gloves, the
Nationals, Olympics and then turn pro. He is not one of the boxers,
as he says, who wants to box but does not want to put in the work
it takes to become good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Eric are you going to win another one,'' said an older
gentleman, pointing to the gold boxing gloves that hang around
Eric's neck, while fans went crazy watching fighter John Vargas's
head snap back from a straight right by Anthony Armstead, causing a
sound that resonated throughout the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am determined and I want it,'' said Eric Kelly, over the
noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is a star, an absolute star,'' Farrell said. ``There is
no limit to his potential.''
</P>
<P>
   At 10:10 p.m., the last fight on the card was over. It was not
the best fight of the night. But on a night of some very good
amateur matches, it was quickly forgotten, as the crowds filtered
out into the cold Bronx night air, heading for home.

THE GOLDEN GLOVES: BOXERS FIGHT FOR A DREAM

 By ADAM KRAMER  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service   ``Watching a fight on television
has always seemed to me a poor substitute for being there. For one
thing, you can't tell the fighters what to do. When I watch a
fight, I like to study one boxer's problem, solve it, and then
communicate my solution vocally.'' -- A.J. Liebling
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Get off the ropes,'' screamed a fan, wearing a red
hat and a Golden Gloves championship chain around his neck, as a
young fighter absorbed his opponent's blows. ``Come on, use your
jab.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Box!'' screamed another fan in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Golden Gloves _ one of the biggest and most
celebrated amateur boxing tournaments in the world _ was beginning
its third day and the audience was going wild, while moving to the
rhythm of the fight. In the ring, the weak-kneed fighter leaned
against the ropes with his arms on his side and a glassy look in
his eyes. The referee had stepped in front of him to give a
standing eight count, after his opponent fired shot after shot in
rapid succession. The young boxer never recovered and the fight was
over, stopped in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of leather hitting open palms echoed off the
cinderblock walls at the back of the Police Athletic League
gymnasium on Longwood Avenue in the Bronx, as trainers warmed up
their fighters, shouting encouraging words. More than 300 people
filled the multipurpose gym, to watch some of the best amateur
fighters in the metro area, and perhaps hoping to catch an early
glimpse of the next Sugar Ray Robinson or Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   The gym walls were painted orange, yellow, blue and covered with
murals painted by neighborhood kids, adding some warmth to its cold
feeling. Above the exit was a Police Athletic League sign, which
said, ``In some neighborhoods, kids have no PAL's except us.''
</P>
<P>
   Every January for the past 72 years, amateur boxers have
converged in gyms like this across the country with a single motive
_ to fight their way to stardom. A victory at one of the Golden
Gloves Tournaments qualifies a fighter for the nationals, and then,
with a bit of luck, Olympic glory.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, the brainchild of then-Chicago Tribune sports
editor Arch Ward, who designed the amateur tournament to help youth
and promote competition, blossomed under the sponsorship of the
Chicago Tribune and The New York Daily News. Today, a newspaper, a
radio or television station, or a civic organization sponsors the
regional Golden Gloves tournaments throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It has also been said that the real reason for newspaper
sponsorship of the tournament was to give papers a way to fill up
the sports pages during the winter months, after the football
season and before the start of baseball's spring training. More
important, the Golden Gloves provided amateur boxers with a venue
to showcase their skills and gave them hope of using boxing as the
means to escape poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year sitting at ringside, I can tell where the new
immigrants are coming from, just from their accents,'' said Bill
Farrell, a New York Daily News staff writer who has covered the
Golden Gloves for the past 13 years. ``In the 80's, the fighters
were from the West Indies, but in the past five years they are from
Mexico, West Africa, Central America, and Central Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of boxers fighting in the tournament continues to be
strong: 500 registered for the most recent New York City
tournament, which divides the fighters into two divisions. The
novice class is for the fighters who have never fought in
competition, and the open class is for those fighters who have had
previous ring experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some areas amateur boxing is picking up, and in others it
is declining,'' said Ray Rinaldi, boxing trainer and New York State
Golden Gloves delegate. ``But throughout the country, with the
Olympics coming in a year, the number of kids signing up to learn
how box is increasing.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that never changes is the crowd. Fans have not lost
their energy or the thrill of watching the matches hosted in their
community. Where else could a true fan sit at ringside and watch 10
fights for $10?
</P>
<P>
   ``Two bucks, I won the last fight!'' said a middle-aged man
dressed in a T-shirt, jeans, suspenders and mud-encrusted boots,
who was betting on the matches with his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got the guy wearing the blue this fight,'' he said to his
friend who was wearing a sweater and jeans, with hair the color of
a smoker's hands stained with tar and nicotine.
</P>
<P>
   One row up, Eric Kelly, winner of the 1998 New York Golden
Gloves, junior Olympic under-19 championship, and one of the top
fighters in the United States at 156 pounds, was watching the
fights. He would be defending his title later in the tournament,
but in the meantime was attending all of the fights with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost another one,'' said Kelly, referring to a fight in
which another boxer from his Bedford-Stuyvesant boxing club had
been defeated. ``We're zero for five.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, 18, is a personable and cocky high school senior, who has
been fighting since he was 10. He spends two hours a day, five or
six days a week, in the gym, then goes home and does sit ups and
push-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Eric does is study and box,'' said Harold Kelly, Eric's
father. ``He has been real disciplined since he was a baby; it is

ATTORNEY FOR THE DALMATIAN: LAW, ON FOUR LEGS 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 BY ERIK LINDEN  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sue Schacter says the love of her husband's life was
not her, but their dog, Sonny. And when her husband passed away,
she was not about to give up their beloved 11-year-old poodle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of a kind,'' Schacter said of Sonny. ``And now he's
vital to my well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schacter's lease clearly states that pets are forbidden. Now
her landlord is trying to evict her, even though Sonny has a clean
record. So Schacter did what any good New Yorker in trouble would
do. She hired a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Karen Copeland, determined and pugnacious pet lawyer. She
is mounting a strong defense of Sonny, who she says, in legal
terms, is an ``emotional support assistant animal'' and therefore
has squatting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Copeland is one of a growing number of lawyers who defend people
and their pets. Pet law is a subspecialty of animal law, and
although few lawyers can support a private practice on dogs and
cats alone, these feisty attorneys are passionate about defending
animals.
</P>
<P>
   While New York City is not exactly farm country, it is often
called a zoo. Three million cats and dogs live on top of 7.5
million people, according to the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. And with that kind of crowding,
there are bound to be conflicts. A dozen animal lawyers have come
to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Copeland's cases concern squabbles between landlords and
tenants. Tenants always have a good excuse about why they need to
keep their loved ones. Like the couple who say their dog calms
their two children who have attention deficit disorder. Or the
woman who claimed her dog helped her quit smoking. Or the man with
AIDS who says his loving Rottweiler helps him cope.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan-based lawyer Maddy Tarnofsky has become involved with
medical malpractice _ the four-legged kind. Tarnofsky recently
represented a client whose 9-month-old puppy died in surgery. A
settlement was reached before the case went to trial.
</P>
<P>
   In eviction cases, Tarnofsky said, landlords fail to realize
that pets can be vital to a person's mental and physical health.
But judges and juries do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to jinx it,'' said Tarnofsky, who has been
practicing law for eight years, ``but I haven't lost one of those
cases yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Many lawyers who deal with pet cases are diehard animal lovers.
Wally Dingman, a lawyer based in Riverside, Calif., said he
considered police dogs part of his family. Dingman trains German
shepherds for Adlerhorst Police K-9 Academy, and he defends the
shaggy accused. One recent case involved an officer who was bitten
by a dog during a training exercise. The officer sued the academy
for personal injury, and lost, thanks to Dingman's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Some lawyers take things to the extreme, and the line between
animal defense and animals-rights activism can be blurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife knows that if I ever see anybody abusing a dog, I'm
liable to do something that would get me in trouble,'' said
Dingman, who is also an editor of Dog Sports magazine. ``I view
that as one animal abusing another.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Steve Logan, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based lawyer: ``I
don't think I'd ever take up a case defending someone who's abused
an animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the controversial pit bull is seen as a victim of bad
press. Joel Zand, a New York City lawyer who operates a Web site _
www.doglaw.com _ said some breeds were unfairly maligned. Quoting
Martin Luther King, Zand said pets should be judged on the
``content of their character,'' and not on their particular breed.
</P>
<P>
   Some defenders do not even like the word ``pet.'' Gilda Mariani,
who chairs the New York City Bar Association's committee on legal
issues pertaining to animals, said the word ``pets'' implies
ownership. Mariani prefers the more general term ``animals''
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cringe at the term 'pets','' said Mariani, who likens the
plight of animals to a group of people whose voices are never
heard. ``Animals are a discriminated sector.'' Mariani added that
as pet lawyers multiply, ``more people are looking at what we do as
something serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Pet lawyers also find new homes for pets when their owners die.
Manhattan-based lawyer Frances Carlisle encourages people to look
for a charitable organization to care for stranded pets.
</P>
<P>
   She also encourages other lawyers to join the cause. At a recent
seminar at the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,
Carlisle urged lawyers to take animal pro-bono cases. As she put
it: ``Helping animals has to be your passion, not a way of making a
living.''

COFFEE OR NIETZSCHE? CAFE-GOERS TURN TO PHILOSOPHY 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By VIOLET LAW  
 c. 1999 Columbia News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTCLAIR, N.J. _ Clusters of gleaming white mugs sat on each
table at Page One Cafe, most drained of every drop. A few cradled
cold coffee left by cafe-goers, who had come not for cafe-latte but
for the weekly philosophical discussion. The ceiling lamps were
hanging low, and the faces of the 22 attendees were aglow with the
sparks of intellectual inquiry: What is pleasure?
</P>
<P>
   ``Pleasure is a survival mechanism,'' said Mike Mendlovitz, 40,
a pizza-deliveryman, jiggling his mountain-boot-shod feet as he
reflected on the suicide of a friend who had lost his sense of
pleasure in life. A moment earlier, Dan Brenahan, 60, a network
analyst clad in a business suit, had hypothesized that pleasure
could be simulated just as easily as he had once suppressed pain
when he was badly injured as a child.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the cafe-philo, or philosophy cafe, a lay person's
forum for philosophical discussion that has sprouted up across
America in the last two years Boulder, Colo.; Chicago; Dallas; Los
Angeles; Minneapolis; New York; Philadelphia; San Francisco and
Washington. In most places, the cafe-philo was founded by
individual philosophers _ academic or amateur _ inspired by Marc
Sautet, a late Nietzsche philosopher, who launched the first cafe
in France in 1992. Although some groups meet in restaurants, the
typical venue in the U.S. for the cafe-philo is, no surprise, a
cafe, in observance of the French practice.
</P>
<P>
   The cafe-philo in Montclair was formed in September 1996 by
Chris Phillips, a former philosophy teacher whose mission is to
bring philosophy to everyone, from high school students to prison
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Philosophy for so many decades has been confined to the
academia,'' said Phillips, 39, who now lives in San Francisco and
is spreading the seeds there. He calls the cafe-philo ``a church
service for heretics,'' yet observes that ``people need philosophy
like they need air and food and water.'' The Montclair cafe has
been going strong even in his absence.
</P>
<P>
   At every gathering, a moderator, usually the cafe's founder,
begins by posing an open-ended question to the handful of regulars,
as well as passers-by. In trying to respond to the question, the
cafe participants take turns pouring out their thoughts, and
sometimes their innermost feelings. Most speakers draw from
personal examples to illustrate their arguments, and a few
occasionally paraphrase words of notable writers and philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who can bridge the gap between day-to-day life and
philosophical thoughts will enjoy the cafe-philo,'' said Peggy
Willens, 37, a management consultant who had attended a cafe-philo
in Minneapolis where the topic was ``What should you do if your
friend is engaged in activities that are just plain wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   On a Thursday night at Le Poeme, a candlelit bistro in
Manhattan, moderator Bernard Roy, 54, a native of France and a
Baruch College philosophy professor, perched on a high stool with
chin in hand and listened attentively as one middle-aged man used a
boy-gets-girl story to underscore the fine line between selfishness
and unselfishness. Others cited author Ayn Rand's theories on ``the
virtues of selfishness.'' Roy's smiling, sparkling big eyes, topped
by silvery eyebrows, manifested a grandpa's patience in the group's
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a starvation for intellectual activities,'' Roy said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Edison, 33, a filmmaker, agreed. He happened to walk into
Le Poeme that night and enjoyed the cafe-philo so much that he said
he would start attending regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public dialogue has descended quite a bit over the past
year,'' Edison said. ``Any effort to rekindle that interest is
great.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even though cafes-philo may be a creation of the late 90's,
cultural critics believe the idea behind them is not new. Alan
Olson, a professor of religion and philosophy at Boston University
and executive director of the Twentieth Century World Congress of
Philosophy, points to the Beat Generation's coffeehouses and the
Great Books clubs of the 60's as the progenitors of cafes-philo.
All these cultural institutions were founded on the idea of
engaging the public in philosophical discourse, he said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The cafe satisfies ``the longing for the feeling that we had: We
count,'' said Sam Cresbi, who came of age in the 60's. She attended
the cafe-philo in Washington a few years ago and, she said, ``it
knocked my socks off'' _ so much so that she is now running her own
in Shepherdstown, W. Va., where she currently lives.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``In this period of prosperity and relative peace,'' Olson
added, ``people have the luxury of thinking about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, Roy sees the emergence of cafes-philo in the
United States and other parts of the world, including England,
Israel and Hong Kong, as a direct outcome of the movement by some
contemporary philosophers to popularize philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there is something special about the 90's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're immersed in a self-conscious era,'' said Robert
Thompson, a keen observer of popular culture and director of Center
for Study of Popular TV at Syracuse University. ``So much of the
American life is subject to hyper-analysis.'' Overwhelmed by an
avalanche of media attention, Americans today, Thompson said, are
more used to analyzing issues.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stephanie Roth-Nelson, 49, a Boulder, Colo.-based
technical writer and cafe-goer, laments, ``With friends and family,
the discussion seems superficial. Everybody is so caught up with
the mundane day-to-day life.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, the cafe-goers also come to search for something more
universal. Jeremy Iggers, 47, who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy and
started the cafe in Minneapolis, thinks most participants miss
``the connection to other people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with the anonymity of modern life,''
said Iggers, a reporter for the Minneapolis Star Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   That may be why Sat Bhattacharya, 28, keeps coming back, despite
his hectic schedule as a Ph.D. candidate and instructor at Cornell
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less a sense of community in America,'' said
Bhattacharya, a native of India. ``Americans are more like
individuals.'' An avid attendee since last November, two months
after Roy founded his cafe-philo in Manhattan, Bhattacharya enjoys
both the company and the conversation of the diverse group at Le
Poeme.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the multitude of philosophies that makes life
interesting,'' Bhattacharya said.

   NAIL ART _ Some people would call them the 10 greatest
masterpieces in New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. They are
only about two and a half inches long, don't hang on the wall or
stand on pedestals, and are not rendered in marble or painted on
canvas. Their asking price is a modest $18 to $25. These works of
art are on the tips of 20-year-old Desiree Henry's fingers.

<P>
   NEW ITALIAN THEATER _ In America, Italian culture has been far
too often associated with ignorance and buffoonery, not to mention
myriad ``Godfather'' imitations; a fact not lost on Vittorio
Capotorto. He blames a malnourished Italian-American culture on an
initially poor, strictly blue-collar work ethic. He wants to fill
the void with his vision of theater.
</P>
<P>
   ORGAN TRANSPLANTS _ The fate of the 50,000 Americans awaiting
organ transplants, may hinge on a new federal policy that would
change the way organs are allocated. Right now, organs are
distributed regionally _ meaning that a heart from a donor in, say,
New Jersey, would go to someone in that state even if there were a
patient in New York who needed it more. The result is a large
disparity in waiting times between regions, since some areas have
fewer donors than others. The new guidelines would change that, but
not everyone thinks that is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   SURVEILLANCE _ In recent years, the number of surveillance
cameras in Manhattan has increased dramatically, and New Yorkers
appear to have scant awareness of their presence. Places that used
to seem like private settings _ elevators, empty street corners or
quiet parks _ have become public thanks to monitoring by cameras.

LITERATE ROMANCE: GETTING HITCHED IN THE AISLES

<P>
   When Michele Savage thinks about her wedding day, the children's
book ``Miss Spider Gets Married'' comes to mind. Ann Rice's
``Memnoch the Devil'' also rings clear in her memory. Both were on
display near the makeshift altar in the Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore in
Columbus, Ohio, where she and her beau, Steven, were married.
</P>
<P>
   And it was only fitting that the couple had their wedding in the
store. After all, that is where Steven proposed, dramatically
interrupting a meeting of Michele's romance book club to announce
that he wanted to marry her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were married between mystery and gay studies, which was
oddly appropriate,'' Savage said. The best man was gay.
</P>
<P>
   The Savages' storybook wedding is the ultimate example of how
the megabookstores have successfully turned a little Camus, coffee
and conversation into a low-key, literate dating scene. Borders
Books &AMP; Music now solicits customers not only with comfortable
sofas and cappuccino, but encourages singles to socialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly it's a thriving singles scene,'' said Daryl Mattson,
community relations coordinator for the sprawling Borders store at
the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's sort of a cruising sensibility going on, with people
looking up and down'' perusing books and magazines, said David
Jetton, describing the scene at Barnes &AMP; Noble at 82nd Street and
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Among the strategies bookstore browsers employ _ choosing
reading material that they hope will attract like-minded partners
or spending time in a favorite specialty section.
</P>
<P>
   Mattson recently organized a singles' reading soiree titled
``Recruiting Love'' which attracted about two dozen singles from
the Wall Street community. A few people met and, true to form for
the clientele, exchanged business cards, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's the relaxing atmosphere of a bookstore that makes people
feel comfortable, Mattson said. ``People feel weird going to a bar
alone, or going to a movie alone, but you can walk into a bookstore
alone and pretend you're just shopping, or just sit there alone and
no one's going to pass judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``First it was discos, then it was coffee bars, and now
bookstores,'' said Dierdre Kaduk, an actress who regularly visits
the Barnes &AMP; Noble bookstore and cafe at 82nd Street. While she has
yet to find Mr. Right, she often socializes with friends in the
store.
</P>
<P>
   Jetton first struck up a conversation about Tennessee Williams
and other gay playwrights with his partner, Dennis Schulz, last May
in Gryphon, a small bookstore on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, they met again by chance in the Barnes &AMP; Noble
across the street. ``You can scan the entire floor'' from atop the
escalator, Jetton said. ``He spotted me and came to me.'' The two
went out for dinner that same night.
</P>
<P>
   For the bookstores, setting up an atmosphere conducive to casual
conversation has worked well as a sales strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more comfort you give someone in a store, chances are they
will stay longer,'' said Helena Aalto, communications director for
the Chapters megabookstore chain in Canada. The average browsing
time in a comfortable megastore is ``a little short of one hour,''
compared to about 15 minutes in the more traditional mall stores
the chain owns, she said. More browsing time seems to yield more
books sold per customer, she added.
</P>
<P>
   But the sit-down-and-make-yourself-at-home approach to
bookselling can also produce some unexpected results. Bruce
Deachman, a freelance writer looking for an offbeat feature, tried
last year to see what it would take to get thrown out of the
Chapters in Ottawa. After spending nearly three weeks in the
aisles, trying everything from rolling coins at a wooden desk to
noisily fixing his broken telephone with a screwdriver, he was
finally asked to leave for practicing his golf putt in the sports
section.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 19 days there, I didn't see many people buying stuff,''
Deachman said. But he said he did see a lot of free reading and
socializing.
</P>
<P>
   A Burlington, Ontario, couple, now married, ``just started up a
conversation'' one day in Chapters, recalled Kelly Kuus, store
manager. She said they returned within a year to have their wedding
photos taken _ in the romance section, of course.
</P>
<P>
   And customers are not the only ones meeting in bookstores. Beth
Reynolds, an editor in Ann Arbor, Mich., for Borders' Web site, met
her husband in 1994 while they were both clerks at a Borders store
in Pittsburgh. They married two years later. ``I originally thought
of working there because, of course, I would meet someone,''
Reynolds said.
</P>
<P>
   For the Savages, a bookstore wedding seemed inevitable, if
offbeat. But in spite of her happy ending, Michele Savage was blase
about encouraging romantic hopefuls who sip lattes and pretend to
peruse magazines while scanning the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go to a bookstore to read, and to buy books,'' Savage said.
``And if you happen to meet somebody, well _ that would be a happy
accident.''

FOCUSING ON SELF-ESTEEM: PHOTO SHOOTS FOR BODY IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

 By KIM K. DIXON  
 c.1999 Columbia News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the first 25 years of her life, Ana battled with
the mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting dressed in the morning was an exercise in
self-torture,'' said the 27-year-old Cuban-American actress, who
asked that her last name not be used.
</P>
<P>
   Despite constant, and successful, dieting, Ana loathed every
nook, cranny and dimple on her body. She had been on Broadway and
in TV commercials but could not stomach looking at herself in any
of her roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was paralyzed. ... I couldn't have a conversation with
people without my body being in the background, right here in the
back of my head'' getting in the way of a normal life, Ana said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City photographer Ellen Turk has a radical reply to
this distinctly female predicament. Three years ago, Turk began
persuading women who typically cringe at the sight of themselves in
a passing mirror to confront their demons head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Clients willingly pose for a photo session in either their home
or Turk's in Brooklyn. The photos are artsy black-and-white stills,
culminating in nudes if requested. One is a woman lying on a bed,
askew and disheveled, on her stomach viewed from above. Another is
simply a profile shot of a woman peering in a bathroom mirror.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get at what's special, and everyone's got something
special,'' said Turk, a 50-ish woman with a pixie buzz haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pictures they like capture something which contradicts the
idea they're not living up to some ideal of beauty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Women for whom the mirror yields such power may be biologically
doomed to fail. A 1992 study in the International Journal of Eating
Disorders found that a woman's perceived ideal body weight was 13
to 19 percent lower than recommended by health experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety five percent of women can't achieve their ideal,'' said
Terry Poulton, author of ``Fat Chicks: How the Diet Industry Makes
Women Hate Their Bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Turk's solution is not cheap, at $450 a shot, which Turk said is
necessary to pay for the film, processing, printing, phone calls
and one photo session, which lasts about three hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a half an hour or so of talking and getting comfortable,
I shoot a few rolls of film,'' Turk said. ``And I've already spent
time talking to the woman, learning her story.''
</P>
<P>
   Her clients run the gamut from those with general body hate to
those with full-fledged eating disorders. Many have suffered
serious psychological trauma. Ana was sexually abused as a child
and had disordered patterns of eating for as long as she can
remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this problem with my body image, so I thought what
better way to deal with it than to display it like a piece of
meat?'' said Ana, who admitted a feeling of horror at the first
sight of herself on Turk's film.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw the pictures, I went crazy,'' Ana said. ``But
it was like a road accident, I couldn't stop looking and then
finally I got used to seeing what I thought was ugly. I got
desensitized to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Turk client, a New York City chiropractor, had a similar
reaction after her photo session with Turk last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a reprogramming of all the negative tapes in my
head,'' said the 42-year-old, who has despised her body since being
mocked as a child for her less-than-ideal size.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was Ellen,'' the chiropractor said. ``She makes you
feel very comfortable and at ease.''
</P>
<P>
   But skeptical body-image and eating-disorder experts yell
caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This method could be very dangerous by just scratching at the
surface,'' said Gerri DiBenedetto, a New York therapist who treats
eating disorders ranging from compulsive overeating to anorexia.
</P>
<P>
   She doubts that a one-time photo session with Turk can be a
cure-all for the deeply rooted eating and body-image disorders.
DiBenedetto and other experts argue that while the idea might seem
promising, women see themselves all the time and yet the
distortions persist.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she professes to help people with body-image problems,
she's trying to be a therapist, and then trying to cover herself by
saying, 'I advise people to get therapy,' '' said Dr. Denise
Heebink, a psychiatrist at New York Hospital's Eating Disorder
Program.
</P>
<P>
   Although Turk has no degree in psychiatry or therapy, she does
have a master's in special education. She also works with children,
using positive light.
</P>
<P>
   Turk does not profess to be a substitute for traditional
therapy, and admits her method is no science.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some, the need for self-perfection is so strong that I
have to screw up, it's a no win,'' she said. ``I can only do what I
can do.''

BAY STATE MOVES PENSION FUNDS TO MELLON BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For the first time since Massachusetts created its
Pension Reserves Investment Trust for state employees 16 years ago,
State Street Corp. will no longer act as the fund's custodian.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Shannon O'Brien has appointed Pittsburgh-based
Mellon Bank to serve as custodian of the $25 billion fund.
O'Brien's decision was approved Tuesday by the state's Pension
Reserves Investment Management board, which oversees the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Henderson, executive director of the PRIM board, said
Mellon was the strongest candidate in a field that also included
State Street, New York's Citibank, and Chicago's Northern Trust Co.
</P>
<P>
   Mellon entered the low bid, offering to oversee administration
of the fund for a $1.1 million annual fee, compared to State
Street's bid of $2.4 million, Henderson said. ``We found Mellon's
fee to be extremely competitive, but at the same time credible,''
he said. ``They can deliver very high quality services to us at
that level, without compromising quality.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Henderson said Mellon's Executive Workbench
computer network will make it easier for the PRIM staff to keep
tabs electronically on the trust's performance. ``We think that
product is probably a little bit ahead of the competition right
now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The PRIM fund was established in 1983 to invest the pension
money of the Massachusetts State Employees' and Teachers'
Retirement systems, and other state and local government employees
in Massachusetts. State Street has served as custodian of the fund
since its inception. The bank had held onto the business through
four previous reviews by the PRIM board, which seeks new bids for
the custodianship every three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely proud of the work we did on behalf of PRIM
for the past 15 years,'' State Street said in a statement issued
after the decision was announced. ``We wish Mellon the best of
luck.
</P>
<P>
   The PRIM board Tuesday also selected Blackrock Financial
Management Inc. of New York to manage its $1.3 billion portfolio of
fixed-income investments. The board also approved changes in its
asset allocation plan that will increase its investment in real
estate from 4 percent to 6 percent of the fund, and reduce its
stock investments from 47 percent to 45 percent.

 &HT;    Retirement vehicles contain about 30% of stocks' value
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ordinary Americans, saving slowly and diligently for
their retirement years, helped push the Dow to 10,000 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans now hold close to $1.4
trillion worth of stocks, or a 10th of the total value of U.S.
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the stock investments in individual retirement
accounts and traditional pension plans, and the total shoots to an
estimated 30 percent of the total market value.
</P>
<P>
   That concentration means the decisions of millions of individual
investors make a difference in the overall demand for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As demand increases, so do prices.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have been deciding to buy more stocks. Studies of
401(k) plans _ the most common retirement savings plan _ show that
a growing percentage of those investments is in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The 401(k) plans are popular with individuals because income
taxes are deferred on the money in them and because more Americans
are in their mid-career and later years, when they begin to pay
attention to retirement needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, 401(k)s have had a significant impact,'' argued
Catherine S. McBreen. She is the chief retirement consultant for
the Spectrem Group, a respected data-gathering and consulting
company. ``It is more of a longer-term impact, but it's not what's
making the market go up and down day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the growth in total retirement plan holdings has come
from rising stock prices. The total might have grown faster, except
for the money that retirees have withdrawn from their accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Benna, the Pennsylvania consultant known as the father of
the 401(k), believes the plans have had at least a modest impact on
the rising market. ``The 401(k)s are not the sole factor,'' he
cautioned. ``There's too much money, far beyond what's coming from
401(k)s. My suspicion is that there still must be substantial
volumes of foreign money coming into the market.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reliable habits of 401(k) investors have been a comfort
to the market. ``They have helped, simply because there is that
predictable, constant flow,'' Benna said. ``I don't know whether it
(retirement saving) is a big factor or just another factor. The
U.S. market remains a mystery to everybody.''

   FORECASTS-MARKETPLACE (New York) _ The strong performance of the
economy so far this year has pushed the earnings forecasts of many
strategists higher. For example, Bruce Steinberg, chief economist
at Merrill Lynch, turned his earnings growth prediction on its
head, flipping to an increase of 3.5 percent from a decline of 5
percent. But his colleague, Richard Bernstein, says the direction
of earnings is down, not up. Disagreements within one shop are not
unusual, but this difference in direction does show how confusing
the earnings outlook might be for investors _ and how quickly it
can change. By Jonathan Fuerbringer.

INFLATION OPTIMISM HELPS TO PUSH 30-YEAR YIELD LOWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond yields dropped to their lowest point in three
weeks Tuesday, aided by optimism that inflation will not accelerate
and, to a lesser extent, by comments by Alan Greenspan, the Federal
Reserve chairman, suggesting that the central bank will not raise
short-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 22/32, to 96 23/32.
The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction of the
price, fell to 5.47 percent, from 5.52 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Asset Management,
expects that Fed policy-makers will not change interest rates when
they meet March 30. ``The economy's impressive strength will
prevent the Fed from easing,'' he said, ``while the auspicious
inflation environment and global financial fragility argue strongly
against any policy tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine also believes that bond yields will hover around 5.5
percent for a while as fears of a Fed tightening dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports Tuesday pointed to solid economic advances.
Housing starts declined just six-tenths of 1 percent in February,
to an annual rate of roughly 1.8 million units, after setting a
12-year high in January. The levels of both housing starts and
building permits in the first quarter are on track to significantly
exceed those of the fourth quarter, Fine noted. A tapering of house
construction is invariably a prelude to a slowdown in economic
activity, so the robust performance of starts and building permits
suggested continued momentum in the months ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial production rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month
and manufacturing output also rose two-tenths of 1 percent _ its
fifth consecutive monthly advance.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan spoke to the Independent Bankers Association of
America meeting in San Francisco, where his remarks seemed to focus
more on downside risks, providing only a marginal lift to the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks also bolstered bonds as the Dow Jones industrial average
surpassed 10,000 points for the first time in intraday trading; it
closed lower, though, at 9,930.47. Traders speculated that some
investors switched their allocations from stocks to bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Gains could be limited in the days ahead, though, as several
corporate debt issues are expected to be priced. Fannie Mae, among
other borrowers, plans to sell as much as $13 billion of debt, and
AT&AMP;T Corp. expects to sell $5 billion to $6 billion in bonds.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico: magazine article. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet a delightful man named Angel Villasenor appears in none of
the reports. He wears a dirty old fedora over long gray hair pulled
into a ponytail, and for 30 years has guided tourists through the
white adobe Mision de Guadalupe in the heart of downtown. The
chapel was first built by Franciscan missionaries in the 1500s.
Villasenor's eyes still sparkle, his voice is still tinged with
reverence as he points to the ceiling of the mission, to the ornate
mahogany beams carved by the Indians hundreds of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling city, now estimated at 2 million residents,
eventually grew up around the mission, which is now adjoined by a
newer, larger cathedral built of red stone. But the church plaza
remains a hub of Juarez life, a place of Old World energy that
bustles from midday well into the evening. Farmers in straw hats,
happy schoolgirls in their uniforms, young lovers, clerks and
office workers, mothers with their children hurry back and forth
across the grassy plaza. A few miles east, there are luxurious
hotels and department stores and fine restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   American film legend Steve McQueen died here in 1980 while
seeking alternative treatments for cancer. Elizabeth Taylor has
come to Juarez to avail herself of quick and cheap divorces.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the international bridge leading back to El Paso, a
succession of sad-eyed Indian children, some of them barely more
than toddlers, pleads for pesos from passing motorists. The slums
sprawl. Street gangs flourish. Narcotraficantes, celebrated in
popular music, are role models for a generation of Mexico's young.
Scores of families grieve for slain daughters and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   To visit Juarez is to grapple with a disorienting combination of
charm and heartbreak, good and evil, all in great measure.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't know them would assume from appearances that the
two are related. By now, young Guillermina Gonzalez doesn't need to
knock when she enters the house of Irma Perez Franco, doesn't ask
when she grabs a soft drink from Irma's refrigerator. At 22,
Guillermina is about the same age as Irma's dead daughter, one
person who can make the older, grief-stricken woman smile.
</P>
<P>
   Yet until just last year, they lived in very different worlds.
Irma raised her daughter, Olga, in a small, blue stucco house a few
blocks from the church plaza, cooking and selling hamburgers at
night on the sidewalk of the graffiti-scarred neighborhood.
Guillermina grew up a long bus ride south, in the state of Durango,
moving to Juarez with her family only two years ago when the
forestry jobs finally played out and the agricultural economy
continued to crumble.
</P>
<P>
   Her father built their shack on a hill in the wretched colonia
called Lomas de Poleo on the west side of Juarez, and the family
went to work in the maquiladoras. Then Sagrario was killed, and
almost immediately, Guillermina and her family were absorbed into a
growing community of grief.
</P>
<P>
   Irma Perez Franco was long a member by then. In 1995, the tennis
shoes of her 20-year-old daughter, Olga, were found in the desert
with a young woman's skeletal remains. Eight other bodies turned up
in the area about the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The growing cluster of grieving relatives came to call
themselves Voces sin Eco (Voices Without Echo). Each of them, it
seemed, had a story of horror, heartbreak and frustration _ of
police incompetence, or insensitivity, or indifference.
Investigators seemed inclined to blame the victims for their own
deaths, or the victims' families, the relatives said. So every
Monday they gathered at police headquarters at the southern edge of
the city, sitting in the lobby in quiet demonstration beneath large
photographs of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Many gather more informally almost every day. On a sunny winter
afternoon a few weeks ago, Guillermina and Irma sat together in the
parlor of Irma's home, Guillermina listening respectfully while her
older friend spoke of Olga. A small crucifix hung over the door.
The face of Olga dominated the whitewashed walls _ the smiling girl
in her white dress for first communion; Olga in cap and gown for
her high school graduation _ just as Sagrario's face lined the
walls of the Gonzalez dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   Olga had disappeared from a political rally on Aug. 10, 1995,
only 11 days before she was to start college classes at a
prestigious local university. A month later, Irma saw her
daughter's blouse and tennis shoes at the city morgue but could not
bring herself to look at the bag of bones that police said were
Olga's remains.
</P>
<P>
   More than three years later, Irma's eyes remain deadened by
grief, her face sagging with sadness. In her parlor that day, she
spoke just above a whisper. Then, as Irma talked of Olga,
Guillermina's worried parents, Jesus and Paula, suddenly appeared
at the front door. Paula greeted Irma, hugged her daughter, and
briefly scolded Guillermina for not saying where she would spend
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival a few minutes later of a fifth person, Bertha
Marquez, seemed to brighten them all. She is a cheerful, vibrant
woman with short dark hair and a luminous smile. Bertha's joking
caused even Irma to giggle while the five of them posed for a group
photograph.

<P>
   But a similarly grim truth explained Bertha's presence at the
impromptu gathering, explained her connection to Irma and the
Gonzalez family. On May 8, 1995, her 15-year-old daughter, Adriana,
disappeared while shopping for shoes downtown. The girl's body was
found six months later, in the same garbage-strewn expanse of
desert where Olga Franco's tennis shoes turned up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like everybody else, I try to believe what I've been told,''
Bertha says, speaking of her dealings with police, who have not
made an arrest in the case. Her smile is gone, at least for the
moment. ``But it's very difficult to accept when you leave your
daughter alive somewhere, and they give you back just bones.''
</P>
<P>
   The army of workers moves three times a day, with every shift
change at the maquiladoras, a Spanish word that means twin plants.
The factories are the centerpiece of a 30-year-old agreement
between the United States and Mexico: American companies can avail
themselves of inexpensive Mexican labor without paying Mexican
tariffs on their goods.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300 maquiladoras operate in Juarez now, employing
230,000 people, a large percentage of them teen-age girls and boys.
Every eight hours, tens of thousands of workers stream from the
blocky, sprawling plants owned by such American business titans as
Johnson and Johnson, Ford Motor Co., United Technologies and
General Electric, onto hundreds of white buses provided by the
factories. The buses then clog the thoroughfares, raise clouds of
dust in the colonias, rumble past the plaza downtown.
</P>
<P>
   A primary bus stop downtown is a few blocks from the mission.
Some men and older women step down onto the street from the white
buses. But hundreds of those who descend are waiflike teen-age
girls, wearing bright red lipstick and maquiladora smocks. They
have come in the past few months from farms and villages in every
state in Mexico, some from as far away as Oaxaca or Chiapas in the
far south.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are on the street in Mexico's seventh-largest city,
often alone and sometimes late at night. To catch the next bus to
their colonias, they routinely must walk past the cantinas and
discos and howling young men. Some of the girls stop in the
nightclubs to drink and dance. Most of the sexual homicide victims,
Juarez journalists say, are maquiladora girls.
</P>
<P>
   But for many of the victims, the tragedy of their lives began
long before their horrid deaths. Instead, from the moment of birth,
they were victims of the dire alchemy that is the life of Mexico's
poor.
</P>
<P>
   That alchemy begins, most observers agree, with a century of
national government that has been both corrupt and indifferent to
the plight of its masses. The oil crash of the 1980s shattered
Mexico's already fragile economy, forcing the country heavily into
debt. Money that might have been used for education and social
services at home was paid out by the millions to lending nations,
the United States prominent among them. The peso was devalued in
1994, making Mexico's basic currency almost worthless. Then, more
than ever before, desperate Mexicans turned their attention north.
</P>
<P>
   Between 600 and 1,000 people arrive in Juarez every day,
refugees drawn to the U.S.-Mexico border that looms before the
stricken nation like a mirage. Poor Mexicans are tantalized by
stories of relatives in the United States, of running water, and
flush toilets, and electricity, and birthday parties at McDonald's
for their children. But the realities that greet them at the border
are chain-link fences 10 feet high, barbed wire, and the light
green sports utility vehicles of the U.S. Border Patrol, waiting on
the American side every few hundred yards.
</P>
<P>
   The maquiladoras are part of the mirage, too, but less obviously
so. The plants, which manufacture everything from bluejeans to
cruise controls to television sets, seem insatiable in their demand
for workers. Driving through the industrial parks, placards at one
factory after another practically beg for help.
</P>
<P>
   The factories are clean, well-lit places. Workers can shower
there. There is air-conditioning in the summer and heat in the
winter. There's green grass outside, a rarity in Juarez, and picnic
areas, and soccer fields for games after work. In addition to their
salaries, maquiladora workers receive two good meals every day and
some health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   But for housing, the newcomers must turn to the slums and throw
up cardboard shacks that spill down the hills on the outskirts of
town, or spread through the valleys like a rash. Running water is
an unthinkable luxury. Diets consist mostly of beans and tortillas.
Human excrement washes into the streets with every hard rain. In
most slums, the schools have room for a fraction of the children
who play together each day in the dusty streets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the masses continue to pour in from the south, drawn by the
mirage, like drips of gasoline into an already combustible mix. The
army of waiflike newcomers in red lipstick and maquiladora smocks
wanders unknowingly into places where hardened police officers say
they would never go. Scores of them have paid with their lives. For
thousands of others in Juarez, the tragedy unfolds more slowly, day
by day.

CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico: day by day. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The week after the slaying of the latest young victim, Irma
Lovano, was a succession of 15-hour days, and the faces of Suly
Ponce and Manuel Esparza were puffy from lack of sleep. Ponce heads
a special state unit investigating the slayings of Juarez women.
Esparza is her chief lieutenant. With every new body that turns up,
public pressure to solve the crimes ratchets up several more
notches, pressure that comes from as far away as the national
government in Mexico City. The small, windowless cluster of offices
where the investigators work feels like a bunker.
</P>
<P>
   But that recent morning, the weariness of the two lead
investigators seemed to belie the most common criticism leveled by
Juarez feminists and victims' families: that the police don't care.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we have a new case,'' Ponce says, ``a lot of us feel like
crying.''
</P>
<P>
   Former FBI agent Robert K. Ressler has made two consulting trips
to Juarez in the past two years at the request of the Mexican
investigators. Ressler says he was surprised at the commitment he
found there.
</P>
<P>
   ``So in other words, it wasn't just these guys in big hats,
taking siestas,'' says Ressler, who left the FBI's behavioral
sciences unit in 1990. ``They had a pretty good operation and
pretty good people in the top spots. What the women's groups are
saying is that these macho guys didn't give a damn about the
victims. I disagree with that.''
</P>
<P>
   What investigators undoubtedly lack, if not commitment, is
experience. Ponce, a prosecutor with the state attorney general's
office, is only 35. She has been in her job with homicide for five
months. Esparza is an articulate lawyer who moves freely between
Spanish and barely-accented English. But he is only 28.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the investigation has amounted to on-the-job training,
a crash course in methods of confronting the sort of psychopaths
who routinely baffle the most seasoned American detectives. Only
last year, Ressler helped Mexican investigators computerize their
evidence and taught intensive, weeklong investigative seminars. The
recent arrival of the FBI profilers warranted huge headlines in the
Juarez press.
</P>
<P>
   For many here it seems too little, too late. Yet Ponce and her
staff plow on, remaining surprisingly accessible to the media,
ushering a procession of American reporters into their bunker. They
plead for patience, insist they are not in over their heads, that
they are pursuing strong leads in several of the cases. With the
FBI's help, Ponce says, investigators expect to soon know better
whether another serial killer is at work, or whether Juarez women
are being brutalized by a series of copycats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what it will take or how long it will take,''
Ponce says gesturing, her face flushing with emotion as she talks.
``But if we have to work seven days a week, 24 hours a day, we will
do it. We must make Juarez a safe place. That's our goal, to make
Juarez a safe place.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her good intentions, in the social cauldron that is
Juarez, it seems a task well beyond her.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   It is a tradition among the workers to have their photographs
taken in front of their maquiladoras. Thus the largest of
Sagrario's portraits shows her standing in front of her
American-owned factory, a trace of a smile across her long face.
The picture, framed and hung on a wall in the tiny parlor of her
home, loomed over her family as they gathered to speak of her one
night last month.
</P>
<P>
   Sagrario was a devout girl who worked with a Catholic agency to
organize the poor. She and Guillermina wore each other's clothes.
Sagrario dreamed of studying computers and learning to speak
English like her boyfriend. Then the tempting riches of places like
El Paso might be more accessible. She and her family were reminded
of the prosperous world every night _ the lights of the American
city spread out below them like a blanket of white Christmas
lights.
</P>
<P>
   But Sagrario would never see the promised land. Almost a year
after her death, her mother, Paula, can speak of her daughter only
haltingly. Every few weeks comes another terrible reminder of
Sagrario's death, another body, another young woman raped and
killed and dumped in the desert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night was a very bad night because I learned of the last
one,'' Paula says, crowded onto a sofa with three of her surviving
children beneath Sagrario's maquiladora portrait. ``The family
tries to hide that fact from their mother, but a lady told me. And
it comes alive again.''
</P>
<P>
   Votive candles flickered by the Virgin in the dimly lit room
that had grown cold from the lack of heat. Sounds of dogs barking
came from outside, where a nearly full moon hung over the mountains
on a crisp winter night. It was late, but white buses still rumbled
past cardboard shacks, carrying armies of workers, raising thick
clouds of dust.

FORBES USES INTERNET TO FORMALLY ENTER RACE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.H., Iowa) (With FORBES-POLITICS-BIO) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Renouncing the traditional brass bands and
patriotic bunting, Steve Forbes, the multimillionaire publisher,
Tuesday became the first presidential contender to formally
announce his candidacy on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, in his second try for the Republican presidential
nomination, cast himself as unconventional and future-oriented,
telling viewers who clicked on his sleek yet unadorned Web page,
``You and I are entering the information age _ and the Washington
politicians are stuck in the Stone Age.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he has barely broken stride since his defeat in 1996,
Forbes used his remarks Tuesday to try to reshape his image as a
candidate with bucketfuls of money and a lackluster speaking style
whose trademark is a flat tax. While he still champions the tax, he
did not dwell on it Tuesday. Instead, he devoted his tightly
written speech to his newly burnished credentials as an outspoken
backer of religious conservatives and a foe of abortion _ as well
as his concerns about the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' Forbes said, ``the central questions of the year 2000
campaign clearly are these: Do you trust the establishment
politicians to protect your economic security and give you more
freedom and more control over your life? Do you trust them to
defend your values and protect the first and most important freedom
of every child _ the freedom to be born? &UR; '' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you trust them to confront the atrocities in China, end
Saddam Hussein's reign of terror and deploy a real missile defense
system to protect our children?'' he continued. And, eagerly
lambasting the Democrats, Forbes added, ``Do you trust other
politicians to clean out the corruption and sleaze of the
Clinton-Gore administration?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his relentless campaign schedule, Forbes, 51, has thus
far languished in the shadows of two better-known prospects: Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas and Elizabeth Dole. As they did four years
ago, many Republicans question whether a bland business executive
who has never been elected to anything can capture the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, particularly after his performance in 1996 _ when he
lavished more than $35 million of his fortune on his campaign _ no
one doubts Forbes' staying power in the primary season. And no one
doubts his potential to shape the dialogue significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Although Forbes was a fleeting sensation in 1996, registering
high in the polls when he first unleashed his television blitz, he
placed fourth in the pivotal Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary.
But his hard-hitting advertisements _ opponents called them
mean-spirited _ came close to ravaging the candidacy of former Sen.
Bob Dole, who ultimately became the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last time, Forbes plans to forgo federal spending
limits and dig deep into his family fortune to finance most of his
campaign. Bush is the only other contender who is thinking about
eschewing spending limits. So even if the other candidates' money
dries up, Forbes can run television advertisements until the bitter
end. And his more than ample resources have helped him lure some of
the party's most skilled workers, including Steve Grubbs and Nancy
Streck, both Iowa operatives who had been courted aggressively by
other campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Forbes disputed that he was drawing staff
members more because of his bankroll than the appeal of his
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We compensate people according to responsibility and
ability,'' he said. ``And being of Scottish descent, I'm not going
to spend a penny more than necessary. The key is having the message
and getting it out to the voters. But money alone won't win it for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he believes he is better positioned than he was in
1996 because then he did not enter the race until late 1995. ``We
did not have the opportunities, except very, very late to set up
the grass-roots organizations in early states,'' he said. ``People
are going to have a better feel of what we're proposing than in the
short period of '95 and '96.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has refashioned himself this time. The most striking
change is that he has assiduously courted social conservatives and
emphasized abortion and other social issues that he neglected four
years ago. At the very least, the changed emphasis has neutralized
many religious conservatives who opposed him in 1996. He has also
stressed other issues this time, including allowing workers to
divert part of their Social Security taxes into individual
investment accounts and providing parents with vouchers for private
schools.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Do you know what astounds me?'' Forbes asked in his Internet
remarks. ``More young people believe in UFOs than believe that
they're going to collect Social Security when they retire.''
</P>
<P>
   By launching his ``information-age campaign'' on the Internet,
Forbes sought to add another fresh dimension to his candidacy.
While every major presidential campaign has a Web site, the Forbes
organization is promising bells and whistles, including the beaming
of photographs, live, from the stump with the candidate.
</P>
<P>
   After his nontraditional announcement was posted, Forbes staged
a traditional rally that drew about 50 people on the steps of the
state Capitol in Concord, N.H., where he retreated to his mantra
about a flat tax that would tax all wage income at 17 percent. He
signed a pledge promising not to raise taxes _ and challenged other
candidates to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes' remarks were disrupted by a few hecklers, some wearing
fur coats, who called themselves, ``Billionaires for Forbes.'' But
he tried to turn his fortune into a virtue, telling the crowd,
``I'm the only one who is not beholden to the Washington culture of
special interest lawyers, lobbyists and life-time politicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The message seemed convincing to Ginny Burke, a travel writer
and former state legislator from Bedford, N.H., who traveled to
Concord on this blustery day to show her support. ``I think he's
following common sense,'' she said. ``He doesn't owe anything to
anybody. He doesn't have to try to please the lobbyists to raise
money and I think that, unfortunately, most candidates do.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE OPTIONAL MATERIAL)
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stone, a veteran Republican strategist who is not
affiliated with any campaign, dismissed Forbes' candidacy. ``He's
substantially less relevant than he was four years ago _ protest
and reform-type candidacies tend to do a lot less well in times of
economic prosperity,'' he said. ``Secondly, his chameleon-like
change into a religious right candidate is not very credible. This
is a guy who was pro-choice just a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone said that while Forbes ``can play again the role of
damaging the eventual nominee,'' he will ultimately realize that
``he's throwing good money after bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most Republicans _ and certainly his rivals _ are taking
Forbes' much more seriously than four years ago, when his
declaration of candidacy drew little attention. At the time, Dole,
hardly threatened, welcomed Forbes into the race with a quip, ``I
think it will help the economy.''

 &HT;    Dow reaches history, then drops back

<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average finally topped 10,000 in the
first half hour of trading Tuesday, stayed about a minute and then
dropped back sharply and never challenged again.
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark index of 30 blue chip stocks reached an historic
10,001.78. By day's end, however, it closed 69.53 points below
10,000 and 28.30 points below Monday's all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't stop Prudential Securities analyst Ralph
Acampora from exulting to reporters in a conference call: ``It's
exciting. It's America. We all should get up and sing `God Bless
America.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Acampora said stocks are in the earliest stage of a new bull
that began last October when the 1998 stock market correction
ended, and is being led by high-quality stocks such as those in the
Dow index.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated an earlier forecast that the Dow would reach
11,500 before the end of 1999 ``if the market leadership stays with
quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a dozen Dow stocks closed with gains, the biggest being
Merck &AMP; Co., Boeing, Hewlett-Packard, Chevron and Eastman Kodak.
The big losers included American Express, Caterpillar, J.P. Morgan
and Disney. Coca-Cola and AT&AMP;T were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   The broader market also declined on Tuesday, but the technology
loaded Nasdaq composite index posted a small gain on the strength
of positive news about semiconductor sales.
</P>
<P>
   None of the day's activities changed the conviction of traders
and analysts that the Dow will close above 10,000, and probably
this week.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, mutual fund and other money managers are engaged
in end-of-quarter ``window dressing,'' where they buy winning
stocks to be fully invested with their clients' money,
Interstate/Johnson Lane analyst Ricky Harrington said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Friday is a ``triple witching'' session, when the
expiration of futures, index options and individual stock options
often adds to trading and market volatility.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the Dow has teased investors before
closing above an important level. It took six years to go from its
first trade above 1,000 to the first close above 1,000, on Nov. 14,
1972.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow crossed 3,000 several times in July 1990 but did not
close above 3,000 until April 17, 1991, and in 1994, it traded
within shooting distance of 4,000 for about five weeks in February
before closing above 4,000 on Feb. 23, 1995.

U.S. FACTORY IS GETTING WORKERS OUT OF THE SLUMS
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Accompanies JUAREZ-KILLINGS) 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM MADIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico _ Each of the 14 plants General Motors
Chairman Jack Smith toured that day was a bright, bustling place
filled with thousands of focused employees.
</P>
<P>
   But to get from one GM plant to another, the American executive
was forced to drive through the colonias, sprawling communities of
cardboard shacks where ten of thousands of Juarez factory workers
lived in wretched poverty.
</P>
<P>
   On the trip back across the international bridge to El Paso at
the end of the day, Smith turned to Lee Crawford of Delphi
Automotive, the GM division that ran the plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crawford, you've got world-class plants and world-class
people,'' Smith said that day in 1992. ``And I don't want our
people to live in the conditions I saw today.''
</P>
<P>
   For Crawford, Delphi's executive director for Mexico and Central
America, Smith's statement was a mandate. Five years later,
neighborhoods of small but sturdy brick homes had sprouted near the
Delphi facilities _ places with heat, electricity and indoor
plumbing. Schools and stores were built nearby, and plans were made
to construct churches. Today, there are 5,500 such dwellings in
Mexican cities where Delphi runs factories, housing as many as
35,000 of the company's workers and their families. Delphi shares
small mortgage payments with its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest gift they could ever give,'' employee Noel Monreal
told television reporters in 1997, the day he moved his family into
their new home. But such largess is rare in a city where 330
American-owned maquiladoras _ or ``twin factories'' _ now employ
230,000 people. Delphi's is the only factory-sponsored housing
program in the city. For most of the rest of the maquiladora
workers, factory wages amounting to $3 a day are insufficient to
escape the grimmest living conditions. Factory buses deposit
thousands of workers in the colonias, where after a day working
with the world's most sophisticated production equipment, employees
retire to homes with dirt floors and no electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The incongruity gives rise to frequent allegations of
exploitation, criticisms that have intensified in the past several
years. Critics say the factories and their owners are indifferent
to the slayings of young Juarez women. Many, if not most, of the
victims have been maquiladora employees.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials have recently made overtures toward Juarez
feminist groups. Robert Urrea, the top executive for AMAC, the
largest Juarez maquiladora association, has joined the board of
directors of the Juarez rape crisis center that opened last month.
Maquiladora nurses will receive training as rape crisis counselors.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, the factories' most visible response to the
slayings has been plant posters urging employee caution while
coming to and going from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really concerned about these tragedies, but the Chamber
of Commerce in Fort Worth or an association of bankers aren't
responsible for the security of the city,'' said Serbando Sarabia,
executive director of AMAC. ``We contribute a lot with salaries and
benefits in the city. We now have to demand security from our city
and state government.''
</P>
<P>
   The stance has been a public-relations disaster, one serving to
cast employee-friendly companies like Delphi, Juarez's largest
private employer with a work force of 20,000, in an even more
favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most factories, which maintain strict security at their
plants, Delphi executives routinely guide journalists on long
tours. Recent visitors to one plant found an immaculately clean,
well-lit place with Mexican music piped in above the hum of
machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The company lunchroom, where workers receive two free meals each
day, resembled the interior of a new Luby's restaurant. Televisions
playing rock videos hung above the booths.
</P>
<P>
   And thousands of employees go home to the new dwellings built
near their plants, thus avoiding dangerous places in Juarez on the
maquiladora bus routes. Those new homes also have flushing toilets.
For thousands of Juarez factory workers, that remains an
otherworldly luxury.

 &HT;    This boy Tiger's got game
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Once again, Auburn's trapping pressure worked
flawlessly. It was a perfect double team, one Bryant Smith
initiated as he passed through the revolving door. The senior
swingman reached back and stopped the door. On the other side of
the door, Auburn basketball publicist Chuck Gallina did likewise.
And there, trapped like a driveway rat and encased in glass, stood
Scott Pohlman.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time anyone stopped the little guard all day.
</P>
<P>
   ''All they do is pick on me,'' a smiling Pohlman said once Smith
sprung him. ''All they do is pick on me.''
</P>
<P>
   If Auburn teases Pohlman, the Tigers also treasure him. Earlier
on Saturday in Indianapolis, he scored a career-high 28 points to
lead Auburn past Oklahoma State 81-74 and into the NCAA
Tournament's Sweet 16. The performance thrilled an RCA Dome crowd
of 30,318, particularly because Pohlman looks as if he would blend
in nicely with the Indiana state high-school playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the opening tipoff. ''Pohlman ran me to death,''
Oklahoma State point guard Doug Gottlieb said admiringly. The
slight sophomore guard from Roswell hit 11-of-17 shots from the
floor, 2-for-3 on three-pointers, and all four foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   In 32 minutes, Pohlman did not commit a single turnover. Not
even when, with Doc Robinson sitting out nearly five minutes after
getting his fourth personal midway through the second half, he
found himself at the point for one of the few times all season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bigger key to the win was him playing the point,'' Auburn
coach Cliff Ellis said, ''because they had us where they wanted it,
and he responded.''
</P>
<P>
   With the shot clock winding down and Auburn clinging to a 74-72
lead, Pohlman drove across the lane and collided with Oklahoma
State's Brian Montonati. No foul was called, and Pohlman stuck a
pullup jumper with 0:51.9 left. When he made both ends of a 1-and-1
with 13 seconds to play, Auburn was bound for Knoxville, where the
top-seeded Tigers (29-3) will meet Ohio State in Thursday's
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   There, Ohio State will learn that looks can be deceiving.
Robinson already knows what most opponents think when they spy the
6-foot-2, 160-pounder the Tigers call Opie.''Once they come out and
look over at him, they say, 'Look at this guy. He can't play. He
doesn't deserve to be out there. He looks like a ballboy.' But once
he start to hit threes and get in a rhythm, they know.''
</P>
<P>
   They know what opponents have discovered all of Pohlman's life:
He's got game.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's just Scott's mentality,'' Robinson said. ''I can kind
of feel it once he gets into his rhythm, and I look into his eyes
or he gives me that look.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that Pohlman looks like he could still be playing for
the Roswell High Hornets. He's the second-leading scorer, 12.3
points a game, on the winningest team in Alabama state history.
''He's always loved big games,'' said Pohlman's father, Ray, who
bought his son his first basketball goal at the age of 2, one with
a little metal arm below the basket that rang every time Scott
scored a basket. ''He's always liked the pressure of the big games.
That's kind of been his trademark.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at Roswell, where Pohlman led the Hornets to the state
Class AAAA championship in 1997. ''We'd go into games and look like
we were not gonna win,'' Pohlman said, referring to the Hornets'
slight appearances. ``We'd call ourselves the golf team.''
</P>
<P>
   Once on the court, Pohlman displayed a game forged in his
driveway. For Scott's 10th birthday, his father installed a
regulation 10-foot basket mounted on a plexiglass backboard. ''Kind
of unheard of in our neighborhood,'' Pohlman recalled. ''It was
pretty cool.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was a magnet for neighborhood kids and later Scott's
school teammates. They'd play for hours, often until late at night,
when the neighbors or Pohlman's parents would ask him to please
turn off the car radio, or the floodlight, or just stop shooting.
But Pohlman also spent hours alone, referring to a set of cards
that defined his shooting, dribbling and passing drills based on
Pete Maravich instructional tapes his father had bought.
</P>
<P>
   By his senior year at Roswell, Pohlman was prepared to attend
Pepperdine on a scholarship, especially after his official visit.
''Beaches and girls,'' he recalled, smiling. ''It'd be a hard place
to study. Might've joined the surf team.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Auburn called; a scholarship came open when a
junior-college signee was arrested and convicted of assault.
Pohlman changed his mind, preferring to play closer to home and in
the Southeastern Conference. Before he left for Auburn, his father
advised, ''Son, you're going to have to prepare yourself mentally
to come off the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Pohlman remember's his son's reply: ''He said, 'Dad, I'm not
going down to Auburn to sit on the bench.' Then, I knew he was
going to go to Auburn to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Pohlman one game to crack the starting lineup. Now, he
has helped put Auburn two wins from its first Final Four. That
could come Saturday, two days before Ray Pohlman's 55th birthday,
when his boyish-looking son might be the man once again.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way I've been all my life,'' said Pohlman. ''People
underestimate me. But I try not to let size matter. If they do
(underestimate), it's to my advantage.''

 &HT;    Chilling tales of Hitler's `Last Days'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service'
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life isn't beautiful in ``The Last Days,'' a searingly memorable
documentary about the Holocaust in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Steven Spielberg for his Survivors of the Shoah
Visual History Foundation and an Oscar nominee for best
documentary, ``Last Days'' shows us a particularly vile footnote to
Hitler's Final Solution. In the waning months of World War II, when
Der Furher's forces were crumbling, one would think the eradication
of more Jews would be the last thing on his mind. Instead, he
decided to enforce his implacable program of genocide in occupied
Hungary which, until that point, had been somewhat removed from the
appalling events occurring in neighboring countries. As one of the
five survivors who are the film's focus puts it, ``Judaism was our
religion, but we were Hungarians . . . We didn't believe the
stories of the refugees.''
</P>
<P>
   They should have.
</P>
<P>
   In six weeks, 438,000 Hungarian Jews were rounded up and put in
cattle cars. Told they were headed to work in a vineyard, another
survivor remembers secretly packing a bathing suit her father had
given her. Unfortunately, there wasn't much time for sunbathing at
Auschwitz or Buchenwald, which is where most of them landed.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, some of ``Last Days''' stories and footage
are familiar. There are the obscene piles of corpses, the walking
near-dead whose skeletal bodies chilled the Allied liberators who
first discovered them, the appalling horror tales of ovens and
showers. Yet the documentary manages a unique focus by confining
itself to one small country and to five people who made it out
alive _ less, as they all point out, because of any resilience or
resourcefulness on their parts but because they were lucky. Very
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Even ``luck'' can be a risky proposition. In one of the film's
eerier sequences, director James Moll introduces us to kindly Dr.
Hans Munch, a would-be Schindler who claims he used his experiments
at Auschwitz to help prolong lives. Confronted by a survivor who
wonders why her sister, one of Munch's lab rats, died in six months
under his supervision, the doctor looks distinctly less kindly and
decidedly more uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It's moments like this that give Moll's 87-minute documentary
its special identity and impact among the mass of Holocaust
testimony. Tell future generations that 6 million died and they
have a statistic. Tell them about Tom Lantos, the only Holocaust
survivor serving in Congress and unimaginable horror is given a
human face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days'' says a kind of kaddish for the dead Jews of
Hungary. And it does so with respect, with honesty and, oddly
enough, with a kind of undiminished hope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   A documentary on the Holocaust. Directed by James Moll. Rated
PG-13 for extreme adult themes including genocide. At Toco Hills. 1
hour and 27 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: An extraordinary small-scale history lesson.

TEXAS LAWMAKERS GRAPPLE WITH PROPOSED PROPERTY-TAX CUTS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lawmakers said Tuesday they haven't found a way
to realize the $2 billion in property-tax cuts sought by Gov.
George W. Bush without short-changing Texas teachers and dashing
hopes for other forms of tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly halfway through the 140-day legislative session, members
of House and Senate committees predicted the projected $2.5 billion
surplus for 2000-01 would be more than devoured by a proposed $3
billion boost for education and at least $500 million in
miscellaneous tax breaks. They're hoping an increased revenue
estimate will save the day.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush clings to his 1998 re-election promise to provide
some direct relief to property owners, ranking lawmakers said
Bush's best hope is for indirect relief in the form of higher state
payments to local school districts. Theoretically, districts would
have less need to increase ad-valorem property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put extra dollars in certain areas and they
will be considered tax relief, because otherwise the local property
taxpayers would have paid that,'' said Rep. Henry Cuellar,
D-Laredo, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is on us to put the majority of the dollars on
public education and higher education,'' Cuellar said.
</P>
<P>
   From a practical, not political, standpoint, bigger monthly
paychecks for teachers could be better than small reductions in
annual property taxes, said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands and thousands of teachers that are going to get a
significant pay raise _ that is a greater economic impact than
token property tax relief,'' said Oliveira, one of many lawmakers
who is convinced there won't be enough money left on the table for
Bush's full request.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush's $2 billion property-tax relief objective, Oliveira
said, ``we can't reach that under any fiscal scenario that I see.''
</P>
<P>
   His conclusion is shared by Senate Finance Committee Chairman
Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, who said it is ``probably
questionable'' whether Bush's full objective will be met, although
Ratliff and others caution that it's too early in the
budget-wrangling process to declare any notion dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, it's anybody's guess,'' said Rep. Harold
Dutton, D-Houston, vice chairman of the House Public Education
Committee that figures heavily into the equation. Dutton's
committee will sort through a stack of requests for teacher-pay and
retirement-benefit increases and program enhancements, and decide
how to divvy up about $1.5 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have more things in the hopper than we have money to do
them, which is always the case,'' Dutton said.
</P>
<P>
   Though teacher groups have pleaded for a $6,000 annual increase
to put them close to a national average, Ratliff and House
counterparts have poured cold water on that request.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way we're going to get the $6,000 per teacher, but
if you talk about only $1,000 per teacher, you're talking about
$600 million over two years. That adds up in a hurry,'' Ratliff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cuellar agreed, saying, ``we would love to do a $6,000 payraise,
but we just can't do it now.''
</P>
<P>
   Teachers won't be the only sector left asking for more.
Businesses seeking tax relief have endorsed proposals that would
cut billions from state income through tax-rate reductions, credits
and incentives. But a majority of the proposals could be doomed by
the agreed-upon emphasis on new education spending _ and an
informal, high-level agreement to cap those tax cuts at $500
million. Even so, the head of Ways and Means isn't ready to throw
in the towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not letting the Appropriations Committee or Senate Finance
Committee in any way designate or decide how much we should spend
or save in tax exemptions, tax credits and incentives,'' Oliveira
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have a collision course with the
appropriations-finance process. Hopefully it will be a minor
collision .... and hopefully it's not the Titanic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The projected surplus presents a rare opportunity for lawmakers
to cobble together a package of sales tax and franchise tax relief,
Oliveira said. One popular proposal calls for a moratorium on sales
taxes on school-related items.
</P>
<P>
   Oliveira predicted sales-tax relief could top $300 million in a
stand-alone measure likely to reach the House floor in mid-April _
about the same time as the House version of the budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next thing we're going to look at is some (business)
franchise-tax exemptions or credits, and then we're going to leave
the research-and-development and job-training credits for the end,
as well as any possible property tax relief,'' Oliveira said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The property tax relief of $2 billion is the most difficult to
do,'' Oliveira said, emphasizing that he kept his own promise to
Bush to search for ways to implement Bush's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who is on vacation, wasn't available for comment Tuesday.
A spokesman said he remains confident that lawmakers will act in
the best interests of both students and taxpayers.

<P>
   MIAMI _ The Rev. Henry Lyons, the nationally prominent black
minister from Florida who was convicted this month on charges of
racketeering and grand theft, stepped down Tuesday as president of
the National Baptist Convention U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   The minister, whose lavish lifestyle of Rolls-Royces, expensive
real estate and other excesses was bankrolled by large corporations
trying to buy his influence in black communities, had survived
attempts to oust him as president of the nation's largest black
religious organization. He even won a vote of confidence from the
convention's leaders after his indictment on state and federal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, two weeks after his conviction in a Pinellas
County Circuit Court, and with his lawyers reportedly working on a
plea agreement just weeks before a federal trial on similar
charges, the St. Petersburg minister finally resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``With tremendous dignity,'' his attorney, Grady Irvin, told
reporters outside Lyons' home church, Bethel Metropolitan Baptist
Church in St. Petersburg, in describing Lyons' announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very remorseful,'' Irvin said, ``with respect to any
difficulty he has caused the convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons faces a maximum 8 1/2 years in prison when he is sentenced
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. S.C. Cureton of Greenville, S.C., will be the interim
president, until Lyons' term expires in September.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons continued to enjoy the support of his own parishioners and
prominent religious leaders as his troubles piled higher. He sold
bogus and highly inflated convention membership lists to
corporations who wanted to sell life and burial insurance and
market other things in black communities, ultimately leading to his
conviction on racketeering charges. He stole $4 million in all,
prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his other crime, pocketing some $240,000 in donations
to black churches burned by arson, that led to his grand theft
conviction and more greatly embarrassed convention members.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons did more than embarrass them, said some black ministers.
He betrayed people who believe in the black church.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad commentary on the religious community and for
Baptists, and it has a far-reaching effect,'' said the Rev.
Franklin R. Clark, pastor at Mount Olivette Baptist Church in
Miami's Overtown section.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been exploited,'' he said. ``It leaves a bitter taste in
my mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons waited too long to step down, said the Rev. Calvin O.
Butts III, pastor at the Abyssinian Church in New York, whose name
is often mentioned as a possible successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long overdue,'' said Butts.
</P>
<P>
   The convention's board of directors should have seen the need
for Lyons' resignation two years ago, when his legal troubles began
to take shape, said Butts.
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, black ministers said they hope it is the
beginning of a more accountable leadership in the convention, which
has allowed its presidents almost a free hand in running its
business. Lyons, by his own lawyers' admission, ran the
organization from a briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be able to go on,'' said the Rev. Herman Powell, the
pastor of Early Grove Baptist Church in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But some, like Butts, see a need for a complete overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great desire would be for the convention to elect a
governing board for a year to re-structure the organization, get
new board members, audit the books, etc.,'' he said. ``Otherwise, I
don't think these changes will happen. Eventually, there would be a
return to the old ways.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he is not a candidate for president this fall, but in
the future, ``Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want anyone to believe I was being outspoken simply
as a desire to become president,'' Butts said.
</P>
<P>
   Convention presidents serve for five years, and can be
re-elected once.
</P>
<P>
   At Lyons' church in St. Petersburg, parishioners still stood
behind him on Tuesday. Some on the church's deacon board even asked
for a show of hands in support of him, but Lyons ``would not allow
them to take that vote,'' said his lawyer, Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A majority of the people did not want him to resign,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   His defense team had described his actions as failed business
dealings, not crimes, and said that prosecutors did not understand
the authority that a black community invested in its minister.
</P>
<P>
   But many, like Clark in Miami, said he failed the people who
trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worship God,'' he said, ``because man fails.''

 &HT;    1998 top rookie Wood out for season
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Andres Galarraga. Moises Alou. Now
Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   The National League on Tuesday lost for the season a third major
star, as Wood, the reigning Rookie of the Year and great hope of
the Chicago Cubs, was diagnosed with a torn ulnar collateral
ligament in his right elbow. An MRI exam in Chicago revealed the
damage, although the extent of the injury and the chances of
surgery could not be determined until further tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel for him,'' Cubs closer Rod Beck said. ``I think, as a
pitcher, everyone one of us (has been) in bed with an ache and a
pain thinking it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood was in the middle of a disastrous camp. He already had been
hospitalized twice, for respiratory and intestinal illnesses, and
was making just his first start of the Cactus League season on
Saturday. He left the mound against Anaheim after throwing just 26
pitches and was sent back to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Wood, 21, was 13-6 in 26 starts last season with 233 strikeouts
in 166 2/3 innings and figured prominently in Cubs' hopes for their
first pennant in 54 years. He was sidelined with a tender elbow
most of the last month of the season but faced the Braves in Game 3
of the League Championship Series, allowing one run in a 6-2
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A kid like that only comes around once in a while,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said. ``Even though he's the opposition, you sure
don't want to see him hurt. The game needs more young kids to come
along like that.''

 &HT;    NCAA Women's notebook: Top 16 teams to square off
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All 16 of the teams hosting NCAA women's subregional
sites won second-round home games Sunday and Monday, meaning each
of the four regionals will feature the top four seeds.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of the games were close, and, in the case of
Connecticut, the No. 1 seed in the Mideast, its second-round
contest Sunday was a downright scare. Xavier almost became the
women's equivalent of Miami of Ohio, Gonzaga and Southwest Missouri
State by leading the Huskies for most of the game before falling
86-84 in the final 7.1 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Musketeers could have gotten a return trip to Cincinnati for
the Mideast semifinals on Saturday, but a relieved full house of
10,027 at Gampel Pavilion watched freshman Tamika Williams sink two
free throws for the winning points.
</P>
<P>
   No freebies here
</P>
<P>
   Many of the top-drawing programs avoid disclosing how many
tickets they give away or discount during the regular season, but a
true gauge of the sport's fan base can be found in who turns out
for NCAA Tournament games.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tennessee has been averaging nearly 18,000 fans a home
game this season, only 9,907 _ easily a season low _ turned out at
Thompson-Boling Arena on Monday night to see Chamique Holdsclaw and
Kellie Jolly play their last home game. The Lady Volunteers rolled
in the second half to an 89-62 romp of Boston College, with
Holdsclaw tying her career high of 39 points. The low turnout
partly was because of a 9:30 p.m. starting time. But the NCAA
mandates an average ticket price of around $15 for tournament
games, and fans used to getting through the gates for $5 or less
might have decided to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   A number of schools did very well in their second-round games.
In addition to Connecticut, Iowa State had 11,719 for its win over
Oregon, Virginia Tech turned out 9,812 to see the Hokies defeat
Auburn, and Purdue brought in 9,501 to see the Boilermakers beat
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia drew the poorest of the 16 host schools, with an
official crowd of 2,212 for Monday's 68-55 win over Southern
Methodist. The Lady Bulldogs still set a home attendance record
this season, averaging 3,199 for 14 games, including two in the
NCAA sub-regional.
</P>
<P>
   Sick of the Huskies?
</P>
<P>
   UConn is the Beast of the East, with its traveling media
entourage of 20 and regular coverage in the mainstream New York
media. But some coaches think that its national profile, as well as
that of Tennessee, crowds out almost everyone else.

 &HT;    Judge declines stay in NCAA eligibility order
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NCAA schools have been left in a state of confusion over
freshman academic eligibility standards now that a Philadelphia
judge has refused to stay an order that the old rules discriminated
against blacks.
</P>
<P>
   On March 8, U.S. District Court Judge Ronald Buckwalter of
Philadelphia struck down the NCAA's Proposition 16, which does not
allow freshmen athletes to participate if they score lower than 820
on the SAT or 66 on the ACT. The NCAA asked for a stay of the order
so that some kind of academic guidelines would be in place while it
filed an appeal. On Tuesday Buckwalter said no and as of today
there are no minimum standards for incoming freshmen athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mess, no doubt about it,'' said SEC Commissioner Roy
Kramer. ``Now we have to figure out what's the next step.''
</P>
<P>
   The very next step for the NCAA will be to continue the appeal.
The NCAA will seek a stay of Buckwalter's order from the Third
Circuit Court of Appeals but will appeal the case no matter what
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA's concern continues to be the welfare and protection
of student-athletes and the effect this ruling has on the
preparedness of freshmen for academics and athletics as they enter
Division institutions,'' said Cedric Dempsey, the executive
director of the NCAA. ``Our membership is left with many unknowns
about how to address eligibility standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling creates numerous problems for the schools, but here
are just a couple:
</P>
<P>
   _ Technically, coaches will have no academic standard to use as
a guideline during the current spring recruiting period. In reality
they still have to use the old standard in case the NCAA eventually
wins on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   _ Freshmen athletes who were admitted to school this year but
were ineligible to play because they didn't meet the old standard,
are today technically eligible. But if the athlete participates in
one event, like this week's NCAA basketball tournament, he or she
forfeits a whole year of eligibility. And if the NCAA wins the
appeal, the school would have to forfeit the event in which the
athlete participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that the judge never realized what kind of can of
worms he could open with this thing,'' said Kramer.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's ruling doesn't preclude the use of standardized test
scores, but does say there can not be a minimum score that cannot
be offset by other academic work. The NCAA Division I Board is
looking at a system that would allow a student to compensate for a
lower standardized test score with a higher grade point average on
13 college preparatory subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's lawyers said this week that the earliest it could
establish new guidelines would be October. Other athletic officials
said it could happen sooner, given the urgency of the situation.

WASTE BUSINESS BOOMS AS USES ARE FOUND

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over a decade ago, Michael R. Daley was touring a plant that
burned old tires for energy when he learned that it paid haulers to
cart away gypsum, one of its byproducts. Daley was astounded:
Gypsum, he knew, is used in plaster, toothpaste, paints, even molds
for false teeth. So Daley set up shop near the plant to collect and
resell the gypsum.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his company, Triad Energy Resources Inc., has grown
into a successful small enterprise, all by setting up next to
corporations and finding uses for their wastes. Triad makes soil
additives from the C &AMP; H Sugar Co.'s sugar-filtration byproducts in
Crockett, Calif. It turns leftover skins and seeds from Australian
wineries and fruit processors into fertilizer and compost. And it
is now contracting with fish processors in Oregon to turn their
detritus into fertilizer and fish food.
</P>
<P>
   ``If companies were smart, they'd all locate near sources of
waste,'' Daley said.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate America is, in fact, catching on. More and more
companies are buying their neighbors' wastes or selling their own.
And a growing number of economic development agencies and private
developers are building ``eco-industrial parks'' _ eco-parks for
short _ for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Some are doing it to attract jobs, others to reduce trash flows,
still others simply to make money. But all are working on the
principle that one company's waste can be its neighbor's raw
material. And they are taking advantage of the fact that many
wastes that cannot be recycled back to their original uses can
still be profitably used as materials for other products.
</P>
<P>
   ``A park that makes environmental and economic sense is an idea
whose time has come,'' said Dustin Bielagus, a developer who is
building an eco-park in Londonderry, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Eco-parks are rising in Mississippi and Mexico. They are on the
drawing boards in Puerto Rico and Mesa del Sol, N.M. Dow Chemical
Co. is building one near its plants in eastern Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In California, local officials plan an eco-park in Oakland,
while the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians is looking for companies
to set up at its trash-to-energy plant near Palm Springs to extract
materials from the trash before it is burned.
</P>
<P>
   While the environmental movement spawned the idea of such
industrial symbiosis, it is no longer the primary force. ``People
realize that where materials are thrown out, there is money to be
made,'' said Kevin Taylor, coordinator of the California Materials
Exchange Program, a state group that brought Triad and C &AMP; H
together.
</P>
<P>
   There is money to be saved as well, added Reid Lifset, who edits
the Journal of Industrial Ecology. ``Companies are always looking
for cheaper ways to procure raw materials,'' he said, ``and the
more they hear about eco-industrial parks, the more light bulbs go
off.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of selling and buying wastes is not new, of course. The
Environmental Protection Agency lists about 40
government-subsidized waste exchanges. But now more entrepreneurs
are becoming involved, charging companies for listing available
wastes or waste-product needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valuable waste materials should not be consigned to subsidized
exchanges whose funding can get cut,'' said William Sloan, who just
started Millennium Exchange Ltd., a for-profit, Web-based waste
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Even the terminology reflects the private-sector thrust, said
Julie Rhodes, executive director of the Reuse Development
Organization, a clearinghouse for information about reusing
materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``People call them materials exchanges now, not waste
exchanges,'' she said. ``The whole idea is to think of waste as
having value.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, most existing exchanges ignore location when they match
waste sources with users. Factor in the cost of shipping waste, and
the economics of selling it becomes shaky. But put companies next
to one another, and the economics works.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot cheaper to transport used lumber from next door
than it is to truck wood down from a forest,'' said Ann Schneider,
director of recycling programs at the University of California at
Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   That is the type of argument that the Energy Answers Corp., a
resource recovery specialist in Albany, is using to woo companies
to set up near the trash-to-energy plant it wants to install in Rio
Pedras, near San Juan, P.R. Patrick F. Mahoney, president of Energy
Answers, said he was close to persuading a paper company to reopen
an abandoned plant on the site because it could recycle waste paper
coming in and use cheap energy from the trash being burned. He said
he was also talking to steel and concrete companies about using
scrap steel from the trash and the fly ash that is left after
combustion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put the companies close enough to get the materials by
conveyor belt,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the proselytizing, eco-parks are not an easy sell. When
a company is picking a site, a chance to lower disposal or
materials costs pales next to considerations like availability of
workers, taxes and nearness to customers. The sheer logistics of
figuring out the proper mix can be daunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we could handpick a perfect assortment of
businesses that would move right in, but it just doesn't work that
way,'' said Michael Krause, executive director of the Green
Institute, a nonprofit developer that just abandoned the idea of
using guaranteed waste exchange as a draw for an industrial center
it is building in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And even if the companies come, who is to guarantee that none
will move or change their products or go belly up?
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute one company changes its processes, the whole
industrial ecosystem gets screwed up,'' said Stuart L. Hart, a
professor of strategic management at the University of North
Carolina's Kenan-Flagler Business School.
</P>
<P>
   Not even environmentalists are unequivocal in their support.
Nancy B. Hirshberg, director of natural resources at Stonyfield
Farm Inc., fought to make waste exchange a requirement of the park
that Bielagus is building next to Stonyfield's yogurt plant in
Londonderry. But she is having second thoughts. ``Creating a market
for wastes could create a disincentive to eliminate them,'' Ms.
Hirshberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Bielagus acknowledges that his ideal tenant would generate no
waste. And Ned Hall, an executive vice president of AES Enterprise,
a company that operates power plants and will anchor the park, says
the park's green premise has not stopped local residents from
yelling, ``Not in my back yard.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, the numerous ifs and buts have created a Catch 22:
developers do not want to invest millions in setting up an eco-park
until they have successful models to follow, yet such models will
not dot the landscape until a few more pioneers take the plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be a major trend until people see more good
examples,'' said Nabil Nasr, director of the National Center for
Remanufacturing and Resource Recovery at the Rochester Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   An example of sorts does exist in Kalundborg, Denmark, where
companies have been exchanging wastes for more than 20 years. But
Kalundborg was not built for that purpose; it had a lucky
confluence of companies that started to use one another's wastes
after environmental regulations banned their disposal methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kalundborg was a wonderful accident,'' said Edward
Cohen-Rosenthal, director of Cornell University's Work and
Environment Initiative.
</P>
<P>
   That accident may, in fact, have been replicated in Tampico,
Mexico, an industrial city in the Monterrey metropolitan area. Some
25 companies, all within a 40-mile radius, recently hired Bechtel
Corp.'s consulting arm to identify their wastes. Bechtel found 44
waste streams, and one chemical plant is already using a pigment
plant's waste ferric chloride as a water purifier, while a
manufacturer of industrial gases is exploring ways to use carbon
dioxide that is going up a smokestack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are looking first to see what they can exchange among
themselves, and then for what kinds of companies they will woo,''
said Paul Worhach, a Bechtel senior engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Companies and developers in less industrialized areas do not
have that luxury. So they are plunging feet first into courtship.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Economic and Community Development Department
recently wooed a power plant to its new Red Hills Ecoplex in
Choctaw County _ in the heart of lignite coal mining territory _ in
part by pointing out the availability of on-site coal and water.
</P>
<P>
   The plant will not start operating for two years, yet Robert T.
Smira, the agency's deputy director, said he is close to leasing
space to a brick maker that would use the clay left over from coal
mining. The mining company, which normally uses the clay to fill in
the holes its strip mines leave, will instead use the fly ash the
power plant spews out. More fly ash will go for building roads,
replacing the gravel that Choctaw now pays to haul in. And Smira is
also trying to interest a wallboard maker in the fly ash.
</P>
<P>
   That takes care of the solid stuff. Steady streams of water, at
various temperatures, flow in and out of power plants, too. The
eco-plex will have a greenhouse, a fish farm and a few food
processors, all either feeding water to the plant or taking it. The
greenhouse and a dry ice company will probably use the carbon
dioxide from the plant's stacks.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of everything-but-the-squeal setup attracted the AES
power plant to Londonderry. A sewage treatment plant nearby will
provide cheap water. Heated water coming out of the power plant
will be piped first to other factories that can extract some of the
heat, then back to the treatment plant. AES also expects to sell
steam it would otherwise vent to the air.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, it is an unbeatable system _ but no one knows how
many manufacturers will respond. Other eco-park developers feel
more comfortable casting a wider net for tenants, then offering
incentives for them to use one another's wastes.
</P>
<P>
   The Sustainable Technology Park Authority, a nonprofit
organization, is building an eco-park in Cape Charles, Va., that
welcomes any tenant that promises to operate along strict
environmental rules. As tenants move in, it will use lists of their
byproducts to woo others. But now it simply offers rent reductions
to companies that exchange wastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't setting up the whole park around that,'' said
Timothy E. Hayes, the agency's executive director. ``But we hope
that the availability of cheap materials will be an incentive to
come here.''

 &HT;    Replay may finally win owners' approval
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Last year, as he walked into a session for the NFL
owners to decide the fate of instant replay, Mike Holmgren was a
man confident that proponents had the 23 votes necessary to
resurrect the system. But approval didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren thinks there are enough votes this year, but he's
taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I about fell out of my chair (last year),'' Holmgren said.
``I'm taking nothing for granted. I know what everyone is saying,
but I'll believe it when I see them starting to put the
(television) monitors on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless several owners are lying about their position on replay,
however, Holmgren has little to worry about this time around. A
spate of high-profile officiating gaffes during the 1998 season
seemed to convince all but the staunchest replay opponents that the
much-debated system is now a necessary evil.
</P>
<P>
   Although the annual meetings are running behind schedule _ some
agenda items slated for Monday morning weren't addressed until
Tuesday afternoon and committee sessions were going late into the
night _ the replay vote probably will be today. A straw poll
indicated only four teams opposed the system presented by the
committee. Two other teams are undecided. The addition of the
expansion Cleveland Browns means that replay needs 24 votes to be
approved, but most league officials think they have a vote or two
more.
</P>
<P>
   The system recommended by the committee is known as
challenge-based, with coaches able to review two plays per game. If
the original call is upheld, the challenging team is charged a
timeout. In the final two minutes of the second and fourth
quarters, replay can be triggered only by an official in a special
booth.

 &HT;    Inside pro tennis: U.S. tennis on comeback trail
 &HT;    By Todd Holcomb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the new year broke, the USTA bragged that American-born
players had finished No. 1 on both pro tours for the first time
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The fact was, however, that American tennis had never looked so
bleak. There wasn't a young American without colored hair beads
showing any sign of matching Pete Sampras or Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the picture has flipped. While Sampras and Davenport have
each been dropped to No. 2, American tennis is making an unforseen
comeback.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was veteran Todd Martin who led the charge. The
former No. 5 player fell out of the top 100 for a while in 1997
while battling shin and elbow injuries, but in the final five weeks
of last year, Martin went 14-4, losing three times to Sampras while
defeating five top-10 players. He's back at No. 10 after reaching
the quarters of Indian Wells, where he beat Marcelo Rios, and the
Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   Another player presumed finished was Chris Woodruff, a top-30
player two years ago. Woodruff, 26, the former NCAA champ from
Tennessee, injured his right knee in December of 1997 while kicking
footballs with Richey Reneberg at Georgia Tech. He essentially sat
out 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Woodruff surged to the quarterfinals in Indian Wells
-- which actually had a stronger field than the Australian -- and
scored victories over Felix Mantilla, who had just beaten Sampras,
and sixth-ranked Tim Henman.
</P>
<P>
   Among young players, the USTA is most high on Jan-Michael
Gambill. A year ago, the 21-year-old came from outside the top 200
to beat Agassi, Henman, Mark Philippoussis and Alex Corretja, but
his appearance at the AT&AMP;T Challenge here last year revealed a
suspect clay-court game and net play.
</P>
<P>
   This year, his volleys have improved, and his two-handed
groundstrokes are among the biggest in the game. He's beaten Agassi
and Henman again, as well as Sampras this month in Scottsdale, in
becoming the only under-26 American with an ATP Tour singles title.
It propelled him to a career-high No. 31.
</P>
<P>
   On the women's side, Chanda Rubin has resurfaced after a 2
1/2-year slump that started with a hand injury just as she reached
No. 5 in the world. This year, she has beaten Martina Hingis and
was up a break in the third set on Steffi Graf last week. She's
back to No. 24.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, there's Serena Williams, on an 11-match winning
streak after titles in Paris and now Indian Wells, where she beat
Davenport and Graf. She's up to No. 16 and predicts that she'll be
there by the French Open in May.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Challenge snags Woodies
</P>
<P>
   Jim Courier and Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde, winners of
nine Grand Slam doubles titles, will play in the AT&AMP;T Challenge,
tournament owner ProServ announced Monday. The Woodies, who won the
Olympic gold medal for doubles in Atlanta, have won 53 career
doubles titles, the most of any active team. . . . The USTA Women's
Challenger of Norcross begins Sunday with qualifying at Racquet
Club of the South. Great Britain's Samantha Smith, ranked No. 55,
is the highest-ranked player in the field.
</P>
<P>
   New No. 1 not a fluke
</P>
<P>
   There are some misconceptions about Carlos Moya, the new No. 1
player on the ATP Tour. One is that he's just a dirt-baller.
Although the reigning French Open champion won two-thirds of his
matches on clay last year, he is proven on hardcourts, as well. He
has made the semifinals or better of the U.S. Open, the Australian
Open and the ATP Tour Championship. Granted, he was a first-round
loser at the Australian this year. It's also easy to forget that
Moya is a young, physically imposing player. He's the youngest
top-10 player at 22, just 2 1/2 months older than No. 11
Philippoussis, and he's 6-foot-3, 177 pounds. Sampras is listed at
only 6-1, 170. Moya is the first Spanish No. 1.

NFL OWNERS GIVE THE NOD TO THE JETS

<P>
   PHOENIX _ He has a strong presence at these NFL meetings, but
the remarkable thing is, he is not here.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt the large shadow of Bill Parcells is hanging
over the American Football Conference.
</P>
<P>
   You could hear it in the voices of his peers Tuesday morning,
when the AFC coaches had their annual breakfast with the media as
part of the league meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was back on Long Island, continuing to retool his New
York Jets. The other AFC coaches were here, with their owners, even
though most of them would rather not be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jets will be the team to beat this year,'' said Jimmy
Johnson of the Miami Dolphins. ``Not only in our division, but in
all of football. I think they are as strong as any team in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put that playoff game they had in Denver (the AFC
Championship game) on a neutral field and I think you might have
seen a different result.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' AFC opponents agreed on one point: New York should be
the favorite to repeat as AFC East champion, in a year that the
division figures to be as tough as it ever has been.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, we were sitting here at this same breakfast saying
New England was the team to beat, and they were,'' said Buffalo
Bills coach Wade Phillips. ``But all of that has changed. The Jets
have a heck of a football team, and they've done some good things
in the offseason to make them better. Wherever they felt they had a
problem last year, they went out and tried to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our division is going to be right there with the best,'' said
the Indianapolis Colts' Jim Mora, ``but the Jets will have the best
chance going in. They've done a good job there the last couple of
years putting a very good football team on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at our division. The quarterbacks. Marino in Miami.
Bledsoe in New England, Flutie in Buffalo, Testaverde in New York,
and Peyton (Manning) with our team. Every team has the guy you need
to win, the quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you would have to say that the team that won it a year
ago is the team to beat,'' said the Patriots' Pete Carroll. ``And
they've improved themselves. Steve (Atwater) should really help
them out. That became a salary cap thing for the Broncos, and they
couldn't keep him. Tom Tupa will help their punting, and this kid
Roman Phifer they picked up from the Rams is a good linebacker.
They're going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, New England was picked as the team to beat, but of
the five teams in the AFC East, it seems to have slipped the most,
while the rest have improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a good football team,'' said the Bills' Phillips. ``We
could have easily won 12 ballgames last year. Some games got away
from us at the end that easily could have been ours. But I guess
you could say that we won some that maybe we should have lost.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a better football team,'' said Johnson of
his Dolphins. ``We had a meeting last week in Miami and we had one
of these independent talent evaluators that we pay come in and take
a look at what we have done in our personnel, and size up with what
the other teams have done picking talent the last couple of years.
He thought we had done an excellent job, drafting fine football
players in the draft, and that the Jets had done a good job picking
up players in free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson nearly quit at the end of last season, and when he
decided to come back, he promised he would take more time for
himself. But he already reneged on that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting just as much time into it as I did before,'' said
Johnson. ``At the time I said I need more time off, I felt that
way. Then I took a little vacation and didn't go to some of the
bowl games. All the while I was away, I kept thinking I should be
at these games looking for more talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the first time in my coaching career that I ever
felt that way at the end of a season. I didn't handle it well. Now
I'm back to where I was. This is what I want to do. I'm enjoying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   All of these coaches know that the most important thing next
season is finish with the best intradivision record. The Patriots
were 7-1 two years ago and won it. The Jets were 7-1 last year and
won it. This year, it will be hard for any team to get that good a
division record, but the one with the best figures to be standing
on top of the heap when the year is over. And right now, it looks
as though the championship banner once again might fly over the
Evil Empire to the South.

MEDICARE REVAMP PANEL DISBANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid sharp philosophical divisions, a federal panel
charged with finding a way to stave off a financial crisis for
Medicare disbanded Tuesday after failing to gather enough votes to
make any recommendations to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, President Clinton, who had appointed four
members to the 17-member panel, said he will issue his own proposal
to revamp Medicare, which is due to run into severe financial
problems within a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Panel members, who include lawmakers and health policy
specialists, Tuesday fell one vote short of the 11 needed to
approve a plan to allow more Medicare beneficiaries to switch to
private health plans, with the government subsidizing the cost of
their premiums.
</P>
<P>
   Formed a year ago by Congress, the panel had been considered the
best hope to build momentum behind a bipartisan effort to
restructure Medicare, which now provides health insurance to 39
million senior citizens and disabled Americans. Despite the
commission's impasse, the panel's cochairman, Senator John Breaux,
Democrat of Louisiana, vowed to file legislation that would write
the panel's plan into law.
</P>
<P>
   The eight Republicans on the panel, joined by two Democrats,
supported the proposal, while all four of President Clinton's
appointees to the commission, and three Democratic lawmakers
opposed it. The partisan nature of the vote suggested that Medicare
reform could become a bitter issue in Congress during upcoming
elections. Democrats have made gains in past elections by arguing
that Republicans want to injure the popular health program.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the White House Tuesday, Clinton said the
commission's approach runs the risk of raising premiums for those
in the traditional Medicare program. He also criticized the
proposal for raising the age of eligibility to 67, from 65 today,
``without policy to guard against increased numbers of uninsured
Americans.'' He also said the commission's proposal to pay
prescription drug costs for poor beneficiaries did not go far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he had instructed aides to begin work on a White
House Medicare plan that would use 15 percent of the projected
federal budget surplus to shore up the program and help fund a
broad prescription drug benefit. ``It is now incumbent on me to
present an alternative proposal . . . I'm going to do my dead-level
best to get it done,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare is expected to run out of money as early as 2008, just
as millions of baby boomers begin to hit retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Republicans Tuesday sought to lay blame for the
deadlock on Clinton, whose four appointees voted against the plan.
Senator Phil Gramm (R-Texas), accused Clinton of passing up a
chance to achieve bipartisan consensus on reforming Medicare. ``We
have a president who had the opportunity to change American history
on Medicare, and he didn't have the courage to act,'' said Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux said he will introduce legislation based on the proposal
he unsuccessfully pushed before the commission. Breaux's proposal
would gradually raise the eligibility age for Medicare from 65 to
67 over 24 years; add prescription drug coverage for poor
beneficiaries who earn up to 135 percent of federal poverty
guidelines; require all Medicare supplemental insurance policies to
offer limited prescription drug benefits; shift a $3.6 billion
annual subsidy to the nation's medical schools from the Medicare
budget to the general federal government budget; and reduce
payments to hospitals and doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial element of the Breaux proposal, however,
is likely to be its plan to create a private market for health
maintenance organizations and other insurers to care for the
elderly. The government would pay 88 percent of the premium for
private coverage, while beneficiaries would pay the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the proposal have argued that it will create a
two-tiered system where the poor can afford only inferior coverage
while the rich will be better off.

 &HT;    Survivor: `I could feel the heat'
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark

<P>
   BOURBONNAIS, Ill. _ Jo Ann Lyons was eating a steak and a baked
potato Monday night in the dining car of Amtrak's City of New
Orleans train as it headed toward a stop in Kankakee, Ill., when
she heard a crash. The next thing she knew, her dinner was all over
her clothes, she was covered with glass and she was under the
table, trapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and I were just sitting there when everything
crashed to the ground, the cups and glasses,'' said Lyons, 62, a
retiree from Slidell, La. ``I was the last one they got. I was
blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons and her husband, Ray, were on a multitrain vacation around
the United States when the train that was supposed to take them
home slammed into a truck Monday night on a dark stretch of tracks
near Bourbonnais, Ill., 50 miles south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 196 passengers and 20 Amtrak employees on board, about 20
were teenagers from Clinton, Miss., and their chaperones returning
from a spring break ski trip to Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   One of the teenagers suffered a back injury, and three of the
chaperones were hospitalized, but no other serious injuries were
reported to group members.
</P>
<P>
   Jo Ann Lyons suffered broken bones, including a broken pelvis
that will keep her in traction for six weeks at St. Mary's Hospital
in Kankakee. Ray Lyons, 64, has a crushed chest and was in
intensive care Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   As Jo Ann Lyons waited for rescuers to pry her out from under
the table, she realized other cars were on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could smell the smoke, I could see the flames, I could feel
the heat,'' she said. ``I thought that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lyons' trip began March 10 in San Antonio, Texas. From there
they traveled to Los Angeles, then north and finally east. The 19
1/2-hour trip from Chicago to New Orleans was to have been the last
leg of their trip.
</P>
<P>
   The worst part of the crash, Lyons said, was when she was
carried out of the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cold, and dark, and scary,'' she said. ``There were
people crying. I hope I don't have to stay here. I want to go home
to Slidell.''

SERBIAN TANKS ROLL INTO KOSOVO, THREATENING PEACE TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Kosovo peace effort was on the verge of collapse
Tuesday as Serbia moved heavy tanks and thousands more troops into
the province at the same time that Serbian negotiators here
insisted on extensive changes to a draft peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Washington warned that the Serbs seemed to be
``bracing for war'' instead of preparing for peace with about
30,000 Serbian troops now in or poised near the province. The heavy
Yugoslav M-84 tanks that rolled into the province, in violation of
previous pledges, were the first to be seen in Kosovo in at least
five months, according to cease-fire monitors who began their
mission last October.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to raising new complaints about the content of the
peace agreement, Serbian negotiators here showed no signs of giving
in on their objection to a 28,000-member NATO peacekeeping force on
Serbian soil to police the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shall sign the political agreement if they accept our
suggestions,'' the Serbian president, Milan Milutinovic, said on
emerging Tuesday afternoon from the French conference center, a
former hotel that was the German occupation headquarters during
World War II. The talks resumed there on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But international mediators rejected any substantive changes to
the agreement. ``The talks are over,'' a Washington policymaker
said as Clinton administration officials convened a meeting to
discuss the next steps after the talks end, possibly as early as
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks faltered, the fighting in Kosovo continued Tuesday
in violation of an October cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, co-chairman of the talks
with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, accused the Serbs of
backtracking and warned: ``The moment of truth is not far away.''
</P>
<P>
   The NATO allies have threatened to launch wide-scale bombing of
Serbian military targets unless the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, accepts the agreement. The Kosovo Albanian delegation to
the talks said on Monday that it was prepared to sign the accord as
negotiated in the first phase of the talks last month in the French
chateau of Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Albanians reacted warily when the international
mediators said they were willing to make ``technical adjustments''
to the agreement to get the Serbs to sign, and though some Albanian
commanders in Kosovo are threatening to keep fighting for
independence, the Serbs are now seen to be the main problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are today going back on certain aspects they appeared to
have accepted at the end of the Rambouillet negotiations, and they
still totally refuse civil and above all military guarantees on the
ground,'' Vedrine said of the Serbian side in a report to the
French Parliament this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Another official close to the talks said that the Serbs had
demanded changes in up to 70 percent of the agreement, which would
provide political autonomy to the largely ethnic Albanian majority
population of Kosovo and commit NATO peacekeepers for a three-year
transition period. Alliance officials discussed military
peacekeeping arrangements with the Albanian delegates Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will come back and continue trying to get engagement going
Wednesday,'' said Philip T. Reeker, the chief spokesman for the
talks. ``The negotiators, with the full agreement of the contact
group, have reminded the Serb delegation and Milutinovic that only
technical adjustments could be considered, and that the purpose of
this meeting is simply to discuss implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the United States, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and
Russia, the six ``contact group'' countries that convened the
talks, have showed signs of disunity this week on the peacekeeping
force, which would be largely European and commanded by a British
general, with 4,000 American troops in a backup role.
</P>
<P>
   The five Western countries, all NATO allies, have insisted that
no settlement would mean anything without armed peacekeepers to
enforce it. But French officials have indicated that the
peacekeepers might not necessarily have to be an integral part of
NATO, and Russian officials in Brussels have said Russian soldiers
would only participate if a Russian general shared command.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Russian reporters covering the talks here said that the Russian
mediator, Boris Mayorsky, had told them Monday night that Moscow
had never approved the part of the draft agreement providing for
peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The draft says that peacekeepers would separate the Serbian
military and police forces from the armed Albanian rebels, oversee
the withdrawal of all but 1,500 Serb troops from the province
within a year and provide security for Kosovo's two million people
until a new international conference convenes in three years to
decide whether the province should remain a part of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   But according to an official who had seen the Serbian proposals
for changes, Milosevic was not prepared to accept provisions that
would allow the ethnic Albanian population to form its own police
force using former independence fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the Serbian proposals accept the draft's guarantee
that the more than 200,000 people displaced by a year of violent
clashes be allowed to return to their homes, the official said. The
Serbs also reject the idea that the international war crimes
tribunal in The Hague has a right to investigate the possibility of
war crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradoxically, their position could solidify the contact
group,'' an official said. ``Nobody can say the Serbs are being
reasonable and just want minor changes.''
</P>
<P>
   If the talks end in an impasse, a real possibility according to
their French hosts, it would probably take NATO about a week to
gear up for bombing. More than 400 American and European warplanes,
including American B-52's, stand ready to launch attacks against
selected Serbian military targets in Kosovo and beyond, and then to
destroy all of Serbia's sophisticated air defenses, if ordered into
action by the alliance's top civilian official, Javier Solana, the
secretary general.
</P>
<P>
   But officials in Brussels said he would only give the go-ahead
if he decided that there was a broad consensus that the Serbs were
the main obstacle to an agreement and that bombing might get
Milosevic to change his mind. Western embassy staffs would probably
be evacuated from Belgrade before any bombs started falling,
officials say, and the 2,000 civilian observers who have been in
Kosovo since last fall would also be brought out.
</P>
<P>
   Western officials charge that Serbia has blatantly violated the
terms of the Oct. 13 cease-fire agreement that provided for the
observers. Tuesday, monitors in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo,
said they had seen Yugoslav tanks and soldiers headed toward
fighting south of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has always opposed any use of force to bring about a
settlement in Kosovo. Alliance officials in Brussels say that
bombing would probably wreck the attempts NATO has made to build a
constructive relationship with Russia since the end of the Cold
War.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After months of negotiations, North Korea agreed
Tuesday to allow the United States to inspect a huge underground
site that Washington suspects is the center of a renewed effort to
build atomic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes some modest commitments by the United States
to continue food aid to North Korea, and to begin a pilot project
to help it grow potatoes to end to a famine that by some estimates
has led to the starvation of more than 3 million people in the last
few years. But the agreement leaves a number of issues still
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Chief among them is North Korea's continuing development of
ballistic missiles, some of which it has sold to Iran and Pakistan,
among other nations. Last week, former Defense Secretary William J.
Perry, who is conducting a complete review of American policy
toward North Korea, said that the country's ``long-range-missile
program itself suggests in parallel the development of a nuclear
weapons program.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, there are continuing suspicions, but no explicit
evidence, that North Korea may be hiding other elements of its
nuclear research and development program. And nothing in this
agreement requires the North to suspend test shots of its missiles,
like the one it sent over Japan last August that led Tokyo and the
Washington to press for the development of a missile defense system
in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's nuclear accord is the second the United States has
reached with North Korea since the two countries came perilously
close to military conflict in June 1994. The State Department
spokesman James Rubin said the latest accord would permit repeated
and regular American visits to the remote, mountainous site called
Kumchangri, about 25 miles Northwest of Yongbyon, the nuclear
research center that has been under constant inspection by the
International Atomic Energy Agency for five years.

   The American visits to the underground facility, which are
scheduled to start in May, would mark the first time the North has
allowed inspection beyond Yongbyon. They may be doing so because
the underground site was detected so early that it is still a huge
whole in the ground, with no signs that equipment has yet been
installed. The agreement permits regular visits after the initial
inspection, until the United States concludes that the facility
poses no threat.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea continues to deny that the site is intended for the
nuclear research or production, though in the negotiations they did
say it was designed for ``a sensitive military purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House hopes that the accord will also quell a rising
movement in Congress to cut off fuel oil shipments to North Korea.
Under the 1994 accord, the United States committed itself to
provide 500,000 tons of oil to the North for a number of years, in
return for Pyongyang's agreement to freeze activity at the Yongbyon
plant, which appeared at the time to be only four or five months
away from producing five or six nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress never provided more than partial funding for the
shipments. The future of the nuclear accord was thrown into further
peril last summer after intelligence reports about the existence of
the underground site surfaced in news articles.
</P>
<P>
   The site at Kumchangri was difficult to hide from American
satellites: thousands of North Korean military workers were
swarming over it each day, excavating a huge area under a mountain.
The shape of the excavation led experts to tentatively conclude
that the North's goal was to re-create the nuclear processing
facilities under round-the-clock inspection at Yongbyon.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress accused the State Department of
attempting to suppress news of the North Korean activity, and
charged that the huge new underground site proved that the North
Korean military was seeking to rebuild its bomb-making capacity at
a new, secret installation.

 WASHINGTON: secret installation. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politically, Tuesday's accord allows the administration to
certify to Congress in coming weeks that the North continues to
comply with the 1994 accord. Without that certification, Congress
would almost certainly have cut off the fuel oil, a move the
Pentagon feared would lead North Korea to resume its production of
plutonium, and create a new confrontation similar to the one that
led to the movement in the spring of 1994 of B-2 bombers and
anti-missile defenses to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we've contained an effort to break out of the
agreement,'' an American official said.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations that ended Tuesday were led by Charles Kartman,
a longtime State Department expert on Korea, and by Kim Gye Gwan,
North Korea's vice foreign minister and a longtime interlocutor
with the United States on North Korea's nuclear projects.
</P>
<P>
   For months the talks were stalemated, with the North Koreans
initially demanding a $300 million payment by the United States for
a one-time visit to the nuclear site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We refused repeatedly to provide the kind of direct
compensation that they were seeking,'' said Rubin, the State
Department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But over months of talks, the more Kartman talked about access
to the site, the more the North Koreans talked about food aid. And
in the end, what they got was a promise that the current American
food aid program, which the State Department insists is for humane
reasons and is unrelated to the nuclear agreements, would continue.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said that a consortium of American
groups would announce the details of the potato program in coming
days, and that the Agency for International Development would
provide about 100,000 tons of food aid for North Korea to
compensate for the loss of crops during the two seasons it will
take to get a full potato harvest.
</P>
<P>
   That increase, though, has already aroused some critics of the
administration's policy. Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-NY, who heads
the House International Relations Committee, said Tuesday, ``I am
concerned that the administration had to provide almost 600,000
tons of food aid to gain that access'' to the nuclear site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is distressing that the North Koreans and other rogue
nations may begin charging the United States for ensuring
compliance with their international agreements,'' Gilman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in a lunch with reporters, Perry declined to say
whether he would recommend more food aid in return for further
agreements with the North, particularly on missile proliferation.
But he talked at length about the human cost of the starvation
there, including stunted and orphaned children, and said that
making food aid a ``quid pro quo for achieving our aims'' was ``a
perfectly reasonable policy that I'm open to considering.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a country so weak that it could not fight a sustained
war,'' Perry said. ``But it is also a country so desperate that it
could lash out.''

FINDINGS HELP BOLSTER COLLISION THEORY OF MOON'S ORIGINS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Recent measurements of the moon's core bolster an
Apollo-era theory that the satellite formed from material ripped
away when the Earth was hit by a large object, planetary scientists
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Readings taken by NASA's Lunar Prospector suggest the iron lunar
core comprises less than 4 percent of the satellite's total mass,
and perhaps less than 2 percent. The Earth's iron core comprises
about 30 percent of the planet's total mass.
</P>
<P>
   The unmanned, $63 million Lunar Prospector mission was launched
Jan. 6, 1998, and became the first NASA spacecraft to reach the
moon in more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Past analysis of the lunar rocks and soil gathered in the late
1960s and early 1970s by the Apollo astronauts revealed a mineral
composition that suggests the moon and the Earth had a similar
origin. If they formed independently from the same materials,
though, the ratio of their cores to total mass should be
equivalent. Differences in their cores might suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical finding in helping scientists determine how
the Earth and moon formed,'' said Alan Binder of the Phoenix-based
Lunar Research Institute, Prospector's chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Konopliv of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,
Calif., presented the core measurements, made by gravity sensing
instruments on the probe, at this week's Lunar and Planetary
Science Conference at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Konopliv's findings and those of Lon Hood, a University of
Arizona researcher who is taking magnetic readings of the moon with
Prospector, place the diameter of the moon's core at between 140
and 280 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the collision theory believe the moon formed when
the Earth was hit about 4.4 billion years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This impact occurred after the Earth's iron core had formed,
ejecting rocky, iron-poor material from the outer shell into
orbit,'' Binder theorized. ``It was this material that collected to
form the moon.''

 &HT;    Truck driver in Amtrak wreck held probationary license
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark and Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOURBONNAIS, Ill. _ The driver of a flatbed truck struck by an
Amtrak train in rural Illinois on Monday night, leaving at least 13
people dead and 119 injured, was driving with a probationary
license after three traffic violations last year, Illinois
authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators in Bourbonnais, where the second-worst accident in
Amtrak's 27-year history occurred, said John Stokes of Manteno,
Ill., told them he didn't see any warning signals at the crossing
and tried to get out of the way of the oncoming train.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators were looking into whether the signal might have
malfunctioned, although emergency crews arriving shortly after the
accident said the warning lights were blinking and the gates were
partially down.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers continued to search for at least three people presumed
to be missing, focusing primarily on a double-decker sleeping car
near the front of the train that was crushed and burned in the
derailment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Illinois secretary of state's office
confirmed that Stokes, 58, was driving on a probationary license
after he received three speeding tickets within a year. He was
scheduled to have his driver's license suspended Jan. 25, but got
the probationary license after completing a four-hour safety class.
</P>
<P>
   Cy Gura, a safety engineer with the National Transportation
Safety Board team, said the driver told investigators he didn't see
the train or flashing warning lights until he had already started
driving his truck, loaded with steel, across the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very sad and upset. He felt he did whatever he thought he
could do to clear the train track but he didn't do it,'' Gura said.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials said 196 people had bought tickets on the City
of New Orleans train, but it was unclear whether all had actually
boarded, leading to confusion about how many people might be
missing. The New Orleans-bound train also carried 18 crew members
and two off-duty Amtrak workers.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers included about 20 teen-agers and their chaperones
from Clinton, Miss., who were returning home from a ski trip to
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, reports indicated 14 people had been killed, but a
National Transportation Safety Board official said at a news
conference Tuesday afternoon that the number of confirmed deaths
stood at 13.
</P>
<P>
   The City of New Orleans, a train made popular in the 1970s by a
song by that name recorded by Arlo Guthrie and written by Steve
Goodman, had been scheduled to arrive in New Orleans at 3:30 p.m.
Tuesday. The No. 59, as it also is known, makes a daily run from
Chicago with stops in Champaign, Ill., Memphis, Tenn., and Jackson,
Miss., among others.
</P>
<P>
   As emergency crews worked into the night Tuesday to find those
believed missing, hundreds of townspeople gathered to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The train departed Chicago at 8:03 p.m. Monday, three minutes
behind schedule. For reasons not immediately known, the train lost
35 minutes between Chicago and Homewood, where it arrived at 9:21
p.m., Amtrak officials said. The train left Homewood at 9:26 p.m.
bound for Kankakee. About 8 miles north of the station, the 14-car
train and its two locomotives struck a flatbed tractor trailer
truck loaded with steel used used to reinforce concrete.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the accident was a ``truck in the wrong place at
the wrong time,'' said Randy Myers, an official with the
Bourbonnais Fire Department.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing lights and crossing gates were operating when emergency
personnel arrived at the scene of the collision in Bourbonnais,
Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   The truck was leaving a nearby Birmingham Steel Co. yard, though
receptionist said the driver did not work for the company. The
Associated Press identified the driver as John R. Stokes, 58, of
Manteno.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Garchwait, a manager at Blain's Farm and Fleet, a retail
hardware store the length of a football field away from the
accident, said the area is a combination of light industry and
farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rebar seems to be the biggest industry here,'' Garchwait said.
</P>
<P>
   In the song ``The City of New Orleans,'' Arlo Guthrie sings
that:
</P>
<P>
   ``The train pulls out at Kankakee/Ross along past houses, farms
and fields.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be pretty much what the area is like,'' said
Garchwait, who returned Monday to the store, which had been used as
a triage area. ``It is very flat. It's a cash crop area. Corn.
Soybeans.''
</P>
<P>
   The temperature was about 40 degrees with light snow on the
ground that had no effect on the accident, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverside Medical Center treated 46 passengers. Thirty-four
were treated and released and 12 remained with more serious
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many were sleeping, totally relaxed and then tossed about,''
said Mary Thomson , a Riverside spokeswoman.

IRISH LEADER WHO GREW INTO ELOQUENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: This story was eliminated earlier but has been restored.)

 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ When he was campaigning for election as prime
minister in 1997, Bertie Ahern was disdained by many voters and
politicians as a lightweight who had risen from the working class
of Dublin and still spoke with a distinct North Side accent, which
turned ``th'' sounds into D's.
</P>
<P>
   He lacked gravitas, his detractors said, and would be something
of an embarrassment representing Ireland among better-spoken
presidents and prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern acknowledged with some humor that he had trouble
pronouncing words like ``growth'' and brushed up his diction. He
won the election, narrowly, and when he meets President Clinton at
the White House on St. Patrick's Day, accompanied by Celia Larkin,
his partner of 10 years, his better-spoken opponents will be back
here, restless and relatively powerless in the parliamentary
minority.
</P>
<P>
   Ahern, whose tongue rarely fails him now, ignores what his
supporters call ``the chattering classes'' of Dublin 4, an affluent
and well-educated section on the South Side.
</P>
<P>
   When he returns home next week, Ahern, 47, may be on the verge
of making Irish history as the prime minister to preside at the
completion of the Northern Ireland peace agreement and the official
end to 30 years of sectarian violence in the predominantly
Protestant British province.
</P>
<P>
   But he may also be forced out of office and into an early
election by a growing corruption scandal involving some of his
allies in the Fianna Fail (Warriors of Destiny) Party.
</P>
<P>
   Before he left Dublin last week, he sounded distinctly
statesmanlike on the peace effort, saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``If the new agreement succeeds, it will see the two traditions
working together both in Northern Ireland and on the island for the
first time in 200 years. Every right-thinking person wants to see
the back of conflict for good and to create a new and happier
future for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home nobody is worrying about his accent or about the fact
that he is not married to his partner, Ms. Larkin. His 10-year
relationship with Ms. Larkin, a former Fianna Fail worker, has
never become a serious political issue here. But his other
political problems are real.
</P>
<P>
   To form a coalition government in 1997, he needed the support of
the smaller Progressive Democrats Party. The prospects for a full
five-year term were good. The economy was booming, and in a month
Ahern had helped broker a cease-fire by the Irish Republican Army.
</P>
<P>
   That paved the way for the accord in April to give minority
Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland added power and to give
overwhelmingly Catholic Ireland added influence in the affairs of
Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Then late last year, Ahern was suddenly reminded that political
trouble was as easy to find as the rain. Some of his party's most
prominent elected officials were accused of having taken huge
bribes from executives.
</P>
<P>
   One businessman, former Prime Minister Charles J. Haughey, who
had fostered Ahern's career and once called him ``the most devious
and cunning of them all,'' was shown to have amassed wealth,
impossible on an elected official's salary, including horses, a
yacht, a farm and his own island off the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Haughey, according to sworn testimony, had received nearly $3
million from Dunnes, the largest chain of department stores in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   His coalition partner, Mary Harney, leader of the Progressive
Democrats, which split from Fianna Fail 14 years ago over
corruption, said she might quit the government. That would lead to
an election well before the constitutional deadline of mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Irish people appear to believe that although
Ahern is personally honest and lives modestly, he must answer for
the past corruption of his party. Many people apparently feel that
as a high party official, and a professional accountant, he had to
have had some knowledge of what Haughey and other colleagues were
up to.
</P>
<P>
   A political consultant and a former ranking Foreign Ministry
official, Fergus Finlay, said to survive Ahern might have to find
another coalition partner in the next election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bertie Ahern,'' Finlay said in an interview, ``has made a
genuine effort to clear up his party's act and turn Fianna Fail
into an organization other parties can do business with. But he's
trying to do all that without confronting the ghosts of his party's
past. And that's a recipe for failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern would, of course, disagree. In the midst of the
disclosures about some of his former allies, he said: ``I am a
credible person. I am an honest person.''

 &HT;    Reporters told to reveal sources
 &HT;    By Jay Croft
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The judge in Richard Jewell's defamation suit against
The Atlanta Journal-Constitution again Tuesday ordered reporters to
name sources for articles about the former Centennial Olympic Park
bombing suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County State Court Judge John Mather originally ruled
last April that the journalists must identify law enforcement
officials who gave them information about Jewell. But the
newspaper's attorneys refused. And Jewell's lawyers asked the judge
to rule in Jewell's favor without a trial and to hold the
newspaper's attorneys in contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Mather declined to do either Tuesday, but Lin Wood, Jewell's
lead lawyer, praised the latest court order and blasted the
newspapers for holding back information on sources.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper's attorney, Peter Canfield, was out of town
Tuesday and could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mather gave reporters 60 days to reveal sources or face possible
civil contempt, which can include being jailed until they name
names. The newspaper could appeal a contempt order if one is
issued.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal-Constitution was the first news organization to
report that Jewell was being investigated in the July 1996 bombing
that killed one woman and injured 111 people. The former security
guard at first was hailed as a hero for spotting the knapsack that
held the bomb. Months after the Games, he was cleared of any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Jewell sued the Journal-Constitution in January 1997, claiming
he was libeled ``in a series of false and defamatory articles which
portrayed him as an individual with a bizarre employment history
and an aberrant personality who was likely guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood has said he is seeking tens of millions of dollars in
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper has insisted its reporting was fair and accurate.
Canfield said last year that disobeying the first court order was
essential for appeals. Further, the sources would be hurt if the
newspaper names them, Canfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Mather wrote Tuesday that he ordered the newspaper to name
sources ``in the interest of revealing the truth'' and said the
refusal to do so has complicated ``what is, in essence, a simple
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Mather wrote that reporters are not protected from naming their
sources when the reporters are parties to a lawsuit or criminal
case.
</P>
<P>
   That privilege extends only when reporters are not directly
involved in the case. Mather cited a March 8 state Supreme Court
decision that he said supports ``what is apparent'' in state law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our press enjoys no greater constitutional freedom under our
First Amendment than any citizen,'' Mather said. ``A member of the
press . . . may not adhere to only those directives of the court
which conform to their subjective interpretations of the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood said Mather was giving the journalists a ``final
opportunity to obey the law'' before imposing ``extremely harsh''
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't test the accuracy and reliability (of the newspaper's
reporting) unless we talk to the sources,'' he said.

RUSSIA OFFERS TO CURTAIL NUCLEAR TRADE WITH IRAN FOR END TO
SANCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
 (wg) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia has offered to curtail nuclear cooperation with
Iran if Washington ends sanctions against two leading Russian
nuclear research centers, Russia's Atomic Energy minister said in
an interview on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal came as Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov prepares to
travel to Washington next week for critical talks on security
issues and to appeal for billions of dollars in credits from the
International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of Russian proposal is to remove a major irritant in
relations with the West and unlock valuable contracts to Russia's
hard-strapped nuclear institutes.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Clinton administration officials said that Atomic Energy
Minister Yevgeni Adamov had presented the plan to American
officials last week and that the two sides were trying to hammer
out an agreement before the Primakov trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help with the overall tone of our relationship,'' a
senior administration official said. ``Adamov is taking the
initiative and appears to have Primakov's support. But we still
have a paper to negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Adamov's proposal addresses one of Washington's main fears: that
Russia may expand its nuclear cooperation with Teheran.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is already planning to build several nuclear power
reactors at Bushire, Iran. While American officials object to that
project, they are even more worried that Russia will also provide
Iran with heavy water and graphite reactors, which are especially
useful in producing plutonium for nuclear bombs. Those fears led
the United States to impose sanctions in January against the two
leading research centers: the Scientific Research and Design
Institute for Power Technology, also known as Nikiet, and the
Mendeleyev University of Chemical Technology.
</P>
<P>
   Russian nuclear cooperation with Teheran is also a major Israeli
concern.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions were especially embarrassing for the Russians
since Adamov used to be the head of Nikiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nikiet is really at the center of our concern,'' said a senior
American expert. ``It is the principal Russian entity that could
provide assistance beyond Bushire. If we can address Nikiet, we
have made a very significant step.''
</P>
<P>
   Adamov's plan, in theory, would do precisely that. Adamov said
he wanted to sign a document in Washington affirming that Nikiet
has cut off all contact with Iran. In return, the United States
would lift sanctions against Nikiet. A similar agreement, Adamov
said, could be worked out for Mendeleyev University.
</P>
<P>
   A procedure would also be established to discuss future
American-Russian disputes about the provision of Russian nuclear
technology to Iran, according to Adamov's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia would not abandon its plan to build nuclear reactors
at Bushire.
</P>
<P>
   Adamov said he had already instructed Nikiet to break its ties
with Iran, although American officials said there were signs that
the contacts were continuing.

 &HT;    Lyons resigns as Baptist leader
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ With a prison term looming for his
conviction on racketeering charges, a tearful Rev. Henry Lyons
apologized to African-Americans Tuesday and resigned as president
of one of the nation's largest black Baptist denominations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to say to St. Petersburg, to Florida, to black
Americans all over this country that I'm just so sorry about all of
this,'' Lyons said, his voice choking with emotion. ``I'm truly
regretful. I hate that I hurt so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyons, 57, was convicted two weeks ago in a Florida state court
of stealing some $4 million from corporations that wanted to do
business with the National Baptist Convention USA. Prosecutors
convinced an all-white jury that he spent much of the money on
luxury items for himself and three alleged mistresses. He faces up
to seven years in prison on the state charges.
</P>
<P>
   He is also due in court today on separate federal charges that
include extortion and income tax evasion. He is expected to accept
a plea bargain in hopes of winning a reduction in the 18-20-year
federal prison term he could face.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons tendered his resignation to the convention's board of
directors at a special meeting at his St. Petersburg church.
Although all but three of the 230 board members voted to keep him
as president, Lyons insisted on stepping down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I had to resign, I should resign and I did resign,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the board members stood steadfastly by Lyons throughout
his two-year ordeal, insisting he was a victim of
racially-insensitive media investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Their support didn't waiver with Lyons' resignation, as the
group discussed a motion to continue paying Lyons his $100,000 per
year salary for the next five years. The matter was referred to a
committee for further consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The board's vice president, the Rev. Stuart Cureton of
Greenville, S.C., was elevated to serve the remaining months of
Lyons' five-year term, which expires in September. But a scramble
to succeed Lyons in the powerful post began immediately, with
several candidates handing out press releases outside Lyons'
church.
</P>
<P>
   About two dozen opponents of Lyons held a news conference
outside the convention's headquarters in Nashville calling for a
new convention constitution to ensure that Lyons' successor be more
accountable. ``We will never again be subjected to one-man rule,''
said the Rev. Kenneth Whalum, minister of Mount Olive Baptist
Church in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation caps a tumultuous scandal that began when Lyons'
wife set fire to a $700,000 waterfront home that Lyons had
purchased with Bernice Edwards, his co-defendant in the state trial
and the former director of public relations for the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards was acquitted of all state charges, but still faces
federal charges of income tax fraud and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors in the state trial took several weeks to lay out
their case against Lyons, tracing a trail of huge checks from
credit card, insurance and funeral service companies that wanted
access to the convention's membership list.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons agreed to provide the list even though he knew there was
no such document and that ministers would be extremely reluctant to
release their rolls even to the convention, prosecutors argued.
</P>
<P>
   The paper trail also showed the money went for furs, jewelry,
expensive cars and other luxury items, which Lyons bought for
himself, his family, Edwards and two women who testified they had
affairs with him.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most condemning was evidence that Lyons took most of a
$250,000 donation from the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish group,
that was intended to rebuild black churches burned in a string of
arsons.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons later repaid that money, but by then criminal
investigations were well under way.
</P>
<P>
   Lyons gave his first extensive interview since his conviction to
ABC Television's Connie Chung Monday night. He apologized in the
broadcast, saying he felt he had ``disgraced the black community
and black America.''
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted spending the money on luxuries, saying ``I was
like a kid at the fair, and just wanted to go out, touching and
tasting everything, kind of running without a great deal of control
in my life.''

 MOSCOW: were continuing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Strapped for cash and eager to maintain a modicum of cooperation
with Washington, Iran is just one issue where the Russians are
hoping for a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise has already been worked out concerning 16 advanced
IBM computers the Russians obtained in 1996 in violation of
American export controls.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians obtained the IBM computers using Moscow-based
middlemen and installed them in the closed nuclear city of
Arzamas-16, a design center for Russia's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration initially asked that the computers be
returned. Under the compromise, the computers have quietly been
moved from a military site to a civilian site within the closed
city: a building used by Sberbank, a government bank.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM computers are to be used for civilian purposes, such as
the development of commercial software, according to the new
arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise plan was overseen by Siegfried Hecker, the former
director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, who visited Russia
to help put it in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there will be sufficient access, physically or
electronically, to assure ourselves that the computers are for
civilian use,'' Hecker said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   American officials hope to work out a similar arrangement for an
SP-2 IBM computer, which American officials suspect has also been
delivered to Arzamas, to be used in a high-performance computer
system from Silicon Graphics, which is at the Russian nuclear
design center at Chelyabinsk.
</P>
<P>
   There has been progress on other some fronts, as well. Russian
and American officials hopes to conclude arrangements that would
facilitate the sale to international companies of billions of
dollars worth of low-enriched uranium derived from Russian nuclear
warheads. Negotiations were conducted in 1993 but an agreement has
been thwarted by commercial and legal problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian government has also made encouraging statements
about the need to pass the START-2 treaty, slashing strategic arms.
</P>
<P>
   Iran, however, has been the most contentious issue, and the
Russians are eager to see the sanctions lifted. If they are not
removed, the sanctions would deprive Nikiet of several million
dollars worth of work, a considerable setback for the cash-poor
institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The contracts which we have had have been suspended,'' Adamov
complained. ``Those which were prepared have not been signed, and
the partners who work with us are scared and are avoiding
discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, however, also has an interest in resolving
the issue. Nikiet, which designed the type of reactor involved in
the accident at Chernobyl, is working to improve the safety of
Russia's nuclear power complex, a task Washington has supported.
</P>
<P>
   One American-financed project that was suspended as a result of
the sanctions involves the installation of the special display
system in Russian reactors to help pinpoint the cause of a nuclear
accident.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Department officials have been so worried about the
safety implications that they secretly appealed to the White House,
asking that some exceptions be made to the sanctions so that
important safety work could go forward, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</P>
<P>
   Russia has also taken some steps to cut off contracts on the
sale of missile technology to Iran, but much more needs to be done,
American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One big issue is whether Nikiet has, in fact, stopped its
contacts with Iran, as Adamov contends it did.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the past contacts, Adamov said Nikiet had prepared a
contract for the sale of a research reactor to Iran. The Mendeleyev
Institute, he insisted, has provided some basic unclassified
information to Iran on heavy water technology, while recommending
that Iran purchase a light-water reactor.
</P>
<P>
   Adamov said the Russian government had rejected his proposal to
sell the research reactor to Iran and that Nikiet no longer has
dealings with the Iranians. That, he insisted, should lay the basis
for an agreement in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe in American pragmatism,'' Adamov said. ``This is
a chance to check if these people are pragmatic, though I am afraid
of some angry people in the State Department. They are somewhat
narrow-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said that Washington needed to
confirm that the contacts had really been broken off before
sanctions were lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to accept this on face value,'' the official
said. ``They will have to provide assurances that they have really
cut this relationship off. There is a lot of heavy lifting to do
between now and the Primakov meeting.''

CURBS ON MANAGED CARE STILL DIVIDE TWO PARTIES
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Of the issues likely to draw serious attention from
Congress this year, managed health care would seem to be
particularly ripe for action. Republicans and Democrats agree that
Americans need guarantees of better treatment from health plans and
that most voters would applaud steps in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   But to say the two parties have that much in common is not to
say they see eye to eye. As lawmakers begin anew this year to try
to craft _ and, perchance, to pass _ a patients' bill of rights,
many of the same obstacles that tripped them up in previous years
again stand in their path.
</P>
<P>
   The parties remain split by philosophical differences about how
extensively the federal government should regulate insurers, who
are poised to marshal at least as many millions of dollars and
hundreds of lobbyists to block the legislation as they have in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps just as significant, members of both parties are already
engaged in intense political gamesmanship, each side intent on
snaring credit for any bill and suspicious of the other's desire to
actually enact a law.
</P>
<P>
   When a Senate committee headed by James Jeffords, R-Vt., starts
hammering out the details of a bill on Wednesday, the degree of
consensus and the depths of division between the parties should
become abundantly clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the first test of the new Congress on health care,''
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts said after that panel, the
Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, held a hearing
into the issue last week.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the committee's senior Democrat, said that the steps
the majority Republicans had proposed were pathetically
insufficient and that Democrats would try to amend any Republican
bill that failed to do enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're enacting a law,'' Kennedy said at the hearing, ``not a
sieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreshadowing the friction to come, Jeffords offered a droll
retort. ``It looks like we'll have an interesting markup next
week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats alike have introduced comprehensive
bills, and Kennedy and other Democrats will use the committee
process this week to try to tweak the Republican effort under
consideration so that it incorporates provisions and language
favored by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican and Democratic bills give patients expanded ways
of appealing an insurer's refusal to cover treatments, promote the
ability of patients under managed care to use the nearest emergency
room and permit doctors to discuss with patients their full range
of options.
</P>
<P>
   But while Republicans would leave initial judgments about the
medical necessity of treatments in the hands of health maintenance
organizations and other insurers, Democrats would empower patients'
doctors to make those decisions, subject to some federal
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Democrats' plan would apply to all Americans with
private insurance, the Republican bill would affect only the
covered employees of fully self-insured companies. In addition, the
Democrats would make it easier and more fruitful than under current
law for patients to sue managed care providers for denial of
treatment. Republicans oppose such a liability provision,
forecasting an increase in the expense of health coverage that
might force businesses to scale back what they offer employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the best thing we can do is make sure a patient is
cured,'' Jeffords said in an interview. ``They'd rather have a good
lawsuit.''
</P>
<P>
   In the House, some of the same points divide Democrats and
Republicans, but a slightly different contest is taking shape.
While Democrats and some Republicans are pushing for a
comprehensive bill, the Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, has tentatively
signaled an interest in passing a series of more limited bills that
isolate specific proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hastert has not fully committed to that approach, aides
said that by teasing out those aspects on which both parties agree,
he could make sure that some legislation passes, inoculating House
Republicans against charges of do-nothingism.
</P>
<P>
   But even some members of Hastert's own party dislike that
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, we'll run out of time before we get to the
hard parts,'' said Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., who has introduced
a comprehensive bill similar to Democratic proposals. ``And if we
don't get to any of the hard parts, you're not going to get any
congratulations for the easy parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their disagreements, many Republicans and Democrats have
expressed real hope for legislation this year, tracing their
optimism to the early beginning of the debate. But they must get
past the logjams inevitably created by addressing any issue as
intricate as this.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it takes seven years to produce legislation that is
complex,'' Norwood said with an audible sigh. ``This is complex,
and we're only in our fifth year.''

BRAZIL STOCKS DEFY RECESSION'S DAMAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ After spending much of 1999 so far
straddling the line between pessimism and panic, Brazilian markets
are staging a cautious rally that may be the first sign the
economy, Latin America's largest, is starting to creep its way out
of recession.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the benchmark Bovespa stock index, the main
barometer of investor sentiment, moved into positive territory
measured in U.S. dollar terms. And when measured in the Brazilian
currency, the real, stocks have risen 57 percent in two and a half
months.
</P>
<P>
   The last two days have been notable, with the Bovespa index
gaining 8.77 percent on Monday and a further 2.35 percent on
Tuesday, to close here at 10,658.39.
</P>
<P>
   The real, which spent much of January and February battered by
concern over a possible return in Brazil to the turbulent times of
hyperinflation, has strengthened nearly 15 percent in the last two
weeks to settle in New York Tuesday at 1.87 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement is partly the result of investor optimism after
pledges by foreign financial institutions to renew credit lines
totaling about $23 billion to Brazilian borrowers over the next six
months. The foreign banks acted after pleas by the new president of
this country's central bank, Arminio Fraga, a former fund manager
for George Soros.
</P>
<P>
   Lending rates, though, remain extremely high by world standards.
On Tuesday, Bloomberg News reported, the overnight futures contract
for May rose to 42.06 percent from 41.49 percent on Monday. Bonds
were mixed, with the widely traded C bond yielding 16.04 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the signs that inflation may not be accelerating as fast as
once feared have helped alleviate some investor concerns. ``We're
witnessing a shift in sentiment from very dark forecasts to a
scenario of a long, slow recovery,'' said Octavio de Barros, chief
economist here for Banco Bilbao Vizcaya. De Barros, like most other
economists at large banks, said he saw the brunt of Brazil's
economic difficulty occurring in the first half of the year, with a
recovery, if an anemic one, starting late this year or early in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Banks' willingness to keep lending to some companies came on the
back of an endorsement last week by the International Monetary Fund
of the government's plan to narrow the budget deficit. The IMF
agreed to provide a $9.3 billion installment from its $41.5 billion
aid package, some of which the central bank can spend to combat
currency speculation. ``There's a realization in the markets that
the recession we're experiencing is preparing us to emerge
stronger, with a more vibrant export sector and improved public
accounts,'' said Fernao Bracher, president of Banco
BBA-Creditanstalt, in a telephone interview from Paris.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian currency, though recently improved, has lost 35
percent of its value since the government abandoned market support
for it two months ago. Yet the severity of the recession brought on
by devaluation is one of the main reasons why some analysts foresee
resumed growth so soon. Dampened activity _ with economists
forecasting output to shrink as much as 6 percent in the first
quarter _ should translate into lower consumer demand for most
goods, keeping inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood that inflation will not gallop out of control, as
it did in the early '90s, when price increases of 60 percent a
month were common, allows consumers and companies to plan with more
certainty. The government's pledge not to let salaries be regularly
adjusted for inflation provides additional assurance, said Julio
Ziegelmann of BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is too early to tell whether the new-found optimism on
trading floors foretells any change in the bleak economic reality
that many Brazilians are expected to confront in coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment, hovering near a record at 8.4 percent, is seen
rising as high as 10 percent in the next few months. And according
to a study by Marcio Pocmann, an economist at the University of
Campinas, per-capita income should fall 6.4 percent this year,
steeper than declines in recessions in the '80s and early '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market is not that accurate an indicator,'' said
Guido Mantega, an economist affiliated with the opposition Workers
Party. ``People are getting poorer.''

RENO TO ANNOUNCE OPPOSITION TO RENEWAL OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno has decided to announce
at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that the independent counsel
statute is ``structurally flawed'' and should be abandoned, a
striking reversal from her past embrace of the 21-year old
Watergate-era reform law, government officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After much reflection, we have decided reluctantly to oppose
reauthorization of the act,'' said a final draft of written
testimony that Reno had prepared to deliver at a Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   During her six years as attorney general, Reno's position on the
law has hardened as she tried to carry out the statute, and she has
come to view it as rigid, unwieldy and unfair, law enforcement
officials said. In a more personal sense, Reno's shift on the law
illuminates a rite of passage for the Miami prosecutor who was
tossed with little preparation into the brutal combat over politics
and law in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Reno had often watched in frustration and
anger at what she viewed as serious prosecutorial abuses committed
during inquiries led by several independent counsels, including
Kenneth Starr, and had concluded that some of these investigations
had spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other single issue, the debate over independent
counsels has defined Reno's tenure at the Justice Department. The
law requires Reno to refer cases to outside counsels, chosen by a
three-judge panel, whenever there are specific and credible charges
of criminal wrongdoing against any one of about two dozen top
officials in the executive branch of government, including the
president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
   At first, some of Reno's aides hoped the law might work as it
was designed to keep the Justice Department out of political
controversies. Instead, the aides said the law has had the opposite
effect, repeatedly plunging Reno into raw partisan battles that
left her deeply scarred and undercut her image of integrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was just a constant frustration on her part as
she tried to apply the statute, which she came to view as nothing
more than a rigid set of rules that sometimes defied common
prosecutorial sense,'' said one former Justice Department official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``That frustration was
compounded by the fact that some of the special prosecutors that
were appointed ended up taking a very simple, narrow issue and
turned it into a long, drawn-out investigation that often seemed to
stray from the original mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for the first time, Reno will publicly express her
dissatisfaction with the law, echoing themes voiced two weeks ago
by her deputy, Eric H. Holder Jr. He announced at a House hearing
that the Justice Department was opposed to renewing the statute
when it expires on June 30. Holder said that cases now referred to
independent counsels could be handled by career prosecutors at the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In applying the statute, which gives the attorney general the
sole authority to decide whether an independent counsel should be
appointed, Reno has found herself buffeted between Republicans in
Congress and Democrats in the Clinton administration. Republicans
hammered her for what they viewed as bias in her refusal to refer
to an independent counsel the swirl of campaign finance issues that
arose from the 1996 Clinton re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also expressed unhappiness and frustration with
Reno. They complained that she timidly acquiesced to Republican
demands when she sought appointments of independent counsels to
investigate Cabinet officers like Mike Espy, the former agriculture
secretary; Henry Cisneros, the former housing secretary; Alexis
Herman, the former energy secretary; Bruce Babbit, the interior
secretary, and Ron Brown, the commerce secretary who died in a
plane crash in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Reno endorsed the law. When she testified before the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee in May 1993, she strongly
urged Congress to renew the legislation. She said that it was
preferable for disinterested, outside prosecutors, free from the
taint of politics, to conduct investigations of high-level
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are legitimate concerns about the costs and
burdens associated with the act, I have concluded that these are
far, far outweighed by the need for the act and the public
confidence it fosters,'' Reno testified.
</P>
<P>
   Reno quickly discovered that the law provided little respite
from political controversy. In July 1994, one day after President
Clinton signed the bill reauthorizing the law, Reno asked the
appointing panel of three appellate judges to reinstate Robert B.
Fiske Jr., who had been selected by Reno as chief Whitewater
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Aides at the time said Reno was surprised and dismayed when the
three-judge panel dumped Fiske and instead appointed Starr. ``She
thought a good deal of Fiske,'' the former Justice Department
official said. ``There was no question that in our mind Fiske was
independent, and we did not think it was necessary for Starr to be
appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after Starr took over the Whitewater inquiry, the panel
named Donald C. Smaltz to investigate Espy. Reno's decision to seek
an independent counsel in that case was a highly technical one
because there was no evidence that Espy had performed any favors
for the gifts he was accused of accepting from companies regulated
by the Agriculture Department, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and her aides assumed that Smaltz's inquiry would be
concluded in a matter of months. But Smaltz built up a large
prosecutorial office and, in August 1997, his prosecutors charged
Espy in a 39-count indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was deeply displeased by Smaltz's tactics, the officials
said, concluding that no career federal prosecutor would have ever
subjected Espy to such scrutiny. In December 1998, four years after
Smaltz's appointment, a jury acquitted Espy of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Reno became especially frustrated with Starr's tactics as the
Lewinsky investigation progressed. Reno, and several senior Justice
Department lawyers, the officials said, became troubled by what
they viewed as possible violations of Justice Department guidelines
by Starr's prosecutors, from his decision to require Secret Service
agents to testify before a grand jury to allegations of leaks of
grand jury material to reporters. She has now decided to
investigate those tactics.

   The following stories are part of four-part series on Lonnie
Holley, the Alabama folk artist who has endured nothing but trouble
since he was one of the stars of the Olympic Arts Festival in 1996.
Holley, one of the South's most important folk artists, has known a
world of trouble in his 49 years. But nothing has prepared him for
the random misfortunes that have bedeviled him like Job over the
past couple of years. This is a story about a man who has struggled
against great odds to make his art and to keep his family together.

<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART1 _ COLUMBIANA, Ala. _ We start with Holley's
arrest, then back up and tell the story of how he got there.
(Auchmutey, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 90.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEHOLLEY-PART2 _ HARPERSVILLE, Va. _ We look at Holley and
his family and their current troubles. Holley has raised five
children by himself, and by all accounts did a great job against
the odds. But in recent years, his kids have had all manner of
problems. And it could get worse. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 58.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIEH0LLEY-PART3 _ BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ We look at Holley's
career in the context of the world of folk art. The reasons for
folk artists' struggles are complicated but the results are the
same: renowned, respected artists who wouldn't qualify for an auto
loan. We also look at the efforts of various dealers and do-gooders
to help him and his family. (Auchmutey, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) 50.
</P>
<P>
   LONNIE-HOLLEY-PART4 _ We sort out the endings, happy and
otherwise. The first good news, it seemed, Holley had gotten in
years was that juvenile authorities had been so impressed with
Holley's 16-year old son Kubra that they took it upon themselves to
nominate him for the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a magnet program
in Birmingham for gifted children from across the state. While
oldest son Ezekial appears headed for prison, and third son A.J.
for juvenile boot camp. And Holley? He'll probably plead guilty to
reduced charges and get probation, and he's finally painting again.

SENATE CALLS FOR MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM AFTER DEMOCRATS DROP
OPPOSITION
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Senate Democrats abandoned
their longstanding opposition on Tuesday to a politically popular
bill that calls for a national defense against limited long-range
missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The actions all but assure overwhelming approval of the overall
bill, which declares it to be United States policy to field an
antimissile system against ballistic missile threats from rogue
nations like North Korea and Iran as soon as ``technologically
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration dropped its threatened veto by President
Clinton after the Senate passed a compromise amendment that
Democrats say insures that any antimissile system will not
interfere with arms-control negotiations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A final vote in the Senate is expected on Wednesday. The House
is scheduled to debate and likely pass a similar, bipartisan
missile-defense bill on Thursday. While neither bill authorizes a
specific system or appropriates money to build it, the measures, if
enacted, represent the government's most forceful support for the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that the Senate compromise defuses
a potent national security campaign issue that Republicans could
have wielded against Democrats, and tries to finesse a nettlesome
issue before the Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov visits
Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long opposed an American antimissile system, and
conditioned further reductions in its nuclear arsenal on
Washington's compliance with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty. Fielding an antimissile system would require changes in
that pact, and Russia's leaders have expressed alarm in recent
months over the revived plans.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise amendment, passed 99 to 0, asserts that the
United States will continue to negotiate cuts in Russia's nuclear
forces, which Democrats interpret as language that is inextricably
linked to the ABM Treaty. But Republicans rejected any explicit
language that would have tied deployment of an antimissile system
to adherence to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said that by failing to incorporate language that would
specifically protect the treaty, the overall measure could face
opposition from Russian leaders and the Russian parliament, which
is considering ratification of the second strategic arms reduction
treaty known as Start-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration appeared satisfied with the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were the final bill, we'd accept it,'' Robert Bell, a
senior national security official at the White House, said Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The action marks a significant departure for Senate Democrats,
who twice last year narrowly blocked the same measure from coming
to the Senate floor, and for the White House, which had wielded a
veto threat, arguing that it was bad policy to deploy such a costly
system based only on technological merit.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has since picked up bipartisan support in the wake
of missile tests in the last year by North Korea and Iran, and
recent disclosures that China may have stolen nuclear secrets from
an American weapons laboratory that would enhance Beijing's
long-range missile fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill recognizes the threat is real and that the world has
changed,'' said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., who helped broker the
compromise amendment with Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.

   BOURBONNAIS, Ill. _ They were just settling in for the night,
comfortably ensconced in the first-class double-decker sleeper car
of a train with a famous name, The City of New Orleans. They had
boarded in Chicago, just 90 minutes before, and their train, its
legend celebrated in a popular American folk song, was due to pull
into New Orleans in the late afternoon of the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But in a single horrifying instant, everything changed. At 9:55
p.m. CT Monday, Amtrak's City of New Orleans smashed into a
semi-trailer truck at a railroad crossing in this rural town about
55 miles south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, 13 passengers had been found dead, all of
them in the sleeper car. Officials said Tuesday night that four
people were unaccounted for. There were no signs they were alive.
</P>
<P>
   In what was being called one of the worst accidents in Amtrak's
history, the train derailed and the first five cars were mangled,
twisted like empty soda cans. Flames burst out, visible from miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure at this point I can collect my thoughts enough to
tell you what was going through my mind,'' said Michael
Harshbarger, chief of the tiny Bourbonnais fire department. ``I
don't think I've ever seen anything quite like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials were releasing few details about the dead, whose
bodies were being kept in an old lumber company warehouse turned
makeshift morgue. They confirmed, however, that four of those
killed were a woman, her grandchild and two other children, all
from Nesbit, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, June Bonnin, was a cancer survivor in her late 40s
who had opened a bed and breakfast with her husband while she was
still recovering. She was traveling with her granddaughter, Jessica
Whitaker, 12, two of the girl's friends and her daughter, so that
the girls could shop in Chicago at a store that carried American
Girl dolls and their accessories, which feature historic details.
The daughter, Ashley Bonnin, who is Jessica's aunt, was injured in
the crash and hospitalized in Kankakee, a few miles south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bonnin was among 114 people who were injured, at least 11
critically, authorities said. They were rescued along with the rest
of the train's surviving 216 passengers and crew members. Among
those passengers was a group of 20 teen-agers from Mississippi and
their chaperones, returning from a ski trip to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, who was driving on a probationary permit after
his license had been suspended because of speeding tickets, was
heading east across the train tracks when the train hit. His truck
was packed with heavy steel bars from a nearby steel factory. He
was routinely treated and released, officials said. The collision
shattered the trailer section of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day Tuesday, rescue crews that had rushed here
from miles away were still combing through the tangled metal,
hampered by piles of crushed debris and the need to make sure the
wreckage would not shift and endanger the rescuers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The once-gleaming sleeper car had been slammed up onto one of
the train's two locomotives. It was broken down the middle and
ravaged by fire, Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interior is filled with debris from the fire, and it's
necessary to search through that debris to find victims,''
Harshbarger said. ``It's simply a matter of digging with the gloved
hand, turning pieces of debris over in order to find someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Allen, 80, who was traveling with his wife from their home
in Winona, Minn., to visit their son in Florida, described the
frightening confusion of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this violent jerking motion and all of a sudden we
just stopped and the lights went out,'' said Allen, who was riding
in one of the last of the train's 14 cars and had just settled down
to read a book. He heard a loud, grating noise and then, he said,
``All we could see was the smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash was one of the deadliest in Amtrak's 26-year history.
The worst was a 1993 crash that killed 47 people when a train
plunged into a bayou near Mobile, Ala. In 1987, two trains collided
near Chase, Md., killing 16.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
arrived Tuesday morning. In addition to investigating the accident,
the board will coordinate efforts to help the families of the dead
and injured, as it does after plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, John Ralph Stokes, 58, of Manteno, Ill., a
town near the accident site, had had his commercial driver's
license suspended in January because he had received three speeding
tickets in 12 months, said David Druker, a spokesman for the
Illinois secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   However, since this was Stokes' first suspension, he was able to
take a safety class and receive a temporary probationary permit.
Barring any problems, he would have received his regular license
back on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was driving legally,'' Druker said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Wykle, the administrator of the Federal Highway
Administration, said the agency would investigate the
safety-compliance record of the company Stokes was driving for,
Melco Transfer Inc. of Peotone, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the door or the telephone at Stokes' house on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Cy Gura, a safety engineer with the National
Transportation Safety Board, told The Associated Press that Stokes
had told authorities that he did not see the train or warning
lights until he had already started driving across the tracks.
Later Tuesday afternoon, safety board officials would not confirm
that account.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, held a press
conference Tuesday to say that he had been briefed on the
investigation and believed that the truck driver was trying to beat
the train by driving around the crossing gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engineer said he saw the lights flashing, he saw the
barriers down, and then he saw the truck stop and try to get around
it,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Illinois Central Railroad, which manages the
railroad crossing, said the crossing was equipped with gates, two
signal lights and a bell, which were functioning properly Monday
night, based on an analysis of a computer chip that records the
previous 3,000 times the crossing equipment functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every confidence that they were working last night,''
said the spokesman, Jack Burke. He said the blinking lights begin
to flash five seconds before the gates come down, and that the
gates start to come down about 26 seconds before the train gets to
the crossing. He said it would not have been possible for the truck
to get trapped by the closing gates, because the gates would have
hit the truck and broken.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three previous fatal accidents at this railroad
crossing, in 1964, 1968 and 1988. State officials say that is a
relatively good safety record, given the number of trains that
cross the intersection _ about 40 a day, traveling at speeds
between 25 and 79 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Jolene Molitoris, administrator of the Federal Railroad
Administration, said Tuesday that the crossing was considered a
good intersection. The agency's records indicate that the road
crossing the tracks is angled to give drivers a clear view of
oncoming trains.
</P>
<P>
   A City of New Orleans train passes this way every night, pulling
out of Chicago at about 8 p.m. It makes a few stops in Illinois,
stops in Memphis, Tenn., and virtually turns into a local train in
Mississippi, until it reaches New Orleans at 3:30 p.m. the
following day. Another City of New Orleans train makes the same
trip in reverse every day.
</P>
<P>
   The City of New Orleans was the main northbound train of the
great black migration from the South in the 1940s and 1950s. And it
was celebrated in a folk song written by Steve Goodman and made
famous by Arlo Guthrie. The song croons about men dealing cards in
the club car, mothers rocking their sleeping babies and the train
``passin' towns that have no names, freight yards full of old black
men, and the graveyards of rusted automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The chorus _ ``Good Morning America, how are you?'' _
memorialized the romance of the railroad age.
</P>
<P>
   The modern-day City of New Orleans is a comfortable ride,
especially in the sleeping car, where passengers have a
``hospitality hour,'' a morning paper delivered to them, and a
24-hour on-call attendant who can ``order you a night-cap if
wished,'' Amtrak's literature says.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board officials said they had
interviewed the truck driver and the train engineer and sent the
train's black box to Chicago to be analyzed. They plan to retest
the crossing gates and lights and the sensor on the tracks that
trips the gates.
</P>
<P>
   They said the investigation was complicated by the presence of
two cars on the side tracks, one full of steel and the other full
of furnace residue from a steel plant. The cars had been struck in
the derailment and were making the search for evidence more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for the first time in a railroad accident, the safety
board deployed a counseling team to work with the survivors, an
approach adopted after a fatal airline crash in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a stiff winter wind, rescue workers clambered on
top of the up-ended and fractured train cars, searching for any
glimpse of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   Some had worked all night, helping the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were coming off the train searching for their
family members,'' said Karen Brzezicki, a firefighter and paramedic
for the Bourbonnais Fire Department who was one of the first
workers on the scene. ``That was the hardest part, people searching
for their children. This is one of those things you don't want to
see and you hope you never have to see again.''

ADVISORY PANEL DISBANDS WITHOUT AGREEING ON WAYS TO SAVE MEDICARE

 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal advisory commission searching for ways to
preserve Medicare disbanded Tuesday night in disagreement, just
three hours after President Clinton denounced its work and said he
would devise a proposal of his own as an alternative.
</P>
<P>
   The commission ended its work without endorsing any
recommendations to avert a financial crisis in the program, which
provides health insurance for 39 million Americans who are elderly
or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member commission, headed by Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,
fell one vote short of the 11 votes needed to approve a final
report. Ten commission members _ eight Republicans and two
Democrats _ voted for radical changes that would convert Medicare
into an arena for competition among public and private health
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Sad but not surprised, Breaux said, ``We have advanced the
Medicare debate in a very significant way.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress created the commission in 1997, expecting that it would
propose the difficult and perhaps politically unpopular choices
needed to insure the program's solvency. Medicare will almost
certainly become an issue in the next presidential campaign.
Democrats can portray themselves as defenders of Medicare, offering
new coverage for prescription drugs, while Republicans will
criticize Clinton and other Democrats as thwarting efforts to stave
off the insolvency of the Medicare trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux and Rep. Bill Thomas of California, the leading
Republican member of the commission, said they would keep fighting
for their proposal, under which the government would offer a fixed
amount of money to each beneficiary to purchase a public or private
health plan.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Clinton had studiously refrained from commenting
on the work of the commission. But late this afternoon, less than
an hour before the panel began its final session, Clinton went to
the South Lawn of the White House and criticized the proposal
supported by 10 of the 17 commission members.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the proposal, drafted by Breaux and Thomas, ``does
not provide for an adequate, affordable prescription drug benefit''
for the elderly and disabled. Moreover, he said, the proposal could
increase the number of Americans without health insurance, by
raising the eligibility age for Medicare to 67 from 65, and could
cause excessive increases in premiums for people who remain in the
traditional Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Clinton said that Breaux's plan was unacceptable
because it did not include the President's proposal to earmark 15
percent of any future budget surpluses for the Medicare program.
Independent experts agree that Medicare needs ``substantial new
revenues'' to provide for the baby boom generation, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   After thanking the commission for ``valuable work,'' Clinton
said he would devise his own proposal, and he said he hoped
Congress would approve it this year, but he gave no details of what
he had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want an agreement this year,'' Clinton said. ``I am going to
do my dead-level best to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke out after it became clear that members of Congress
from both parties were blaming him for the commission's failure to
agree on any recommendations.

<P>
   During her early days at America West, flight attendant Mary
Metcalf needed food stamps to support her family.
</P>
<P>
   A single mother at the time, Metcalf had trouble making ends

never need such assistance again.

and other flight attendants worried about their future. Many have
been working more hours to put money aside. Others have secured
part-time jobs just in case.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the airline revoked the flight passes of flight
attendants and other employees, meaning that they will need tickets
to fly while off duty.
</P>
<P>
   Strike negotiations resume today.
</P>
<P>
   For many flight attendants, the disenchantment goes deeper than
their differences with America West, piercing the heart of a
profession that has seen better days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very scary time for many flight attendants,'' explains
Metcalf, who has worked for America West for about 13 years. ``Many
people think that we have exciting jobs and that we must get paid
very well. That isn't reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the job of a flight attendant isn't very glamorous. The
profession is marked with low pay, stressful working conditions and
uncertainty as airline managers continue to find ways to cut costs
and increase profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't the job it once was,'' laments Deanna Clarkson, who
has worked America West for 14 years. ``It's very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   From her home in central Phoenix, Clarkson talks about the glory
days. The pay was decent. The passengers were mannerly and genteel.
And the hours allowed her to spend time with her son, who is now 7.
</P>
<P>
   But the times have changed.
</P>
<P>
   One big shift is declining wages.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson says she now earns 90 percent of what she earned in
1991. That's because America West took a financial nose dive and
was forced into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   At TWA, flight attendants have seen their salaries drop about 25
percent since 1985. Bankruptcy also was to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Johnson, America West senior vice president of corporate
affairs, disputes any claim that flight attendants are paid 10
percent less today than in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that all employees, not just the flight
attendants, took a 10 percent pay cut in 1991 when the airline went
into bankruptcy. But he said all employees had their salaries
restored to pre-bankruptcy levels in 1994 and that the flight
attendants and other employees have been receiving annual raises
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson acknowledged that the flight attendants have sacrificed
a lot for the company and deserve higher wages.
</P>
<P>
   At America West, base salaries for flight attendants start at
$12,852, among the lowest in the industry, and peak at about
$21,900 after 12 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   TWA entry-level attendants must pay for their six-week training
and then receive base salaries of $13,212 a year. Base salaries
peak at $25,000 to $28,000 a year for flight attendants who have 12
years of seniority.
</P>
<P>
   The best attendants' wages are at United Airlines, which has
starting salaries at $17,154 and reach about $40,000 a year after
14 years of service.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for the lost wages, Clarkson and other flight
attendants pick up extra flights.
</P>
<P>
   On an average schedule, Clarkson can earn $22,000 a year. But
with the overtime, she can make $35,000. But that isn't without
consequences. She doesn't get as much time with her son.
</P>
<P>
   Clarkson works a three-day trip. With her latest schedule, she
arrives at the airport on Tuesday at 5 a.m. for a 6 o'clock flight
to Orange County. From there, it's back to Phoenix, on to
Sacramento and then to Las Vegas. It's mid-afternoon by this time,
too early to call it a day. So Clarkson and the crew head back to
Orange County and then back to Las Vegas before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is repeated on Wednesday. But on Thursday, she
finishes her day at 2:30 p.m. and heads straight to pick up her son
at her parents' home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be very grueling and tiring,'' Clarkson admits, adding
that there are no lunch or dinner breaks. With airlines eliminating
hot meals, flight attendants must bring their own food on the road.
``That means lots of soup in a cup, baked potatoes and salad in a
bag.''
</P>
<P>
   With such low wages, many flight attendants find it impossible
to save money. Many find part-time jobs to save money for down
payments on a home or simply to get ahead. Clarkson recently found
another job in case the flight attendants go on strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``On these salaries, you aren't able to save very much money for
these types of emergencies,'' she confesses. ``So I had to find
something to pay the bills if the worst happens.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to financial concerns, flight attendants also worry
about rising passenger aggression.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, flight-attendant assaults were extremely rare,
according the Association of Flight Attendants in Washington, D.C.
The union studied the rising tide of violence on United Airlines
and found that in 1993, 54 flight attendants reported being
assaulted. Last year, however, there were more than 100 violent
acts committed.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for the midair fracases, according to
William McGlashen, president of the Association of Flight
Attendants chapter in Phoenix and an America West attendant.
</P>
<P>
   One is the cramped passenger quarters that have been created as
airlines have been squeezing more seats onto planes, McGlashen
explains. About 10 years ago, there were 106 seats on a Boeing 737.
Now, there are 122 seats.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, passengers are getting less service.
Meals have been eliminated on many routes, and some airlines don't
show movies anymore. Add alcohol to the equation, and flight
attendants have an explosive situation on their hands, McGlashen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't like how things have changed. But it's still a great
job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors helped fuel a fist fight on a flight Metcalf
was working recently. She says the flight was packed and a woman on
board was drinking too much and getting unruly. When Metcalf
refused to serve her another drink, the woman petitioned the man
sitting beside her to get one for her. He declined and she slapped
him one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was horrible,'' recalls Metcalf. ``Just think about it. You
can't kick anyone out. You have to diffuse the situation until you
arrive at your destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbal abuse, however, is more common. Metcalf says she is
shocked at the names passengers have called flight attendants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of passengers don't have as much respect for the flight
crew,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants attribute this to changing opinions about
their profession over the years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930, when ``stewardesses'' debuted at United Airlines, all
were registered nurses, with their primary purpose safety. Few are
nurses today, but flight attendants still focus on safety, and
their training has been widened to handle other emergencies such as
crash evacuations and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines, however, didn't maintain that image. For instance, the
now defunct National Airlines in the 1970s aired some racy
television commercials. One showed a flight attendant in a bikini
sauntering toward the camera and proclaiming, ''I'm Jennifer and
I'm going to fly you like you've never been flown before.''
</P>
<P>
   In another, flight attendants asked viewers to ``Fly me.''
</P>
<P>
   And a Continental Airlines spot highlighted flight attendants
telling viewers, ``We really move our tails for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The image of flight attendants never completely recovered from
such ads.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon flight from Phoenix to San Antonio, flight
attendants battled some of the problems of their trade. The
passengers in row 15 are having their fourth beer after only being
in the air one hour. Their shouting is starting to annoy passengers
around them and a flight attendant asks them to keep their voices
down.
</P>
<P>
   Up the way, an elderly couple is complaining about the snack _ a
bag of peanuts and a beverage. They tell the flight attendants that
they didn't eat lunch and are feeling very weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``People expect so much from us sometimes,'' a weary attendant
says.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all the problems, few flight attendants would trade
their jobs for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love what I do. I've gone to so many different places,''
explains Clarkson. ``Yeah, you get some rude people and that was
rare before. But you get to meet so many interesting people and
there are so many other people who are still thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she says, the other day a regular passenger to
Orange County brought all the flight attendants ice cream sundaes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like that restore your faith,'' she says. ``I don't
think I could ever do anything else.'' &QL;

<P>
   If ``the sleep of a labouring man is sweet,'' as the Old
Testament insists, the slumber of a retired man, or woman, should
be even sweeter. But for 25 percent to 35 percent of older
Americans, sleep is not something that comes all that easily.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Telles Sr., for instance, 63 years old and retired from
a glass factory, happily loses consciousness at 10:30 p.m. but is
wide awake again two hours later, and again an hour after that.
Margaret Baker, 70, a retired librarian, has conquered the oeuvres
of Tony Hillerman, Dorothy L. Sayers and P.D. James _ all during
the midnight hours when she cannot fall asleep. ``I am a devoted
mystery fan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Telles and Mrs. Baker eventually sought help at a research
clinic at the University of Pittsburgh. But insomnia in older
adults, sleep experts say, is often neglected by family doctors,
who may view fitful nights, like wrinkles and farsightedness, as a
normal accompaniment of aging. And patients themselves rarely deem
their troubled sleep important enough to complain to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   A new study may change all that. In Wednesday's issue of The
Journal of the American Medical Association, Dr. Charles Morin, a
professor of psychology at Laval University in Quebec, and his
colleagues report that insomnia in older adults can be effectively
treated with cognitive-behavior therapy, with sleeping medication,
or a combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
   And the behavioral therapy, which was specially tailored to
educate patients about ``sleep hygiene,'' to correct faulty beliefs
and expectations about sleep and to instill better sleep habits,
proved longer lasting than drug treatment, the researchers found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chronic insomnia is a treatable condition even in late life,''
Morin and his colleagues concluded.
</P>
<P>
   In their study, the researchers compared the treatments in 78
men and women, aged 55 and older, all of whom had suffered from
insomnia. The subjects either had difficulty falling asleep or
staying asleep, at least three nights a week for at least six
months, and had complained of daytime fatigue, impaired functioning
or mood disturbances that they attributed to loss of sleep.
</P>
<P>
   People with major depression, medical conditions producing
insomnia, or sleep apnea, and those who were unable to stop taking
previously prescribed sleeping pills were excluded from the study.
</P>
<P>
   Subjects who received weekly 90-minute sessions of
cognitive-behavioral therapy, a trial of the sleeping pill
Restoril, or a combination of the therapy and Restoril all showed
significant improvement in their sleep patterns at the end of the
eight-week treatment period. These patterns were measured by sleep
diaries, brain-wave recordings during sleep and the ratings of the
subjects' bed-partners. These results were compared with control
subjects given dummy pills.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four months later, subjects in the group receiving
cognitive behavior therapy alone were still sleeping much better,
but the improvement of subjects in the group receiving medication
alone was lost after the drugs were discontinued. Surprisingly,
subjects who received both medication and therapy did not hold onto
their gains as effectively as those who received therapy alone,
perhaps because they attributed their improvement to the sleeping
pills and did not invest as much in the behavioral learning
program, the researchers speculated.
</P>
<P>
   Other sleep researchers said the study was significant because
it would alert doctors to the importance and the practicality of
treating insomnia in older patients, and because it offered a
treatment option other than drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a behavioral intervention that works and that is
durable, that's got to be important,'' said Dr. Daniel J. Buysse,
an associate professor of psychiatry at the Sleep and Chronobiology
Center of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who was
co-author of an accompanying editorial in the journal.
</P>
<P>
   The direct costs of insomnia, according to a 1995 estimate,
approach $14 billion a year, though some experts suspect this
figure is high.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 15 percent of people who suffer from chronic insomnia
receive treatment, according to surveys. But studies indicate that
untreated insomnia may put people at higher risk for major
depression and may cause elderly people to be placed in nursing
homes sooner than if the condition had been treated.
</P>
<P>
   Insomnia increases with age, often linked to medical or
psychiatric problems or changes in life style. At any age, women,
though they sleep more deeply and longer than men, are also more
likely to have insomnia, particularly during menopause and
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The appropriate role of sedative-hypnotic drugs, a class that
includes most sleeping pills, in treating chronic insomnia is
controversial, particularly in the elderly. Unlike antidepressants,
sleep medications treat symptoms but do not address the underlying
causes of insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire may be out, but the embers are still there,'' said
Dr. David Kupfer, chairman of psychiatry at the University of
Pittsburgh, a co-author of the journal editorial.
</P>
<P>
   With long-term use, patients can develop tolerance for
sedative-hypnotic drugs, and the medications can produce side
effects, including a morning ``hangover,'' disturbances in
short-term memory and concentration, and rebound insomnia when the
medication is discontinued. In older people, who metabolize drugs
more slowly, side effects may be more pronounced. And
sedative-hypnotics have been linked in some studies to an increased
risk in the elderly to falls, hip fractures and automobile
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers contend that the risks of drug treatment for
insomnia have been somewhat exaggerated. The vast majority of
patients, they say, do not abuse sleeping pills, and no good
studies have been done of long-term treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James K. Walsh, executive director of the Sleep Medicine and
Research Center at St. Luke's Hospital in St. Louis, cited studies
showing that of people who reported taking sleeping pills within
the past year, 60 percent say they took them 30 times or fewer, and
only 11 percent said they took them every night or nearly every
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behavioral treatments work, but there are only a few dozen
experts in treating insomnia with behavioral techniques,'' Walsh
said. ``To just say you can't take sleeping pills or can only take
them for a few weeks is not practical.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh says he carries out trials of new sleep medications for
drug companies and is a paid lecturer for some of the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors, and many patients, however, remain wary of
sleeping pills, and welcome treatment strategies that do not
involve medication. In Morin's study, for example, 80 percent of
the subjects, when asked which method of treatment they would want
if they had a choice, said they would prefer to receive behavioral
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One reason cognitive-behavior therapy may be longer-lasting in
helping patients with chronic insomnia, sleep experts say, is that
it trains people to serve as their own therapists and to take
responsibility for their sleeping habits.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects in Morin's study, for example, were instructed in
basic principles of ``sleep hygiene,'' including the effects of
caffeine, alcohol and diet, and taught ways to increase their
chances of sleeping, like going to bed only when they were sleepy,
getting up and going to another room if they could not fall asleep
within 15 or 20 minutes, and arising at the same time every
morning, regardless of how much they slept the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The therapists also worked to correct ``faulty'' beliefs, like
the notion that sleep should be as enveloping in later life as it
is in young adulthood. The percentage of time spent each night in
the deepest stage of sleep begins to decrease after the age of 40,
and by 60 or 70, people spend little time in deep sleep. ``Even
with the best sleeping pill in the world, you cannot make a
65-year-old person sleep like a 25-year-old person,'' Morin said.

 &HT;    Online magazine targets minorities
 &HT;    By Tammy Joyner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ During her 20-plus years as a broker, Deardra
Green-Campbell said she rarely saw minority investors and often had
to explain how the stock market worked and what investments would
be best for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent three quarters of my time educating clients,'' the
investment consultant said recently. The 1993 U.S. Census Bureau
survey of household assets estimated only 6 percent of blacks and
Hispanics own stocks or mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been unable to find anything updated, so I would have to
make the assumption that not much has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell hopes to make improvements to those numbers.
</P>
<P>
   She launched an online investment magazine this month to help
blacks, Hispanics, native Americans and other neophyte investors
navigate the stock market, considered one of the greatest
wealth-building sources around.
</P>
<P>
   The site (http://www.investedmagazine.com) debuted March 1 and
is believed to be the first of its kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sets us apart is our educational approach to the
market,'' said Campbell, who conducts seminars and classes on
investing. ``Most of the (educational investment) sites make the
assumption that the reader has at least a basic understanding of
the markets. We don't. Everything we write is designed to help the
reader understand the concept or strategy we're presenting, but
also how to apply that concept or strategy to their personal
life.''
</P>
<P>
   As a black woman, ``investment education is something I'm
personally and professionally committed to,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As a former vice president at Charles Schwab and Dreyfus Service
Corp., Campbell said, ``I know that investment returns are what
have made a lot of the wealth in this country. But in order to be
successful at investing, you have to understand the market and how
to balance investment returns with investment risks.''
</P>
<P>
   People not used to investing ``often don't understand that risks
can be managed and as a result ... we shy away from market-type
investments, and then we miss out and instead settle for 2.5
percent from the local banks,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Minorities have made tremendous economic strides this decade,
Campbell noted in her first ``From the Editor's Desk'' article on
the Web site. She cited a recent University of Georgia study that
found during the past nine years, the after-tax income for black
people rose 73 percent, outperforming the 56.7 percent gain for all
other Americans. But, she goes on to say, blacks' net worth _ the
best gauge of actual wealth _ still falls short of whites'.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site has features on investing in Africa and the best
companies for minorities to invest in.
</P>
<P>
   It will also include regular articles on investments such as
stocks, bonds and mutual funds. It also highlights investment
strategies, individual investors and industry professionals.
Subscribers can post questions on a message board, answer each
other's questions and talk about investing in general.
Subscriptions are $5.95 a month or $15 a quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it's to help establish a community of people with
like-minded goals,'' Campbell said.

DOW'S 10K RUN  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Now that the Dow has peeked above the 10,000
threshold, investors are wondering whether the milestone will mark
a temporary ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting close to an intermediate top, and in that sense,
10,000 might be a psychological barrier,'' said Arthur Stockton of
Stockton Trust in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, a barometer of the share
prices of 30 of America's most prominent companies, resembled a
pole vaulter at a track meet Tuesday. It cleared its first attempt
at 10,000 shortly after the opening bell at 8:21 a.m. Arizona time,
reaching 10,001.78, then scratched on all successive jumps.
</P>
<P>
   It finished down 28.30 points at 9930.47.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's trading session brought back memories of the Dow's
first crossing of the 1,000 mark three decades ago. It did so on
four separate days in early 1966 but failed to hold any of those
gains for more than a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   The market then spent the next 6{ years moving sideways and
lower, before finally rallying to close above 1,000 for the first
time on Nov. 10, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Investment observers point out that the economy is in better
shape today than in the late 1960s, when government spending on the
Vietnam War was starting to push up inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a darn favorable environment right now,'' Stockton
said. ``There's just not much bad news out there.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other differences between '99 and '66.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Baby Boomers were still in high school, grammar
school or preschool, and their parents were spending money on food,
clothing and other consumer goods rather than investing it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, members of the huge Boomer generation are moving into prime
investing years in their 40s and 50s, and their buying of stocks
and mutual funds has pushed the market higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of faith in Social Security makes us more concerned
about retirement planning, and that fuels our investments in 401(k)
plans and other accounts,'' said Fred Lynn of F.A.L. Capital
Management, a Scottsdale investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace 401(k) retirement programs and even individual
retirement accounts have played a big role, bringing adults of all
ages into the stock market by offering tax incentives and other
benefits. Neither type of program existed a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in the 401(k) plan since Day One,'' said Kelly L.
Cook, 27, of Chandler, who works at the Finova Group in Phoenix.
``I can't afford not to be.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the costs of investing have come down drastically
since the 1960s, making it more economical for a larger number of
people to get started. For example, the government deregulated
brokerage commissions in 1975, giving birth to a vibrant discount
business that today is reinventing itself with cut-rate fees on
Internet trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the beginning of the electronization of trading that
has created a lot more participation by the general public,'' said
Pejman Hamidi, who writes an online trading newsletter for Polar
Analytic Services in Mt. Clemens, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important has been the explosive growth of mutual
funds, which have enabled millions of investors to participate in
the market with greater convenience, more affordability and reduced
risks compared with owning individual stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual-fund assets have swelled more than 100-fold, from less
than $50 billion in the 1960s to more than $5.7 trillion today,
eclipsing even bank deposits.
</P>
<P>
   The economic backdrop also has been an exceptionally good one
for stocks. The nation's prosperity has been on a general uptrend
since the Persian Gulf War ended in 1991. Today's economic climate
is marked by steady growth, moderate interest rates, low
unemployment and scarce inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow's hitting 10,000 is ``an indication that things are
going right with the economy,'' said Susan Filson, senior portfolio
manager at Harris Trust Bank in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Low interest rates, in turn, have fueled liquidity-driven
buying. That's a fancy way of saying that investors are
transferring cash from low-yielding bonds, money-market funds and
bank accounts into the stock market in search of greater gains.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for investors is to determine whether today's high
stock prices are justified _ the Dow is up more than 6,000 points
just since the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn thinks so, in light of the productivity gains being
achieved by American companies through the increased use of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix money manager L. Roy Papp goes a step further, arguing
that the technological breakthroughs of the past decade and a half
could be more significant than those of the Industrial Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the development of the personal computer in 1982, we
have had only one year of recession,'' Papp said. ``Something is
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Technological improvements help to explain why the big stocks in
the Dow average, which includes the likes of IBM, General Electric
and Hewlett Packard, have fared so well in recent years. Large
corporations are more likely to have embraced computerization,
which has helped them cut costs in an era of low inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large companies have had really good earnings growth,'' said
Rose Papp, co-manager of the Papp mutual-fund group in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Last year during a talk to investors in Phoenix, fund manager
Art Bonnel predicted that the Dow would hit 20,000 by the year
2007. Today, he suspects that forecast might be too low.
</P>
<P>
   mergers and acquisitions have reduced the number of large stocks
in which to invest, Bonnel says, yet the public continues to pour
more cash into the market. Meanwhile, inflation remains low, the
political environment is reasonably stable and technology continues
to spur productivity gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you put it all together, it's a perfect environment for
stocks,'' said Bonnel, who runs the San Antonio-based United
Services Bonnel Growth Fund. ``If you haven't ventured into the
market yet, I'd recommend doing so, because this market's going a
lot higher.'' &QL;

RENAULT OFFERS TO BUY 35 PERCENT SHARE OF NISSAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ In one of the biggest gambles that a
European car company has ever taken, Renault SA of France on
Tuesday offered to buy 35 percent of Nissan Motor Co., Japan's huge
but deeply troubled producer of cars and trucks.
</P>
<P>
   If Nissan accepts the offer, which could be worth as much as $4
billion or even $5 billion, the deal would mark a rare incursion by
a foreign company into the inner sanctum of Japanese industry. It
would also transform Renault from a smallish European producer to
one of the world's biggest players.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry executives said such a deal carries
enormous risks. Renault has been unsuccessful in previous efforts
to move overseas, and it is not dominant in Europe. Nissan has lost
money for five years and is believed to have lost more than $1.5
billion in 1998. A turnaround is nowhere in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan also has more than $30 billion in total debt, much of it
difficult to identify because it lies with affiliated companies and
is not part of Nissan's official balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   And there are major questions about control. Though Renault
would gain several board members and be able to veto major
decisions, it would not necessarily have the power to dictate
strategy or dismiss top executives.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, DaimlerChrysler AG walked away from a deal with
Nissan. At the time, Daimler executives complained that Nissan did
not have an adequate turnaround plan and would require too much
attention to be worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But even after Daimler snubbed Nissan, Renault's chairman, Louis
Schweitzer, said he was still interested. In a brief statement on
Tuesday night after a meeting of Renault's board of directors, the
company said it was ``convinced of the merits of a strategic
alliance'' and would now enter exclusive negotiations with Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Nissan said it would proceed with the
negotiations. ``We will work out conditions for forming an alliance
in the days ahead so that a conclusion can be reached by the end of
this month,'' said Yoshikazu Hanawa, president and chief executive
of Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   Renault did not mention the price it had offered. At Nissan's
current market capitalization of about $10 billion, 35 percent of
the company would be worth about $3.5 billion. A variety of sources
said that Renault was prepared to pay a premium for the Japanese
company. French news agencies, quoting unnamed government and labor
union sources, said the company is offering 32 billion French
francs, just over $5 billion, for 35 percent of the company.
Renault would install three of its executives, led by Schweitzer,
on Nissan's board.
</P>
<P>
   Renault shares fell 5.45 percent, or 1.93 euros, to 33.47 euros
($36.80) in Paris. Nissan shares rose 19 yen, or 4 percent,
bringing their gains to 18 percent in the last two days. Nissan's
American depositary receipts rose 31.25 cents, to $7.4375 on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A big question for Renault is, why? Nissan, once extolled as a
prime example of an unstoppable Japanese company in books like
David Halberstam's ``The Reckoning,'' is a corporate basketcase
today, hobbled by high costs, staggering debts and a nightmarish
recession in its home market. It is also extremely difficult to
understand, because it has so many entangling ties to other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Renault has bounced back from losses of $1 billion
in 1996 to booming sales and profits last year. Thanks to its
popular line of new cars and minivans, Renault earned about $1.4
billion on $40 billion in sales in 1998, and has built up a
substantial cash cushion.
</P>
<P>
   But Renault, in which the French government owns 44 percent of
the stock, remains a smaller player in a field increasingly
dominated by giants like Daimler-Chrysler, Ford, Toyota and General
Motors. About 85 percent of Renault's cars are sold in Europe, and
most of those are in France itself. It has little presence in the
United States and virtually none in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, offered
several reasons for their interest in Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   As Japan's second-biggest car company after Toyota, they argue,
Nissan would give Renault a powerful presence in Asia as well as in
the United States. Renault could in turn provide Nissan with a
strong base in Europe, where it currently has little market share,
as well as in Latin America. In combination, the two companies
would be the world's fourth-biggest carmaker with 4.8 million
vehicles built, ahead of Volkswagen AG.
</P>
<P>
   Schweitzer was also attracted by Nissan's line of products.
While Renault derives most of its sales from small and midsized
passenger cars, which Nissan also builds, the Japanese company also
produces sport trucks, light trucks and luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   Renault executives see other potential benefits. They like
Nissan's factory in Smyrna, Tenn., which is one of the world's most
modern. And they see opportunities for profits from reorganization:
Nissan currently uses 29 separate manufacturing ``platforms'' _ a
car's basic engineered underpinning _to build about three million
cars a year. Most other companies have consolidated scores of
different models into fewer than half that many platforms.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the dangers and uncertainties are at least as formidable as
the attractions. In teaming up with Nissan, Renault would be trying
to direct a company that has long been at the very heart of the
Japanese economy. Though Ford has owned 33.4 percent of Mazda for
several years, Nissan is a much bigger company and Renault would be
seeking much greater management control.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Renault would probably not obtain full control. Under
Japanese rules, by buying more than 33 percent of a company's
stock, an investor would obtain a veto right over major decisions
like mergers, acquisitions and new security offerings.
</P>
<P>
   But unless Nissan makes specific legal concessions on management
issues, Renault would not have an automatic right to set
compensation levels, reshuffle manufacturing or branding strategy
or install new management.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes 51 percent to control the board,'' said Tetsuya
Morimoto, an expert in corporate law at the Tokyo office of White &AMP;
Case. ``Thirty-three percent does not stop the other party from
running the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Automobile analysts said on Tuesday that there is no guarantee
an alliance of the two companies would produce a new powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nissan is not a strong player, and Renault is not the
strongest player in its market either,'' said Christian
Breitsprecher, an automobile analyst at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt.
``Getting two basically weak companies doesn't necessarily create a
stronger player.''
</P>
<P>
   Renault's track record with foreign partners is mixed at best.
It bought American Motors Corp. in 1981 only to see the company
plunge into disarray before Chrysler came along and bought it. It
reached an agreement to acquire AB Volvo of Sweden in 1993, but the
deal collapsed when both shareholders and Volvo managers rebelled
over provisions that would have given the French government a veto
over key decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Renault does own the big American producer of heavy
tractor-trailer rigs, Mack Trucks, and that business has been
successful. Renault has made it clear that part of its interest in
Nissan Motor carries over to Nissan Diesel, the loss-making truck
company in which Nissan Motor owns a 40 percent stake. It was not
clear on Tuesday night whether Renault's offer includes a separate
capital infusion into Nissan Diesel or would simply amount to an
indirect stake through Nissan Motor.

GIFT OF ENDANGERED SHEEP RILES SMITHSONIAN
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By TIM GOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Officials at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington could
hardly contain their delight 16 months ago when a wealthy
California real estate developer, Kenneth E. Behring, pledged $20
million in cash to the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural
History.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Behring family's gift will bring our museum into the 21st
century,'' the secretary of the Smithsonian, I. Michael Heyman,
said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But museum officials have been less exultant about some of their
benefactor's other generosity. In a donation that went
unpublicized, Behring, who is one of the world's more accomplished
trophy hunters, also gave the Smithsonian the remains of four
bighorn sheep he had shot in Central Asian republics of the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The hitch was that the wild mountain sheep are on lists of
threatened animals that cannot be imported into the United States
under the Endangered Species Act. One of the sheep, a Kara-Tau
argali, is considered among the most endangered animals in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   And as finishing touches are being put on the newly renovated
Kenneth E. Behring Family Hall of Mammals, the Smithsonian is
coming under attack by conservationists for having petitioned the
Interior Department last fall to waive the ban so it can get the
sheep out of a Canadian taxidermy shop and into the museum's
permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the controversy, wildlife officials in Mozambique say
a party of big-game hunters that included Behring is under
investigation for the possibly illegal killing of three bull
elephants there last July. Other Mozambican officials, in the
impoverished northern province of Cabo Delgado, said they
authorized the killing of a few ``problem'' elephants after
Behring's party pledged to help the provincial government with
wildlife management plans and gave a $20,000 donation to a local
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trophy hunters can do almost anything they want in these
countries if they have enough money,'' said a senior vice president
for the Humane Society of the United States, Wayne Pacelle. ``But
they won't shoot animals like the argali unless they can get the
trophies home, and the Smithsonian is giving them a strong reason
to do it by helping get them into the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Behring, in a statement issued by his Washington spokeswoman,
Sheila Tate, said he killed his sheep with the proper permits and
``was certainly not encouraged by any museum to hunt them.'' He
dismissed the accusations that his hunting party acted improperly
in Mozambique as ``just plain wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the Natural History Museum, Robert W. Fri, said
in a recent letter to the Humane Society, ``It is the firm policy
of the Smithsonian not to encourage the trophy hunting of
endangered species, and we have carefully adhered to that policy in
this case.'' Fri said the museum was seeking the specimens because
they were ``unique to our collection and rare in collections
elsewhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of saying the museum might withdraw the
permit application, the Smithsonian's Provost, J. Dennis O'Connor,
backed away from that claim in an interview Tuesday afternoon.
``We're re-evaluating just what the species might provide for us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A decision has yet to be made at the Interior Department's Fish
and Wildlife Service, which, under the Endangered Species Act, must
determine that bringing specimens of endangered animals into the
United States will help indirectly to preserve the species.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Behring's argali, the officials said they would
not act until they received further documentation they had
requested some weeks ago. And one senior official familiar with the
case suggested that the application was already being viewed with
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It raises some real red flags,'' the official said. ``What
seems to be going on here is that somebody knows they're not going
to get an import permit one way so they've gone to the Smithsonian
to get it another way.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. Hoffman, the former director of the Natural History
Museum and now a senior scientist at the museum, applied for
permits to import the four wild sheep Behring shot in Kazakhstan
and Kirghistan in September 1997, just weeks before the final
discussions of his $20 million donation. The gift was the largest
in the 151-year history of the national museum system.
</P>
<P>
   Behring, former owner of the Seattle Seahawks football team,
said he shot the sheep with permits authorized by the Russian
Federation, which oversees wildlife issues in many of the former
Soviet republics, and with Russian scientists in his hunting party.
But export permits for the animals were issued two days before the
enactment of a decision by the international convention that
oversees wildlife conservation to upgrade the Kara-Tau argali to
its most-endangered category. The other sheep are considered
threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Behring suggested that he was equally scrupulous in the hunting
trip he took to Mozambique last July with a current and a past
president of the Safari Club, of which he, too, is a prominent
member. A provincial wildlife official in Cabo Delgado, the
province where Behring hunted, agreed. The official, Carlos
Fernando Mugoma, said in a telephone interview from Pemba, the
provincial capital, that Behring's party had come ``to survey
investment opportunities in our province,'' and had been granted a
permit by the province to shoot a lion, a leopard and a buffalo.
Scrawled on the permit in Mugoma's handwriting is also a notation
in Portuguese that ``problem elephants'' may also be taken.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Safari Club said the party had shot one such
elephant with a ``special permit'' from the provincial governor.
But Mugoma and Behring contradicted that account, saying the party
in fact shot three elephants, and Behring's spokeswoman, Ms. Tate,
sent a reporter a copy of a $5,000 check, dated six weeks after the
hunt and made out to the provincial government with the notation
``elephant permit.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from the Mozambican capital, Maputo,
the head of the country's wildlife service, Arlito Cuco, said that
according to a federal investigation, the elephant hunt apparently
did not target problem elephants and was therefore unlawful. He
also said that two of the elephant tusks were missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was illegal,'' Cuco said. ``Because according to the law in
Mozambique, you cannot hunt for sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Behring said through his spokeswoman that he knew nothing of the
investigation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Dow Jones industrial average continued its
flirtation with the 10,000-point mark Tuesday, even crossing it
briefly. But it reversed its early climb and ended the session
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Broader market averages were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow, made up of 30 of the best-known names in corporate
America, poked through 10,000 at 9:50 a.m., soon after trading
began on the New York Stock Exchange, and rose as high as
10,001.78.
</P>
<P>
   But the index pulled back and closed at 9,930.47, down 28.30
points, or nearly three-tenths of 1 percent, on the day.
</P>
<P>
   While 10,000 is an eye-popping number, analysts noted that in
percentage terms the rise from 9,000 was less significant than any
of the other 1,000-point gains the average has recorded during its
long bull run, which began in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``While people are transfixed with the prospect of all those
zeros, what is most impressive is not the level itself but the
length of this bull market,'' said Christine Callies, chief
investment strategist at Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in the Dow, she said, ``represents a complete shift
from inflation-hedge assets like houses and gold mines to assets
that thrive only when inflation is under control and government
fiscal policy is being reined in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once those goals have been achieved,'' she added, ``the equity
gains tend to be smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, market technicians and portfolio strategists have been
concerned for some time that the rise in the Dow and other market
gauges has been led by a relative handful of stocks. That
narrowness, they contend, is a warning sign for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of breadth in the market worries me to death,'' said
Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell &AMP; Reed, an
investment firm in Overland Park, Kan., which manages more than $27
billion. ``The market's internal technical factors just don't look
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's action fed this sort of concern. On both the New York
Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq market, declining issues outnumbered
those that advanced.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, stock traders tended to ignore a good day in
the bond market as interest rates fell.
</P>
<P>
   Well-known technology shares did better for a second consecutive
session. But bank stocks, which rallied on Monday, fell back
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Trading volume on the Big Board was relatively modest, just shy
of 752 million shares. On the Nasdaq market, 977.2 million shares
changed hands.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, which set a closing high
on Monday, slipped 0.90 point, to 1,306.36. The Nasdaq, which has
risen more than 11 percent this year, gained 7.83 points, to
2,439.27.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russell 2000 index of smaller-company shares, a laggard
for nearly a year, fell 1.67 points, or four-tenths of a percent,
to 399.17. The American Stock Exchange composite index fell 4.60
points, to 716.31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fully invested in small and mid-cap stocks and are
beating ourselves in the head every day,'' Herrmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Two financial stocks, those of American Express and J.P. Morgan,
were the biggest drags on the Dow. American Express, which has been
among the market's best performers so far this year, fell 2 3/16 a
share, to 123 9/16. Morgan dropped 1 3/8, to 124.
</P>
<P>
   Merck &AMP; Co., the drug giant, was the best-performing Dow stock;
the company's shares rose 1 5/8, to 85 7/8 after the company
received government approval for expanded use of an
anti-cholesterol drug.
</P>
<P>
   Among big technology stocks, Intel gained 2 1/2 a share, to 120
3/8. A report released late Monday showed that semiconductor sales
rose 1.2 percent in January, to $11.1 billion, compared with $10.97
billion in the month a year earlier, as rising demand in Europe and
much of Asia offset lower sales in North and South America.
Microsoft rose 3 3/16, to 169 1/16. And Cisco Systems gained 1, to
106.
</P>
<P>
   Flashnet Communications, an Internet service provider, more than
doubled in its first day of trading, closing at 43 5/8, after
coming to market priced at 17.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Hewlett-Packard and IBM, technology stocks
are absent from the Dow. But some market strategists said that
recent weakness in technology issues boded well for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology stock prices peaked on Feb. 1,'' said Thomas
Galvin, chief investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette. ``But even though technology has been in the penalty box,
the market has been able to hit new highs. Bond yields are
stabilizing because of no apparent signs of inflation, and now
earnings are beginning a cyclical recovery. The bull market is back
in business.''
</P>
<P>
   Galvin, clearly optimistic about the market's prospects,
projects the Dow will not flirt with the 10,000 level for long. By
the end of the year, he expects the average to be at 11,000.

 Pirates Cost Software-Makers Plenty

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
The growing popularity of cheaper CD-ROM recorders in homes could
be costing computer game, educational and reference software-makers
nearly $1 billion in lost sales, according to a survey being
released today.
</P>
<P>
   And 12 percent of home computer owners admitted having at least
one unauthorized copy of a CD-ROM, predominantly computer and video
game titles, according to the survey to be released during the
first full day of the Game Developers Conference in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Piracy already is a major threat to the $6.3 billion video and
computer game industry. Douglas Lowenstein, president of the
Interactive Digital Software Association, on Monday told a group of
some 300 game company executives at the conference that pirates who
copy and sell games cost the industry an estimated $3.2 billion in
lost international sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the new survey, conducted by Merrill Research &AMP; Associates
of San Mateo, is the first to focus on a relatively new phenomenon
of ``casual copiers'' _ PC owners who copy games and other software
for themselves, their relatives or their friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer casual copying reared its head because of the cheap
CD-Rs that hit the streets in the last couple of years,'' said
Brian Dunn, vice president of computer software copy protection for
Macrovision Corp., which sponsored the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Research general partner Joe Wheeler said the firm last
month surveyed 301 home PC owners, ages 15 to 59. While only 6
percent owned CD recorders, another 32 percent knew someone else
with such a device.
</P>
<P>
   Among copied titles, 47 percent were of computer and video games
and 29 percent were of educational software. Another 24 percent
were copies of reference or personal business software.
</P>
<P>
   Copyright laws allow consumers to make backup copies of
software. However, it's illegal for people to copy a game or
software they don't own or to give it to someone else. Lowenstein
also noted that it's rare that anyone would need a backup copy of a
CD-ROM game.
</P>
<P>
   The casual copying phenomenon is tied to the growth in sales of
CD-R devices, which have come down in price from $1,000 or more to
as low as $200. About 600 million CD-ROM recorders were sold in
1998, a 165 percent increase from the year before, according to the
International Recording Media Association, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the cost of blank recordable CD-ROMs has dropped to
less than $1 each.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent poll by the MTV cable network showed about 50
percent of young adults were planning to buy a CD-R.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, anyone can be a pirate,'' Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Macrovision is trying to sell game-makers new software designed
to prevent copying. The company is one of two in the world offering
such encryption technology for game-makers, Lowenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenstein said he has not had a chance to examine how Merrill
Research arrived at its revenue loss estimate. But he said the
survey should be taken seriously by the game industry, which now
uses copyright protection technology on only a few titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is $1 billion or $200,000, there is a problem,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The IDSA has in the past year stepped up enforcement of
commercial game piracy.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``It's awfully difficult for the industry to go into
the bedroom and try to run down individuals who are using CD-Rs to
copy at home,'' he said. ``That why the emphasis needs to be on
what we are going to do to help ourselves. You've got to do what
you can to protect your product.''
</P>
<P>
   The Game Developers Conference will host a panel discussion on
new CD-ROM protection techniques today. The 13th annual conference,
which runs through Friday at the San Jose Convention Center, is
expected to draw about 7,000 game industry professionals.

FORBES OUTLINES PROGRAM IN ANNOUNCING BID FOR PRESIDENCY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ Steve Forbes, the wealthy publisher whose deep
pockets caused heartburn for Republican presidential candidates in
1996, said Tuesday he will again make a bid for the White House and
intends to air television ads beginning next month.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes made his announcement both on the Internet and at an
outdoor rally in front of the New Hampshire state capitol, where he
outlined his program that included reforming the tax code,
privatizing Social Security and beefing up defense spending.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes claimed to be the first candidate in U.S. history to
announce his campaign on the Internet. But Lamar Alexander, another
candidate repeating his 1996 attempt at the Republican nomination,
made his announcement on the Internet four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the Web site announcement, the 51-year old candidate pledged
to run a vigorous campaign despite polls showing him lagging far
behind other Republicans, including Texas Gov. George W. Bush and
former Red Cross chief Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today marks the beginning of a national crusade to restore
Ronald Reagan's vision of hope and prosperity for all Americans. I
don't believe in business as usual _ and I surely don't believe in
politics as usual,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who catapulted onto the national political scene four
years ago with his promotion of the flat tax, again stressed the
need for tax reform calling the tax system ``an abomination.``
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too complex, too corrupt. It's a playground for
special-interest lawyers, lobbyists and lifetime politicians,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But faced with criticism that the flat tax disproportionately
benefits the wealthy, Forbes this time would allow taxpayers to
choose either the flat tax or the current system. He did not
elaborate how such a system would be paid for or administered.
</P>
<P>
   While Forbes has increasingly tailored his message to court the
religious conservatives _ repeatedly asserting his opposition to
abortion _ he only briefly touched on those issues in his
announcement addresses Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said Republicans should not abandon the anti-abortion plank
in the party platform crafted by Reagan. But adopting a more
conciliatory stance to compete in the crowded GOP field, Forbes
said that anti-abortion forces need to persuade their adversaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't come across as trying to ram something down people's
throats,'' he said in a town-hall meeting taped Tuesday for later
broadcast on WMUR-TV in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   While political observers give Forbes little chance of winning
the GOP nomination, the chief executive of a publishing empire can
cause mischief for the leading candidates because of his enormous
wealth. Some Republican leaders fear a repeat of 1996 when Forbes
damaged front-runner Bob Dole by running millions of dollars of ads
in key primary states slamming the Senate leader and weakening his
general-election position.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last time, Forbes is expected to rely on his personal
fortune and contributions and forgo federal matching funds and the
contribution limits that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   By officially filing his candidacy with the Federal Election
Commission rather than establishing an exploratory committee, as
Bush and Dole and others have done as a preliminary step, Forbes is
now free to begin a full-scale campaign, including a media effort.
He plans a more elaborate announcement later in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said he is now preparing for an ad campaign, targeted to
run before the end of April. However, the candidate would not say
where the ads would run or whether they would target certain
candidates. ``We're going to be running commercials advocating our
positions,'' he told the Houston Chronicle. ``I believe in
utilizing every tool possible.``
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also said that while he never has attacked anyone
personally, he looks ``forward to a vigorous debate with the
candidates.'' He said it would be unwise for the leading candidates
to avoid debates or participation in the early primaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters resent being taken for granted. They don't like
candidates posturing as emperors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes also claimed that he is better positioned this time
because he has started much earlier and been spending the years
since the last election building grass-roots organizations to back
up what will likely be an expensive broadcast war.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has tapped a number of political operatives who worked
for presidential candidate Pat Buchanan in 1996, including the head
of Buchanan's New Hampshire operation and his media consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is he's a more experienced candidate. He'll have
a stronger grass-roots effort,'' said Ken Eagan, executive director
of the New Hampshire Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Dick Bennett, a Manchester-based pollster, said that Forbes
must overcome negative perception among voters here that he is
trying to buy the election. Bennett said many voters were turned
off when Forbes swamped the airwaves here before the 1996 primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't like seeing him whenever they flipped the
channels,'' he said. &QL;

JUDGE ORDERS DEATH PENALTY IN '96 KILLING BY EX-LAWYER
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ Addressing the defendant as an ``angry,
sinister, controlling and malignant force,'' a state judge on
Tuesday ordered that Thomas Capano, a once prominent and wealthy
Delaware lawyer, be executed for the murder of a former mistress
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Judge William Swain Lee of the Delaware Superior
Court affirmed a jury's recommendation in late January that Capano,
49, be put to death, rather than serve a life sentence without
parole, for killing Anne Marie Fahey, a scheduling secretary for
Gov. Thomas Carper. The same jury found Capano guilty of
first-degree murder on Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Lee set June 28 as the date for execution by lethal injection,
but it is unlikely that it will occur then. A death sentence in
Delaware leads to an automatic appeal, and lawyers for Capano said
they would file one.
</P>
<P>
   Capano also faces a wrongful-death civil suit filed by Ms.
Fahey's family.
</P>
<P>
   Capano, who has been in prison since his arrest in November
1997, will join 17 other inmates awaiting execution in Delaware,
one of 38 states with a death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   While Lee's decision was widely expected _ even by Capano, his
lawyers said _ his withering 12-minute summation of the three-month
trial stunned many in the crowded courtroom, which included members
of the Fahey and Capano families.
</P>
<P>
   As Capano sat before him, Lee condemned him as an arrogant bully
who ``systematically and contemptuously degraded all those who
participated in the proceedings,'' a clear reference to Capano's
outburst and sneers, which led to frequent admonitions from the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Capano does not face judgment today because family and
friends failed him,'' Lee said. ``He faces judgment because he is a
ruthless murderer who feels compassion for no one and remorse only
for the circumstances in which he finds himself in. He is a
malignant force, from whom no one he deems disloyal or adversarial
can be secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Capano betrayed no emotion as the judge affirmed the jury's
recommendation of the death sentence. Before he left, he turned to
his 76-year-old mother, Marguerite, who uses a wheelchair, and said
quietly, ``I'll be all right. I love you.'' She wept, and was
comforted by relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The trial had been stunning in its force, gaining national
attention for its revelations, defensive strategies adopted by
Capano and in the end, the emotional trauma to Ms. Fahey's family
and the Capanos.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that Capano shot and killed Ms. Fahey on June
27, 1996, after her efforts to break off a two-year affair with
him. Shunning his lawyers' advice, Capano took the stand in his own
defense and admitted he elicited the help of his brothers, Louis
and Gerard Capano, who later testified against him, to dump her
body in the Atlantic Ocean. Her body was never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   In later testimony, he accused another former lover, Deborah A.
MacIntyre, of committing the murder in a jealous rage, a contention
that Ms. MacIntyre denied on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   In the penalty phase of the trial, Capano refused to express
remorse or plead for his life, other than to ask the jury to
consider the feelings of his mother, his four teen-age daughters
and his former wife, Kay _ which Lee said was the ultimate act of
selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the courthouse on Tuesday, Ms. Fahey's family had little
to say. But it was clear they had been heartened by Lee's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He summed up in 12 minutes what we have felt for 33 months,''
said Ms. Fahey's sister, Kathleen Fahey-Hosey.
</P>
<P>
   Capano's lawyer, Joseph S. Oteri of Boston, said of the judge's
remarks, ``I have never heard anything like that in all my life.''
But his co-counsel, Eugene Maurer of Wilmington, said the judge had
to justify the death penalty by characterizing Capano ``as a
miscreant.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferris Wharton, the state prosecutor, called Lee's summation
``an extraordinarily eloquent statement,'' and told reporters ``it
showed that not just poor people are convicted of these kinds of
crimes.''

 WASHINGTON: any recommendations. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, said
Clinton ``chose to kill the Medicare commission's bipartisan
recommendations one-half hour before the commission was scheduled
to meet.'' But Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, said Clinton
did not try to influence commission members ``one way or the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appointed four of the 17 commission members. All four
voted against the Breaux-Thomas proposal, though two of the four
said they saw some merit in it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Clinton appointees, Professor Stuart Altman of
Brandeis University, said Breaux's plan did too little to find
additional revenue for Medicare and to guarantee affordable drug
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need more money in this program,'' Altman said. ``We
need it sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commission member, Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former
chairwoman of Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, said she
supported efforts to inject competition into Medicare. But she said
such competition could never produce enough savings to solve
Medicare's financial problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., acknowledged that the commission was
influenced by politics, but he declared: ``Thank God for it. That's
the exercise of free men and women doing the business of their
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, he said, ``the proposal before us would convert
Medicare from a universal guarantee to a government voucher for
private insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Breaux disagreed. ``This proposal is not a voucher program,'' he
said. ``It is not an end to Medicare as an entitlement.''
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen of the House Ways and Means Committee and the
Senate Finance Committee said they would hold hearings on the
Breaux-Thomas proposal. And Breaux said the full Senate would
probably support much of the proposal. But the outlook for action
in Congress is murky, unless Republicans agree to Clinton's
proposal to use some of the projected budget surplus for Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the proposal to earmark some of the surplus for
Medicare was a bookkeeping gimmick. ``The President's proposal is
likely to create a public misperception that something meaningful
is being done to reform the Medicare program,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Many health policy experts say Medicare will eventually need
additional revenues, beyond the current sources of money, which
include premiums paid by beneficiaries, workers' payroll taxes and
general revenues from the Treasury. But Newt Gingrich, who as
speaker of the House named four commission members, insisted that
his appointees promise not to vote for tax increases. And the
commission did not seriously consider tax increases.

 Column: Getting A Handle on Patenting
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I believe I have a couple of items that I may be able to
patent and wonder how best to go about the patenting process.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  You might start by curling up with a good primer like
``Patent It Yourself'' by San Francisco patent attorney David
Pressman (Nolo Press, 7th edition, 420 pages, $45). Even if you
decide to consult with a patent attorney (about $200 an hour and
up), you are probably well advised to go through a self-help book
like Pressman's to get a handle on the complex patenting process.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, Pressman advises inventors to start out with a clear
record of the creation process. That means writing about and
drawing a rough sketch of each invention. Sign and date these early
records and have them witnessed by two persons such as friends,
neighbors or co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   If you can, build and test your design and again keep careful,
signed and dated written records.
</P>
<P>
   Consult with potential buyers, professors, friends and others
about the commercial potential. It's hard to get a patent but even
harder to make a commercial success of it. Pressman figures only
about three out of every 100 patents make money.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, you need to conduct a search to see if your
invention is patentable. You can hire a professional to do this
search or go to a patent depository library like the one on the
fifth floor of San Francisco's main Civic Center library.
</P>
<P>
   For a less complete computer search, you can go to two Web sites
_ &LR;  www.uspto.gov  &LR; and  &LR; www.patents.ibm.com  &LR; _ but these only go
back to 1974. There also is some general information on patents and
patent law at these sites.
</P>
<P>
   If you feel you can get a patent on your inventions and believe
someone will buy it, the next step is to prepare and file an
application with the U.S. Patent Office. The application requires a
$380 filing fee along with detailed drawings and descriptions. A
professionally prepared application for a simple device can easily
cost $3,000 to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   After you file your patent application, &UR;  &LR; you might want to sell
or license your invention to a company. Pressman advises against
hiring invention developers, who tout their ability in getting
companies to buy new products. &UR;  &LR; ``Their track record in getting you
more money than they take is practically zero,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Filing Conundrums
</P>
<P>
   Q: My wife and I are self-employed and run a consulting business
out of our home. Previously, we've divided the income and filed a
Schedule C, but I understand the IRS wants us to file as a
partnership (Form 1065). If we do that, how do we handle the two
home-office deductions?
</P>
<P>
   A: If the two of you are involved in the same business and split
the income 50-50, you can continue to file one Schedule C (the form
for sole proprietors) and two Schedule SE forms to properly report
self-employment tax, according to CPA Mary Kay Foss of the Danville
firm of Marzluft, Giles, Tulis &AMP; Foss. The IRS treats married
couples as one person for many tax purposes, but each of you has to
pay your share of the 15.3 percent self-employment tax.
</P>
<P>
   If your businesses are separate, you can file two forms of
Schedule C and two for Form 8829 for home office deductions. One
Schedule C can be filed if one spouse is the proprietor and the
other is an employee. In that situation, a Form W-2 will be
required for the employee-spouse.
</P>
<P>
   If both of you file as a partnership, you can still claim
office-in-home deductions. Form 8829 is used for Schedule C filers
only. A partnership would require all of the same information on
your own schedule.
</P>
<P>
   If you rent your home offices to the partnership, you need to
pay rent at the going rate per square foot in you neighborhood. No
sweetheart deals are allowed. What you pay in rent must then be
reported as income on your individual income tax returns.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever your arrangement, you should have it in writing, Foss
suggests. If you are a partnership, you should split income based
on the ratio of ownership. Note that Schedule C filers only report
income and expenses while partnerships must go through the added
step of preparing a balance sheet to report business assets and
liabilities.

 Greenspan Says World Troubles Hurt U.S. Farmers
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Sam Zuckerman &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan came to San Francisco
yesterday to speak just hours after the Dow Jones industrial
average briefly crashed through the 10,000 barrier for the first
time ever.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed chairman didn't utter a word about the market
because high finance wasn't on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who has frequently voiced his worries about
speculation in stocks and coined the phrase ``irrational
exuberance'' several thousand Dow points back, chose the occasion
to speak about the U.S. farm economy.
</P>
<P>
   While the overall U.S. economy experiences a remarkable mix of
robust growth, low unemployment and low inflation, ``agriculture
has been one of the more notable soft spots,'' Greenspan noted,
hurt by worldwide weakness in commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's choice of San Francisco as a venue to speak about
farming wasn't as odd as it seemed at first glance. His audience at
the Moscone Center consisted of more than 2,000 community bankers
in town for a convention of the Independent Bankers Association of
America, many from small-town banks that specialize in loans to
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed chief's outlook for the broader economy was, as usual,
ambiguous and delivered in his characteristic on-the-one-hand,
on-the-other-hand style.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy U.S. economy ``is partly the result of influences
that may prove transitory, but a number of fundamental strengths
imply more lasting benefits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan noted that, after eight years of economic growth,
`'the economy appears stretched in a number of dimensions, implying
considerable upside and downside risks to the economic outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   Weakness in farm prices reflects the sick economies of key
trading partners such as Japan and Russia, which have cut back
their imports of U.S. agricultural products. Farmers won't see
better times until troubled economies overseas recover, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   To survive under these conditions, farmers must keep on making
themselves more efficient and more productive by using the latest
technology, Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Showing that he is no fan of the environmentally sensitive
farming movement, the Fed chief touted ``heavier reliance on
chemicals and pesticides to reduce crop losses.''

 Turning Water Into Gold
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Peter Sinton &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Indian Wells Water Co. is putting a new twist on the bottled water
business.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonoma startup is trying to carve out a niche in the
thriving $4.3 billion U.S. water market with a distinctive pitch to
consumers who may want to improve the economic lot of American
Indians while slaking their thirst.
</P>
<P>
   The company is making an unprecedented attempt to market bottled
water as a purely American Indian enterprise. That means tapping
springs on tribal lands, building bottling plants there, hiring
local residents and returning profits to American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Wells hopes customers will find its efforts a refreshing
notion in a market dominated by such large, well-known players as
the Perrier Group, Suntory and McKesson HBOC Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which started selling its water in San Francisco
last month, still has a ways to go before it reaches its goal of
turning water into gold on Indian reservations. To date, Indian
Wells is bottling water from a natural but non-Indian source in
Sedona, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   The company, though, has lined up significant American Indian
support. For example, the Mille Lacs Band of Minnesota's Ojibwe
tribe last May invested $10 million for a 40 percent stake in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Wells also has various agreements with the Mille Lacs and
five other American Indian tribes, including the Washoe near Carson
City, Nev., to develop springs and build bottling plants. And it is
looking for one more tribe in Southern California to complete its
network of strategically located sites of water supply around &LR;   &LR; the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Although markets and convenience stores are swimming in bottled
water, Indian Wells chief executive Jim Stevens believes that
``cause marketing will help position the product.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, 51, knows something about selling water. In 1976, he
helped introduce Perrier to the United States. He then became chief
operating officer for the world's largest bottling company,
Coca-Cola Enterprises, and chief executive of Suntory Water Group,
the second-largest U.S. water company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to help American Indians develop a new economic
template besides casinos,'' said company President Brian McCarthy,
53. The former rear admiral in the Naval Reserve's Defense
Logistics Agency started Indian Wells a decade ago as a business
that delivered purified tap water to homes and offices.
</P>
<P>
   Then three years ago, he got out of that business and created a
new company that would be true to the Indian Wells name and sell
bottled water from Indian springs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, McCarthy recruited Stevens, who still lives in Atlanta,
to develop the concept. While talking to tribes about potential
sources of water, they approached European investors, who love both
bottled water and Indian lore, about sources of capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't think we could find the money in Indian country, so
we pursued more traditional finance methods,'' said McCarthy. But
the 3,000-member Mille Lacs surprised him and Stevens when they
expressed an interest in investing in Indian Wells. The Ojibwa band
already operate two profitable casinos in central Minnesota, about
80 miles from St. Paul, and have been a pioneer in plowing profits
back into development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy has been to become less casino dependent and
diversify into other industries that will benefit the band, create
jobs for members, help the surrounding community and have an impact
on Indian country beyond the Mille Lacs,'' said Kenneth Mimmack,
commissioner of corporate affairs for the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at getting into bottled water ourselves but realized
we had no experience or marketing ability,'' he added. ``That's
what we liked about Indian Wells.''
</P>
<P>
   With its investment, the band took two positions on the
startup's seven-person board to help ensure that Indian Wells
remains true to its mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals are good,'' agrees Richard Trudell, a Santee Sioux
who directs the American Indian Resources Institute in Oakland and
is an Indian Wells director. The startup's bottling plants will be
located on American Indian lands and each will be operated and 60
percent owned by the American Indian tribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for the 1.6 million American Indians living on
more than 550 federal reservations to diversify their economic
efforts, and to do so in a way that protects our resources,''
Trudell said.
</P>
<P>
   But finding springs with sufficient flow and acceptable mineral
content has sometimes been a challenge. The first few tests of
Mille Lacs water sources proved marginal at best, so the search
there continues.
</P>
<P>
   However, Indian Wells has found a suitable spring on
Narragansett Indian Tribe lands near Charlestown, R.I., and plans
to spend $7 million to $9 million to build a bottling plant there
within six months. CEO Stevens said this plant could supply the
entire Northeast market with 10 million cases of bottled water a
year and generate $70 million or $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Each participating tribe will receive all of the profits
generated by its bottling plant, 60 percent in cash and 40 percent
in Indian Wells stock. McCarthy and Stevens hope to make money from
marketing and distribution charges as well as appreciation of the
company's shares.
</P>
<P>
   The two executives are aware that establishing commercial
ventures on Indian lands involves special sensitivity. For example,
there may be problems getting members of the Squaxin Island Tribe
in Washington state to work at the plant because they like to go
clamming together at certain times of the year. To compensate for
those absences, the company realizes it will need to build up
sufficient inventory of bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Wells still has a long way to go before water rivals the
billions of dollars generated by casinos on American Indian
reservations or becomes as successful a venture as the more than
$50 million in sales generated by actor Paul Newman's popcorn,
salad dressing and other food lines, which benefit nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy and Stevens also face formidable competition in the
U.S. water business.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.3 billion U.S. Perrier Group, which is owned by Nestle,
is the largest contender with 75 springs and 18 brands including
California's Calistoga and Arrowhead. Suntory Group is second
largest and McKesson is third with its Alhambra, Sparkletts and
Crystal brands.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Coca-Cola announced plans to roll out its U.S. brand
of bottled water called Dasani. Instead of tapping natural springs,
Coke will turn on the tap and use reverse osmosis to filter and
purify the water before adding minerals for taste. Five years ago,
Coke's main soft-drink rival, PepsiCo, began selling its Aquafina
brand.
</P>
<P>
   There also are plenty of small players. For instance, Crystal
Cream &AMP; Butter Co. of Sacramento has been selling bottled water
from Sierra springs since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why companies see water as such a strong
selling point. Mike Newell, vice president for Crystal Cream, said
the profit margins of his company's water business are several
times fatter than the milk business' thin 2 percent returns.
</P>
<P>
   The sales growth in the water business also is far higher than
milk or sodas. John Sicher, editor of Beverage Digest, reports that
the $57 billion soft drink business is growing at about 3 percent a
year while the $4 billion bottled water business is growing 8
percent a year overall and the small bottle segment growing about
20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the competition, Indian Wells, with only 10 employees,
believes it has an important edge. Stevens points to surveys
showing 78 percent of consumers are more likely to buy a product
that is associated with a cause they care about, and 66 percent
would even switch brands.
</P>
<P>
   Indian Wells picked the Bay Area as its second market after
Arizona to sell bottled water. Last month, the Indian Wells brand
started to show up on independent grocery store shelves in San
Francisco and Marin. The firm is also planning radio commercials
featuring American Indian actor Michael Greyeyes.
</P>
<P>
   The distributor of Indian Wells bottled water is pleased with
sales so far. ``We've had an outstanding penetration rate,'' said
Don Saccani, whose Anchor and Mariner distribution companies also
deliver Anchor Steam, Miller and some other beers, soft drinks and
Calistoga water. ``In less than two months, 35 percent of the 1,250
stores we serve are taking Indian Wells.''

JUDGES APPROVE SOME CONFLICT OF INTEREST REFORMS, BUT NOT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE STEPENS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's top judges on Tuesday approved a range
of reforms aimed at reducing conflicts of interest, but they
rejected a plan favored by many in Congress: posting a list of each
judge's stock holdings at the local courthouse for anyone to see.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the U.S. Judicial Conference ended months of debate by
reaffirming its current disclosure system, which makes judges'
investments far more difficult to review than those of Congress and
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that disclosures of this nature intrude on judges'
financial privacy,'' a conference committee concluded.
</P>
<P>
   That could mean trouble at the Capitol, where lawmakers have
warned they would consider legislation if the judiciary did not
loosen its grip on the disclosure reports. Last year some
legislators proposed posting the reports on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association also may wade into the dispute. A
major division of the bar last month approved a resolution calling
for local disclosure of judges' stocks, and representatives of the
full bar are expected to vote on the matter in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Judicial Conference missed an important opportunity to
make public disclosure forms truly public,'' said Doug Kendall, a
Washington lawyer who favors reform. ``This gives the impression
that judges have something to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   A conference committee stressed on Tuesday that judges may
choose individually to make their investments public. The committee
also outlined a series of programs, ranging from ethics workshops
to conflict-detecting computer systems, that it hopes will ensure
judges obey ethics laws.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms stem from ``On Their Honor,'' a series published
last year by The Kansas City Star. The articles revealed that
federal judges in Kansas City and elsewhere repeatedly presided
over lawsuits against companies in which they owned stock, despite
laws forbidding such conflicts. The newspaper's study of judges in
four states uncovered more than 300 court orders entered in
violation of federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Although judges file lists of their investments in Washington,
the articles showed the judiciary shields those reports from the
public with an array of bureaucratic hurdles. Court officials
release the reports only after a lengthy administrative process and
only after warning the judge about who is investigating his or her
holdings. As a result, few people look at the reports or use them
to identify conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   The series sparked a barrage of criticism from Congress and
consumer advocates, and it led the conference to enact some reforms
at its last semi-annual meeting. At the September meeting, the
judges also referred the disclosure issue to five committees for
study.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, which sets policy for the federal judiciary,
reviewed the committee reports behind closed doors Tuesday. Chief
Justice William Rehnquist presided over the meeting at the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The reports raised many objections to providing what they
described as ``ready access'' to the disclosure lists, which are
public under federal law. Some judges decried a loss of privacy.
Others worried the lists would allow lawyers, by naming particular
corporations as defendants, to influence which judge heard their
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee,'' one report said, ``concluded that no ethical
principles required judges to make available lists of financial
interests.'' MORE

 McDOUGAL TRIAL SEES MRS. CLINTON'S VIDEOTAPE  
(sw) 
 By STEVE BARNES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, appearing Tuesday on
videotape in the trial of a woman who once was her business partner
in the Whitewater real estate deal, testified that she had little
knowledge of the development company's financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen these documents before and I have no
information about them,'' Mrs. Clinton said when prosecutors for
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, presented copies of loan
papers in the name of her husband, taken out in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never spent any significant time at all looking at the books
and records of Whitewater,'' Mrs. Clinton said at another point in
her previously secret grand jury testimony, which was given at the
White House last April 25.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony came in the trial of Susan McDougal, who is
charged with criminal contempt of court and obstruction of justice
for refusing to answer questions about Whitewater transactions,
including some that were nearly identical to those posed to Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal, her former husband, James McDougal, and Jim Guy
Tucker, who was then governor of Arkansas, were found guilty of
fraud in 1996 in connection with a series of interlocking
transactions, including a $300,000 loan in 1986 to Mrs. McDougal
that an Arkansas businessman testified he granted to her at Bill
Clinton's urging.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial now under way, the focus has been on a $27,600 loan
made in 1982 in Clinton's name by an Arkansas savings and loan
controlled by James McDougal, who has since died, and a $5,081.82
check written in 1983 by Mrs. McDougal with the notation, ``Pay off
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's prosecutors have long contended that part of the 1986
loan to Mrs. McDougal was improperly diverted to the Whitewater
real estate partnership. They maintain that other funds from the
loan were similarly laundered to largely retire the loan made in
Clinton's name.
</P>
<P>
   As a defense witness in 1996, President Clinton denied any
knowledge of the loan to Mrs. McDougal and said he had never
borrowed money from Madison Guaranty, McDougal's savings and loan
company. When McDougal began cooperating with prosecutors after his
conviction, he reversed himself and contradicted Clinton on both
points, according to an FBI agent who testified last week. It was
with McDougal's guidance, said the agent, Michael Patkus, that
investigators found the $27,600 loan in Clinton's name.
</P>
<P>
   The cashier's check, recovered in 1997, does not bear Clinton's
endorsement, however, and Starr's staff has acknowledged that
Clinton may have been unaware of the loan, as the president's
lawyers have suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about this,'' Mrs. Clinton was heard to
say on Tuesday about the loan. ``So far as I knew,'' she testified,
McDougal saw to the Whitewater partnership ``until the very end.''
</P>
<P>
   All the more reason for Mrs. McDougal's cooperation, say
prosecutors, who note that she is the only member of the original
Whitewater partnership to not have testified about the loans and to
whether Clinton was truthful in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton also disputed a bit of conventional wisdom about
the relationship between the two couples in the partnership,
replying, when asked if she and her husband were social friends
with the McDougals, ``No, we were not.''

COMPUTER SALES HEAD FOR SLUMP THIS FALL, SOME ANALYSTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Many businesses will quit buying computers as the new
millennium approaches to avoid adding to system problems that may
be created by the arrival of Y2K, market research shows.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in the number of computers shipped is expected to
drop from 16.96 percent in the third quarter to 7.59 percent in the
fourth quarter, according to Cahners In-Stat Group, a high-tech
market research firm with offices in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter is typically the strongest period of growth
for personal computer shipments, but problems the arrival of the
next millennium may cause is expected to result in a drop this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a risk management approach that most sane (information
technology) managers will want to take to survive through January
first,'' said Martin Goslar, who directs the Internet commerce and
PC market services for Cahners In-Stat.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn should be brief.
</P>
<P>
   However, the situation could mean good news for consumers.
Manufacturers may slash prices in an effort to keep inventory low.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some deals might be available that weren't there before,''
Goslar said.
</P>
<P>
   The research firm spoke to information technology managers in a
cross section of businesses before predicting the downturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is highly likely that in the fourth quarter, we're going to
have a lockdown to some degree,'' Goslar said.
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to the computer sales slump is that the businesses
will be spending their technology budgets on making sure their
systems are Year 2000 compliant. That will leave less money
available for buying new computers.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth quarter stall is expected to trickle into other areas
as well, affecting sales of items such as networking equipment. &QL;

   financial interests.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded that posting the lists could tacitly shift
responsibility for uncovering conflicts from the judges to the
public. It added that judges' enemies also could use the
information to file fake liens against their land holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Making the lists accessible outside Washington could ``create
substantial security risks,'' the report warned, without explaining
how.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have ridiculed that claim, pointing out the lists do not
include addresses or phone numbers for the judges. They argue many
jurists want the power of high public office but not the
accompanying scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the chairman of the conference's executive committee
said the judiciary takes the issue seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recommendation was not that we turn a deaf ear to this
problem and go on to something else,'' said the chairman, Judge W.
Terrell Hodges. ``It was that we redouble our effort to educate
judges.''
</P>
<P>
   Among reform efforts outlined in conference reports:
</P>
<P>
   - Court officials have shipped ``informational letters'' to all
federal judges, reminding them of their duty under ethics laws.
More educational materials will be distributed to all 2,000 federal
judges this spring.
</P>
<P>
   - Ethics training will be incorporated into a variety of
workshops and seminars for federal judges. That process began last
year, when the Federal Judicial Center included segments on ethics
in education programs it presented to judges around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   - Two computer systems are under development to automatically
flag conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   One will be adapted from software already in use in Maine that
identifies conflicts by comparing judges' investments with
computerized docket reports. Court officials will incorporate the
other system into the expansive Electronic Case Files project,
which they hope will one day eliminate paper court records.
</P>
<P>
   - The conference is recommending that all judges perform an
additional ``recusal check'' before entering their first court
order in any lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   - The conference will distribute two checklists judges can use
to ensure they do not overlook conflicts of interest. One will
focus on financial holdings, the other on non-financial conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   - One committee will continue to study changing federal rules to
require litigants to identify all corporate affiliations.
</P>
<P>
   Judges in the Western District of Missouri last month approved a
similar rule. It requires corporations named in a lawsuit to supply
a list of all their subsidiaries, any parent companies and any
affiliates. Clerks can compare those companies to a judge's
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's vote, federal judges in western Missouri will
continue to file lists of their investments at the courthouse in
Kansas City. They enacted that reform last year, shortly after The
Star published its findings.
</P>
<P>
   The conference released its decision late Tuesday, limiting
immediate reaction. Congressional staffers said they would review
the announcement and speculated that lawmakers might choose to
reopen the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, members of both the House and Senate called for
changes in the way judges disclose their investments. One advocate
of reform was Rep. Howard Coble, a North Carolina Republican and
chairman of a House subcommittee on the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think judges' financial holdings ought to be insulated
from public knowledge,'' Coble said at the time. ``I want to get
some sunlight into what appears to be a dark room.''
</P>
<P>
   The judicial conference is the principal policy-making body for
the federal courts. The chief justice serves as presiding officer
of the group, which meets twice a year at the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Other members include the chief judges of the 13 courts of
appeal, a district judge from 12 geographic circuits and the chief
judge of the Court of International Trade.

 &HT;    Little OSU shoot to slay goliath Tigers
 &HT;    By Susan Vinella
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Jason Singleton is used to standing on the
basketball court and looking up.
</P>
<P>
   That's the position Ohio State's 6-foot-5 power forward has
found himself in frequently this season. Singleton will be there
again on Thursday, when the fourth-seeded Buckeyes face top-seeded
Auburn in the South Regional semifinals of the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers (29-3) boast a starting frontcourt with a 7-foot
center in Mamadou N'Diaye and a 6-7 power forward in Chris Porter,
the Southeastern Conference's player of the year. Their reserves go
6-7 and 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're a big team and they want to go crash the boards,'' OSU
point guard Scoonie Penn said. ``We have a problem with that
because we're undersized.''
</P>
<P>
   Auburn ranked fourth nationally in rebounding margin during the
regular season, grabbing 44 per game while giving up 34.8. In their
first and second round NCAA games, the Tigers grabbed an average of
10 more rebounds per game than their opponents and scored a total
of 40 points from second-chance shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest fear is their ability to rebound on offense,'' Ohio
State coach Jim O'Brien said. ``That's been one of our obvious
deficiencies this year and it seems like one of their strengths.
That's going to be a real concern.''
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the disadvantage he'll have against a taller
opponent, Singleton said he'll have to be smarter and quicker.
He'll study more film to learn Porter's tendencies in an effort to
anticipate them on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll just try to use my intelligence, my quickness and wit,''
Singleton said.
</P>
<P>
   Equally as important for Ohio State is keeping 6-11 center Ken
Johnson in the game. The Bucks tallest player, Johnson is a
terrific shot blocker who can alter a game. But he's also prone to
foul trouble. With him on the bench, OSU shrinks significantly with
6-7 forward George Reese as his replacement. And its defense
becomes more conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Kenny's not in foul trouble and he's blocking shots, we
can take a lot of chances out there,'' Penn said. ``We can get in
the passing lanes a little bit more. We can play our pressure
defense even more.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien continues to stress to Johnson that he doesn't have to
block every shot. That sometimes, positioning himself for rebounds
is more important than trying to swat balls away. Johnson said he's
trying to play smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I have to do is stay confident, stay on the ground and
time shots well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, who, in a fluke, grabbed 12 rebounds in OSU's second round
rout of Detroit, doesn't expect to finish with similar numbers
against Auburn. But he knows if OSU hopes to pull off the upset,
his taller teammates will have to be aggressive on the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure if we can keep those guys off of second shots, we'll
have a good chance of winning the game,'' Penn said. ``That's their
biggest thing, rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen them go up and down (the court in transition). But I
feel we can play that way and we can really change the whole tempo
of the game.'

THE DEFICIT IS DEAD, THE TAXES ABIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to budget policy, Uncle Sam plays a heads-I-win,
tails-you-lose game with America's taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   The specter of humongous deficits ``as far as the eye could
see'' as the decade dawned justified tax increases as critical to
stanching chronic budgetary hemorrhages.
</P>
<P>
   Call it a great American tradition, and the telephone excise tax
is the granddaddy of all such taxes. It was imposed 101 years ago
to finance the Spanish-American War. The war ended, but the levy
remained as a ``luxury'' tax because only rich people and
businesses had telephones.
</P>
<P>
   It lived on in perpetuity, and the escalation of America's
involvement in Vietnam prompted Washington to boost it from 3
percent to 10 percent to help finance the war effort. The telephone
tax was subsequently scaled back but never repealed, even though it
was a target for elimination occasionally in the '80s. In 1990, it
was made permanent as part of the deficit-reduction arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward eight years to the arrival of the first U.S. budget
surplus in nearly three decades, which has been accompanied by
forecasts of several trillions more in surpluses over the next 15
years. Is anyone proposing repeal of the telephone tax because its
putative purpose as a deficit-cutting tool no longer exists?
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the gasoline tax boost legislated in 1993 to help
bring down the deficit? Gas taxes had historically been levied to
raise money to build and maintain roads and bridges for the
motoring public. After the deficit hit a record $290 billion in
fiscal 1992, however, panic hit Washington. The fear of
half-a-trillion-dollar shortfalls by the end of the 1990s led to a
sense of revenue-enhancement urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the federal gasoline tax was boosted a few cents a gallon
to help ameliorate the deficit problem rather than maintain the
highway system. As gasoline prices have fallen to historic lows,
that tax increase has receded from the national consciousness.
Nevertheless, it remains, even though the deficit crisis used to
justify it no longer exists.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the cheaper gasoline gets, the more it
encourages gas consumption, which increases its revenue-raising
potential. Therefore, it's small wonder nobody in Washington has
stepped forth to advocate repeal of the tax now that the Treasury
expects to be awash in budgetary surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Washington will dole out a lot of cash for highway
work. It will also direct a lot of the gas tax revenue to
pork-barrel transit projects. At the same time, however, a lot of
money will be used to finance budget outlays that have nothing to
do with transportation needs. When this happens, the highway trust
fund will get the same sort of IOU the Social Security trust fund
gets after its surplus revenue is spent on other things.
</P>
<P>
   What most Americans don't realize is that the looting of Social
Security surpluses is merely the largest of many such trust-fund
rip-offs. Whereas the trust funds once masked the size of deficits,
they now create surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the resulting surplus funds are made possible by revenue
from taxes approved specifically to ease deficits. The deficit is a
thing of the past, they say, but these taxes remain.
</P>
<P>
   Why?

GOLDMAN REVEALS PLANS TO GO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A secretary plans to buy a summer home. A 36-year-old banker is
already pondering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to stock. Not the Dow Jones industrial average,
which briefly flirted with the 10,000 mark Tuesday. But to stock in
Wall Street's last big private partnership, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
which detailed its plans to go public Tuesday and offered a glimpse
of how it will divide about $21 billion in projected net worth.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street legalese, substantially all of Goldman's 13,000
employees will get a stake in the blue-chip investment bank when it
sells shares this spring. The general partners who currently own
the firm will get substantially more _ the average value of their
shares will reach about $50 million. But employees below that level
will share a $4 billion windfall _ secretaries, janitors and word
processors included.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like winning the lottery: We earned it,'' insisted a
corporate secretary at Goldman's beige-stone headquarters on 85
Broad Street, catty cornered to the New York Stock Exchange. ``But
it's a little like the lottery, I guess, because it's not the kind
of pay you get everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Not on Wall Street, anyway. Though many of the Internet start up
companies that go public these days turn their founding employees
into overnight millionaires, Goldman says it is the first
securities firm, and one of the only companies in history, to share
the spoils from a public offering with employees who have no
ownership stake. It is sharing 20 percent of the firm's estimated
value, according to details provided in the formal registration
that the firm filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Under this share-the-wealth formula, a secretary in Hong Kong
who took home $40,000 last year and has worked at the firm for five
years will get a stock bonus worth about $25,000, some of that in
shares that cannot be sold right away. A newly hired New York
janitor might get $10,000. One rising banker who earned half a
million last year said he expected to receive Goldman stock and
options valued at about $1 million, though payments have yet to be
finally determined
</P>
<P>
   Partners, of course, will see their stakes increase much more.
Even the most junior of Goldman's 221 partners, including 58
promoted only three months ago, will have shares valued at about
$20 million if the public offering goes as planned, people familiar
with Goldman's plans said. The most senior partners, led by Henry
M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive, will see their stakes rise to
more than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman employees were not exactly clicking their heels as they
knocked off work for the day Tuesday. But many had trouble
suppressing smiles despite the firm's blanket ban on indulging the
press, especially when it comes to the coming public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lucky,'' said one young banking associate, smoking a
cigarette as he picked out his chauffuered sedan from the line of
black cars outside headquarters. ``I just wish I got here a few
years earlier,'' he said, explaining that those with longer tenure
will get a bigger slice of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is the only major Wall Street firm that bucked the trend
to go public in the 1970s and 1980s. Partners there said over and
over that they did not want to sell shares because that would risk
diluting the firm's famously aggressive culture. Even more than
other securities firms, Goldman is well known for keeping its
bankers on call most hours of the day and night and elbowing its
way to the top of the rankings in the most lucrative areas of
finance.
</P>
<P>
   But the record amount of money investors have been willing to
pay for top securities firms recently _ and Goldman's worries about
whether it has enough ammunition to compete in the new financial
world of megacompanies _ prompted a rethinking. Goldman partners
first voted to go public last summer, only to have the plan
derailed by the downturn in financial markets last fall. The
offering was revived amid the strong comeback recently for
financial stocks, and Goldman now hopes to complete the offering by
early May.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman wants to sell the public 11 to 13 percent of its shares,
raising perhaps as much as $3.45 billion. Depending on the price
investors are finally willing to pay, the firm as a whole would
have a market value of $18 billion to $24 billion, which would make
it the third-largest on Wall Street after Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The firm disclosed in its filing Tuesday that it lost $663
million in an area of the business known as trading and proprietary
investments, with most of that loss attributable to turmoil in the
world bond market after Russia defaulted on its debt in August.
Many other securities firms had trouble as well at that time, but
the steep loss might keep Goldman, despite its premium brand name,
from pricing its shares above those of its top rivals. Most
analysts expect Goldman to sell at about a 10 percent to 20 percent
discount to Merrill and Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was caught by surprise how much of their profits come from
trading, and how that can really be volatile,'' said Hal Schroeder,
an expert on investment banks at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``I don't
think that they have the earnings stability some other firms do and
so they will trade at a discount.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the offering will probably be the second largest in U.S.
history, following Conoco's $4.4 billion public offering last year.
And Goldman now has momentum on its side, with the Dow gearing up
to surpass 10,000 and Goldman's earnings soaring. The firm reported
first-quarter pretax earnings of $1.19 billion, up 16 percent from
a year earlier, dispelling any notion that last year's woes would
hold back its performance in the first part of this year.

POPULIST LEADER BO GRITZ EMBODIES THE INTRIGUE OF AMERICA'S RIGHT
WING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY L. THOMAS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) _ Bo Gritz is a leader in the Christian
Patriot movement, a talk-show host and a one-time presidential
candidate. He calls himself the most-decorated Green Beret
commander from the Vietnam War and the ``real-life Rambo.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters call him a hero. An American freedom fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Critics call him a huckster. And perhaps a fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he's called, Gritz (pronounced ``grites'') is used to
the labels. Now it appears that Kansas City had better get used to
him.
</P>
<P>
   Next month Gritz will be among 200 exhibitors at a
``preparedness expo'' at Bartle Hall. His mission: teach people how
to cope with the computer- and millennium-related chaos that he
believes will erupt in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz also told The Kansas City Star that he wanted to form a
``constitutional covenant community'' in the Ozarks similar to
Almost Heaven, a colony he founded in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   In Almost Heaven, residents must sign a ``covenant'' pledging to
defend the constitutional rights of their neighbors. If authorities
come for them, they will protect one another, even if they have to
take up arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking into securing property that can be formed into a
safe area for Americans,'' Gritz said. ``The Ozark station will be
affordable, undeveloped, with little or no restrictions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's increased presence in Missouri intrigues authorities and
those who monitor the far right. His appearances, they say, may
provide a forum in which disparate zealots can come together. Once
together, authorities fear, they may give voice to their anger,
which could lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a covenant community in the Ozarks also worries
observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He accumulates into these places a hodgepodge of very
eccentric folks,'' said Bill Wassmuth, director of the Northwest
Coalition Against Malicious Harassment, in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``These leaders fill these guys full of rhetoric and ideas and
ultimatums and paranoia and fear and anger, and then, sooner or
later, one or two of them loses it...and starts committing
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, 60, who lives in the state of Nevada, scoffs at such
talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those detractors have never been to Almost Heaven,'' he said.
``They've never read anything I've written or heard anything I've
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's many followers remain loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever meet the man up close and personal, one of the
things that you find with him is a sincerity and an honesty that
you can see in his eyes and his face,'' said Ron Stafford of Kansas
City, who calls himself the ``general'' of the United States
Militia.
</P>
<P>
   Others in the movement, however, call Gritz a phony.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Bo Gritz does is get people inflamed,'' said Clay Douglas,
publisher of The Free American Newsmagazine, a patriot publication
based in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't give them any real facts. He doesn't offer any
solutions. The only thing he wants to do is take your money and fly
around the country in his airplane.'' No stranger to news
</P>
<P>
   Gritz made national headlines in the 1980s when he led several
forays into Laos in search of American soldiers who many thought
were still being held as prisoners from the war in Vietnam. He made
news in 1992 when he talked white separatist Randy Weaver into
surrendering in the standoff at Ruby Ridge, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later he tried _ unsuccessfully _ to mediate in the
``freemen'' standoff in Jordan, Mont. Last August he led dozens of
colleagues through the North Carolina mountains in a fruitless
search for Eric Rudolph, a suspect in bombings of abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after his wife of 24 years told him she wanted a divorce,
Gritz shot himself in the chest. He survived, and many _ including
police and his own son _ questioned whether the former Special
Forces commander had really intended to kill himself. Gritz says
that he wanted to die but now thinks God saved him for a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever people think of Gritz, all agree that he has been a
very busy man. Among his accomplishments, all of which can be
verified:
</P>
<P>
   - He earned a bachelor's degree in law and corrections from the
University of Nebraska and a master's in communications from
American University.
</P>
<P>
   - He led dozens of special military operations in Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   - He is a commercial pilot and flight instructor.
</P>
<P>
   - He holds a sixth-degree black belt in karate.
</P>
<P>
   - He is an underwater demolitions expert and a certified
hypnotherapist.
</P>
<P>
   Going beyond accomplishments that can be verified, though, Gritz
also says that he was featured as ``the'' American soldier in Gen.
William C. Westmoreland's memoirs, A Soldier Reports. And Gritz
says he was the model for the hero in the ``Rambo'' movies. MORE

 &HT;    Phillis calls on Ohio to change school funding policies
 &HT;    By Lynn Hulsey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ About 325 Ohio school districts are too wealthy
to get special state help but struggle to make ends meet with local
tax dollars, according to William Phillis, executive director of
the Ohio Coalition for Equity and Adequacy of School Funding.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Phillis brought that message to the Ohio Statehouse
atrium, in what he said will be a series of similar news
conferences across the state.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Milburn, spokesman for Gov. Bob Taft, said the state has
made major commitments to education in the last few years and the
governor has proposed spending a record $13 billion on schools in
the state's 611 districts over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people in the education community want a blank check
from the state,'' Milburn said. ``The governor believes that we
have to have accountability for the massive amount of dollars that
we're investing in education.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillis' group, a coalition of Ohio school districts,
successfully sued the state over its school funding system, which
was found unconstitutional by the Ohio Supreme Court in 1997. In
February, a Perry County Common Pleas judge said the system remains
unconstitutional, despite changes enacted last year by the Ohio
Legislature. The state plans an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the state's recent funding changes benefited the state's
poorest districts, funneling more money to disadvantaged pupils and
targeting crumbling school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Phillis argues that the state is ignoring the needs of most
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this group of districts in the mid-wealth range that
are emerging as the new poor,'' said Phillis.
</P>
<P>
   By his definition ``mid-wealth'' districts are those where the
community's per pupil property valuations range from $56,559 to
$113,371, which would include the majority of the Miami Valley's 61
school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening here is that the whole system is grossly
underfunded,'' Phillis said during a phone interview after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Huber Heights, which has a per pupil property valuation of
$66,394, is one local struggling district. It faces a $3 million
projected deficit by June 30, 2000 without additional revenue or
cuts. Seven efforts to get voters to approve a new operating levy
have failed since 1991 and the district is on the May ballot with a
6.5 mill continuing levy, said Cheryl Dale, the district's central
office coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system is flawed, therefore it causes us to rely on our
property owners to make up any gaps in funding,'' said Dale. ``Its
getting harder and harder to get voters to say yes on these
levies.''

<P>
   ``Rambo'' movies. A closer examination suggests that some of the
claims are overstated.
</P>
<P>
   - Westmoreland, who was Vietnam field commander from 1964 to
1968 and Army Chief of Staff from 1968 to 1972, said he was not
referring to Gritz as ``The American Soldier'' in the chapter by
that name in his book.
</P>
<P>
   Five pages of the 21-page chapter describe Gritz's
accomplishments. Referring to Gritz as a ``daring young
commander,'' Westmoreland describes how Gritz and his South
Vietnamese guerrilla force recovered the ``black box'' from a U-2
spy plane after it exploded along the Cambodian border.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, however, Westmoreland said the chapter
title was not referring to anyone in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``My intent was to talk about the typical American soldier,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Westmoreland described Gritz as ``a very energetic, can-do type
of guy.'' But he also said Gritz was ``a loose cannon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You never knew where...he was going or what he was going to
do,'' he said. ``You want people like that...on the battlefield.
But to translate that to a peacetime civilian society is another
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   - As for Gritz's being the most decorated Green Beret commander,
an Army spokesman says there is no such category.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to shortchange anyone by trying to make a
category that is so subjective,'' said Col. John Smith of the
Army's public affairs office. ``So if someone makes that claim, I
would be suspicious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudi Gresham, a spokesman for the Special Forces Association,
said that even if there were such a category, ``in order to be the
most decorated, you would have to have gotten the Medal of Honor,
and he certainly has not gotten the Medal of Honor.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of his 22-year career in the Army, Gritz had
accumulated 62 decorations, including five Silver Stars, 10 Bronze
Stars, two Legion of Merit awards, the Distinguished Flying Cross,
two Purple Hearts, the Soldier's Medal and 26 Air Medals.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz said he was once referred to as the ``most decorated Green
Beret commander'' at a medal ceremony in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody asked a question about the decorations, and somebody
answered, `Bo Gritz is the most decorated Green Beret
commander,' &UR; '' he said. ``That's how that came about.''
</P>
<P>
   - As for the Rambo label, Gritz routinely refers to himself as
``Rambo'' in speeches and in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   But David Morrell, the author of First Blood, the 1972 book
whose character, John Rambo, spawned the movie series, said he had
never heard of Gritz until 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``No real-life Vietnam soldier was ever used as a model for the
character, although Audie Murphy (from World War II) came to
mind,'' Morrell said. ``Certainly...Rambo of First Blood had
nothing to do with him (Gritz) or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the ``Rambo'' producers had Gritz in mind when
they made the second movie, but I knew them reasonably well and
never once heard his name mentioned.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Rambo: First Blood Part II,'' movie, John Rambo goes to
Cambodia in search of American POWs and finds he's been duped by
Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz acknowledged that he had never spoken with anyone
associated with the ``Rambo'' movies. But he said it was obvious
that the movie was modeled after him because of the similarities
between his experiences and Rambo's. An early military start
</P>
<P>
   James Gordon Gritz was born on Jan. 18, 1939, and from an early
age he loved the idea of being a soldier.
</P>
<P>
   His father, 1st Lt. Roy L. Gritz, a World War II pilot, was
killed Nov. 19, 1944, while on a mission. At 14, Gritz used $10,000
of his father's insurance policy to enroll at a military academy.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz joined the Army in 1957, finding his calling in the newly
formed Special Forces. When the Vietnam War came along, he couldn't
wait to go.
</P>

   ``I needed to be tested,'' he wrote in his 1991 book, Called to
Serve. ``I wanted to go out and hit something.''

short for ``Jimbo'' _ became a hero among his comrades. MORE

 WASHINGTON: Snowe, R-Maine.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January, the administration began to backpedal. The White
House announced it was asking Russia to renegotiate the ABM treaty
to permit a limited national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Defense Secretary William Cohen and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff testified to Congress that the administration was
pledging $6.6 billion over the next six years to build a network of
radar and interceptor missiles.
</P>
<P>
   That commitment increased the budget for a national missile
defense to $10.5 billion between now and 2005. The administration
has said it would decide next year whether to build an antimissile
system _ perhaps based in Alaska or North Dakota, or on ships _
that would be ready by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Even as senior U.S. officials sought to calm Russian fears and
explain that the system was intended to protect against outlaw
nations, the unity of Senate Democrats was fracturing so badly that
leaders expressed concern they would not be able to muster 33 votes
to sustain a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats negotiated two amendments that are vague enough for
both sides to interpret them the way they want. The first, which
also passed 99 to 0, assures that any money to be spent on a
missile system would go through the regular congressional
appropriations process. The second was the arms control amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments were embraced both by Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.,
one of the bill's chief sponsors, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., one
of its chief foes.
</P>
<P>
   But arms control advocates, who fear that fielding a missile
system will undermine nuclear weapons cuts, criticized the
negotiating. ``The Senate has taken a sow's ear, put a little rouge
on, slapped on some lipstick, and produced a sow's ear,'' said John
Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World, an arms
control advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Before striking the compromise, Democrats and Republicans argued
bitterly over the legislation. ``A national missile defense can't
protect us from a low-flying cruise missile launched by a third
world despot or from a terrorist who plants a bomb under a
skyscraper in lower Manhattan,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.Dak.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said: ``It's time for Congress
to wake up and act. The technology to develop and deliver nuclear
and other weapons of mass destruction is widely available and
spreading rapidly.''

   his comrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``James G. Gritz is one of the finest Army officers I have ever
known in my life,'' wrote one of his superiors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He displayed a positive genius for winning the fanatic
devotion of his native troops and the absolute loyalty of his
American officers and men. They would follow him into the jaws of
death confident that he would bring them through to victory.''
</P>
<P>
   But in 1974, Gritz was still struggling with an identity crisis
brought on, he said, by the 400 Viet Cong he killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In special operations, I never had a job where I wasn't out in
the jungle killing people,'' he said. ``It really screws you up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz retired in 1979 as a lieutenant colonel. He says he was
asked by a Pentagon official to retire so he could lead POW rescue
missions.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1980, Gritz began to organize Operation Velvet
Hammer to do just that _ find Americans still being held prisoner.
In March 1981 he began training 25 former Green Berets for the
task, but the mission was called off. Gritz says he was told by
government officials that the Delta Force already had a plan to
rescue the POWs.
</P>
<P>
   He started putting together a new mission, called Operation
Grand Eagle. That plan was shelved in January 1982.
</P>
<P>
   A determined Gritz picked up the pieces and began assembling
Operation Lazarus. He hired guerrillas and entered Laos in search
of POWs in November 1982. The mission was aborted when the party
was ambushed.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1983, Gritz and four others _ including a University
of Kansas graduate searching for her lost father _ were arrested in
Thailand for illegal possession of a radio transmitter. They were
ordered to leave the country.
</P>
<P>
   It was later revealed that Operation Lazarus was financed by
private donors, including actor Clint Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   After Gritz's highly publicized expeditions into Laos, he was
invited to testify before a congressional committee, where he said
he thought that at least 50 Americans were still being held.
</P>
<P>
   When asked for evidence, Gritz said: ``I have the same evidence,
sir, that might be presented by a clergyman to convince you that
God exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Then-Rep. Robert Torricelli, a New Jersey Democrat, replied:
``Colonel, time is either going to prove you to be one of the great
heroes of our time, or you are going to have a very difficult time
with your conscience for raising the hopes of desperate families.''
</P>
<P>
   In the hearings, the State Department's Richard Armitage
testified that analysis of two bags of bones recovered by Gritz's
team had determined that the remains were those of two southeast
Asians mingled with those of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz later acknowledged that he had no solid POW evidence,
saying that the pictures taken of a camp in Laos where American
prisoners were allegedly being held had not turned out, because he
had used the wrong camera setting.
</P>
<P>
   In her 1994 book, Prisoners of Hope: Exploiting the POW/MIA Myth
in America, Susan Katz Keating criticized Gritz, saying that ``at
best, Gritz is an inveterate publicity hound.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But if Gritz at first comes across as an amusing egotist, he
is also a charismatic leader gone wrong, a man who has toyed with
human lives while in pursuit of his goals,'' Keating wrote. ``In
the process, he has earned a dubious distinction, a place of note
among the charlatans whose claims have so distorted the MIA issue;
for it is Bo Gritz, American hero, who is directly responsible for
constructing much of the framework that supports the POW hoax
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz says his efforts were sincere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there were American prisoners being held,'' he said.
``And none of them came home.''
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the government for the failure of his POW missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could do all the things I did in Vietnam, why...couldn't
we do something kind of simple, like in Laos?'' he said. ``Every
time we got into a place where we could accomplish the mission,
something happened. It was just too much coincidence.'' The
political fray
</P>
<P>
   In March 1988, Gritz attended the Populist Party's national
committee meeting and gave such an electrifying speech that the
delegates nominated him for vice president.
</P>
<P>
   His presidential running mate: former Ku Klux Klansman David

   David Duke.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Duke and Rambo!'' proclaimed the April 1988 cover of
``The Populist Observer'' newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz says he did not know that Duke would be on the ticket when
he accepted the nomination. He eventually withdrew, but four years
later he ran for president on the Populist Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Bo's continuing denial,'' said Wassmuth of the Northwest
Coalition Against Malicious Harassment. ``He'll sidle up to
somebody, then that person gets identified in public as a racist,
then Bo backs away.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz has also been criticized for his connections to the
Christian Identity movement. According to Identity teachings, Jews
are the root of all the world's problems, and nonwhites are
inferior to whites.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, who has spoken at several Christian Identity functions,
says that doesn't mean he accepts the doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely reject the premise that if you're not white, you
don't have a soul,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After dabbling in politics, Gritz founded the Center for Action
in 1989 to ``put accountability back into government.''
</P>
<P>
   Through the Center, Gritz sponsors SPIKE Delta Force training.
SPIKE stands for ``Specially Trained Individuals for Key Events.''
The training, Gritz says, is the same as that received by elite
troops in the Army's Special Operations Command.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz has turned the Center for Action into a full-time business
and says he has trained more than 5,000 students, or ``Spikers.''
Sessions include courses on everything from performing emergency
surgery to passing a lie-detector test.
</P>
<P>
   One session took place in Kansas City in January, when about 140
persons paid $150 each to learn how to pick locks. Gritz says he'll
be conducting phase two of his SPIKE course when he returns in
mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be primarily to assault-proof every man, woman and
child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, of the Free American, says the sessions are dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what he does is give the people just enough training
to get themselves hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz also has a radio show, ``Freedom Call,'' broadcast Monday
through Friday. In the Kansas City area the show runs from 9 to 11
a.m. on KCXL, 1140 AM. It can also be picked up on shortwave radio.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's main topics these days is a cause that could
land Gritz in prison. Gritz is facing a 40-year sentence for trying
to help a Connecticut woman regain custody of two children in a
divorce case. Gritz and his son are charged with conspiracy to
commit kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz denies the accusations. ``Absolute hogwash,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suicide or sympathy?
</P>
<P>
   Gritz was back in the national spotlight last August when he
announced that he was going to Andrews, N.C., to try to persuade
Rudolph, the abortion clinic bombing suspect, to turn himself in.
</P>
<P>
   The searchers went home empty-handed after eight days. MORE

MITTELEUROPA LOSES JOURNAL SOROS BACKED
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The post-Communist world's sole
magazine devoted to analyzing the region's own transformations is
dead, a victim of the Russian financial crisis, bad management and
the shifting priorities of its main supporter, the financier George
Soros.
</P>
<P>
   The monthly, Transitions, founded in 1994 and based here, has
published its last issue and will lay off its small staff at the
end of the month, its publisher, Jan Urban, said Tuesday in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Although its circulation was less than 8,000, much of its
readership was in the countries of the former Soviet bloc. The
magazine and its Web site, which are in English, were one of the
few common strands to link the professional, scholarly and
political elites of the former Communist bloc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a loss in every way,'' said Jiri Pehe, a former
journalist and political adviser to President Vaclav Havel. ``It is
the only journal of its kind reporting on developments in Central
Europe and the former Soviet Union that is actually read by the
people living there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefim Fistein, former editor in chief of a Czech daily, Lidove
Noviny, said Transitions was the lone magazine to attempt
comparative studies of development in the region on issues like
privatization, human rights, the treatment of minorities and crime.
It helped leaders avoid mistakes made by other countries, and it
also provided journalists and scholars in the region a chance to
write for a wider audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very convenient tool, not only for the Easterner, who
gets little information from his own press about his neighbors, but
for the Westerner, too, whose knowledge about the region is even
lower than here,'' said Fistein, now assistant director of
broadcasting for Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Urban, a well-known former dissident, said that without the
magazine ``there will be no real bridge from the emerging
English-language elite, pro-democracy and pro-free-market, to the
West and to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Urban said he had underestimated the difficulty of finding
alternative financing when Soros told him that he would cut back
his yearly grant to the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our circulation was rising, and we were getting 300,000 visits
a month to our Web site,'' he said. ``It's not that the magazine
was unsuccessful. But we were not able to finance it in the long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing directors of foundations and companies are hard to
sell on a diffuse readership in 75 countries, Urban said, adding,
``We didn't have time to convince the corporate world of this
venture's importance in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years, ``the region is less sexy, and it's very
complicated to report on transitional nations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This region is underreported in the Western media generally,''
Urban added.
</P>
<P>
   But others at the magazine and elsewhere said that Urban was not
extremely business minded or entrepreneurial and that he did too
little to raise money or earn it.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Soros Foundations and the Open Society
Institute, Aryeh Neier, said in a telephone interview from New York
that Soros simply did not want to finance forever an expensive
magazine of small circulation.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine had evolved from a research report of Radio Free
Europe and Radio Liberty. Soros had subsidized it as part of the
Open Media Research Institute. When that closed in 1997, the
magazine was published by another independent foundation. But Soros
still provided most of the support, and the magazine became more
journalistic, attractive and lively.
</P>
<P>
   Soros agreed to give it $1 million in 1998, with the grant
declining by $250,000 a year, to push the magazine to be
self-sustaining. But Urban had secured less than $100,000 in new
financing for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see it have other sources of revenue,
primarily advertising and subscriptions,'' Neier said. ``But there
hasn't been enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have adhered to our initial commitment of $750,000,
if they could have made it at that. But they said they couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also implied that in view of the business plan of the
magazine, Soros had lost confidence in its future. Alternative
proposals were made to reduce the scope of the magazine. But Soros
offered $250,000 for this year in a telephone call to Urban this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Others at the magazine said they believed that Soros, having
lost much money in the Russian financial collapse, reneged on his
pledge and doomed the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Neier denied that. ``The Russian crunch hurt a lot,'' Neier
said. But even before that, he said, Soros had told the foundations
that he would cut back by half on grants from 2001 and revert to
the levels of 1993 to 1997.

   after eight days.
</P>
<P>
   When Gritz flew his plane back to Idaho, he knew something was
amiss when his wife, Claudia, didn't pick him up at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   She filed for divorce Sept. 11, citing irreconcilable
differences. She could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Claude left me, it was kind of like I didn't have any gas
anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 20, Gritz got up, showered, shaved and put on his
uniform. He grabbed his Colt .45 service pistol, loaded it with
ammunition and drove to a nearby town. There, he confronted his
wife, and then drove to a gravel road a mile from town and climbed
out of his truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember I put the pistol just at the lower row of ribbons
on my chest,'' he said. ``I saw my finger squeeze the trigger, and
the gun went off. I felt the bullet. The next recollection I had, I
was on the ground, looking up. The gun was still in my hand. I just
figured I would probably die there.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullet entered Gritz's chest and exited through his armpit,
blowing several medals off his uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics wonder whether Gritz really meant to kill himself.
</P>
<P>
   In his report, Sgt. Clyde Burgess of the Clearwater County
sheriff's office wrote: ``It is this officer's observation that Mr.
Gritz did not truly intend to kill himself, but instead, to raise
sympathy from his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Gritz's oldest son, Jim, has questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rambo can't kill himself?'' he asked sarcastically. ``I think
he was trying to put a point across _ that his heart was broken.''
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 12, Gritz filed a motion seeking a temporary restraining
order and alimony from his wife. He said she had $100,000 worth of
precious metals and rare coins and was conducting business at
Almost Heaven, which gave her access to all the community's assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am currently living in a borrowed motor home with only my
military pension to subsist upon, which is inadequate for my normal
living expenses that I have enjoyed throughout the course of my
marriage to the plaintiff,'' he said in court papers.
</P>
<P>
   A divorce was granted Nov. 25, ending Gritz's third marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz got the Center for Action business. His ex-wife got Almost
Heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The shows go on
</P>
<P>
   At the Tulsa Grand National Gun, Knife and Preparedness Show on
Feb. 27, more than 2,500 exhibitors were hawking their weapons, Y2K
goods and survival gear.
</P>
<P>
   It was a patriot's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz was sharing a booth with Randy Weaver. As soon as the
doors opened, customers lined up to buy Gritz's book, Called to
Serve, for $25, and Weaver's The Federal Siege at Ruby Ridge for
$20.
</P>
<P>
   Business was brisk, with up to 20 persons in line at times, some
with assault weapons slung over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Jim Gritz was running the Close Quarters Combat course.
For $30, participants learned how to fire a weapon and ``clear'' a
house of intruders, and then used paintball guns to shoot posters
of ``bad guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bo Gritz gave a talk that ended with his traditional
finale: burning the United Nations flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``You embrace an unrighteous system, and you're going to end up
a crispy critter,'' he said to the crowd's delight.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz's enthusiastic reception does not surprise critics such as
Wassmuth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bo is a charismatic speaker,'' he said. ``And there's that
bravado, blustery image that some people find engaging....I suspect
that he will continue to keep right on rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Gritz agree with that prediction?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a wonderful life,'' he said. ``And I'm not finished
yet....So I'll just keep trying to help people to be self-reliant,
confident. Like Kansas City, the next time through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of people in Missouri. They're hard, like woodpecker
lips. They've got a good reputation. I like that. And I like people
that say, `Show me. Don't be talking to me about it. Show me.' &UR; ''

SPEAKING OF SNAKES, ARIZONA'S THE PIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX The prevalence of shamrocks, the green beer, the
ridiculous claims that someone way back on your mother's side was
Irish _ really, O'something or O'other _ can mean only one thing:
It's St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   St. Patrick is famous for driving the snakes out of Ireland and
into the ocean, where they drowned. How he did this depends on whom
you talk to: He either beat a drum, rang a bell, led them with a
wooden staff or got rid of them by preaching an especially moving
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Except that he didn't. You can't get five words into this legend
without some know-it-all blurting out that Ireland never had snakes
in the first place. The ``snakes'' are just a symbol of pagan
beliefs, he'll tell you. It's all metaphorical.
</P>
<P>
   These kinds of people ruin everything. Don't even get them
started on Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, Ireland is snake-free. So in the spirit of
the day, let's credit St. Patrick with doing the job.
</P>
<P>
   But could it really happen? Are there any modern-day saints in
our midst? Could anyone rid Arizona of snakes? For instance, would
an especially potent sermon do the trick?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because snakes can't hear, I doubt it,'' said Tom Taylor of
the Arizona Herpetological Association. That probably rules out the
drums and bells as well; the staff, presumably, remains a viable
option. Though Taylor knows of others. &QL; 
150 degrees of separation
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't like water,'' he said. ``You could have a giant
flood, I guess. Maybe wash 'em all out. Maybe have our annual
hundred-year flood.''
</P>
<P>
   If that didn't work, there's always the desert heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn the furnace up a little bit,'' Taylor said, ``maybe have
it be 150 degrees. That would eliminate them, and probably anything
else _ probably you and me.''
</P>
<P>
   No one wants that. What's the point of ridding the place of
snakes if we're not around to enjoy their absence?
</P>
<P>
   Wes Patrick claims some insider knowledge on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``St. Patrick was my great-great-great-great-uncle,'' said the
non-sainted Patrick, owner of Critter Control, a company that
specializes in trapping animals.
</P>
<P>
   The lineage claim is a load of blarney. But seriously, Patrick
said, a cold snap would rid the state of snakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Move Arizona to the Antarctic,'' he suggested, ``because the
cold would either make them hibernate forever or make them leave.
You'd have to change the climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but the only foolproof way to get rid of snakes is to
eliminate their food source, he said, and with all the furry little
critters running around in Arizona, that's unlikely. Still, that's
how.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what my great-great-great-great-uncle would have done
if he hadn't been such a great preacher,'' Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Our gift to LA
</P>
<P>
   Har. He knows a sermon wouldn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not the kind I would deliver, anyway,'' he said. ``I know I've
heard people pray for them to leave. I've heard people cuss them.''
Neither worked.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Organ, a dispatch supervisor for Rural/Metro Fire
Department (which removes snakes from yards), liked the idea of the
staff, although he sounded like he had St. Patrick mixed up with
the Pied Piper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of chasing them into the sea . . . I would probably
just have them follow me into the LA basin,'' he said. ``They've
got to go somewhere, and what better place than LA?''
</P>
<P>
   A good start. The leftovers can slither their way to Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some question the saintliness of the whole idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would you want to get rid of them?'' asked Gavin
Gallifant, owner of First and Last Pest Control. ``They're
incredible rodent feeders. If we did that, we'd be overpopulated
with rodents. I know the serpent has a bad rap, but they actually
are very beneficial to the environment. I wouldn't do it. That's
the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   You've got to admire him for sticking to his principles. But
don't hold your breath for St. Gavin's Day anytime soon. &QL;

   BC-SALMON-PROTECTION-NYT (moved on Monday, Mar. 15)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Monday, Mar. 15,
about threats to Pacific salmon misstated the planned
classification of the fish. Federal officials proposed to declare
that eight of nine wild salmon types in the Pacific Northwest would
be listed as threatened species. Only one type, not all, would be
listed as endangered. The Endangered Species Act allows officials
more time to develop protections for species listed as threatened
than it does for those with the more serious classification of
endangered.

   A New York Times News Service article sent on Thursday, Mar. 10,
about security concerns at Los Alamos National Laboratory referred
incorrectly to the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who were
executed in 1953 for espionage. They were convicted of having
conspired with David Greenglass, an engineer at Los Alamos, not of
having acted as couriers for two other workers at Los Alamos _
Klaus Fuchs and Ted Hall _ who spied for the Soviet Union.

film academy's annual awards ceremony in January, and Mr. Vicente
Gomez apologized the next day. It was not Mr. Garci who apologized.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government says it has been working
hard since 1991 to reduce the chances of train-vehicle collisions
like the one Monday night in Bourbonnais, Ill., but the railroad
crossing there was one the government said had already been fixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had the best we've got,'' said Jolene Molitoris,
administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Molitoris said the Bourbonnais crossing had gates, lights
and a computerized system designed to ensure that warning lights
flash and the gates come down 25 to 30 seconds before a train
arrives, regardless of its speed. If gates come down more than 30
seconds in advance, drivers may gradually become convinced that the
warning system is crying wolf and that they have time to go around.
</P>
<P>
   The improvements in Bourbonnais cost about $150,000 five years
ago, making it one of the best-equipped of the approximately
260,000 grade-level railroad crossings in the country, Ms.
Molitoris said. Only about 62,000 crossings, fewer than 40 percent,
have any active warning system _ gates, lights or bells.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Transportation Department is testing systems that
are more difficult to circumvent. One, in Mystic, Conn., has gates
that come down over all four lanes of the road, so a driver cannot
cross the double yellow line and drive around them.
</P>
<P>
   In this fiscal year, the Transportation Department is providing
$154.8 million to states to improve crossings. A flashing signal
system can cost $60,000, and a gate across a single lane can cost
$15,000. An overpass or tunnel costs millions of dollars.
Improvements are made by local or state highway departments, or the
railroads themselves, not the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department is trying to reduce the number of
crossings so that improvements can be concentrated on those that
remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best crossing is the one that doesn't exist,'' said Warren
Flateau, a department spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   When the federal government began its campaign in 1991, there
were more than 290,000 grade-level crossings, but by this year,
33,000 of them had been closed. The goal is to eliminate at least
another 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy is working, officials say. Last year there were 422
deaths in crossing accidents, down one-third from five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The small towns around Chicago, long a railroad hub, are ground
zero for such accidents. Seven high school students died in 1995 in
Fox River Grove when a train plowed into the back of their school
bus while it was stopped for a traffic light, its rear hanging over
the tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 3,030 accidents at public railroad crossings counted by
the Federal Railroad Administration in 1998, 175 were in Illinois.
Only two states had more, Texas, with 282, and Indiana, with 178.
Amtrak was involved in 139.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are gradually improving; in 1995, there were 4,154
such accidents, more than a third more than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Federal Railroad Administration, the number of
train-vehicle collisions is falling in Illinois, too, down 15
percent since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has tried a variety of tactics to reduce collisions.
In an effort to improve law enforcement, it has arranged for police
officers to ride in the cabs of freight trains, so they can see how
many drivers or pedestrians dash across the tracks in front of
them.
</P>
<P>
   After the Fox River Grove collision, the Illinois Legislature
set a minimum fine of $500 or 50 hours of community service for
drivers or pedestrians who cross in front of trains.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger trains running at 79 mph can take more than a mile to
stop; freight trains travel at slower speeds but they typically
have more cars, and can take just as long or longer to stop. Making
trains stop faster is difficult, so many locomotives have been made
more conspicuous by the addition of ``ditch lights,'' a set of
headlights at the lower left and right, to join the traditional
cyclops eye mounted near the top.

FINLEY, GREENE HAPPY WITH DEBUTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- Chuck Finley and Todd Greene both were in a
particularly good mood after playing in Tuesday's game against the
Chicago White Sox at Tempe Diablo Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (muscle strain upper back/neck) made his first start of
the spring on the mound and Greene (bad right shoulder) made his
first appearance at catcher. Both said they came away feeling good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Greenie tell you the joke I told him?'' Finley asked
reporters. ``I told Greenie that we got a letter from Disney today
saying if we didn't get in a game by today they'd cut off our
workman's comp.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley made 24 pitches in one inning. He struck out the first
two batters he faced, gave up a single to Jeff Abbott, then got
Paul Konerko on a grounder to short.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about it is I walked on the field and I walked
off the field under my own power,'' he said. ``I planned on
throwing all fastballs but the way my fastball was in the 'pen, I
didn't think I'd get too far. My split was there, my curveball was
decent, so I said heck, why not use them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley's opening day start is still a question, but he says as
long as he is ready to jump in the rotation the first time around,
he'll be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing is it's not like I've been shut down, I've been
throwing,'' he said. ``I can make steps forward because I'm not
that far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Greene caught three innings. Although he was charged
with a passed ball, he blocked a couple balls in the dirt and
picked a runner off first base. One runner tried to steal on him,
but he lost the handle of the ball and didn't make the throw to
second.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I feel now I could catch tomorrow,'' Greene said. ``I
don't think that would be wise at this point because I don't
necessarily have to be ready. ... My legs are more sore than my
shoulder, so that's good.''
</P>
<P>
   The one play that tested his shoulder came in the third inning
when a pitch from Jarrod Washburn was in the dirt. Greene blocked
the ball and threw to first to catch the baserunner Abbott leaning
too far off the bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel it at all,'' Greene said. ``That's the throw I
would think would bother it, because it was an off-balance throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way it feels I don't think I'll have any problems. I'll
have the normal aches and pains, but I don't think I'll have
anything that will keep me from catching.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Terry Collins called it a big day, but cautioned
there is still a ways to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to mend,'' he said. ``Getting those two guys
out there was really nice but we can't get carried away. We have to
realize it's the first step of two weeks left in camp. It's still a
matter of how we come out of here and what kind of shape they're in
by the end of camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus played all nine innings at shortstop in Tuesday's 4-3
loss the the White Sox. He played four innings on Sunday at short
in a split-squad game, but Collins didn't get a chance to see him
then.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, who was a shortstop at UCLA, looked comfortable there but
did make one error.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take time to get used to it,'' Glaus said.
``Reading the ball off the bat, things like that. But I played
there a long time. If I didn't, it would be a different story. ...
As many things you can do on the baseball field is going to help
you chances of making the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Rex Hudler, the ex-Angel and new colorman on Angels broadcasts
for KCAL-9 and Fox Sports West, is in town to work on some mock
broadcasts. He took in Tuesday's game from the press box, but
obviously still has quite a bit of player in him.
</P>
<P>
   When the Angels' Randy Velarde led off the first inning with a
home run, Hudler had trouble controlling himself in a place where
cheering is not allowed: ``Oh, baby, he got around on that one!
That-a-way RV!''
</P>
<P>
   After being told the press box rules, Hudler apologized.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will wear green caps today for St. Patrick's Day. ...
The Milwaukee Brewers will visit the Angels today in Tempe. Tim
Belcher will start for the Angels against the Brewers' Rafael Roque
at 12:05.

 &HT;    MEDICARE COMMISSION FAILS TO ADOPT PLAN
 &HT;    480&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Torn by profound differences over what the
government's role should be in providing health care for seniors, a
bipartisan commission ended its 15-month mission Tuesday without
adopting a plan to reform Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-member panel voted on recommending a proposal to
Congress, but fell one vote short of the 11 votes required.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would have dramatically transformed the Medicare
program from one in which the government pays for health care to
one in which the government provides ``premium support,'' helping
people buy private health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also would have gradually raised the eligibility age
from 65 to 67, matching the Social Security eligibility age.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's action is likely to become the first step in a process
that could consume much of the rest of this congressional term.
Although the commission's plan will not be formally recommended to
Congress, it had the support of three members of the Senate Finance
Committee _ which writes Medicare law _ and was co-sponsored by the
chairman of the House Ways and Means health subcommittee, which
also has jurisdiction over Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fully intend to take this document, which a majority of the
commission supports, and introduce bipartisan legislation to begin
moving this through the legislative process,'' said Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., the panel's chairman and author of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours before the final roll call was taken, President
Clinton predicted the outcome and said he would offer Congress his
own Medicare reform proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he hoped for action before the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is too important to let partisan politics stand in
the way of vital progress. I believe if we make the hard choices,
if we work together, if we act this year, we can secure Medicare
into the future,'' Clinton said in a Rose Garden statement.
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, which covers nearly 39 million elderly and disabled
beneficiaries, is expected to run out of money for its hospital
insurance trust fund in 2008, about the time that the first of 77
million baby boomers start to become eligible for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Breaux plan predicted it would slow the
increase in Medicare costs over the next decade and allow the
program to continue operating until 2013 or 2017.
</P>
<P>
   They also claimed the plan would foster competition among
insurance companies and managed care groups, giving Medicare
beneficiaries a greater choice of health coverage offering a wider
range of benefits. Another part of the plan would have extended
prescription drug coverage to those at or near the poverty level.
</P>
<P>
   But critics of the plan warned that it ran the risk of excluding
the oldest, sickest and poorest Medicare beneficiaries from
enhanced managed care coverage while costing them considerably more
than they would pay under the current program.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   They argued that those risks were not worth it for a plan that
would not significantly extend the solvency of the Medicare
program.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the plan ``falls short'' because raising the
eligibility age without ensuring insurance coverage for those over
55 could increase the number of uninsured Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he was concerned about the potential for
significant premium increases, and criticized the panel for not
embracing his plan to earmark 15 percent of the projected federal
budget surplus over 15 years _ about $700 billion _ to shore up the
Medicare program until 2020.
</P>
<P>
   The commission was supposed to have completed its work by March
1, but delayed a final vote until this week in a last-ditch effort
to forge a compromise.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ For the first time anyone here can remember,
Harvard College is wondering whether it should find a way to get
students out of their rooms and away from their books to _ gasp _
relax and socialize.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by The Harvard Crimson, the student newspaper, brought
the question to the forefront last month when it asked
undergraduates something that many of them seemed to be too busy to
think about: their happiness.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it found that 64 percent of the students
said they stayed in their rooms at least every other weekend to do
homework, with about 45 percent saying they would like to stay in
less often.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of the 211 men and 210 women surveyed said they had
two hours of free time a day, or less. But even those minutes are
not stress-free; about the same number said they often felt guilty
about the way they spent that free time. And 36 percent said that
while at Harvard they had never had a romantic relationship that
lasted more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey, conducted over a weekend using a list of
undergraduates selected at random from the student directory, arose
from a widespread feeling that something was missing from campus
life.
</P>
<P>
   While many institutions of higher education, including Harvard,
are playing a growing role in regulating students' behavior outside
class _ with restrictions on fraternities, alcohol consumption and
late-night parties _ the Crimson survey raises a question on the
other side of that trend: Does a college have a responsibility to
make sure its students go out and play?
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the Harvard administration is divided on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   Archie C. Epps III, the dean of students, said he had tried for
years to tell students that misery was not a required course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see people slow down and smell the roses, if
you would,'' Epps said, ``and take a moment to enjoy the charm of a
Harvard building, and also reflect on those things that could
produce a philosophy of life.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Harvard owed its students fulfillment, and not just
academically. More play space, for starters: His dream is to bring
a barn from New Hampshire, put it on the quad, and turn it into a
disco on the weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Students may have become so harried and competitive, Epps
continued, that they are afraid to start relationships. ``It's
hard,'' he said. ``Maybe they kind of frighten each other. It's
sort of a look right, look left, who's going to win?''
</P>
<P>
   Harry R. Lewis, the dean of Harvard College, agreed that times
have changed; when he was an undergraduate in the 1960s, no one
complained about such things.
</P>
<P>
   So Lewis said he was surprised that students would turn to the
institution to provide a quote-unquote social life, and he added
that the term itself had a code meaning: ``Going to a party where
there is alcohol _ that is social life.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students hear about the parties at their friends' colleges
and expect the same sort of life style, Lewis said. He told The
Crimson that attending Harvard was ``a rare and precious
privilege'' that should not be wasted. And he pointed out that
Harvard had increased its financial aid budget last year, in part
to give more free time to students who would otherwise have to get
a paying job.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Lewis said, dragging students out of their rooms
does not need to be a priority.
</P>
<P>
   Many undergraduates agree. Some are happy, some are miserable,
and some are happy being miserable. About 13 percent said the
success of their Harvard experience was not contingent on their
being happy.
</P>
<P>
   Jung E. Oh, a junior, told The Crimson: ``The place expects me
to work hard, and I do, and I like it. For me, academic intensity
brings happiness.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjie Flusberg, a sophomore, said that he knew people who did
nothing but study, but that he was not sure what the college could
do for them. ``The only thing the school could do is give less
homework,'' Flusberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Harvard offered more dances and parties, there is no
guarantee that students would abandon their studious ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a conundrum,'' said James Y. Stern, a writer of
The Crimson's survey article. ``There's not much you can do to
force people to have a good time. It stems from how competitive the
world of Harvard has become. You just get people who are
hyper-driven at the age of 17.''
</P>
<P>
   Epps said that just getting students to assess their life style
was a good start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often,'' he said, ``they don't realize until they look back on
their freshmen and sophomore years and say, `What was that all
about?'''

   WASHINGTON _ In late 1996, months earlier than previously
acknowledged, a senior Clinton administration official ordered that
security measures at the nation's nuclear weapons laboratories be
quickly strengthened, but his orders were largely ignored or
delayed, administration officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, senior administration officials had said that they
first learned of the security lapses at the labs in the summer of
1997 and took prompt action.
</P>
<P>
   But eight months earlier, in November 1996, Charles Curtis, the
deputy secretary of energy, ordered a series of security measures
to be carried out on a strict timetable over the next several
months, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   But those measures were not taken, the officials said, despite
the warning in the department's annual security review for 1996
that the Energy Department was ``at greater risk of becoming a
victim of espionage than at any time in its history.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Tuesday that this inaction was largely owing to a
change in leadership at the Energy Department. Federico Pena became
secretary of energy in March 1997 and Curtis left office one month
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking into this possible lapse,'' Bill Richardson, who
succeeded Pena last year, said in a telephone interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the administration's response to security concerns
at the Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory and other weapons
plants has become a political issue following reports that the
White House, the FBI and the CIA did not respond quickly to
allegations that China had stolen an important piece of nuclear
technology from Los Alamos in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Pena said in an interview Tuesday that he learned about Curtis'
unsuccessful effort to alert his department to security problems at
the weapons labs just this week, nine months after he left office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time I heard about this plan was two days ago. What
happened here?'' he said. ``This is a serious issue that should not
have fallen through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until July 1997 that Pena was briefed on Energy
Department findings that China had stolen valuable nuclear secrets
from Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico in the 1980s and
that overall security measures at the weapons labs needed
significant bolstering.
</P>
<P>
   Those briefings led to a presidential directive in February 1998
and subsequent changes by Pena and his successor, Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said no one at the White
House was aware of the Curtis directives until the steps leading up
to the presidential directive, and that the president's orders
``went well beyond what Curtis did.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, President Clinton said his administration had
promptly addressed the security problems at the weapons labs. ``The
record is we acted aggressively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say they know of no security breaches
that resulted from the failure to adopt Curtis' directives in a
timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But other administration officials and some in Congress say the
administration acted too slowly. They say the administration and
some of the labs feared that too much security would get in the way
of efforts to use weapons labs to deepen ties with countries like
China by encouraging scientific visits aimed at improving nuclear
safety. It was not until last fall, for example, that background
checks on foreign visitors to the weapons labs were reinstated, two
years after Curtis directed just that, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, under sharp questioning from senators, Richardson
defended the steps his agency has taken since last fall to combat
the theft of secret material from the nation's nuclear weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we have successfully addressed this problem,''
Richardson said at a hearing of the Senate Armed Services
Committee. ``I believe we have strong security procedures in
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John W. Warner, R-Va., who heads the committee, praised
Richardson for taking ``timely and prudent'' measures. But Warner
added, ``I cannot say the same about the administration over a
longer period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of security at the weapons labs is decades old. A 1988
study by the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, found lax controls over foreign visitors. A follow-up
study nine years later found things had gotten worse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, lab experts found the first indications that China had
stolen secrets on miniaturizing nuclear bombs from Los Alamos in
the 1980s. The White House was told about this evidence in April
1996 but took no action.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months later, Curtis summoned the directors of the weapons
labs to a meeting with top Energy Department officials in
Washington on Nov. 21, 1996, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting Curtis ordered a series of actions affecting both
the labs and top Energy Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   They included, officials said, the following: creating a new
tracking system for foreign visitors, revising guidelines to insure
background checks for foreign visitors, increasing
counterintelligence training for officials at the labs and the
Energy Department, preparing annual security reviews and requiring
labs to critique their own security programs.
</P>
<P>
   The self-critique was completed on time, but many of the others
lagged as Curtis became a lame duck. A few weeks after the meeting
the Pentagon sponsored a visit by China's defense minister to one
of the weapons labs without receiving proper clearances, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pena says he talked to Curtis this week and ``he remembers
telling me that I should get a general brief on the espionage
matter and counterintelligence issues,'' but Pena said he doesn't
remember any such conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, now a Washington lawyer and the administration's current
choice to be nominated for secretary of the Air Force, declined to
discuss the matter Tuesday when reached by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   After Curtis left in 1997, his counterintelligence plan became
``an orphan,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't get an order requiring the labs to report to
counterintelligence officials when the Chinese were present,'' the
official added.

SOME URGE DRASTIC MEASURES AS CRISIS GRIPS ECUADOR 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador _ With their country paralyzed by strikes, their
currency losing value and their politicians so far unable to
provide relief, some Ecuadoreans are calling for drastic measures
to end the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of what has been called Ecuador's worst economic
crisis in 70 years, opposition leaders are demanding the
resignation of President Jamil Mahuad, who took office seven months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Military officers are reportedly discontent, although the armed
forces have largely stayed out of politics since democracy was
established 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad, a bookish economist who graduated from Harvard, has
grown weary of clashing with legislators, who have blocked key
bills designed to put the moribund economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
   According to politicians and U.S. Ambassador Leslie M.
Alexander, Mahuad and his advisers have considered closing the
Congress and ruling by decree. But, so far, they have done nothing
more than talk about the idea. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``Yes, that has been discussed,'' said Alexander, who spoke
with Mahuad at the presidential palace Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how attractive the notion of closing the Congress
might be, ``I think that enough level-headed people understand that
it is not an option,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador insisted that Ecuador's democracy is ``alive and
well.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Quito and other cities Tuesday, however, the
scene looked more like anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of taxi drivers blocked roads for the second straight
day to protest steep increases in gasoline prices ordered by Mahuad
as an emergency measure to raise government revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Irate truckers joined the strike, as Indian groups blocked
sections of the Pan-American Highway, the principle north-south
route connecting Ecuador with Peru and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation and commerce in many cities were brought to a
standstill, though some people moved about on foot and bicycle.
Some deputies were unable to get to the congressional building to
discuss emergency legislation demanded by Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's banks reopened Monday following a five-day shutdown
ordered by the government. But many customers were furious when
they found out that their savings and checking accounts had been
partially frozen for up to a year to prevent capital flight.
</P>
<P>
   Falling oil prices, severe flood damage from the El Nino weather
pattern last year and government spending have resulted in a budget
deficit equal to 7 percent of the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad has tried to raise taxes, cut spending, privatize state
institutions and reach an accord with the International Monetary
Fund. But most of the measures have been blocked by populist
legislators. The dispute has eaten away at Mahuad's support and has
prevented Ecuador from receiving up to $800 million in financing
from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason why we could not authorize for Ecuador an
aid package that is proportionally as strong as it was for Mexico a
few years ago and for Brazil now,'' IMF Director Michel Camdessus
said on Ecuadorean television. ``The only thing that keeps us from
doing it now is the fact that there is no unity in Ecuador behind
an emergency program.''
</P>
<P>
   The gridlock has led to speculation that Mahuad could stage a
so-called ``self-coup'' by closing the Congress and temporarily
ruling by decree.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Luis Mejia, a deputy allied with Mahuad, called on
the Congress to close itself down. And during call-in programs on
Ecuadorean radio stations, a handful of people endorsed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he reaches an accord with the Congress or he has to
pull off a self-coup,'' said Enrique Galarza, dean of public
administration at the Catholic University in Quito. ``There is no
other way out.''
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Peru, President Alberto Fujimori assumed
authoritarian powers for eight months in 1992 to combat guerrilla
violence and to sidestep obstructionist legislators. Venezuelan
President Hugo Chavez, who attempted to overthrow the government in
1992 as a junior army officer, has threatened to close his
country's Congress if it blocks his reform program.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts contend that such drastic moves require grass-roots
support and collaboration from the armed forces, which Mahuad
apparently lacks. A recent poll put Mahuad's job-approval rating at
16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Paco Moncayo, a centrist congressman and a former head of the
armed forces, said that a military uprising is also extremely
remote.
</P>
<P>
   Although he believes that military leaders have no stomach for
inheriting the nation's economic mess, Alexander said that there
are rumblings within the institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military is feeling the same frustration as the people on
the street,'' the U.S. ambassador said. ``They want things to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Fueling the protests against Mahuad is what one Western diplomat
described as Ecuador's tradition of ``political cannibalism.'' The
country has had four presidents in the past 25 months. Such
instability has given hope to protesters that Mahuad will step
down.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike former President Abdala Bucaram _ who had lost
virtually all of his support when he was forced from office in 1997
_ Mahuad retains the backing of businessmen and the upper-middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that drastic measures can be avoided if Mahuad forms an
alliance with other parties.
</P>
<P>
   The president's center-right Popular Democracy Party lacks a
majority in the 121-seat Congress and had counted on the support of
the right-wing Social Christian Party. But the Social Christians
ended up blocking many of Mahuad's bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most (politicians) recognize that they've got to reach some
kind of accommodation,'' the Western diplomat said.

GOP BUDGET PLAN CUTS TAXES BUT SUPPORTS EDUCATION AND MILITARY

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans laid out a budget proposal on Tuesday
that makes good on their promises to cut taxes and increase
spending on the military and education, but at the cost of deep
cuts elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan is the Republican response to the budget proposal
sent to Congress last month by President Clinton, and like the
White House plan, it makes shoring up Social Security the nation's
top fiscal priority in a period of emerging surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan was introduced on Tuesday in the Senate
Budget Committee, and a similar version is to be taken up on
Wednesday by the House Budget Committee. While it is likely to
prove no more than the opening Republican negotiating position, it
makes clear that the surplus will not mute the debate over how to
capitalize on the nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of
the Senate Budget Committee, said the plan would provide a tax cut
next year of $15 billion and possibly more if the strong economy
continues to generate higher-than-expected tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts would grow to $778 billion over the next decade.
That is enough for the tax-writing committees in the House and
Senate to choose among a variety of tax-cutting options, but
probably not enough, Domenici acknowledged, for the 10 percent
across-the-board reduction in income tax rates that Republicans had
hoped to make the centerpiece of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to blunt attacks from Clinton and Democrats in Congress
that Republicans are shortchanging Medicare, Domenici said his plan
would set aside $133 billion over the next decade to cope with a
variety of contingencies, including the possibility that an
overhaul of Medicare would require an infusion of money.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would increase Pentagon spending by $18.2 billion,
to $290 billion, reflecting an insistence among Republicans on
rebuilding what they see as a dangerously run-down military.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to neutralize a traditionally Democratic issue,
the plan calls for a $3.3 billion increase in federal spending on
education next year, to a total of $103 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But to allow the spending increases on the military and
education while also meeting another bedrock Republican pledge _ to
remain within the tight spending limits set out in the 1997
bipartisan budget deal _ the plan would require slashing spending
on a wide array of other programs.
</P>
<P>
   To stay under the cap on programs that receive annual
appropriations _ $536 billion for next year _ the plan requires
discretionary spending cuts of $14.7 billion next year, which some
members of both parties said could well prove politically
impossible. The plan would require even bigger cuts in the two
subsequent years: $15.4 billion in 2001 and $22 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, if it is adopted by both the House and the Senate,
would not become law but would be the guideline for the annual tax
and spending bills Congress will take up this year. It is not
binding but suggests specific cuts that the appropriations
committees could consider in reconciling the demand from both
parties for new and expanded programs be financed with the painful
discipline of the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal suggests that spending on environmental programs,
for example, be reduced to $21.5 billion next year, from $23.9
billion this year. It would reduce spending on science, including
NASA, to $18 billion, from $18.8 billion this year. It would shrink
spending for agriculture to $14.3 billion next year, from $16.8
billion, and would not renew billions of dollars in emergency aid
Congress gave farmers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici called the plan ``a good start on wisely and
effectively using projected surpluses into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Budget Committee's senior Democrat, Sen. Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey, attacked the proposal, as did the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to fund an irresponsible and exploding tax cut, it
fails to commit a single penny to securing Medicare and it requires
discretionary cuts in the first few years that could not
realistically be put together without serious reductions in key
areas like education, health and environment,'' said Gene Sperling,
the administration's economic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said he hoped the committee would complete work on the
plan this week and send it to the Senate floor for a vote next
week. Last year, Domenici feuded over budget priorities with his
counterpart in the House, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. But this year,
the two men are working closely together to keep the party united
as they head into months of negotiations with the White House on
taxes, spending, Social Security and Medicare.  &QL;

FLASHY LAS VEGAS GAMBLER WAS KILLED, DID NOT COMMIT SUICIDE,
AUTHORITIES SAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After stashing $4 million in silver in an underground vault near
Las Vegas, the son closest in character to legendary Texas gambler
Benny Binion died when someone gave him a lethal dose of heroin and
a prescription tranquilizer, Xanax, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's revelation by a Nevada coroner was the latest twist in
a mystery that has been slowly unraveling since the girlfriend of
55-year-old Ted Binion reported finding his lifeless body on Sept.
17.
</P>
<P>
   A reward for his killer was immediately raised to $100,000 from
$25,000 by his brother, Jack Binion, executor of his estate.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Binion was born in North Texas where his flamboyant father
still had many admirers, including Billy Bob Barnett who erected a
$150,000 statue of Binion outside Billy Bob's Texas, the
self-described World's Largest Honky-Tonk. The statue was shipped
to Las Vegas in 1988, a year before the elder Binion's death from
natural causes at 83.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, investigators would not say how the drugs were
administered to Ted Binion, or whether they had a suspect in his
death. Heroin was found in Binion's stomach, although he was known
to have smoked the drug before reportedly kicking the habit earlier
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are numerous scenarios,'' Clark County Coroner Ron Flud
said on Tuesday. ``We're not to the point we're going to comment on
any of the scenarios.''
</P>
<P>
   The girlfriend, ex-topless dancer Sandy Murphy, 27, and three
others were arrested on charges of stealing Ted Binion's buried
treasure two days after his death. Jack Binion said one of them,
Richard Tabish, 33, was romantically linked with Murphy. Tabish, a
twice-convicted felon, built the underground vault. All have denied
the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Binion had the vault constructed on his Pahrump, Nev., ranch
after losing an 11-year battle to keep his gaming license. It was
finally revoked a year ago because of his friendship with
underworld figure Herbert Blitzstein, the victim of a
gangland-style killing in January 1997, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he and his brother Jack sold their share of the $80
million Horsehoe gaming empire to a sister, Becky Behnen, following
a drawn-out feud.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Ted Binion's life had it's breathtaking ups and
downs.
</P>
<P>
   While brother Jack and sister Becky were said to have their
father's gambling business acumen, it was Ted who inherited his
larger-than-life Texas personna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started learning (the gaming business) when I was 12,'' Ted
Binion told The Wall Street Journal three weeks before his death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Benny Binion brought his family to Las Vegas from the
Fort Worth-Dallas area, as legend had it, with $2 million packed in
a suitcase. He had run an illegal, but rarely prosecuted, gambling
operation at the Top of the Hill Terrace speak-easy, built on an
unincorporated patch between Fort Worth and Arlington _ now a
Baptist seminary _ and another gaming club in west Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Nicknamed ``The Cowboy,'' he served prison time for bootlegging
during Prohibition and for tax evasion in the 1950s. &QL;

<P>
   Zenobia Barlow remembers when the frenzy over computers in the
classroom came to California. As director of the Center for
Ecoliteracy, a nonprofit foundation in San Francisco, she had long
shepherded money to elementary schools seeking to involve students
in hands-on science projects like local creek-bed restoration and
organic gardening.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1996, Ms. Barlow says, more and more parents and teachers
were telling her: ``This is nice. But where are the computers?''
</P>
<P>
   Although grade schools, especially in well-off suburbs, had long
used the computer as a teaching tool, more and more were coming to
rely on it; for many students, escaping the classroom was looking
less like a sojourn to the local watershed and more like an
afternoon spent staring at a screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this increasing pressure in the earlier and earlier
grades for children to be involved with computers,'' Ms. Barlow
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   That was when her center hired William L. Rukeyser, a
51-year-old consultant who had done public relations for the
California Department of Education, to found Learning in the Real
World, a nonprofit organization that has become a rallying point
for those who would like to take the steam out of the drive to
computerize classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when conventional wisdom holds that computers and
technology are as essential to schools as blackboards and libraries
_ when President Clinton trumpets his goal of ``connecting every
classroom in America to the Internet by the year 2000'' _
Rukeyser's organization is the skunk at the garden party.
</P>
<P>
   It has blanketed news organizations, lawmakers, school systems
and parent groups with phone calls, faxes, reprints of articles and
slickly produced brochures asking if connecting ``every classroom
in America'' to the Internet makes sense. This year, it has awarded
$54,000 in grants for research into how computers are affecting
education, especially in the early grades, and whether they are
being overemphasized. Rukeyser says the group gets its money from
its parent, the Center for Ecoliteracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many programs were being slaughtered by this perception
that if it didn't involve computers, it wasn't worth anything,''
Rukeyser said. ``I quickly realized that there was this tremendous
faith that computers were in fact some plaster saint that would
save the day.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rukeyser's group is fighting a powerful tide. In just six years,
the number of computers in public schools has more than doubled, to
7.4 million in 1998. Spending on instructional technology from
kindergarten through grade 12 rose sharply as well, to more than $5
billion last year from $2.1 billion in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But dissenters like Rukeyser are beginning to make their voices
heard, with even supporters of educational technology acknowledging
that they may have a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we're reaching a point of maturation in all this,''
said Dr. John Bosco, a professor at Western Michigan University who
is chairman of the Consortium for School Networking, a nonprofit
group that promotes technology in schools. ``We're beginning to see
that it is not magic, and that there are things done in the name of
information technology which are either foolish or wasteful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bosco added that educators and researchers were starting to ask
more sophisticated questions about computers' role in the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that both proponents and opponents are looking
for the magic fountain,'' he said. ``They're looking for a study
which would demonstrate that computers do good things for learning,
but I can tell you that's never going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Roberts, director of the Office for Educational Technology
in the federal Department of Education, agreed that computers and
Internet connections were ``simply the starting point,'' but she
added, ``I think there is sufficient evidence out there right now
to support the investment that we're making in technology.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Learning in the Real World's grant recipients, Dr. Larry
Cuban, a professor of education at Stanford University and the
author of ``Teachers and Machines: The Classroom Use of Technology
Since 1920,'' agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that computers have an initial novelty
effect,'' Cuban said. ``The kid gets immediate feedback _ can in
effect talk to the computer, and the computer responds. This whole
issue of a human-machine interaction is very engaging for kids. But
how long it lasts depends a great deal on the teacher's use of it
and the particular software.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and three other researchers plan to use the money from
Learning in the Real world to investigate just what it is that
teachers and students are doing with the computers that are
provided for them. Cuban in particular will be focusing on computer
use in preschools and kindergartens _ precisely the age level,
Rukeyser and Ms. Barlow say, at which children might be better off
planting seeds and digging in the dirt, rather than surfing the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Rukeyser says he will continue to make phone
calls, send faxes and show up at events like last month's
Conference of the Consortium for School Networking in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, our approach to all this is that we're skeptical,''
he said. ``We're not pushing our own brand of solution, and we're
not saying that the emperor has no clothes. We're just asking, Is
his tie on straight and do his socks match?'' &QL;

HARKES HEADED TO REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John Harkes seems to fit in well in Foxborough. With
the US national team and D.C. United, he has lost only once in
regulation time in 12 matches at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now he hopes to continue his success as a member of the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution Tuesday announced the acquisition of Harkes, who
had played three games on loan to Nottingham Forest in England
before suffering a calf injury. Harkes will join the team for
training Monday in preparation for its Major League Soccer season
opener at Miami March 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was going well here, I had a good rapport with the
fans and was getting some good writeups,'' Harkes said from the
Village Hotel in Nottingham Tuesday night. ``But I tore my calf
muscle against West Ham and time was running out on the loan. The
manager wants me to stay and play to the end of the season with the
option to take me on full-time, but I don't think that is in my
best interests. I want to get back and commit 100 percent to the
Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Harkes turned 32 early this month and is likely past his
prime, the Revolution are hoping his experience and winning habits
will help elevate the team. The Revolution have failed to win a
playoff game in three years and had the league's worst record last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``New England is the team I wanted to go to,'' Harkes said.
``Foxboro Stadium is a great atmosphere and one of the best venues
I've played in in 11 years with the national team.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes became available when D.C. United's player budget
exceeded the salary cap. He was considered expendable, but other
teams were reluctant to acquire him. Though Harkes is among the
most accomplished US players of his generation, his stock fell
after he was dropped from the national team before the '98 World
Cup. Many coaches were discomfited by his clashes with former US
coach Steve Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   But Revolution player-coach Walter Zenga did not hesitate to
court Harkes, who was acquired for two draft choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter wants to have me in the center of midfield,'' Harkes
said. ``If he needs me on the right or left, I'll do whatever it
takes to help out the club. Right now, I want to concentrate on
being healthy and settling into the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to starting fresh with a new club in a great
area with passionate fans and good people running the club who want
soccer to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Revolution have some good personalities and all we have to
do is jell together. We have to look at ourselves individually,
what we can do to make the team work. Fortunately, I've had success
and won a lot of things and my experience and enthusiasm will
hopefully come across.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes made his international debut in 1987 and was captain of
the US national team until clashing with Sampson last year. He has
long been ambitious and outspoken, making his way into Sheffield
Wednesday's starting lineup at age 23 and remaining in England's
Premier League until the start of MLS in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the opportunity to return to the Premier League and that
is an opportunity you can't turn away from,'' Harkes said. ``I
wanted to challenge myself and I've shown I can play at this level
in an attacking game, at a faster pace, and against the best
players in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes's national team days ended abruptly, but he seems
rejuvenated by his latest England sojourn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was difficult with the way I've represented the country for
so many years as an ambassador for the game,'' Harkes said. ``Steve
knows what happened, he made some bad choices and it's unfortunate
because we lost and the country lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little setback, but with Bruce in there injecting
some new blood and combined with some veterans, the future looks
good. Bruce has done the right thing with younger players and it
should have been done years ago.''

   DOW CROSSES 10,000 MARK BUT RETREATS FOR DAY
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average continued its flirtation with
the 10,000-point mark, even crossing it briefly. But it reversed
its early climb and ended the session down 28.30 points, or
three-tenths of a percent, to 9,930.47. The broader market averages
were mixed, with the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index edging down
0.90 point, to 1,306.36. The Nasdaq composite index rose 7.83
points, or three-tenths of a percent, to 2,439.27.
</P>
<P>
   Bond yields dropped to their lowest point in three weeks, aided
by optimism that inflation will not accelerate and short-term
interest rates will remain steady.
</P>
<P>
   The price of gold plunged after President Clinton suggested that
the International Monetary Fund should sell some of its gold
reserves to help reduce the debt burdens on the world's poorest
nations.
</P>
<P>
   WORKERS TO SHARE GOLDMAN WEALTH
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs, Wall Street's last big private partnership,
detailed its plans to go public and offered a glimpse of how it
will divvy up about $21 billion in projected net worth. For the
general partners who own the firm, the average value of their
shares will reach about $50 million. But employees below that level
will share a $4 billion windfall, secretaries, janitors and word
processors included.
</P>
<P>
   COCA-COLA'S MARKETING COSTS RISE
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report, Coca-Cola said it spent more than $1.2
billion on marketing activities for its largest bottler, Coca-Cola
Enterprises. That's nearly twice what it spent the year before on
the bottler, which handles close to 70 percent of Coca-Cola's
volume in the United States. That expenditure helped raise case
volume in the United States by 6 percent, but the marketing costs
were keenly felt at Coca-Cola, which turned in one of its most
lackluster performances in years in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   SEC WEIGHS DISCLOSURE RULE
</P>
<P>
   Federal securities regulators, concerned that some investors may
be getting key stock information before the rest of the market, are
considering tightening disclosure rules so that companies will be
forced to announce news to all investors at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   TWA NAMES NEW CHIEF EXECUTIVE
</P>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines said William Compton, the carrier's
president, would take over as chief executive in May, succeeding
Gerald Gitner, who will remain as chairman. The move comes at a
time when TWA has been losing money while the industry has had
record profits for four consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZILIAN MARKETS IN CAUTIOUS RALLY
</P>
<P>
   After spending much of 1999 so far straddling the line between
pessimism and panic, Brazilian markets are staging a cautious rally
that may be the first sign the economy, Latin America's largest, is
starting to creep its way out of recession.
</P>
<P>
   SAKS EARNINGS MEET EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Saks, the owner of Saks Fifth Avenue and other department
stores, said that its fourth-quarter earnings rose 26 percent,
meeting Wall Street estimates. But the company warned that this
year's profit might be less than expected as it integrates chains
it has acquired. Shares of Saks fell $1.5625, to $28.9375.
</P>
<P>
   Nine West Group, the women's shoe company, said it lost $7.3
million in the fourth quarter and would close its 9&AMP;Company chain.
</P>
<P>
   Credit Suisse Group reported higher-than-expected second-half
profits.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO MAKES CASE FOR INVESTMENT
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has been able to separate itself from other, more
troubled Latin countries since economic crisis shook the region
last year, luring back investors. Foreigners' preference for Mexico
has been felt in the stock and currency markets and in longer-term
investments.
</P>
<P>
   POSITIVE REPORT FOR SOUTH KOREA
</P>
<P>
   South Korea is the only sizable Asian economy that appears to be
pulling out of economic crisis, although its unemployment rate has
risen and shows no sign of declining, the International Labor
Organization said in a study.

SPORTS COLUMN: BOXING'S BEAUTIFUL BLACK EYE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The fuel of boxing is controversy _ after all, what are matches,
not to speak of rematches, made of, anyway? It goes back to at
least Pindar, who composed soaring odes to the boxing brawls in the
ancient Greek Olympiad, some of which were surely, as the saying
goes, manipulated.
</P>
<P>
   The peculiar fascination continued through the centuries, to
Saturday night, when, by the estimation of a thick majority of
spectators, Lennox Lewis clearly won the unified heavyweight
championship of this planet, but the three judges awarded him a
measly draw with Evander Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but such is the essential charm of boxing _ the sleaziness
of it all. And thus the fuel for controversy. There is simply no
fuel like an old fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Return, for just one example that comes to mind, to the second
heavyweight title bout between the new champion, Rocky Marciano,
and the dethroned champion, Jersey Joe Walcott, in Chicago in 1953.
Walcott got knocked down late in the first round and sat on the
canvas on his backside, one arm resting on a ring rope, as the
referee counted him out. In the dressing room after the fight,
Walcott's manager, the questionable Felix Bocchicchio, protested
that his fighter didn't hear the count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was robbed in New York the first time we boxed Joe Louis,''
he said, ``but I never saw no robbery like this.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, he didn't live to see the fight Saturday night. A
fight that some have said, to echo a remark from The New York
Clipper newspaper in 1873 following the Harry Hicken-Bryan Campbell
bare-knuckles battle, was ``a put-up job'' and ``drove another nail
in the coffin of pugilism.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 21 months ago, after Mike Tyson had made all gone with
pieces of Holyfield's ears, the belief among many was that this was
not just another nail in the very large coffin of pugilism, but
also the final one. In other words, boxing had finally bitten off
more than it could chew.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind. We turn around and have a sellout crowd at Madison
Square Garden for Holyfield-Lewis. Not only that, but tickets were
also sold out swifter than for any bout in Garden history, and that
includes the historic Ali-Frazier fights.
</P>
<P>
   This is just when many say that boxing is so corrupt they
wouldn't pay two cents to see a fight. True _ they pay hundreds and
thousands of dollars. Somewhere in the back of our primitive heads
is a love of the sordid. Somewhere back there is also a taste for
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any question that the next Holyfield-Lewis fight _ and
there will surely be one, as early as the beginning of summer _
will be a bigger box office and pay-per-view draw than the last?
</P>
<P>
   Every time we learn from the experts that boxing is dead, that
there is no longer a James Fig, or a John L. Sullivan, or a Jack
Dempsey, or a Joe Louis, or a Muhammad Ali, there rises from the
gym of worn boxing shoes, tattered gloves, tape, headgear,
mouthpieces and cigar butts, another fight in which we just can't
wait to see what happens, who wins, who gets robbed.
</P>
<P>
   It is a kind of burlesque, and in that sense one is reminded of
something Ann Corio said. Corio, once the most famous of burlesque
strippers who died in her 80s earlier this month, had been asked to
describe the art of undressing artistically. ``Always keep your
pants on,'' she said, ``It brings the boys back hoping next time
you'll take them off.''
</P>
<P>
   The lure of boxing is similar. We aren't quite sure of the
outcome, but the activity goes to the very core of our being. And
this despite the frequent pronouncements by the American Medical
Association that boxing should be banned _ not just the judges in
the Holyfield-Lewis fight, but also the whole shebang. I find this
curious, since most doctors I know can't wait to close up shop and
fly out to see a big fight.
</P>
<P>
   Should boxing be better supervised? Yes. Should judges be better
qualified? Yes. Should there be boxing at all in a civilized
society? Probably not, but look around, what's civilized? We have a
long way to go. Meanwhile, our primordial nature speaks.
</P>
<P>
   And the controversies rumble on. Some even as harmless as who
were history's best fighters, in or out of their divisions. One
day, the two late sportswriters, Red Smith and Frank Graham, were
in just such a discussion. Smith remarked that Sugar Ray Robinson
was the best fighter that he had seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps,'' Graham said, ``but Benny Leonard would have beaten
him as a lightweight, Jimmy McLarnin would have beaten him as a
welterweight, and Mickey Walker and Billy Conn would have beaten
him as a middleweight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether you're right,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither do I,'' Graham said.

A LEGENDARY TRAIN'S WORST NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Miss., La., S.C.)  (See also TRAIN-CRASH, TRAIN-SAFETY)

<P>
   KANKAKEE, Ill. _ The passenger train had just swept across the
snowy farm fields, passing a tall white grain elevator, and was
headed, a bit late, for its stop in Kankakee, an old railroad town
where the whistle echoes like a lullaby every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whistle, the clanging, it's a good noise,'' said Dennis
Brady, 57, who lives in Kankakee, ``a noise that's supposed to be
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was silence. And then came the sound of sirens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened so quickly, we didn't have time to be scared,''
said Don Allen, 80, a passenger who was unharmed. He stood in the
parking lot of a motel here Tuesday with his wife, Lois, ready to
resume a trip to see their son. ``We didn't know how bad it was
until this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing the terrible sounds of tons of metal slamming together
and seeing flames shoot into the sky, workers at a nearby
Birmingham Steel plant raced to the side of the tracks, trying to
pull passengers from the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said that at least 13 people had died and that
four others were believed to be missing in the wreckage, a charred
and twisted heap of steel along the Illinois Central tracks, about
50 miles south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The train, the storied City of New Orleans, had traveled about
50 miles of its scheduled 934-mile journey, with several stops in
smaller cities in Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the great name trains of the 20th century,''
said H. Roger Grant, a history professor at Clemson University, and
the author of several books about rail travel.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1920s through the 1940s, the train was known for its
highbrow clientele and top-shelf amenities. Then the train became
better-known for its working-class passengers, many of them blacks
who had moved from the Mississippi Delta to industrial centers like
Chicago during the great migration that followed World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The City of New Orleans becomes virtually a local train in
Mississippi, with stops in Jackson, Yazoo City, Brookhaven, McComb
_ places where almost everyone has a friend or a relative living in
Northern cities like Chicago or Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   The singer Steve Goodman wrote a ballad about the train in 1970,
``The City of New Orleans,'' that makes reference to the old
freight yards in Kankakee, just a few miles from the site of the
wreck:
</P>
<P>
   ``All along the southbound odyssey, the train pulls out of
Kankakee,'' passing ``freight yards full of old black men.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rail yards have not been a big employer here for
decades. And Amtrak closed the Kankakee station in the early 1990s,
although the passenger train stops in the town four times a day.
</P>
<P>
   People like Brady, who have ridden the City of New Orleans,
speak of the wondrousness of riding the rail through the spine of
so many Midwestern and Southern towns, seeing the inside of places
that go unseen from the airplane, and even from cars, which
generally stick to the expressways that go around cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see another world when you take the train,'' said Brady.
``Unfortunately, we never took it all the way to New Orleans. We're
like everybody else these days, I guess. We're in too much of a
hurry to get where we're going.''
</P>
<P>
   Kankakee, a city of about 30,000 people, has been struggling to
re-invent itself in recent years, tearing down dilapidated old
buildings and courting developers of office complexes. The towns of
Bourbonnais and Bradley, meanwhile, have increasingly become
bedroom communities for Chicago commuters.
</P>
<P>
   The train wreck was just down the road from a strip of stores on
state Highway 50, just off Interstate 57.
</P>
<P>
   The brilliant sunshine on this late winter day gave these cities
an incongruously cheerful look Tuesday. There were people hanging
clothes to dry on clotheslines, and games of basketball being
played at hoops over garages.
</P>
<P>
   As people gathered in shops and restaurants Tuesday, there were
expressions of sorrow, as well as thanksgiving that apparently no
local people had been on the train.
</P>
<P>
   People who work at the hospitals here, Riverside and Provena-St.
Mary's, had been working through the night.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after the wreck, a call was issued to all doctors,
nurses and other staff workers at St. Mary's to report immediately
to the hospital, said Becky Wilder, a spokeswoman for the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had physicians running from their cars in the parking
lot,'' Ms. Wilder said. ``Within a half-hour, we had 150 doctors at
the hospital. I've never seen anything like this.''

GOLD PLUNGES AFTER CLINTON SUGGESTS SALES BY THE IMF
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The price of gold plunged Tuesday after President Clinton
suggested that the International Monetary Fund should sell some of
its gold reserves to help reduce the debt burdens on the world's
poorest nations.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is not new, but had been set aside several years
ago, in part because of the opposition of Germany. But after the
election of the new chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, the sentiment
changed, opening the way to put the plan back on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Then French President Jacques Chirac suggested Monday that
France could support IMF gold sales for the same cause, aligning
another major player _ and one-time opponent _ behind the sales.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sharp drop in gold's price on Monday and Tuesday
seemed to indicate that a lot of investors had forgotten that
selling IMF gold was a possibility, although the United States has
supported sales for some time and other countries had brought up
the subject again recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strange thing is that the IMF story wasn't fully in the
price,'' said Philip Klapwijk, a managing director of Gold Fields
Mineral Services Ltd. of London, which produces some of the most
closely watched research on gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sales are quite probable, but in the future,'' he said.
``There is a lot of preparation that would be required.''
</P>
<P>
   The price of gold for April delivery on the New York Mercantile
Exchange fell $3.70 an ounce, or 1.3 percent, to $283.90. On Monday
it dropped $5.80 an ounce. From its recent high of $295.50 an ounce
Thursday, the price of gold is off 3.9 percent and not that far
from the 19-year low it hit in August.
</P>
<P>
   What this proposal will do for the longer-term price of gold is
uncertain, but it does not look positive.
</P>
<P>
   IMF gold sales would require approval of Congress and of other
nations in the IMF. In addition, the IMF would be expected to sell
the gold in the most orderly fashion possible, if the plan was
approved, to limit its impact. And it would be some time _ maybe a
year _ before gold sales could occur.
</P>
<P>
   However, the threat of the sale would hang over the market,
making it harder for good news to lift the price. The threat of
gold sales by the world's central banks has had a negative impact
on the price of gold over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised the amount of impact merely the speculation
had'' on the price of gold, said George Milling-Stanley, manager of
gold market analysis at the World Gold Council.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has about 103 million ounces of gold and under the
Clinton administration proposal about 5 percent, or 5.2 million
ounces, would be sold. That is equal to about 6 percent of total
mine production.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Chirac said the money from gold sales should be used
to expand a program of debt relief for a group of 41 of the world's
poorest countries, know as Highly Indebted Poor Countries, or HIPC.
With the additional money from gold sales, the countries in that
group could be expended to 50.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who made his proposal before a group of African
government officials, including representatives of highly indebted
countries, said he wanted ``extraordinary relief for countries
making extraordinary efforts to build working economies.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders said that some other downward pressure on gold came from
the fact that big speculators who had been betting that the price
of gold would fall had just recently backed off those positions.
That buying back of gold is what helped push the price up about $8,
to $295. With this negative news, there was an opening for them to
sell again. &QL;

 Developers to Get Apple Source Access
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Jon Swartz &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Joining the free-software movement, Apple Computer yesterday
introduced a new version of the Macintosh operating system for
servers and said it will allow developers access to the new
software's blueprints via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   With the move, Apple becomes the first major computer company to
offer software designers some of its programming code secrets. The
computer-maker hopes the software giveaway will inspire more
developers to craft applications based on its Mac OS server
software.
</P>
<P>
   Just as significant, it marks the biggest endorsement yet of
``open source'' computing, in which companies and organizations use
the Net to enlist volunteer programmers and accelerate software
development.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic has been employed to particular success by supporters
of Linux, an operating system for business computers that poses a
challenge to Apple's server technology. Developers can download
Linux for free, customize it and distribute it. The program is
widely used by Internet service providers, PC makers and Web
developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping the software eventually runs on all kinds of
computers,'' Steve Jobs, Apple's interim CEO, told a gathering of
reporters and employees at the computer-maker's Cupertino campus.
``We're putting our source code and the intellectual property out
there for everyone to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple's decision is as competitively driven as it is benevolent,
observers said. The venerable computer-maker is butting heads in
the server market with Windows NT and different versions of Unix,
including Linux.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``There are societal and corporate advantages for Apple
here,'' said Richard Doherty, research director of Envisioneering
in Seaford, N.Y. ``It is making elements of its great technology
available to the public, and it is seeding the use of its operating
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple also said it's considering opening up some of its other
software code, though officials declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think more companies will make open source available,''
Avie Tevanian, Apple senior vice president of software development,
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Graphics and Sun Microsystems said they are considering
making portions of their Unix operating systems available as open
source. Netscape and Apache have already opened up programming code
for the creation of Web browsers and server software, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   But don't count on Microsoft to come around anytime soon,
industry observers note.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft does not have the mind set,'' Doherty said. ``Mr.
(Bill) Gates will never admit to bending to pressure. They may
volunteer code for Windows 95, but who wants buggy software?''
</P>
<P>
   Components of Mac OS X Server software are available at
 &LR; www.apple.com &LR; . Mac OS X combines features from the current Mac OS
and Next Computer's Rhapsody operating system. Apple acquired Next
in late 1996. The server software is a precursor to a major
overhaul of the Mac OS later this year.
</P>
<P>
   In related news, Apple reduced the price of its $999 Mac OS X
server to $499 for most users.

 Chevron Plans To Move Unit, Cut 100 Jobs
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; By Rebecca Smith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c 1999, San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Chevron Corp. said yesterday it will move its 321-person pipeline
unit to Houston by the end of the year, eliminating 100 jobs along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The relocation of the pipeline unit from offices in San Ramon,
Bakersfield, Salt Lake City, New Orleans and Woodlands, Texas, is
expected to save $15 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   The San Ramon office, which currently serves as the corporate
headquarters of the pipeline unit, employs 62 in management
positions and office staff while the Bakersfield field office
employs 20 in management and operations positions.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for the consolidation of all of the unit's offices
into a single facility in Houston by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Gorell, a spokesman for Chevron, said no information is
available yet on the number of employees who will be relocated and
which jobs will be phased out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a difficult decision but one that is necessary to
allow Chevron to remain competitive over the long term,'' said Jeet
Bindra, president of Chevron Pipe Line Co.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Chevron said it would relocate its chemical company
from San Ramon to Houston, slashing 300 positions.
</P>
<P>
   More cuts and transfers are expected. Late last year, Chevron
Chairman Kenneth Derr said the firm will eliminate up to 1,000 jobs
in 1999 and reorganize operations with an eye toward reducing
yearly expenses by $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions are stimulated, in part, by low oil prices. The
company's net earnings plunged 39 percent in 1998 as a consequence
of oil prices that fell by half.
</P>
<P>
   Though crude oil prices have firmed this month, rising to around
$14.50 a barrel, the company continues to look at ways to
consolidate operations and cut costs. It has been trimming
expenses, systematically, since 1991. Total reductions, to date,
exceed $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to move the pipeline unit to Texas, company
spokeswoman Dawn Soper said, because most pipeline employees
already are in Texas. The unit is responsible for managing the
transportation of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical
products through nearly 9,000 miles of Chevron pipeline in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Chevron's changes are taking jobs out of the Bay
Area. Last month, the oil firm said it will shift its La Habra
advanced technology unit to San Ramon in Contra Costa County. That
unit has 330 positions, though not all are expected to survive the
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area remains home for the greatest concentration of
Chevron workers. It has more Chevron employees, at 8,200, than the
No.2 and No.3 areas combined, Houston and Southern California.

WORKING WOMEN FUELING FAMILY INCOME IN NEW ENGLAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Servi clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Gains made by working women have fueled a dramatic
growth in family income in New England, evidence that women have
made significant strides in the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1983 and 1997, the real earnings of married couples with
college degrees in New England rose 45 percent, from $70,079 to
$101,780, much of that gain due to the increased earning power of
married women. Additionally, the real median income of middle-class
New England families grew one-third faster than national family
income.
</P>
<P>
   Married women working today are better educated, are higher
paid, hold better jobs, and are working more hours than ever
before, according to a study released to the Globe Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are enormous increases in New England, and they are
mostly due to the labor force involvement of wives, whose
educational attainment is rising,'' said economist Paul Harrington
of Northeastern University's Center for Labor Market Studies, who
authored the study in conjunction with Thomas Kochan of the Work
and Employment Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, mothers are now working an average of 1,600
more hours per year than they did in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Marx should know. A vice president at Fidelity
Investments, she has always worked full time. And she has continued
to do it with two children, putting in 12 hours at the office each
day before factoring in the commute, and relying heavily on a
``tremendous support system.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been working since before my kids were born,'' said
Marx. ``I have worked forever.''
</P>
<P>
   As the second and third generation to enter the work force in
large numbers, married women with children are now an integral part
of the middle-class wage gains that have fueled New England's
bustling economy. Between 1983 and 1997, for example, the median
earnings of married working mothers rose 77 percent, accounting for
almost two-thirds of the real income gains of such dual-earner
households. By contrast, men in such households experienced an
income gain of just 9.8 percent. In dollar amounts, however, the
median pay for men continued to be twice as much as for women.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, married couples with some college or
post-secondary training saw their incomes increase 22.3 percent, to
$68,080 from $55,684.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Wood, 39, a senior partner at the law firm of Nutter,
McClennen &AMP; Fish, acknowledged that if she stopped working today,
her family's lifestyle would change substantially. ``But that being
said, I would never do what I do, in terms of having a very
demanding job, for the money,'' she said. ``You have to have
passion for your work.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT's Kochan, president of the Industrial Relations Research
Association, said the percentage of married women entering New
England's labor force has increased from just under 70 percent to
nearly 80 percent over the 15-year study period. The study examined
New England and the nation as a whole, but did not look at other
regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The region's labor shortage, and the increased demand for
workers in such fields as financial services and high technology,
have helped professional women entering the market garner
top-paying jobs.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, experts say, working mothers' increased hours
and bigger job responsibilities are having a profound effect on
family life. ``Women are getting better jobs and their income is
now crucial to the family, but, by and large, the family has not
restructured to support working women,'' said Joan K. Peters,
author of ``When Mothers Work: Loving Our Children without
Sacrificing Ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who can afford it are outsourcing some of their
responsibilities to nannies, to cleaning people, to daycare,'' said
Peters, ``but they are doing that because the woman's
responsibilities at home are still not being shared equally between
men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when men and women are equal partners at home, both now
face the demand of the 50- to 60-hour work week as well as the
ongoing perception among employers that leaving early to pick up a
child or attend a school conference is largely women's work. Peters
calls this situation a hidden fault-line, and she said it has led
to increased stress and anxiety among working women with children.
</P>
<P>
   In releasing their report, both Harrington and Kochan said they
are hoping to generate dialogue and solutions for working parents
whose job responsibilities are preventing them from meeting their
families' needs. Their paper, titled ``Building a Family Centered
Labor Market Policy,'' will be presented Monday at a Northeastern
University conference.
</P>
<P>
   Marx, who describes herself and her husband, an Internet
consultant, as ``equal partners,'' said they have managed by
relying on a support system of service providers, friends, and
family members. ``No matter what age your children are, if you are
working full time it is difficult, and you need a tremendous
support system,'' Marx said. ``It definitely helps if your partner
is oriented toward family, which my husband is. It also helps to
have an army of people and baby sitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, about 5.5 percent of 54 million households of
married couples currently rely on the wife to bring home the bulk
of the family paycheck, federal statistics show. Among these
dual-earner families, 22 percent of wives now earn more than their
husbands, up from 18 percent in 1987 and 4.4 percent in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   When New York-based Catalyst examined women's pay in a study of
461 female vice presidents or top executives at Fortune 1,000
companies two years ago, it found that 75 percent were primary
earners and 64 percent were married with children.
</P>
<P>
   Constance Armstrong, executive director of the Boston Club, has
noticed the changes. ``Typically, a woman is in management for 10
years before she joins the Boston Club,'' she said. ``Now, we are
seeing women coming in at younger ages. That implies to us that
women are achieving higher management positions at younger ages.''

 AN ORCHESTRA OUT ON A LIMB, TOUTING THE 20th CENTURY

 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The directors of the Philadelphia Orchestra were not pleased to
read the headline over a recent article in The Philadelphia
Inquirer about plans for the orchestra's 1999-2000 centennial
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phila. Orchestra Will Leave Old Masters Behind,'' the headline
said. From a public relations standpoint, the subheading was even
worse: ``In its 100th season every piece will be from the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   What? No Mozart or Brahms? Every program devoted to 20th-century
music? Not surprisingly, the orchestra's office was flooded with
calls, faxes and e-mail from irate concertgoers who feared an
entire season of tuneless, jarringly dissonant works.
</P>
<P>
   But those incredulous callers have been finding out that there
is less to fear than first imagined. During its centennial, the
Philadelphia Orchestra will offer its subscribers only works
composed during the orchestra's lifetime, which exactly encompasses
the 20th century. But that applies only to the subscription series,
which consists of 121 performances of 44 programs. The orchestra
will also present 20 nonsubscription concerts of 15 programs
(galas, holiday concerts and such) with works by Handel, Beethoven,
Tchaikovsky and other not-completely-banished old masters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, technically speaking, the Philadelphia Orchestra's
regular subscribers will face a season of music from this century,
a programming concept that no other American orchestra has tried.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is not to survey 20th-century music, but to represent
100 years of the music that the Philadelphia Orchestra has been
associated with, including the world premieres of works like
Bartok's Piano Concerto No. 3 (in 1946) and monumental compositions
championed early on by the orchestra, like Stravinsky's ``Rite of
Spring,'' which Leopold Stokowski conducted in its American
premiere in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia Orchestra president Joseph Kluger said he realized
that for many people, the very label ``20th-century music''
conjured up ``a stereotype of music that is by definition 12-tone
and/or atonal, and harshly dissonant.'' He was quick to point out,
however, that the 20th century is filled with ``popular and
accessible'' works, the ``kind of music that people beg for all the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachmaninoff, Sibelius and Ravel are generously represented on
the subscription programs, as are Scriabin, Faure, Mahler, Poulenc,
Prokofiev and Copland _ composers who go down easily even with
timid listeners. Music by important composers like Varese,
Lutoslawski, Takemitsu and an under-40 American, Aaron Jay Kernis,
is being performed. However, there is an absence of works by those
names that mainstream audiences, however unfairly, have come to
fear, like Milton Babbitt, Elliott Carter, Pierre Boulez and
Karlheinz Stockhausen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gurrelieder,'' a sprawling early work by Schoenberg, another
audience-intimidating name, will be performed; but this sumptuously
scored music is ``really very Romantic,'' said Simon Woods, the
orchestra's artistic administrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paradox,'' he added, is that ``though this is a daring
idea, the programming is, if anything, rather conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Then just how daring can the idea be? The orchestra's directors
contend that the programming must be judged not in the context of
earlier eras, when concerts of new works were the norm, but against
today's more backward-looking mentality.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, all orchestras were essentially
contemporary music ensembles, playing mostly new or recent works.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Orchestra's plan is being greeted in some
circles as a ``gutsy and timely move,'' to quote The Philadelphia
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in emphasizing that the old masters would be left behind,
that teasing Philadelphia Inquirer headline did pinpoint what is
arguably daring about the orchestra's centennial season. Its
20th-century programming may not be that challenging, but by
depriving subscribers of their beloved Mozart and such, the
orchestra is making a statement about the richness of this century,
and risking retribution.
</P>
<P>
   The suggestion for a 20th-century season originated with the
orchestra's music director, Wolfgang Sawallisch, which may surprise
those who know the 75-year-old German-born conductor as a man
comfortably steeped in the European classical music heritage. Once
the idea was broached and approved, the process of winnowing down
the repertory began. ``I was very impressed by Sawallisch's
willingness to make value judgments,'' Kluger said, ``and to select
works that are worthy of surviving into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra's choices are nonetheless likely to draw criticism
from some musicians and the more adventurous concertgoers. The
Philadelphia has not been noted for its advocacy of the century's
more challenging composers, innovators who have clearly earned a
place in the 21st century. In the last decade, there have been
attempts to correct this with premieres of single works by Luciano
Berio, Mario Davidovsky, Olivier Messiaen and Ralph Shapey. These
works are significantly absent from next season.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Orchestra's more telling act of commitment to
its era may be its centennial commissions: eight composers have
been asked by the orchestra to create works to be performed over
the next three seasons. The 1999-2000 season will offer two: ``One
Heart Beating,'' for vocal soloist, chorus and orchestra, by
Hannibal, the Texas-born composer who first came to attention as a
jazz trumpeter, and the Eighth Symphony by the Finnish composer
Einojuhani Rautavaara. Eight new works over three years may seem
like a lot, but in a less placid musical culture than today's,
eight new works in one season would not be overdoing it.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the New York Philharmonic, which no one has ever
accused of being a hotbed of radicalism, will present six newly
commissioned works next season. And, in honor of the centenary of
Copland's birth, the Philharmonic will perform almost all his
orchestral works over three weeks in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Excluding past masters does not necessarily make a program more
challenging. For example, by any measure, the Philadelphia's first
subscription program is pretty easygoing: Stravinsky's
``Pulcinella'' (a charming pastiche of music by Pergolesi),
Shostakovich's spirited First Piano Concerto and three popular
works by Ravel, including the mega-popular ``Bolero.''
</P>
<P>
   All from the 20th century, yes. But compare this program with
three concerts that Esa-Pekka Salonen, the conductor of the Los
Angeles Symphony, offered last season, which grouped symphonies by
Haydn with recent works by the visionary Hungarian-born composer
Gyorgy Ligeti. In a way, Salonen's musically provocative mixed
programs were, in terms of marketing, more risky.
</P>
<P>
   Kluger speaks ardently about the role of an orchestra in
educating its audience. A balancing act is required between shaping
and following public taste, and it is getting harder. Subscription
sales are down at every major American orchestra, although this
probably has more to do with life style issues than programming.
Most busy people do not want to commit to a weekly night at the
symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Kluger said, the Philadelphia Orchestra sold
about 85 percent of its seats to subscribers and 5 percent to
single-ticket buyers; this season, those figures are 67 percent to
subscribers, 17 percent to single-ticket buyers. So far this
season, overall attendance is good, roughly 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown praise has bolstered the management's morale. An
editorial in The Philadelphia Inquirer was almost giddy: ``Bravo to
the orchestra leadership willing to take a leap of faith and brand
itself as fresh and contemporary,'' it said, adding, ``Bravo to the
musicians who are willing to show that this fading century's music
can be melodic and rewarding, creating more than an atonal
headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Other musicians are trying to show audiences that gritty works
by Sessions, Babbitt, Lutoslawski and Shapey can be beautiful in a
bracing way that reflects a dynamic, tumultuous century.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the Philadelphia Orchestra's announcement has
provoked controversy and gotten people talking. And apathy, Kluger
said, ``is the biggest challenge orchestras face today.''

NINE NORTHWEST SALMON SPECIES LISTED AS ENDANGERED, THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The federal government Tuesday stepped in to do what
the Northwest has failed to do: bring wild salmon back from the
brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Now state and local leaders must start making good on their
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service listed nine struggling
salmon sub-species in Washington and Oregon, including the once
bountiful Puget Sound wild chinook, as threatened or endangered
under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated listingwill force state and local
governments, foresters, farmers, land and home owners, and even big
city apartment dwellers to make financial sacrifices to reverse
more than a century's worth of environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last hundred years as people have moved out here and
developed this part of the country, we've forced the salmon to
adjust to us,'' said Bill Ruckelshaus, leader of a partnership of
Washington corporations and environmental groups monitoring the
salmon-saving efforts. ``This will force us to adjust to the
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders from Seattle, King, Snohomish and Pierce
Counties, state government and Indian tribes crowded before the
microphones Tuesday to assure Uncle Sam of their commitment to
restoring the natural habitat and pristine waterways that once
allowed salmon to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that by pledging stringent new regulations on how much
water their communities use and how much asphalt and concrete is
laid down for new homes and businesses, they can prevent the
federal government from imposing even more draconian measures in
the thickly populated Puget Sound. They're desperate to avoid the
kind of economic paralysis that hit the Olympic penninsula and the
timber industry with the 1990 listing of the spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people understand what (the National Marine
Fisheries Service) did to us today,'' said King County Executive
Ron Sims.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians may not be able to keep some of the promises
they made Tuesday once their constituents take a hard look at the
utility rate hikes and land-use restrictions they're proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Pivotal to Washington's success in keeping federal regulators at
bay is Governor Gary Locke's salmon recovery plan. The $201 million
proposal, designed to give salmon the cool, clean water they need,
is in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Locke's plan would sharply tighten restrictions on water use for
farmers and surburbanites alike, and crack down on illegal
withdrawals. His proposed ``Forest and Fish'' plan, negotiated over
months by the timber industry, state and federal government, and
some tribes, would put 15 percent of existing commercial timber
land permanently out of production. Locke is calling for adding 180
new state employees to enact the recovery effort, shortening salmon
fishing seasons, and forcing developers and private landowners to
expand protection of wetlands and stream-sides.
</P>
<P>
   The first-term governor's ambitious proposal includes the kind
of dramatic, science-backed measures the federal fisheries agency
likes to see. But it's hard to find a Democrat or Republican from a
rural district who is backing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that average salmon must travel through 28 different
government jurisdictions to reach its spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rural lawmakers complain Locke's plan concentrates too much on
the fish habitat in Washington, and not nearly enough on the
environment at sea where salmon spend most of their lives. It does
nothing to address the sea lions, terns and Canadian fisherman
capturing Washington salmon, they say.
</P>
<P>
   And it exacts too much flesh from farmers and homeowners without
clearly spelling out how much sacrifice will be enough, they say.
Small timber land owners depending on their property to finance
retirement or a college education shouldn't be forced to give up
land, they say, for vaguely defined fish recovery goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Chandler, co-chair of the House Agriculture and Ecology
Committee, hails from Grant County, whose dry land was transformed
60 years ago by the Columbia Basin irrigation project into
sprawling fields of beans and peas. He said Locke's demands that
farmers give up water would rob them of their hopes of ever
expanding their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's plan is centered on taking water from people,''
he said. ``Do that, and you turn off the economy's tap too.
Agriculture is the number one industry in this state, employing the
most people.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are casting stones at Locke's plan too. They
say the Forest and Fish plan doesn't protect enough stream-side
forest land to guarantee salmon will recover.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schmidt, Gov. Gary Locke's top salmon adviser, cautioned
that with six weeks of the session left, it's premature to predict
the plan's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, Rep. Jim Buck, co-chair of the House Natural Resources
Committee and Dave Mastin, co-chair House's Salmon Restoration Task
force, all rural Republicans, said they're confident they'll
deliver a plan that will satisfy federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the Legislature's salmon package lacks the
teeth that the federal government requires?
</P>
<P>
   It may deter federal lawmakers' efforts to get Washington the
money it needs to enact its plans. For instance, Sen. Slade Gorton,
chair of the U.S. Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, is
seeking $210 million more than the $100 million President Clinton
promised for West Coast salmon recovery. Gorton said last week that
it's essential that the Legislature do its share if it wants
federal help.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and Indian tribes are standing by, ready to
sue to protect salmon where the state does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If governmental entities don't step up to the plate to protect
society from a species becoming extinct, (litigation) will
happen,'' said Ed Zuckerman, executive director of the Washington
Environmental Alliance for Voter Education.
</P>
<P>
   Such suits would invite federal judges in to dictate exactly how
much salmon protection is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have lived to regret the fact that they opened the
door for such lawsuits. In Massachussetts, an environmental group
sued the state, claiming it had shirked its responsibilities under
the Endangered Species Act by not banning fishing nets that were
catching an endangered species of whale. They won, and state was
prevented from granting permits for the nets.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Volusia County was sued by an environmental group
for failing to adopt an ordinance to dim beach-front lights that
were leading nesting sea turtles into the path of oncoming cars.
That case is now awaiting a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. At
issue is whether local governments have an obligation to use their
powers to save endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Johnston, a Seattle attorney who specializes in endangered
species law, said environmental groups in Washington could sue the
state for not leaving enough enough water in streams for salmon.
Such a victory could force lawmakers to enact water-use
restrictions they are balking at now.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the federal government can also take direct
enforcement action against governments, businesses and even
individuals deemed to be harming fish with their actions. But
proving that fertilizing a lawn or washing a car is harming a fish
in court isn't easy, and Johnston said that's the path the
fisheries agency is least likely to pursue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal fishery officials inisted Tuesday that they're thrilled
with the cooperative spirit they've seen so far in local and state
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolland Schmitten, assistant administrator of the agency,
warned, ``please don't mistake our desire to partner as a lack of
commitment. We will (protect the fish) even if we have to do it
alone.''

 (ATTN: Hawaii) 
(Eds: 1st take stands; this 2nd take contains additional background
on public offering, quotes from two workers referred to in lede.) 
UNDATED: this year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Goldman's offering is unlikely to change the way it does
business right after its public offering. Nearly half of the shares
will still be owned by former partners, another 20 percent by
employees, and almost 10 percent each by retired partners and two
outside shareholders, all of whom are expected to vote with
management. It will be many years, and only after insiders begin
selling their shares, that Goldman will genuinely become a publicly
owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Among the beneficiaries of the sale of stock are Goldman's
retired partners, many of whom still have investments in the firm.
The so-called limited partners were given choices of receiving
cash, a bond-like security, and stock. By about a margin of two and
a half to one, the limited partners chose to take stock, people
close to the firm said. Even so, Goldman plans to devote about $1.3
billion to satisfy demands from limited partners who chose to
receive cash and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major shareholders, Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets Inc.
of Japan and Kamehameha Activities Association, a giant landowner
and education fund in Hawaii, also stand to make a tidy profit from
their Goldman investments.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also plans to set aside $200 million to set up a
charitable fund. The fund will make Goldman a prime target for
charities, especially in the New York area, but the firm has not
spelled out its philanthropic mission. The amount for charity is
less than the firm envisioned last fall, when it expected to raise
a bit more money from going public. At that time, Goldman
executives said they would commit $350 million to a foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Many Goldman employees say the offering, though it will make
them wealthier, will not immediately change their lives. All will
receive restricted stock that can be sold only after several years.
Some said that they do not plan to sell even then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sell any shares, and I might buy some more,''
said one woman who described herself as support staff. Long term,
she said, the shares will come in handy. ``They will put my kids
through college.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have spending plans. One secretary said she and
her husband have had their eyes on a summer vacation spot in
upstate New York, where they have rented a home for several years.
They have long dreamt of buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that we'll do it now,'' she said. ``Having a few
more dollars shouldn't change your life. But it gives you a sense
of security.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulge-bracket earners at the firm have grander plans. One
investment banker in his mid-30s, after about six years there,
earns more than half a million dollars each year in salary and
bonus. He expects to bank $1 million in shares when the offering is
complete. If all goes as planned, he says he will be most of the
way toward his own target of having $3.5 million in savings, and he
says he is thinking of retiring as soon as Goldman allows him to
sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, this is a tough job and you think about
moving on every day,''he said. ``I love the place, but I don't love
it that much.''

NFL OWNERS VOTE LOS ANGELES IN AGAIN, IF . . . 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ They have no firm financing agreement, no stadium
plan, no apparent political support, no sure owner and no solid fan
base but the city of Los Angeles has two things. It has TV sets and
because of that it now has the NFL's 32nd franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The league's 31 owners voted the city a provisional franchise
29-2 Tuesday, on the third day of the annual owner's meetings. But
owners were so unsure of Los Angeles' willingness or ability to
sustain a team that the move is only for six months and hinges on
several conditions, including the approval of a stadium site,
selection of one of two competing ownership groups and proof the
business community will ``actively support the re-establishment of
a successful NFL franchise in the greater Los Angeles area.''
</P>
<P>
   This decision, opposed by Buffalo owner Ralph Wilson and Oakland
owner Al Davis, left Houston businessman Bob McNair in limbo, which
is where he's been since this process began. Despite having the
financing in place to buy an expansion team and both the money and
the necessary approvals to erect a stadium with the full backing he
needs politically, McNair was told Tuesday he is out in the cold if
L.A. can get hot behind the return of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   If this does not make sense to you, remember this is a league
with teams in Jacksonville, Fla., Nashville, Tenn. and Green Bay,
Wisc. but none in Los Angeles or Houston, the nation's second
largest TV market and fourth largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absurd to have this process pit the fourth largest city
in the country against the second largest market in a league that
has the Tennessee Titans,'' remarked sports agent Leigh Steinberg,
who is working with the group headed by Ed Roski and Eli Broad, who
intend to refurbish the L.A. Coliseum as the new team's home
against the league's wishes. ``Los Angeles has more people come to
a traffic jam than go to any Tennessee Titan game.''
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, Houston at least temporarily lost out to Los
Angeles if the city and either the Roski-Broad group or a competing
one headed by Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz that is trying to build
a stadium in Carson, Calif., a suburb east of Los Angeles, can
satisfy 24 owners that it has the money, power and political clout
to bring the NFL back to Los Angeles after the market lost two
teams - the Rams and Raiders - in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of every 15 individuals in the United State lives within
90 minutes of the Coliseum,'' Roski said after the announcement.
``We feel we have the financial capability to do the transaction
and a viable stadium plan.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, it's news to owners like Denver's Pat Bowlen, who
voted for the proposal but made clear if Los Angeles does not meet
the NFL's requirements by Sept. 15 the franchise would be awarded
to McNair.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking for is a stadium situation like Houston's
in Los Angeles,'' Bowlen said. ``We haven't seen any financial
plan. What financial plan? They may have a financial plan but but
we haven't seen it.''
</P>
<P>
   What they have seen is the second largest TV market in the
country living comfortably without NFL football for years. There
was no hue and cry when the Rams and Raiders left southern
California and there has been no real demand for a team to return,
a fact that has worried the league as a generation of L.A. kids
grow up without attachment to any NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Expansion committee co-chairman Jerry Richardson acknowledged as
much when he conceded, ``It's the league's obligation to rekindle
that passion in Los Angeles. It wouldn't be helpful to rekindling
the passion if we gave the franchise to Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough, but McNair has met every criteria outlined by the
league while the competing Los Angeles groups have not. Yet for at
least the next six months, he must sit on the sidelines while the
NFL plays ball with a reluctant Los Angeles market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel having a deadline established is something we'd hoped
for,'' McNair said, doing his best to put a bright face on at least
temporary defeat. ``Six months is better than 10 months (another
proposed timetable). It's been clear there's a feeling the LA
market could not be ignored. There are now conditions that have to
be met. The league can set any rules or standards they wish but
they have gone on record with Sept. 15 (as L.A.'s deadline).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel shafted. The world isn't fair. I never have gone
into anything expecting things to be fair. There's a preference for
L.A. That's clear. What's also clear is there's a lot more passion
for football in Texas than in Los Angeles so we'll see how it plays
out.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced he had fined San Francisco
49ers owner Edward DeBartolo, Jr. $1 million and suspended him for
another year from running the team for his involvement in an
alleged scheme to buy the state of Louisiana's final riverboat
gambling license. DeBartolo has agreed to testify against former
Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, claiming Edwards extorted money from
him in exchange for a favorable license application. If DeBartolo
violates the terms of the suspension he could be fined an
additional $4 million and be forced to continue watching his
sister, Debroah DeBartolo York, control the 49ers...With only five
dissenting votes, it was decided that the annual Thanksgiving Day
games will remain in Detroit and Dallas...No decision was announced
on the sale of the Redskins for $800 million to Howard Milstein and
Daniel Snyder but rumors persisted that the owners will block the
sale, claiming the offer lacks sufficient capital investment by the
two entrepreneurs. Some of the older owners want to see the club go
to John Kent Cooke, son of the late Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke,
who in his will ordered the team be sold to finance college
scholarships for the needy. Cooke bid $700 million but Milstein's
higher offer to the trust set up to sell the team had to be
accepted. Word was Monday night that the issue, which may well lead
to law suits, had blown up and Milstein was out but Tagliabue
insisted the issue would be discussed Wednesday pending a report
from the Finance Committee...Instant replay will also be voted on
Wednesday and approval is expected but not yet assured. Cincinnati
and Arizona will definitely oppose it and the Jets are a likely no
vote. The Giants and Chiefs have long opposed replay's return but
remain on the fence and inscrutable Al Davis, who has opposed any
past plan that cost his team timeouts, refused to say how he is
leaning.

SENATE CALLS FOR MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM AFTER DEMOCRATS DROP
OPPOSITION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to add new 17th graf with comparisons to Reagan's Star Wars
program; see also RUSSIA-NUKE, CHINA-NUKE)   (wg) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House and Senate Democrats abandoned
their longstanding opposition on Tuesday to a politically popular
bill that calls for a national defense against limited long-range
missile attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The actions all but assure overwhelming approval of the overall
bill, which declares it to be United States policy to field an
antimissile system against ballistic missile threats from rogue
nations like North Korea and Iran as soon as ``technologically
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration dropped its threatened veto by President
Clinton after the Senate passed a compromise amendment that
Democrats say insures that any antimissile system will not
interfere with arms-control negotiations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A final vote in the Senate is expected on Wednesday. The House
is scheduled to debate and likely pass a similar, bipartisan
missile-defense bill on Thursday. While neither bill authorizes a
specific system or appropriates money to build it, the measures, if
enacted, represent the government's most forceful support for the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said that the Senate compromise defuses
a potent national security campaign issue that Republicans could
have wielded against Democrats, and tries to finesse a nettlesome
issue before the Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov visits
Washington next week.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has long opposed an American antimissile system, and
conditioned further reductions in its nuclear arsenal on
Washington's compliance with the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty. Fielding an antimissile system would require changes in
that pact, and Russia's leaders have expressed alarm in recent
months over the revived plans.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise amendment, passed 99 to 0, asserts that the
United States will continue to negotiate cuts in Russia's nuclear
forces, which Democrats interpret as language that is inextricably
linked to the ABM Treaty. But Republicans rejected any explicit
language that would have tied deployment of an antimissile system
to adherence to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Critics said that by failing to incorporate language that would
specifically protect the treaty, the overall measure could face
opposition from Russian leaders and the Russian parliament, which
is considering ratification of the second strategic arms reduction
treaty known as Start-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration appeared satisfied with the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were the final bill, we'd accept it,'' Robert Bell, a
senior national security official at the White House, said Tuesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The action marks a significant departure for Senate Democrats,
who twice last year narrowly blocked the same measure from coming
to the Senate floor, and for the White House, which had wielded a
veto threat, arguing that it was bad policy to deploy such a costly
system based only on technological merit.
</P>
<P>
   The measure has since picked up bipartisan support in the wake
of missile tests in the last year by North Korea and Iran, and
recent disclosures that China may have stolen nuclear secrets from
an American weapons laboratory that would enhance Beijing's
long-range missile fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill recognizes the threat is real and that the world has
changed,'' said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., who helped broker the
compromise amendment with Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January, the administration began to backpedal. The White
House announced it was asking Russia to renegotiate the ABM treaty
to permit a limited national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Defense Secretary William Cohen and the Joint
Chiefs of Staff testified to Congress that the administration was
pledging $6.6 billion over the next six years to build a network of
radar and interceptor missiles.
</P>
<P>
   That commitment increased the budget for a national missile
defense to $10.5 billion between now and 2005. The administration
has said it would decide next year whether to build an antimissile
system _ perhaps based in Alaska or North Dakota, or on ships _
that would be ready by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   That type of anti-missile system is a far cry from President
Ronald Reagan's ``Star Wars'' vision to use lasers in space as a
shield against nuclear attack. Even on a smaller scale, the current
program remains burdened by technological problems that some
experts view as impossible to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   Even as senior U.S. officials sought to calm Russian fears and
explain that the system was intended to protect against outlaw
nations, the unity of Senate Democrats was fracturing so badly that
leaders expressed concern they would not be able to muster 33 votes
to sustain a presidential veto.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats negotiated two amendments that are vague enough for
both sides to interpret them the way they want. The first, which
also passed 99 to 0, assures that any money to be spent on a
missile system would go through the regular congressional
appropriations process. The second was the arms control amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The amendments were embraced both by Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss.,
one of the bill's chief sponsors, and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., one
of its chief foes.
</P>
<P>
   But arms control advocates, who fear that fielding a missile
system will undermine nuclear weapons cuts, criticized the
negotiating. ``The Senate has taken a sow's ear, put a little rouge
on, slapped on some lipstick, and produced a sow's ear,'' said John
Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World, an arms
control advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Before striking the compromise, Democrats and Republicans argued
bitterly over the legislation. ``A national missile defense can't
protect us from a low-flying cruise missile launched by a third
world despot or from a terrorist who plants a bomb under a
skyscraper in lower Manhattan,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.Dak.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said: ``It's time for Congress
to wake up and act. The technology to develop and deliver nuclear
and other weapons of mass destruction is widely available and
spreading rapidly.''

 &HT;    Miami coach a quiet 'warrior'
 &HT;    By Marty Williams
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OXFORD, Ohio _ Everyone is praising Charlie Coles but Charlie
Coles.
</P>
<P>
   He coached brilliantly in guiding Miami to back-to-back upset
wins over Washington and Utah in the first two rounds of the NCAA
tournament, but he avoids the limelight the way he avoided
defenders when he averaged 42.1 points a game as a senior at Yellow
Springs Bryan High School.
</P>
<P>
   The RedHawks are in the Sweet 16 for the first time and will
face defending national champion Kentucky in the Midwest Regional
semifinals in St. Louis on Friday, but the 57-year-old Coles swats
at compliments as if they were pesky mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was 35 years old, this would probably have really gone to
my head,'' he said Tuesday at Millett Hall. ``But now, it can't go
to my head. I've been coaching for 34 years. If I started feeling
good about myself, people might say, 'Gee, what took you so long?
You're not real clever if it took you all this time to win two
(NCAA) ball games.'''
</P>
<P>
   But while Coles hesitates to speak for himself, others are quick
to offer personal testimonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Coles is a warrior,'' said point guard Rob Mestas. ``He
showed that when he came back from cardiac arrest (in a
Mid-American Conference tournament game last year at Western
Michigan) and took us to the conference championship (this season).
</P>
<P>
   ``He literally put his life on the line to come back and coach
us,'' Mestas said. ``How can you not have respect for someone who
does that?''
</P>
<P>
   Senior co-captain Damon Frierson said the reason Coles'
strategies and adjustments worked so well in New Orleans was
because the players have such confidence in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't have been better prepared for those two games.
Even when things weren't going well, we would go to the bench and
he would explain how we could fix the problem. And he was right
about everything he said.''
</P>
<P>
   Coles still refused to budge. ``I just don't think of it like
that. I see it like this: you can tell your players to do this or
do that, but it doesn't mean anything unless they want to do it and
can do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very proud after we beat Washington and Utah,'' he
admitted. ``Our players did what we wanted them to do and they
adjusted well. That's good from a coaching point of view because we
certainly told them to make those adjustments. But the thing that
gives you the most pride is that they did it during the game, in
the face of unbelievable pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked how his team can beat Kentucky, Coles returned to
form.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy for this game is simple. We have to try to keep
it close so we can have a chance. How we're going to do that, I
don't know.'' But regardless of what Coles was saying to the media
on Tuesday, Mestas and Frierson know the players will be getting
something a little more concrete as they prepare to face the
Wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   And they'll believe what he tells them because they're convinced
he believes in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Coles is a great motivator and a great X's and O's
guy,'' Mestas said, ``but he's more than that. We can talk to him
about anything. He worries about other things in our lives besides
basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Frierson, ``You don't have to be with coach Coles very
long before you feel you've known him all your life. He's the kind
of guy a player dreams about having as his coach.

GOLDMAN REVEALS PLANS TO GO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needing)  
 (ATTN: Hawaii)  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A secretary plans to buy a summer home. A 36-year-old
banker is already pondering retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Chalk it up to stock. Not the Dow Jones industrial average,
which briefly flirted with the 10,000 mark Tuesday. But to stock in
Wall Street's last big private partnership, Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,
which detailed its plans to go public Tuesday and offered a glimpse
of how it will divide about $21 billion in projected net worth.
</P>
<P>
   In Wall Street legalese, substantially all of Goldman's 13,000
employees will get a stake in the blue-chip investment bank when it
sells shares this spring. The general partners who currently own
the firm will get substantially more _ the average value of their
shares will reach about $50 million. But employees below that level
will share a $4 billion windfall _ secretaries, janitors and word
processors included.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like winning the lottery: We earned it,'' insisted a
corporate secretary at Goldman's beige-stone headquarters on 85
Broad Street, catty cornered to the New York Stock Exchange. ``But
it's a little like the lottery, I guess, because it's not the kind
of pay you get everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Not on Wall Street, anyway. Though many of the Internet start up
companies that go public these days turn their founding employees
into overnight millionaires, Goldman says it is the first
securities firm, and one of the only companies in history, to share
the spoils from a public offering with employees who have no
ownership stake. It is sharing 20 percent of the firm's estimated
value, according to details provided in the formal registration
that the firm filed Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Under this share-the-wealth formula, a secretary in Hong Kong
who took home $40,000 last year and has worked at the firm for five
years will get a stock bonus worth about $25,000, some of that in
shares that cannot be sold right away. A newly hired New York
janitor might get $10,000. One rising banker who earned half a
million last year said he expected to receive Goldman stock and
options valued at about $1 million, though payments have yet to be
finally determined
</P>
<P>
   Partners, of course, will see their stakes increase much more.
Even the most junior of Goldman's 221 partners, including 58
promoted only three months ago, will have shares valued at about
$20 million if the public offering goes as planned, people familiar
with Goldman's plans said. The most senior partners, led by Henry
M. Paulson Jr., the chief executive, will see their stakes rise to
more than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman employees were not exactly clicking their heels as they
knocked off work for the day Tuesday. But many had trouble
suppressing smiles despite the firm's blanket ban on indulging the
press, especially when it comes to the coming public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got lucky,'' said one young banking associate, smoking a
cigarette as he picked out his chauffuered sedan from the line of
black cars outside headquarters. ``I just wish I got here a few
years earlier,'' he said, explaining that those with longer tenure
will get a bigger slice of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman is the only major Wall Street firm that bucked the trend
to go public in the 1970s and 1980s. Partners there said over and
over that they did not want to sell shares because that would risk
diluting the firm's famously aggressive culture. Even more than
other securities firms, Goldman is well known for keeping its
bankers on call most hours of the day and night and elbowing its
way to the top of the rankings in the most lucrative areas of
finance.
</P>
<P>
   But the record amount of money investors have been willing to
pay for top securities firms recently _ and Goldman's worries about
whether it has enough ammunition to compete in the new financial
world of megacompanies _ prompted a rethinking. Goldman partners
first voted to go public last summer, only to have the plan
derailed by the downturn in financial markets last fall. The
offering was revived amid the strong comeback recently for
financial stocks, and Goldman now hopes to complete the offering by
early May.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman wants to sell the public 11 to 13 percent of its shares,
raising perhaps as much as $3.45 billion. Depending on the price
investors are finally willing to pay, the firm as a whole would
have a market value of $18 billion to $24 billion, which would make
it the third-largest on Wall Street after Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter and Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   The firm disclosed in its filing Tuesday that it lost $663
million in an area of the business known as trading and proprietary
investments, with most of that loss attributable to turmoil in the
world bond market after Russia defaulted on its debt in August.
Many other securities firms had trouble as well at that time, but
the steep loss might keep Goldman, despite its premium brand name,
from pricing its shares above those of its top rivals. Most
analysts expect Goldman to sell at about a 10 percent to 20 percent
discount to Merrill and Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was caught by surprise how much of their profits come from
trading, and how that can really be volatile,'' said Hal Schroeder,
an expert on investment banks at Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods. ``I don't
think that they have the earnings stability some other firms do and
so they will trade at a discount.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the offering will probably be the second largest in U.S.
history, following Conoco's $4.4 billion public offering last year.
And Goldman now has momentum on its side, with the Dow gearing up
to surpass 10,000 and Goldman's earnings soaring. The firm reported
first-quarter pretax earnings of $1.19 billion, up 16 percent from
a year earlier, dispelling any notion that last year's woes would
hold back its performance in the first part of this year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's offering is unlikely to change the way it does
business right after its public offering. Nearly half of the shares
will still be owned by former partners, another 20 percent by
employees, and almost 10 percent each by retired partners and two
outside shareholders, all of whom are expected to vote with
management. It will be many years, and only after insiders begin
selling their shares, that Goldman will genuinely become a publicly
owned company.
</P>
<P>
   Among the beneficiaries of the sale of stock are Goldman's
retired partners, many of whom still have investments in the firm.
The so-called limited partners were given choices of receiving
cash, a bond-like security, and stock. By about a margin of two and
a half to one, the limited partners chose to take stock, people
close to the firm said. Even so, Goldman plans to devote about $1.3
billion to satisfy demands from limited partners who chose to
receive cash and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major shareholders, Sumitomo Bank Capital Markets Inc.
of Japan and Kamehameha Activities Association, a giant landowner
and education fund in Hawaii, also stand to make a tidy profit from
their Goldman investments.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman also plans to set aside $200 million to set up a
charitable fund. The fund will make Goldman a prime target for
charities, especially in the New York area, but the firm has not
spelled out its philanthropic mission. The amount for charity is
less than the firm envisioned last fall, when it expected to raise
a bit more money from going public. At that time, Goldman
executives said they would commit $350 million to a foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Many Goldman employees say the offering, though it will make
them wealthier, will not immediately change their lives. All will
receive restricted stock that can be sold only after several years.
Some said that they do not plan to sell even then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to sell any shares, and I might buy some more,''
said one woman who described herself as support staff. Long term,
she said, the shares will come in handy. ``They will put my kids
through college.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, have spending plans. One secretary said she and
her husband have had their eyes on a summer vacation spot in
upstate New York, where they have rented a home for several years.
They have long dreamt of buying.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that we'll do it now,'' she said. ``Having a few
more dollars shouldn't change your life. But it gives you a sense
of security.''
</P>
<P>
   The bulge-bracket earners at the firm have grander plans. One
investment banker in his mid-30s, after about six years there,
earns more than half a million dollars each year in salary and
bonus. He expects to bank $1 million in shares when the offering is
complete. If all goes as planned, he says he will be most of the
way toward his own target of having $3.5 million in savings, and he
says he is thinking of retiring as soon as Goldman allows him to
sell shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, this is a tough job and you think about
moving on every day,''he said. ``I love the place, but I don't love
it that much.''

MARKETPLACE: YEAR OF THE FLIP-FLOP FORECAST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The unexpectedly strong performance of the economy so
far this year has pushed the earnings forecasts of many strategists
higher. For example, Bruce Steinberg, the chief economist at
Merrill Lynch, turned his earnings growth prediction on its head,
flipping to an increase of 3.5 percent from a decline of 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But his colleague, Richard Bernstein, the director of
quantitative research at Merrill Lynch, has a different view.
Unlike Steinberg, he says the direction of earnings is down, not
up. As he put it in a recent report, ``We do not have one indicator
that suggests that the profit cycle will accelerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Disagreements within one shop are not unusual, especially
because big firms have many analysts who use different approaches
to try to fathom what is going on in financial markets. But this
difference in direction, especially after the two were in accord
before Steinberg's switch, does show how confusing the earnings
outlook might be for investors _ and how quickly it can change.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investment environment is very complex right now,''
Steinberg said, giving his view on what the difference in the
forecasts means. ``We each have our own discipline,'' he added.
``Strategists and economists often disagree with each other, so
this is not unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein acknowledged that ``it certainly is a difference in
direction.'' He explained that his forecast is the outgrowth of his
main theme for 1999 _ that the profit cycle has decoupled from the
economic growth cycle. That is, profits can now lag behind the pace
of the economy, which is the opposite of the situation in the
mid-1990s, when profits were growing at a double-digit pace.
</P>
<P>
   While the economy grew briskly at a 3.9 percent rate last year,
operating profits for the 500 companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's
stock index rose five-tenths of 1 percent, according to IBES
International, which tracks company earnings. The performance was
better _ but well off a double-digit pace _ according to First Call
Corp., the other major company that collects earnings forecasts. It
put earnings growth at 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein also notes that Merrill's current 1999 earnings
estimate for the S&AMP;P 500 companies has fallen below Wall Street's
consensus, an unusual occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this debate important is that the move to 10,000 by
the Dow Jones industrial average, the new highs for the S&AMP;P 500,
and the rebound in the Nasdaq composite index, despite a lot of
earnings warnings from technology companies, all seem to be riding,
in part, on the expectation of a revival in corporate profits later
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Both IBES and First Call are expecting big jumps in earnings in
the third and fourth quarters. Using the so-called bottom-up
approach, which is based on a separate earnings forecast for each
of the companies in the S&AMP;P 500, they both foresee earnings growing
at more than 20 percent in the last two quarters of the year,
following a jump to around 13 percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although such predictions are traditionally too optimistic and
are usually revised downward, these estimates are still awfully
strong after a decline in earnings was posted as recently as the
third quarter of 1998. In the current quarter, the two companies
see growth of 5 percent to 7 percent. (Fourth-quarter 1998
performance, with the data all but complete, is difficult to assess
because of the firms' differing calculation methods. First Call is
up 6 percent, while IBES is unchanged.)
</P>
<P>
   But Bernstein says that earnings are not going to rebound
because companies have lost their ability to raise prices and, in
turn, pass on increasing costs, especially rising wages. He said
that because rising labor costs could not be passed on in higher
prices, profits were being squeezed. This squeeze, he said, will
eventually force layoffs that will crimp consumer spending, the
backbone of the economy's recent surprising performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We differ from the consensus,'' he said, ``in that we believe
that the weakness in corporate profits will lead to increasing
unemployment, slowing investment spending and slowing the overall
economy during the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg acknowledged that there had been some disconnect
between the performance of the economy and profits. But he says
that there were a lot of one-time factors that contributed to the
divergence in performance last year. And those factors, including
the strikes at General Motors during the summer, will not be
present this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year has begun so strongly that earnings growth will pick
up again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Steinberg may represent the consensus and Bernstein
the contrarian view _ and investors may just have to choose whose
view to follow _ they do agree in several areas. One is that
consumer stocks are the place to be. Bernstein, although he sees
slower growth, says that the loss of profit growth for companies
turns out to be a gain for consumers. They are benefiting from both
higher wages and savings from the inability of companies to pass on
price increases.
</P>
<P>
   And Steinberg, while far more bullish about earnings than he was
three months ago, still thinks the stock market faces a rocky
outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy so strong, interest rates are not likely to
fall,'' he said. ``There even may be another growth scare, and
interest rates may back up again. And that is not good for
equities.''

 &HT;    Keel bill to authorize local inspectors at carnivals
 &HT;    By Scott Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ George Lane would have given anything not to be
at the Capitol on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago this Friday, Lane watched in horror as his
15-year-old daughter, Leslie, was thrown to her death from an
amusement park ride at the Austin-Travis County Livestock Show and
Rodeo. Steeling himself against his grief and nervousness, Lane
stood up Tuesday to urge a House committee to stiffen safety rules
for such rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here for the love of this lady,'' Lane said as he showed a
portrait of Leslie to state legislators and a phalanx of television
cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Nine people, including the owners and operators of the ride,
maintenance workers and insurance inspectors, were indicted on
murder charges last September in Lane's death.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the incident, lawmakers are weighing legislation
filed by Rep. Terry Keel, R-Austin, and Sen. Gonzalo Barrientos,
D-Austin, which would for the first time allow Texas law
enforcement officials to inspect and immediately shut down unsafe
rides. Rather than create a system of state inspections, Texas
would continue to rely on inspectors hired by insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Lane, along with several carnival ride and amusement park
operators, testified in favor of the bill. But Lane also referred
to it as ``a start'' and suggested that he'd prefer that the state
do its own inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Lane declined to talk to reporters after the hearing _ ``I'm
holding it in as best I can right now,'' he said _ but his lawyer
confirmed that he'd like the legislation to go further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously leaving the inspection procedure to the insurance
companies didn't work for Leslie Lane,'' said Chris Elliott. ``We
see state and or local inspections as an extra hammer to hold over
these ride operators' heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the Keel bill also have questioned whether law
enforcement officers have the expertise to identify potential
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Keel notes that the insurance companies, which don't want to pay
large claims, have a financial incentive to make sure rides are
safe. Under current Texas law, ride operators must be able to prove
that they have insurance and that the ride is inspected at least
once a year. Insurance companies can choose their own inspectors,
as long as they meet certain standards of education and experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no better incentive than the pocketbook,'' Keel said.
</P>
<P>
   His bill would supplement that system by allowing law
enforcement officials to inspect and immediately shut down rides
they deem unsafe. Under current rules, law enforcement officers or
Texas Department of Insurance officials must get a court order to
close a ride. Keel says that many problems, such as broken lap bars
or an intoxicated operator, are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would toughen sanctions for failing to comply with
the insurance and inspection rules, making jail time a possibility
in addition to fines.
</P>
<P>
   Keel said people overestimate the effectiveness of state
inspections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd end up having state inspectors come out, inspect it,
bless it , say it's safe and it would become unsafe and the
operator would point to the fact that they complied with the
minimum inspection requirements,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of federal regulations, amusement park rules vary
greatly from state to state. Arkansas and Florida use state
inspectors to check rides at every setup, while Hawaii uses state
inspectors every six months. Nevada leaves it up to city code
inspectors, and Missouri and North Dakota have no safety
requirements. Some states perform inspections but do not require
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Keel says his analysis of safety records in other states
convinced him that relying on insurance company inspections is
preferable to a state inspection system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas actually has a pretty good mechanism in place now,''
Keel said. The problem is it isn't complemented by any type of
governmental oversight or deterrence. When you couple these two
prongs, we have the best bill in the United States, in my
opinion.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a sense, what is most remarkable about the federal
government's announcement on Tuesday that it would list nine types
of salmon under the Endangered Species Act, a move that will force
new building restrictions and raise taxes across the Seattle area
and elsewhere in the Northwest, is how little controversy it has
stirred _ so far, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But this new application of the law, the broadest in terms of
both geography and the effect on a human population in the
statute's 26-year history, is almost certain to become a test of
the willingness of an entire urban region to pay large sums of
money and perhaps even sacrifice some growth for what has become a
political battle cry: the control of ``sprawl.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort to restore the once-vigorous runs of the Puget Sound
chinook and other salmon is really a cause that combines elements
of a customary environmental crusade with those of the more recent
drive against rampant growth _ the kind of concern that tops Vice
President Al Gore's ``livability agenda,'' which he hopes to make a
centerpiece of his presidential campaign. Restoring the salmon will
entail cleaning up the waterways that snake all over the Puget
Sound region, promoting and preserving green space and open space,
limiting the creep of suburbanization _ all the kinds of things
that people seem to clamor for in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Those polls indicate overwhelming support here for doing
whatever is necessary to save the salmon, which are running at a
fraction of their historic peaks. A big rally on the eve of the
long-awaited listing drew Seattle's mayor and other top local
officials, all in support of the fish. ``What's good for salmon is
good for people,'' one placard said.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort could well mean measures that may not prove so
popular, particularly in the long run. Fertilizer use could be
banned in some areas, and residents' use of water could be limited.
And it will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, perhaps more, to
preserve crucial land.
</P>
<P>
   So what now seems a popular move could well prompt a severe
backlash against the Endangered Species Act and those state and
local officials who must now adopt the needed restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, what's involved here is that for the last 100 years,
as we developed out here, we sort of forced the salmon to adjust to
us,'' said William D. Ruckelshaus, a Seattleite who served as
Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency in the Nixon
and Reagan administrations and now heads a business round-table
group on salmon. ``Well, now we have to figure out how to adjust to
the salmon. At this juncture, there is tremendous enthusiasm for
that, enough political support to cause politicians here to feel
comfortable in taking some pretty extraordinary steps.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it could all evaporate,'' Ruckelshaus added. ``It could
turn into a fight and a struggle. I don't think it will, but it
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say there is reason to be more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old Clinton slogan was `putting people first,' and now the
Gore slogan is `putting salmon first,''' said Alex Castellanos, a
Republican political consultant, referring to Gore's advocacy of
salmon restoration and his recent promise of $100 million in
federal aid as part of what he and the president called ``a new
partnership for salmon recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   The general idea ``sounds good to people, so of course they'll
say they're for it,'' Castellanos said. ``Even so, here's what
always happens: The best day is the first day it's announced. After
that, when you get to putting the price tags on it, there's just a
steady, steady erosion. After a while, people begin to ask, `Well,
what else could you do with this money?' What if the question
becomes, Do you save salmon or do you save seniors?''
</P>
<P>
   And even if pubic support does hold, still others wonder whether
the salmon runs can really be nursed back to health. The
Seattle-Tacoma region already has nearly 3 million people, and it
continues to grow; some projections call for a population growth of
1 million in the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But at a briefing on Monday, the King County Executive, Ron
Sims, a Democrat who is a strong proponent of salmon restoration
plans and a potential candidate for the Senate next year, said
economic growth and saving the salmon were not incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to tear down the Seafirst bank building and
replant it with Douglas fir _ the key will be to make sure we're
smarter with the land mass that's available,'' he said. ``This area
is going to have to become greener.'' But if it grows by 1 million
people, it's hard to see where and how it could become greener.
</P>
<P>
   Under provisions of the species act, local officials must work
in the coming months to develop plans for restoring the salmon runs
and, if there is no improvement, local governments and eventually
even private citizens could face federal sanctions for failing to
protect the fish.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the key to a successful protection effort may be
that all parties involved feel they are affected equally.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people are convinced that this whole thing really is a
partnership, that everybody is doing their fair share, then I think
you could continue to see a lot of support,'' said Robert E.
Gogerty, a consultant here who has advised both businesses and
political candidates. ``But if they think they're bearing the brunt
of it, then you could see a rebellion.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, precisely because salmon restoration will be
undertaken across such a wide region, it may actually prove more
palatable than other listings that have affected a much smaller
number of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What may be somewhat unique about the salmon listing is that
it is likely to spread the cost of recovery fairly broadly,'' said
Michael Bean, chairman of the wildlife program of the Environmental
Defense Fund. ``The act has often been the source of controversy
because while the public at large benefits from conservation, it
was not uncommon for only one or a few landowners or industries to
bear a disproportionate share of the cost when a species was
listed.''

FLEET-BANKBOSTON DEAL ENTAILS MASSIVE BRANCH SELLOFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- In what industry experts say could be one of the
largest bank divestitures in US history, Fleet Financial Group Inc.
and BankBoston Corp. plan to sell off approximately 270 branches
across New England _ including some 200 Fleet branches in
Massachusetts _ as part of their $16 billion merger.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, detailed Tuesday by sources familiar with the
merger, a combined Fleet-BankBoston would retain nearly all of
BankBoston's 301 branches in Massachusetts, the 215-year-old bank's
traditional stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, which will initially be called Fleet Boston
Corp., would sell nearly all of Fleet's in-state branches.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Boston also proposes to sell around half of BankBoston's
64 branches in Connecticut and nearly all of its 45 branches in
Rhode Island, where Fleet dominates. After the proposed
divestiture, the company will have around 1,580 branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would appear to be the largest single market bank
divestiture ever in a major merger,'' said Christopher Bellini, a
banking lawyer at Gibson Dunn &AMP; Crutcher in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of which branches would be sold was so contentious
that it nearly derailed the merger agreement last weekend. Sources
close to the transaction said Fleet initially agreed to sell nearly
all its Massachusetts outlets but then reconsidered, proposing that
BankBoston branches be sold instead.
</P>
<P>
   But BankBoston prevailed, saying that unless the new company
kept most of its branches in Massachusetts, the merger was off.
According to sources, BankBoston felt that its legacy as the
nation's oldest bank, founded in Boston, was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Both Fleet and BankBoston, which are combining to form the
nation's eighth largest bank, have so much overlap in
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island that they must sell
branches to avoid violating antitrust laws. Fleet, New England's
largest bank, is dwarfed by BankBoston in the Massachusetts market
but dominates in other New England states.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed divestiture will allow other banks, including those
outside the region, to bid for branches and potentially assemble
enough outlets to pose a competitive threat to Fleet Boston.
Whether a serious challenge emerges, however, is an open question.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say that Fleet Boston's divestiture plan may
signal a new chapter in banking consolidation, in which regulators
allow mergers that utlimately decrease competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it sets a precedent,'' said one senior New York
banking lawyer who declined to be named. ``This would essentially
be the first time that Justice has ever permitted a single bank to
dominate a single market.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet and BankBoston executives acknowledge privately that they
hope to sell branches to lots of bidders, preferably smaller banks,
to avoid opening the door to a new competitor. Already several
local banks, including Citzens Financial Group Inc. and US Trust,
have expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the divestiture be to one big entity or divided up in
parts to smaller competitors? That is the big open question,'' said
Gregory Lyons, a partner in Boston-based Goodwin, Procter &AMP; Hoare's
banking practice.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet offcials said all banks were welcome to bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our divestiture plan is subject to revisions and approvals by
federal and state regulators,'' said Fleet spokesman Jim Mahoney.
``But we believe these are attractive franchise opportunities and
that major companies will bid for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we are open to all bidders, whether they are
large or small banks, whether they are inside or outside the
region,'' Mahoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-state banks expected to bid include giant NationsBank
Corp., based in Charlotte, N.C., according to analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Many small, local banks are interested in buying branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community banks would absolutely like to be part of the
bidding process, especially if they can buy branches on an
individual basis'' said Gene Graham, executive vice president of
the Community Bank League of New England, which represents about
118 small institutions. ``But we don't want to have to be required
to purchase a minimum of, say, 20 branches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Boston's divestiture proposals are just that _ proposals.
And the numbers are still approximations, to be approved by
regulators. The two banks, which presented their divestiture plan
to the Justice Department and Federal Reserve officials three weeks
ago, said they are confident that regulators will approve the
proposal later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were frankly surprised at how receptive they were to the
plan,'' one company source said, adding that officials from both
state bodies spent one week reviewing the plan and offered no
criticism. ``If they'd had reservations, they would have said, `You
go forward at your own peril.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the regulators decide, however, Fleet and
BankBoston say their deal cannot be broken.
</P>
<P>
   If regulators decide Fleet Boston must get rid of twice as many
deposits and branches in order to comply with antitrust laws, the
merger agreement must still go ahead _ even if it becomes more
costly to Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet initially wanted a so-called ``regulatory-out clause'' in
the merger contract _ a provision stipulating that Fleet could
renegotiate the agreement's price if regulators demand more costly
divestitures.
</P>
<P>
   But sources close to the merger said BankBoston insisted on an
agreement that could not be adjusted if regulators require more
assets to be divested. The reason, sources said, was that
BankBoston feared that if the deal unraveled it could find itself
open to a takeover by a big out-of-region bidder _ a scenario
BankBoston was keen to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Fleet to agree to a final deal that could not be
renegotiated under any conditions kept executives from both banks
up all last weekend in New York before signing a final deal on
Sunday, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Boston plans to hold three auctions _ one for Fleet
branches in Massachusetts, which have around $7.5 billion in
deposits; one for BankBoston branches in Connecticut, which hold
$1.5 billion in deposits; and one for BankBoston branches in Rhode
Island, which have $2.5 billion in deposits. Auctions may or may
not have multiple bidders, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   While Fleet Boston is expected to cut approximately 5,000 jobs
and close two dozen branches, staffers at divested branches are
expected to keep their jobs when the outlets are sold.
</P>
<P>
   In order to pass regulatory hurdles, Fleet Boston also proposes
to sell $13.6 billion in deposits, or about 20 percent of its
combined $71 billion in deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet Boston Corp. will earn from $0.10 to $0.15 for each
deposit dollar it sells, giving it a profit of up to $2 billion
from divestiture. In a separate sale, Fleet Boston Corp. will also
sell off around $2.5 billion in loans to small and mid-size
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the prospect of divestiture has ``every banker in
town ringing our phones off the hook,'' said an executive at one of
the to-be-merged banks.``They're all looking for a leg up.''

GOP BUDGET PLAN CUTS TAXES BUT SUPPORTS EDUCATION AND MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>

(sw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans laid out a budget proposal on Tuesday
that makes good on their promises to cut taxes and increase
spending on the military and education, but at the cost of deep
cuts elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan is the Republican response to the budget proposal
sent to Congress last month by President Clinton, and like the
White House plan, it makes shoring up Social Security the nation's
top fiscal priority in a period of emerging surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan was introduced on Tuesday in the Senate
Budget Committee, and a similar version is to be taken up on
Wednesday by the House Budget Committee. While it is likely to
prove no more than the opening Republican negotiating position, it
makes clear that the surplus will not mute the debate over how to
capitalize on the nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, the New Mexico Republican who is chairman of
the Senate Budget Committee, said the plan would provide a tax cut
next year of $15 billion and possibly more if the strong economy
continues to generate higher-than-expected tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The tax cuts would grow to $778 billion over the next decade.
That is enough for the tax-writing committees in the House and
Senate to choose among a variety of tax-cutting options, but
probably not enough, Domenici acknowledged, for the 10 percent
across-the-board reduction in income tax rates that Republicans had
hoped to make the centerpiece of their agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to blunt attacks from Clinton and Democrats in Congress
that Republicans are shortchanging Medicare, Domenici said his plan
would set aside $133 billion over the next decade to cope with a
variety of contingencies, including the possibility that an
overhaul of Medicare would require an infusion of money.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would increase Pentagon spending by $18.2 billion,
to $290 billion, reflecting an insistence among Republicans on
rebuilding what they see as a dangerously run-down military.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to neutralize a traditionally Democratic issue,
the plan calls for a $3.3 billion increase in federal spending on
education next year, to a total of $103 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But to allow the spending increases on the military and
education while also meeting another bedrock Republican pledge _ to
remain within the tight spending limits set out in the 1997
bipartisan budget deal _ the plan would require slashing spending
on a wide array of other programs.
</P>
<P>
   To stay under the cap on programs that receive annual
appropriations _ $536 billion for next year _ the plan requires
discretionary spending cuts of $14.7 billion next year, which some
members of both parties said could well prove politically
impossible. The plan would require even bigger cuts in the two
subsequent years: $15.4 billion in 2001 and $22 billion in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, if it is adopted by both the House and the Senate,
would not become law but would be the guideline for the annual tax
and spending bills Congress will take up this year. It is not
binding but suggests specific cuts that the appropriations
committees could consider in reconciling the demand from both
parties for new and expanded programs be financed with the painful
discipline of the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal suggests that spending on environmental programs,
for example, be reduced to $21.5 billion next year, from $23.9
billion this year. It would reduce spending on science, including
NASA, to $18 billion, from $18.8 billion this year. It would shrink
spending for agriculture to $14.3 billion next year, from $16.8
billion, and would not renew billions of dollars in emergency aid
Congress gave farmers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici called the plan ``a good start on wisely and
effectively using projected surpluses into the next century.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Budget Committee's senior Democrat, Sen. Frank
Lautenberg of New Jersey, attacked the proposal, as did the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to fund an irresponsible and exploding tax cut, it
fails to commit a single penny to securing Medicare and it requires
discretionary cuts in the first few years that could not
realistically be put together without serious reductions in key
areas like education, health and environment,'' said Gene Sperling,
the administration's economic policy adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Domenici said he hoped the committee would complete work on the
plan this week and send it to the Senate floor for a vote next
week. Last year, Domenici feuded over budget priorities with his
counterpart in the House, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio. But this year,
the two men are working closely together to keep the party united
as they head into months of negotiations with the White House on
taxes, spending, Social Security and Medicare.  &QL;

BUSINESS TRAVEL: A YOUNGER BREED TRAVELS THE WORLD
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ruth Stanat talks fast, but this probably comes naturally for
someone who has visited more than 100 countries on business in the
last couple of years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no time anymore!'' she gasped the other day from her
office in Fort Wayne, Ind. ``I just jumped off the plane from
Geneva, and I hit the deck running. I can't even look at the
schedule. Back and forth to San Francisco for two hours! I recently
had a meeting in Washington, which I had to leave in the middle of,
to go to Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stanat, 51, is the president and founder of SIS
International Research, a business planning and market research
company with offices in 18 countries. A former senior executive at
Chase Manhattan Bank and the Mars Corp., Ms. Stanat has also
managed to write two books, often working on airplanes or in
airports. The most recent is ``Global Jumpstart: The Complete
Resource for Expanding Small and Midsize Businesses,'' with Chris
West as co-author (Perseus Books, 1999).
</P>
<P>
   While never leisurely, business travel has become more frantic
with the accelerating speed of globalization, Ms. Stanat says. She
chuckles now to think that she was once able to ``drag my kids all
around the world'' and even enjoy an occasional carefree weekend in
London. Now, especially with cellular phones and the Internet, she
says, it's always a business day somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One of the consequences of this is that business travel is
increasing in both volume and pace. ``With the good economy,
companies want their people on the road,'' said Christine Levite, a
vice president at American Express. American Express estimates that
U.S. companies spent $175 billion on travel and entertainment in
1998, up from $165 billion in 1997. And it is no accident that a
lot of those faces in departure lounges are looking younger these
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than just sending someone to Paris, a company will now
send someone to four or five other countries in the European Union,
and possibly to Prague and Budapest, too,'' Ms. Stanat said.
``After about 10 days of this, most people are totally burned out.
Companies are throwing so many young people out on the road because
kids are resilient. They're usually not strapped down with
families, and, hey, maybe it's their first time in Paris. They're
willing to fly coach.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are limits even to youthful patience on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: Newark International Airport, AMR's American
Airlines, Gate 30, last Thursday night. Flight 1535 to Miami has
already been rescheduled five times from its original 6:20 p.m.
departure time. There being few social lubricants as effective as
adversity in the face of a common enemy, strangers have begun
gathering in knots, muttering darkly to one another about what they
say is a lack of reliable information about their flight, which
American agents maintain has been delayed by that hardiest of
excuses, ``bad weather in Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   At 9 p.m., after still another delay, Robert Rossi, a burly
28-year-old real estate salesman from Summit, N.J., who says that
he travels 40 to 50 times a year on business, decides that he isn't
going to take it anymore, not silently at least.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do they keep lying to me?'' he bellows, raising both arms
and addressing the crowd. ``They threatened to call the police
because I'm complaining!''
</P>
<P>
   Once, fellow travelers would have kept their eyes downcast at
such a scene, like subway riders avoiding a panhandler. But Rossi's
outburst actually elicits general approval from the crowd. One
frustrated passenger puts in: ``I'd call this a fly-by-night
operation, but they aren't even doing that.'' Says another: ``I
just came in from in Dallas. The weather is fine in Dallas, just a
little overcast.''
</P>
<P>
   Around 9:30, a group of Port Authority police officers, alerted
to potential rebellion, is summoned to the departure gate. ``There
must be 15 police officers with clubs,'' marvels Joe Abelleira, a
marketing executive with the Cordis Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Calm restored, the plane finally arrives for a 10:58 departure
that will put passengers into Miami around 2 a.m. Oddly, the
official reason for the late flight has now changed, at least on
the American Airlines automated telephone flight-information
system, which insists that ``air-traffic control delays'' were
responsible for the problem with Flight 1535. &QL;

NINE NORTHWEST SALMON SPECIES LISTED AS ENDANGERED, THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The federal government Tuesday stepped in to do what
the Northwest has failed to do: bring wild salmon back from the
brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Now state and local leaders must start making good on their
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service listed nine struggling
salmon sub-species in Washington and Oregon, including the once
bountiful Puget Sound wild chinook, as threatened or endangered
under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated listingwill force state and local
governments, foresters, farmers, land and home owners, and even big
city apartment dwellers to make financial sacrifices to reverse
more than a century's worth of environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last hundred years as people have moved out here and
developed this part of the country, we've forced the salmon to
adjust to us,'' said Bill Ruckelshaus, leader of a partnership of
Washington corporations and environmental groups monitoring the
salmon-saving efforts. ``This will force us to adjust to the
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders from Seattle, King, Snohomish and Pierce
Counties, state government and Indian tribes crowded before the
microphones Tuesday to assure Uncle Sam of their commitment to
restoring the natural habitat and pristine waterways that once
allowed salmon to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that by pledging stringent new regulations on how much
water their communities use and how much asphalt and concrete is
laid down for new homes and businesses, they can prevent the
federal government from imposing even more draconian measures in
the thickly populated Puget Sound. They're desperate to avoid the
kind of economic paralysis that hit the Olympic penninsula and the
timber industry with the 1990 listing of the spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people understand what (the National Marine
Fisheries Service) did to us today,'' said King County Executive
Ron Sims.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians may not be able to keep some of the promises
they made Tuesday once their constituents take a hard look at the
utility rate hikes and land-use restrictions they're proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Pivotal to Washington's success in keeping federal regulators at
bay is Governor Gary Locke's salmon recovery plan. The $201 million
proposal, designed to give salmon the cool, clean water they need,
is in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Locke's plan would sharply tighten restrictions on water use for
farmers and surburbanites alike, and crack down on illegal
withdrawals. His proposed ``Forest and Fish'' plan, negotiated over
months by the timber industry, state and federal government, and
some tribes, would put 15 percent of existing commercial timber
land permanently out of production. Locke is calling for adding 180
new state employees to enact the recovery effort, shortening salmon
fishing seasons, and forcing developers and private landowners to
expand protection of wetlands and stream-sides.
</P>
<P>
   The first-term governor's ambitious proposal includes the kind
of dramatic, science-backed measures the federal fisheries agency
likes to see. But it's hard to find a Democrat or Republican from a
rural district who is backing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that average salmon must travel through 28 different
government jurisdictions to reach its spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rural lawmakers complain Locke's plan concentrates too much on
the fish habitat in Washington, and not nearly enough on the
environment at sea where salmon spend most of their lives. It does
nothing to address the sea lions, terns and Canadian fisherman
capturing Washington salmon, they say.
</P>
<P>
   And it exacts too much flesh from farmers and homeowners without
clearly spelling out how much sacrifice will be enough, they say.
Small timber land owners depending on their property to finance
retirement or a college education shouldn't be forced to give up
land, they say, for vaguely defined fish recovery goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Chandler, co-chair of the House Agriculture and Ecology
Committee, hails from Grant County, whose dry land was transformed
60 years ago by the Columbia Basin irrigation project into
sprawling fields of beans and peas. He said Locke's demands that
farmers give up water would rob them of their hopes of ever
expanding their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's plan is centered on taking water from people,''
he said. ``Do that, and you turn off the economy's tap too.
Agriculture is the number one industry in this state, employing the
most people.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are casting stones at Locke's plan too. They
say the Forest and Fish plan doesn't protect enough stream-side
forest land to guarantee salmon will recover.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schmidt, Gov. Gary Locke's top salmon adviser, cautioned
that with six weeks of the session left, it's premature to predict
the plan's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, Rep. Jim Buck, co-chair of the House Natural Resources
Committee and Dave Mastin, co-chair House's Salmon Restoration Task
force, all rural Republicans, said they're confident they'll
deliver a plan that will satisfy federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the Legislature's salmon package lacks the
teeth that the federal government requires?
</P>
<P>
   It may deter federal lawmakers' efforts to get Washington the
money it needs to enact its plans. For instance, Sen. Slade Gorton,
chair of the U.S. Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, is
seeking $210 million more than the $100 million President Clinton
promised for West Coast salmon recovery. Gorton said last week that
it's essential that the Legislature do its share if it wants
federal help.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and Indian tribes are standing by, ready to
sue to protect salmon where the state does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If governmental entities don't step up to the plate to protect
society from a species becoming extinct, (litigation) will
happen,'' said Ed Zuckerman, executive director of the Washington
Environmental Alliance for Voter Education.
</P>
<P>
   Such suits would invite federal judges in to dictate exactly how
much salmon protection is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have lived to regret the fact that they opened the
door for such lawsuits. In Massachussetts, an environmental group
sued the state, claiming it had shirked its responsibilities under
the Endangered Species Act by not banning fishing nets that were
catching an endangered species of whale. They won, and state was
prevented from granting permits for the nets.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Volusia County was sued by an environmental group
for failing to adopt an ordinance to dim beach-front lights that
were leading nesting sea turtles into the path of oncoming cars.
That case is now awaiting a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. At
issue is whether local governments have an obligation to use their
powers to save endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Johnston, a Seattle attorney who specializes in endangered
species law, said environmental groups in Washington could sue the
state for not leaving enough enough water in streams for salmon.
Such a victory could force lawmakers to enact water-use
restrictions they are balking at now.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the federal government can also take direct
enforcement action against governments, businesses and even
individuals deemed to be harming fish with their actions. But
proving that fertilizing a lawn or washing a car is harming a fish
in court isn't easy, and Johnston said that's the path the
fisheries agency is least likely to pursue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal fishery officials inisted Tuesday that they're thrilled
with the cooperative spirit they've seen so far in local and state
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolland Schmitten, assistant administrator of the agency,
warned, ``please don't mistake our desire to partner as a lack of
commitment. We will (protect the fish) even if we have to do it
alone.''

A GENERAL WILL ADMIT TO ADULTERY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (nk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A retired two-star general who briefly served as
the Army's deputy inspector general has agreed to plead guilty to
eight counts of misconduct stemming from adulterous relationships
he had with the wives of four subordinate officers, his lawyer said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Maj. Gen. David R.E. Hale, reached an agreement
with Army prosecutors on the eve of his court-martial, which was
scheduled to begin Wednesday at Fort Lewis, Wash. The Army had
charged him with 17 counts of misconduct, but in exchange for the
guilty pleas it agreed to reduce the charges and impose a lesser
sentence, which was not made public Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hale had served only four months as deputy inspector general
when his request to retire last February was granted by the Army,
even though the wife of a subordinate had filed a complaint
accusing him of an improper sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's handling of the case led to accusations of a double
standard that allowed senior officers to escape punishment for
wrongdoing while junior officers or enlisted personnel faced
vigorous prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The furor over the case prompted Defense Secretary William Cohen
to order changes in the military's retirement policies, barring
officers accused of misconduct from retiring until charges against
them are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Hale had faced a
maximum sentence of 11 years in prison if convicted at
court-martial. However, under the agreement announced Tuesday,
Hale's lawyers and Army prosecutors have already agreed to limit
his sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, 53, must appear in Fort Lewis on Wednesday before the
presiding officer of the court-martial, who will review the plea
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, who had adamantly maintained his innocence, wanted to
bring the case ``to a swift conclusion,'' his lawyer, Frank J.
Spinner, said in remarks to reporters at Fort Lewis on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Spinner emphasized that while his client admitted having
adulterous relationships and lying about them, both violations of
the code of military justice, he denied committing ``any
nonconsensual sexual offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Hale has agreed to plead guilty to making
false official statements by lying to the Pentagon's deputy
inspector general and conduct unbecoming an officer and gentleman
for having an ``improper relations, while married'' with the wives
of four subordinates, for denying that to one of the husbands and
for misleading the Army's inspector general once the accusation
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   The Army dropped charges of making false statements, unbecoming
conduct and obstruction of justice, including one count that
charged him with threatening one of the women that he would testify
against her in a child custody case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The charges against Hale grew out of the accusations of
Donnamaria Carpino, whose husband was a colonel at the NATO base at
Izmir, Turkey, where Hale served as deputy commander of all NATO
ground forces for southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpino accused Hale of trumping up adultery charges against
her husband and then promising not to pursue them if she agreed to
have sex with him. At the time, Hale was divorcing his wife of 30
years.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the Pentagon's inspector general, Eleanor
Hill, concluded that the relationship between Ms. Carpino and Hale
was consensual, not coerced. That investigation also detailed a
``pattern of inappropriate behavior'' involving the other women, as
well as misuse of travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he agreed to plead guilty to some of the charges
before the court-martial could begin, Hale still, technically, will
have faced a court-martial. As such, he will be only the second
Army general to face court-martial since Congress enacted the
Uniform Code of Military Justice in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   The other case occurred in 1952, when Maj. Gen. Robert W. Grow,
the military attache in Moscow, was tried on charges of dereliction
of duty after his diary was stolen from a hotel room in Germany and
published by East Germany's Communist government.

CIENFUEGOS ENDS HOLDOUT _ FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos reported to Galaxy
training camp Tuesday, ending his holdout -- at least temporarily
-- without warning and much to the surprise of coach Octavio
Zambrano.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Cienfuegos practiced for the first time in
preparation for Saturday's season opener against Colorado, his
problems with the league are far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos said he acted in good faith by reporting to camp, but
that if his contract isn't re-worked by Friday, he'll fly back to
El Salvador and miss the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make a decision to come back to the team by showing
up today,'' Cienfuegos said. ``The league wanted us (he and fellow
holdout Raul Diaz Arce of San Jose) to report to our teams so that
we can negotiate. That's all we're doing, doing our part. Now maybe
they will hold up to their end of the bargain and get this
settled.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Gazidis, the executive vice president of player relations
for the MLS, said he was hoping to speak with Cienfuegos' agent,
Corey Clemetson, so the two sides could begin talks.
</P>
<P>
   Gazidis did say, however, that if Cienfuegos' position is to
report to camp solely for the purpose of negotiations without an
intent to play, that's not an good act of faith in his book.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, it's definitely a positive development to see
him in camp,'' Gazidis said. ``But if Mauricio returns again to El
Salvador, it would show he reported solely to get what he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to us that he plays in games; that's what he's
being paid for. Good faith means adhering to your commitment and he
has a contract to play now and that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clemetson has said all along, Cienfuegos said he feels his
$103,000 contract is an insult compared to what he believes other
marquee players are earning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what we know and our value to the league is the reason
we want to sit down and discuss our contracts,'' Cienfuegos said.
``The maximum of $250,000 is an illusion. There are many players
making more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these players (with high contracts) haven't produced
as well as we have. There are players getting way above the
maximum, yet they're not producing the way we are, so there has to
be a way to compensate us better.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos was very disappointed with the 15-percent raise the
league offered during the first round of negotiations a few weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they offered me amounted to a tip, as you call it in the
United States,'' Cienfuegos said, comparing MLS' offer to a
gratuity at a restaurant. ``I'm willing to meet them halfway, but
they have to be willing to meet with me halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   If the worst-case scenario plays out and he returns to El
Salvador, Cienfuegos would ask the league to shop him around.
</P>
<P>
   ``My career doesn't end here,'' Cienfuegos said. ``If it doesn't
work out, I'd like them to put a price on my exchange and loan me
out somewhere. I'm not ready to retire.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson says the decision to play is up to Cienfuegos and Diaz
Arce.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are ready to play,'' Clemetson said. ``Whether they play
this week really depends on the efforts of the league at this
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they (the league) step up and give them a great, brand new
contract, then the league is true to their word and we can resolve
this. But if it's their intention to get them in camp and use their
names for the purpose of getting ready for the start of the season,
I don't think that's going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambrano, who sat down and spoke with Cienfuegos, believes
everything will be worked out by Saturday. He also said Cienfuegos
appeared in top shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so; I think Mauricio is a competitor and he will be
with us Saturday,'' Zambrano said. ``This thing has been eating him
alive. At the end of the day he wants to play and he knows this is
his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the eyes of everyone, if the league comes through with a
reasonable offer on (par) with offers that other players are given
with (Cienfuegos) relevance, I believe Mauricio will accept it. And
I do believe he deserves to be paid with that elite group.''

APPLE ADOPTS `OPEN SOURCE' STRATEGY  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ The ``open source'' software movement won a
vote of confidence Tuesday from yet another major computer maker
with Apple Computer's release of an operating system for the server
computers that connect desktop and laptop machines across a
business or to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company said its Mac OS X Server would position Apple to
compete in the hot market for small servers priced below $5,000, a
market now dominated by Compaq Computer, Dell Computer,
Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   But just as significant as the product itself is Apple's
adoption of a strategy known as open source, which means that it is
releasing its source code, the original instructions written by the
programmers who created it. Apple has dubbed the software for this
Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   With traditional software models, once the original code has
been compiled into an executable program, it is difficult and
illegal to reconstruct the lines of instructions written by the
programmers. In most cases, companies that make operating systems
jealously protect these instructions as trade secrets, giving
outside developers only enough information to enable them to write
their own software.
</P>
<P>
   The open source movement has been gathering momentum in
corporate markets for several reasons. In addition to being easy to
adapt and modify, it has developed a reputation for being more
stable than traditional software because a growing community of
programmers _ many of whom are developers _ are continually fixing
any flaws they stumble across.
</P>
<P>
   And paradoxically, open source has developed a reputation for
being more secure than commercial software because it can be
examined for loopholes by independent programmers.
</P>
<P>
   The open source movement has been spurred by the widespread and
growing adoption of Linux, an open source operating system
developed over the last decade in a collaboration among a worldwide
group of programmers.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the open source movement has concentrated on
software that runs on server computers, not on desktop computers, a
market dominated by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Like Linux, Darwin is one type of Unix, an operating system
invented at AT&AMP;T's Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s. Other
versions of the Unix operating system include Sun's Solaris and
IBM's AIX.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, analysts and employees in a small
auditorium on the company's corporate campus here, Apple's interim
chief executive, Steven Jobs, said that Apple was stepping into the
corporate server market cautiously and with modest ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to start by walking, and then later this year
we'll be jogging, and by next year we'll be running,'' Jobs said.
Alluding to the introduction last year of its most popular computer
of the decade, he added, ``Our heads are not so swollen by the
success of the iMac, that we don't realize that we have a lot to
learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The $499 Mac OS X Server software will not run Macintosh
applications but will serve as a platform for server programs that
coordinate the sharing of centralized data in work groups and
distribute World Wide Web pages. The company also announced that it
was bundling the software with its fastest Macintosh G3 desktop
computer, and selling the system for $4,999.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs cited Internet performance benchmarks suggesting that the
system was a more powerful Web server than similarly configured
systems from Dell and Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The open source software package, or Darwin, will include the
operating system's most fundamental code, or ``kernel,'' known as
Mach, bundled with a set of services based on the Berkeley Systems
Design version of Unix, and a version of one of the first and most
popular open source programs, the Apache Web server, converted for
the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   The source code was placed on Apple's Web site Tuesday for free
downloading.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in strategy for Apple, which has traditionally
protected its software under proprietary licensing, was applauded
by some of the leading figures in the open source movement, a
number of whom sat in the front row during the presentation by
Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The open source community is delighted about this
announcement,'' said Eric Raymond, a programmer who has figured
prominently in the development of the movement, which sprang from
the hacker culture.
</P>
<P>
   The open source decision will also likely strengthen Apple's
hand in the educational market in part because of pricing and
because, in the words of Gavin Eadie, the director of the strategic
technology group at the University of Michigan, ``With open source
we can get in there and make our changes.''

SHEFFIELD'S COMPLAINTS GETTING HAIRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The player with the ear-lobe jewelry and the
``sensitive'' label, back with his team earlier than expected
following an excused absence, was asked Tuesday if it had been a
time for soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soul-searching?'' he replied incredulously. ``Man, I don't
know where you get that from. I know who I am.''
</P>
<P>
   Who, Dennis Rodman?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no. Gary Sheffield is no Rodman, nothing that extreme. For
one thing, there's no crying in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheffield (begin ital)is(end ital) a player with the talent
to make or break the Dodgers' season if his self-absorption _ about
matters as trivial as personal grooming _ don't distract them or
him.
</P>
<P>
   Which, maybe, it just did.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the day after he left the Dodgers' spring-training camp,
Sheffield was quoted musing about retirement, apparently expressing
frustration over a slow-to-heal throwing shoulder, a 1-for-15 start
in exhibition batting and _ worse _ his switch to left field and
the team policy against facial hair.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody took the retirement talk seriously, certainly nobody who
remembered Sheffield's similar venting at a bleak moment early in
the Florida Marlins' 1998 season, to which Marlins general manager
Dave Dombrowski replied, essentially, ``So retire!''
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there anything wrong with Sheffield's worry about the
shoulder, which threatens to keep him out of the April 5 season
opener.
</P>
<P>
   But when he made an issue of the position change, which he'd
originally approved, and the grooming rules, which are hardly
unique, he went over the line separating the introspective players
from the selfish.
</P>
<P>
   And when he returned to Dodgertown on Tuesday and declined
opportunities to put the left-field and facial-hair questions to
rest, he turned this into the latest fire that manager Davey
Johnson must put out.
</P>
<P>
   As Sheffield spoke to a circle of about 10 reporters in the
clubhouse, teammates were spotted rolling their eyes at the scene.
Some of those Dodgers later issued colorful no-comments.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise might be it took Sheffield _ the last holdover from
the seven-player trade headed by Mike Piazza _ 10 months in Los
Angeles to live up to his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, he'd been a sweetheart with management, teammates and
reporters. After writing last May that Sheffield was physically and
emotionally fragile, I'd come to doubt my words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's reputation preceded him here,'' Dodgers president Bob
Graziano said Tuesday. ``(But) when he came over, I thought the
reputation was about somebody different.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers like Sheffield, and love his 42-homer, 120-RBI
power, and so they're unusually sympathetic in the wake of his
recent statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to support him and help him,'' general manager
Kevin Malone said. ``He knows my door is always open.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone added: ``I like players that have their own opinions and
say what they think. I myself am like that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody deals with (trouble) in different ways,'' first
baseman Eric Karros said. ``Maybe it's easier for him to deal with
it by talking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hate,'' Graziano said, ``for people to judge Gary
based on comments he made one day last week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers know the reason for Sheffield's two-day leave was
innocent, and believe the four-time All-Star has earned special
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a lot of players who've earned it but don't
need it quite as badly as he does.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, what the Dodgers need is Sheffield to move from
right field, Raul Mondesi's natural position, to left. It's one of
those good-of-the-team sacrifices that should come naturally to a
player with a Marlins World Series ring.
</P>
<P>
   To Sheffield, it's an issue. He refers to himself as ``an
All-Star in right field,'' missing the point that he's really an
All-Star hitter with lesser credentials as a fielder.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' no-beards rule, revived by Johnson and Malone, is a
problem to Sheffield because he says he has sensitive skin.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, Sheffield complained that management has failed
to address the grooming issue in a meeting with players. He said,
``Everything's about respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Right now, it sounds more like it's about a guy with a bad
shoulder and a worse spring training batting average taking it out
on a small target.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary's a guy who speaks his mind, what's on it at any
particular time,'' said Dombrowski, Sheffield's former GM. ``He can
hit, though.''
</P>
<P>
   He can, anyway, if his head and heart are in it.
</P>
<P>
   As of Tuesday, he was saying things like, ``I'm not going to
play unless I'm 100 percent (healthy),'' which hardly rings with
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   At 30, he's a player whose greatest seasons came with .500-range
teams in San Diego (1992) and Florida (1996).
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, with a World Series in their plans, need a big year
from Sheffield. They need a hitter who'll carry them in those
inevitable stretches when nothing else goes right. They need a new
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   But the way things are going with Sheffield, what they've got is
another reason to regret trading away the Piazza they had. &QL;

SLUM-LAW _ A law designed to root out slumlords, one of the
toughest in the nation, passed the Arizona Legislature on Tuesday
and is on its way to Gov. Jane Hull, who is expected to sign it.
The legislation requires property owners or agents to register with
the county assessors' offices, increases penalties for landlords
who don't clean up their property, and gives cities and counties
new powers against owners of property used for criminal activity.

RENO TO ANNOUNCE OPPOSITION TO RENEWAL OF INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to change description of Alexis Herman, in 10th graf, from

 By DAVID JOHNSTON and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno has decided to announce
at a Senate hearing on Wednesday that the independent counsel
statute is ``structurally flawed'' and should be abandoned, a
striking reversal from her past embrace of the 21-year old
Watergate-era reform law, government officials said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After much reflection, we have decided reluctantly to oppose
reauthorization of the act,'' said a final draft of written
testimony that Reno had prepared to deliver at a Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   During her six years as attorney general, Reno's position on the
law has hardened as she tried to carry out the statute, and she has
come to view it as rigid, unwieldy and unfair, law enforcement
officials said. In a more personal sense, Reno's shift on the law
illuminates a rite of passage for the Miami prosecutor who was
tossed with little preparation into the brutal combat over politics
and law in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Reno had often watched in frustration and
anger at what she viewed as serious prosecutorial abuses committed
during inquiries led by several independent counsels, including
Kenneth Starr, and had concluded that some of these investigations
had spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other single issue, the debate over independent
counsels has defined Reno's tenure at the Justice Department. The
law requires Reno to refer cases to outside counsels, chosen by a
three-judge panel, whenever there are specific and credible charges
of criminal wrongdoing against any one of about two dozen top
officials in the executive branch of government, including the
president and vice president.
</P>
<P>
   At first, some of Reno's aides hoped the law might work as it
was designed to keep the Justice Department out of political
controversies. Instead, the aides said the law has had the opposite
effect, repeatedly plunging Reno into raw partisan battles that
left her deeply scarred and undercut her image of integrity. She
has been especially distressed at some of the tactics with which
Starr has pursued his investigation of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was just a constant frustration on her part as
she tried to apply the statute, which she came to view as nothing
more than a rigid set of rules that sometimes defied common
prosecutorial sense,'' said one former Justice Department official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``That frustration was
compounded by the fact that some of the special prosecutors that
were appointed ended up taking a very simple, narrow issue and
turned it into a long, drawn-out investigation that often seemed to
stray from the original mandate.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for the first time, Reno will publicly express her
dissatisfaction with the law, echoing themes voiced two weeks ago
by her deputy, Eric H. Holder Jr. He announced at a House hearing
that the Justice Department was opposed to renewing the statute
when it expires on June 30. Holder said that cases now referred to
independent counsels could be handled by career prosecutors at the
Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In applying the statute, which gives the attorney general the
sole authority to decide whether an independent counsel should be
appointed, Reno has found herself buffeted between Republicans in
Congress and Democrats in the Clinton administration. Republicans
hammered her for what they viewed as bias in her refusal to refer
to an independent counsel the swirl of campaign finance issues that
arose from the 1996 Clinton re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats also expressed unhappiness and frustration with
Reno. They complained that she timidly acquiesced to Republican
demands when she sought appointments of independent counsels to
investigate Cabinet officers like Mike Espy, the former agriculture
secretary; Henry Cisneros, the former housing secretary; Alexis
Herman, the labor secretary; Bruce Babbit, the interior secretary,
and Ron Brown, the commerce secretary who died in a plane crash in
Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Reno endorsed the law. When she testified before the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee in May 1993, she strongly
urged Congress to renew the legislation. She said that it was
preferable for disinterested, outside prosecutors, free from the
taint of politics, to conduct investigations of high-level
administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there are legitimate concerns about the costs and
burdens associated with the act, I have concluded that these are
far, far outweighed by the need for the act and the public
confidence it fosters,'' Reno testified.
</P>
<P>
   Reno quickly discovered that the law provided little respite
from political controversy. In July 1994, one day after President
Clinton signed the bill reauthorizing the law, Reno asked the
appointing panel of three appellate judges to reinstate Robert B.
Fiske Jr., who had been selected by Reno as chief Whitewater
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Aides at the time said Reno was surprised and dismayed when the
three-judge panel dumped Fiske and instead appointed Starr. ``She
thought a good deal of Fiske,'' the former Justice Department
official said. ``There was no question that in our mind Fiske was
independent, and we did not think it was necessary for Starr to be
appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   A month after Starr took over the Whitewater inquiry, the panel
named Donald C. Smaltz to investigate Espy. Reno's decision to seek
an independent counsel in that case was a highly technical one
because there was no evidence that Espy had performed any favors
for the gifts he was accused of accepting from companies regulated
by the Agriculture Department, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and her aides assumed that Smaltz's inquiry would be
concluded in a matter of months. But Smaltz built up a large
prosecutorial office and, in August 1997, his prosecutors charged
Espy in a 39-count indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was deeply displeased by Smaltz's tactics, the officials
said, concluding that no career federal prosecutor would have ever
subjected Espy to such scrutiny. In December 1998, four years after
Smaltz's appointment, a jury acquitted Espy of all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Reno became especially frustrated with Starr's tactics as the
Lewinsky investigation progressed. Reno, and several senior Justice
Department lawyers, the officials said, became troubled by what
they viewed as possible violations of Justice Department guidelines
by Starr's prosecutors, from his decision to require Secret Service
agents to testify before a grand jury to allegations of leaks of
grand jury material to reporters. She has now decided to
investigate those tactics.

LOS ANGELES TENTATIVELY AWARDED AN NFL TEAM
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Texas)   (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Los Angeles was awarded the National Football League's
32nd franchise by an overwhelming margin Tuesday at the owners'
annual meeting. There were, however, several conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The league stipulated that a stadium site, financing and support
from the Los Angeles business community must be in place by Sept.
15. If not, Houston would receive the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium options include a refurbished Los Angeles Memorial
Coliseum or new stadiums in either in the city of Carson or in
Orange County. The decision also opened the door for various
ownership groups to surface in Los Angeles and bid for the new
team, which is projected to begin play in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The vote for Los Angeles was by 29-2. The Buffalo Bills and
Oakland Raiders reportedly voted against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, the league had an interesting dilemma,'' said
Jerry Richardson, the Carolina Panthers owner who is chairman of
the league's expansion committee. ``We have two attractive markets
in Houston and L.A. and one only one franchise. The way I see it,
we've tightened up the window.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the expansion committee will visit sites in Los Angeles
in the next three weeks and recommend to the league where a stadium
should be built.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are talking about the greater L.A. area, and that gives us
a window to go anywhere,'' Richardson said. ``But given the time
constraints, I just can't see any other sites being selected in
L.A. other than the Coliseum, Carson or, remotely, Orange County.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said he would be surprised if other groups in Los
Angeles did not surface that would like to buy the team.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear the league was not ready to grant the franchise to
the two groups in Los Angeles who have long been in the race and
who came here hoping that one of them would leave with the team.
Businessmen Ed Roski and Eli Broad head one group that wants the
team to play in the Coliseum and Hollywood mogul Michael Ovitz
wants the team and have it play in Carson. The owners agreed that
too many questions _ stadium financing, parking and ancillary
development _ remained to award the franchise Tuesday to either
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see a very viable stadium proposal; we haven't seen
that yet,'' said Pat Bowlen, the Denver Broncos' owner.

<P>
   ``If L.A. doesn't get its house in order, this franchise is
Houston's,'' said Dan Rooney, the Pittsburgh Steelers' owner.
</P>
<P>
   When Rooney was asked if the owners were concerned that Al
Davis, the Raiders owner, might sue as he has threatened because he
believes he still owns rights to the Los Angeles market, Rooney
answered, ``It's not a factor as far as we're concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston businessman Bob McNair has a strong bid with stadium
proposals in place in Houston, but the league wants to pursue Los
Angeles first because of the size of the market and because ``it is
the entertainment capital of the U.S. and maybe the world.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair was gracious in accepting the delay, adding: ``We feel we
have a deadline we can work with and something to hope for. It's
something we can deal with. We look forward to the opportunity of
going forward and seeing what the ultimate outcome will be.''
</P>
<P>
   The meetings continue Wednesday to vote on the sale of the
Washington Redskins and on the return of instant replay for the
1999 season.

   In other action Tuesday, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced
that Eddie DeBartolo, the San Francisco 49ers' owner who was
suspended last year for gambling ties and for his felony plea as a
result of them, has been fined $1 million and suspended through the
1999 season. DeBartolo can resume control of the 49ers in February
2000, Tagliabue said, if DeBartolo complies with an order he
signed. It says he will not conduct himself in ways detrimental to
the league. If he does, he will fined an additional $4 million,
Tagliabue said.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue said there was strong sentiment among the owners to
keep the Thanksgiving Day games in Detroit and Dallas. He said
several franchises wanted the game in their cities to build their
own tradition on that day, but that most said the games should stay
in Detroit and Dallas.

$1.2 BILLION BILL AT COKE RAISES EYEBROWS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1998, a grim year for the Coca-Cola Co., one bright spot was
the United States, where case volume sales rose a healthy 6
percent. But that appears to have come at a high price.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report, distributed last week, Coca-Cola disclosed
that it spent more than $1.2 billion on ``direct support for
certain marketing activities'' for its largest bottler, Coca-Cola
Enterprises, which handles the bulk of Coca-Cola's volume in the
United States in addition to sales in several countries in Western
Europe. Coca-Cola controls about 42 percent of Coca-Cola
Enterprises, which was spun off as a separate, publicly traded
company in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The expenditure, nearly twice what Coca-Cola spent on the
bottler the year before, included $899 million for marketing and
$324 million for vending machines and other equipment. It far
outstripped the $640 million spent last year for marketing at all
other bottlers in which the company holds equity stakes, the report
noted.
</P>
<P>
   The amount takes on added significance when compared with
Coca-Cola Enterprises earnings for 1998: just $141 million, on
revenue of $13.4 billion. Operating income was $869 million, but
that dwindled rapidly once the company paid $701 million in
interest and $56 million in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   James S. Chanos, who runs Kynikos Associates, a money management
fund in New York, said the marketing expenses that Coca-Cola has
absorbed for Coca-Cola Enterprises were ``an increasingly important
part of the revenue for C.C.E.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The company's cash flow over the last two years, without these
payments from the parent, would have declined,'' said Chanos, whose
company is a ``short seller,'' betting that the share price of
Coca-Cola Enterprises will decline.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing costs were keenly felt over at the Coca-Cola Co.,
which turned in one of its most lackluster performances in years in
1998. With volume flat or declining in Russia, Japan, South Africa,
Germany, Brazil and other key markets, the company's earnings fell
15 percent, from $4.1 billion in 1997 to $3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketing was up 49 percent, and the infrastructure
spending was up 71 percent,'' said Caroline Levy, a beverage
analyst for Schroder &AMP; Co., who removed Coca-Cola Enterprises from
her recommended list last fall and has a neutral rating on
Coca-Cola. ``If they hadn't spent that money, their earnings would
not have been as badly hit last year.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Coca-Cola, Mark Preisinger, played down the
marketing expense, saying that the territory covered by the bottler
grew with acquisitions made during 1998. ``There is nothing new
here except that there is substantially greater territory within
C.C.E.,'' Preisinger said, adding that marketing expenses are
determined in the early part of every year. ``This is money we
contribute to drive the business.''
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look shows that the marketing expenses rose 25
percent even when the bottlers acquired during 1998 are figured in,
and amount to 24.9 cents a case, up from 20 cents in 1997.
Coca-Cola Enterprises bottled about 3.6 billion cases of soft
drinks last year, up from 3.4 billion in 1997. Over all, in the
United States, volume grew to 4.47 billion cases. Worldwide, 15.8
billion cases were sold last year, a increase of 900 million cases
over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in marketing spending has much to do with a long
price war between Coca-Cola and its big rival, Pepsico, in
supermarkets, where prices have been abnormally low for more than
two years in many areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing takes many forms at Coca-Cola, ranging from discount
coupons handed out in local supermarkets to sponsorship of
community events to more sophisticated tie-ins with Coke products
like the Coke card. The company distributed more than 40 million of
the cards last spring and summer, offering discounts at bowling
centers, amusement parks and other entertainment sites with the
purchase of a Coca-Cola, all to drive sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly something that benefits the system,'' said
Laura Asman, a spokeswoman for Coca-Cola Enterprises. ``The direct
support is a natural function of the franchise system and the
Coca-Cola Co. sharing in the investment in our system.''
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola executives have said they plan to reduce spending on
marketing this year, said Andrew M. Conway, an analyst for Morgan
Stanley. ``That's not negative for CCE if pricing improves in
supermarkets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises is one of 11 major bottlers for Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola's chief financial officer, James E. Chestnut, was named
to the Coca-Cola Enterprises board last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of the sluggish sales of Coke products around
the world, Coca-Cola's equity income from all bottlers it has made
investments in fell markedly last year. In 1997, the company
reported $155 million from such bottlers, which account for more
than half of Coca-Cola's volume around the world. But last year,
equity income plummeted to $32 million, a decrease of 79 percent.

FOR MEXICO, AN ECONOMY WITH GUSTO: SHARES AND THE PESO AVOID BRAZIL
STIGMA
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The menu was eggs with hot chili sauce, and the
mood had a certain zing as well. Top executives from foreign
companies had breakfast with President Ernesto Zedillo on Tuesday
and told him that they planned to spend $10 billion this year on
factories and other projects in Mexico, matching last year's direct
foreign investment despite continuing uncertainties about Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   A chipper speech by Zedillo and the satisfied applause of his
audience showed how far Mexico had come in its efforts to separate
itself in international investors' minds from other, more troubled
Latin countries since economic crisis shook much of the region last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners' preference for Mexico has been felt in the stock and
currency markets as well as in longer-term investments. Recently,
the demand for pesos from investors has lifted Mexico's currency to
levels not seen since before the global economy began to waver last
year.
</P>
<P>
   As financial chaos ruled in Ecuador, the Mexican peso rose
Tuesday to its highest level in seven months, settling at 9.665 to
the dollar. The stock market here also continued to climb, with the
benchmark index rising 120.49 points, or 2.53 percent, to 4,890.39.
The index has gained 48 percent since Brazil's currency, the real,
suffered a steep devaluation in January, setting off a new round of
worries about Latin American markets.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has attracted investors' attention because of the
combination of disciplined fiscal policies enforced by Zedillo, a
Yale-trained economist, and close ties to the thriving U.S.
economy, which absorbed more than four-fifths of Mexico's exports
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is a clear safe haven'' for stock market investors,
said Michael Gavin, director of Latin American research at Warburg
Dillon Read. ``Most investors know that Mexico is no longer an
oil-based economy. It is clearly an economy linked to the United
States,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Herminio Blanco, the commerce minister, said that in the five
years since the North American Free Trade Agreement went into
effect, Mexico had received $57 billion for long-term projects,
becoming second only to China among developing countries in terms
of this kind of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Bernd Leissner, president of Volkswagen de Mexico, said the
company planned to increase production this year by 55 percent
compared with 1997 levels and to raise exports by 80 percent. The
Volkswagen A.G. unit has invested $1 billion in its plants in the
state of Puebla to build the new Beetle.
</P>
<P>
   Leissner said that the North American trade pact and a similar
one that Mexico is negotiating with Europe have made auto exports
much easier, allowing Volkswagen's Mexican operation to ``join the
major leagues of our industry worldwide.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, when oil prices plummeted and world markets wobbled,
Zedillo made three pre-emptive budget cuts to keep the deficit at a
maximum of 1.25 percent, as he had promised. In Brazil, the Latin
American country with which Mexico is most frequently compared,
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has battled a fractious
Congress and moved more slowly on fiscal reform.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo got a much warmer reception from foreign executives on
Tuesday than he did from Mexican industry leaders he met with on
Thursday. Mexican businesses remain hampered by a lack of credit
and are wrestling with declining export sales because of the peso's
strength.
</P>
<P>
   In an unscheduled proposal, which put Zedillo uncomfortably on
the spot, Eugenio Clariond Reyes Retana, president of the Mexican
Businessmen's Council, urged him to convert to a dollar-based
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, though, made it clear that he had no plans to abandon
his policy of a virtually free-floating peso.

SEC CONSIDERS TIGHTENING RULES ON COMPANY DISCLOSURES
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Concerned that some investors may be getting key stock
information before the rest of the market, federal securities
regulators are considering tightening disclosure rules so that
companies will be forced to announce news to all investors at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   Harvey J. Goldschmid, general counsel at the Securities and
Exchange Commission, said Tuesday that commission lawyers were
reviewing situations in which companies might have given
information to certain analysts and investors before it was
available to the public. Regulators are worried that some investors
have been able to profit by getting the information first, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The regulators' review, which is expected to take eight or nine
months, could result in new disclosure rules for public companies.
The commission may require, for example, that companies issue news
releases with any significant new information that they plan to
tell analysts or certain investors at invitation-only meetings or
during conference calls that are not open to the public, Goldschmid
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission's lawyers are proceeding carefully, he said,
because they do not want any new rule to reduce the amount of
information that companies are now willing to provide to analysts
and the public. ``That would not be healthy,'' Goldschmid said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent speeches, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt has criticized
companies for selectively disclosing key information to certain
investors. Levitt has pointed out, for example, how some corporate
executives often call their favorite stock analysts to discuss
earnings results before the numbers are released to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies try to disclose new information to all investors
at the same time. But sometimes, it is not immediately clear how
significant the new information is.
</P>
<P>
   In January, for example, the stock price of the General Motors
Corp. rose the same day that it told analysts at an invitation-only
meeting about its plans to increase the production of pickups and
sport utilities, which are among the company's most profitable
products. But Mark Tanner, a company spokesman, said the same
information could have been derived from detailed production
schedules that the company had already distributed to the public.
``It was only highlighted at the meeting with analysts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tanner said General Motors' policy was to disclose news to the
entire market at once. ``We're very judicious about it,'' he said.

TOUGH ANTI-SLUMLORD LEGISLATION APPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 and WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ A law designed to root out slumlords, along with the
blight and crime they bring to neighborhoods, passed the
Legislature on Tuesday and is on its way to Gov. Jane Hull, who is
expected to sign it.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed its last hurdle when the House approved it on a
42-13 vote, with five not voting.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation requires property owners or agents to register
with the county assessors' offices, increases penalties for
landlords who don't clean up their property, and gives cities and
counties new powers against owners of property used for criminal
activity.
</P>
<P>
   It makes Arizona's anti-slumlord law one of the toughest in the
nation, but it might be an idle threat if cities and counties don't
have the political will to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've closed some of the loopholes slumlords had to bypass
city ordinances and prosecution,'' said Rep. Ken Cheuvront, the
central Phoenix Democrat who helped work the bill through a
minefield of opposition. ``It's up to the cities to utilize this
statute and up to the neighbors to put forth the pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighborhood activists say cities, towns or counties must
establish a partnership with law enforcement and back up the new
law with money budgeted to hire an adequate number of inspectors to
respond to neighbors' complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for cities and counties to step up to the plate and
do their share, including me,'' said Maricopa County Attorney Rick
Romley, who has committed time and money to help neighbors salvage
their streets and property values.
</P>
<P>
   The law strengthens existing property codes in Phoenix, Glendale
and Tempe, and it's expected to encourage the adoption of codes in
other cities, including Mesa, where council members plan to ask
voters to approve a housing maintenance code in the March 2000
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If voluntary compliance doesn't happen,'' Romley said, ``we
have to make sure there's a place for neighbors to reach out to.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was created and championed by Romley; Phoenix City
Councilman Phil Gordon; a Slumlord Task Force of county and federal
prosecutors, police, and housing inspectors; several Republican and
Democratic lawmakers; and a well-organized group of neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But it also got a boost from an unlikely source: Sherwin
Seyrafi, who faces city, county and federal charges stemming from
his substandard rentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherwin Seyrafi turned out to be the best thing we had,''
Romley said, laughing. ``He put a face in the newspaper, on the TV
cameras, of who we were talking about when we mentioned the owners
of these slum properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had been some poor old guy who couldn't really afford to
fix up a place, that would have been different. But Seyrafi could
have fixed them up, and refused to. His expensive suits, arrogant
attitude . . . that got to people.''
</P>
<P>
   It may have been Seyrafi's public legal battles that convinced
the Arizona Multihousing Association to stop years of lobbying
against the neighbors and their demands that something be done
about slumlords and the crime their properties breed. The group not
only stopped fighting but began helping with the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not going to walk away since the law is done,''
association spokesman Wayne Kaplan said. ``We hope this is the
beginning of a journey of cooperation with cities, neighborhoods
and homeowners to deal with issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley and others note that long before there was Seyrafi, long
before the Slumlord Task Force, there were neighborhood activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in the last year was they (the politicians) saw
it,'' said Donna Neill, who founded a statewide neighborhood
association and fought for years to bring politicians into her
neighborhood to see the problems firsthand. ``It was in the
newspaper, it was on TV. It came right in front of them. They had
to deal with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have to see what happens. We have to protect it and
amend it and make it stronger. We must see the cities turn the
state law into proper regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Alma Williams, an east Phoenix neighborhood leader,
stood in Karl Baker's front yard looking at the place on the other
side of Baker's chain-link fence where sewage once pooled and
leaked onto his property. The small, shabby apartment building next
door once was owned by Seyrafi.
</P>
<P>
   It has a new owner, but before the law passed, the new owner
didn't have to worry about citations the city wrote to Seyrafi. If
slum properties weren't cleaned up by a new owner, city inspectors
were forced to open a new case, a new investigation and write new
citations to defend in court each time the property changed hands,
which happens often with substandard properties.
</P>
<P>
   But the new law changes that.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this law works, if the owner sells it _ then violations are
supposed to follow the property,'' Williams said. ``It's one of the
biggest hopes we have.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams is cautious about the new slumlord law, worried
that it could be undermined or circumvented by politicians
unwilling to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a lot of tools in the law, but do you have
enforcement?'' she asked. Without relentless and expensive
enforcement, slums will persist, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell neighborhood leaders: Don't listen to what politicians
are telling you; follow the money,'' she said.

ADVERTISING: AIDS, THE WAR THAT ISN'T OVER, GAINS SOME NEW
MARKETING GENERALS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A giant agency company is enlisting in the fight
against AIDS to battle not fear or ignorance but a perception that
the fight is finished.
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. in New York is joining the American
Foundation for AIDS Research, known as Amfar, in what is intended
to be a comprehensive, multimedia communications program. The goal
is to counter a growing belief that AIDS is no longer as much a
menace to public health as it seemed before the introduction of
treatments like protease inhibitor drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very simply, we want to attack this complacency issue,'' said
Edward H. Vick, chief operating officer at Y.&AMP; R., because despite
recent progress, ``AIDS is still a problem _ and could be a bigger
one.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Vick said, ``we want to raise the level of
visibility for Amfar'' and raise donations, now at $18 million to
$22 million a year, by focusing on Amfar's support of clinical and
biomedical research as well as AIDS prevention. So the campaign
carries this new theme: ``We've bought time. More research will buy
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick joined the Amfar board at the behest of a member, Alan D.
Schwartz, who is also on the board of Y.&AMP; R.; Schwartz is executive
vice president and senior managing director at the Bear Stearns
Cos. Employee volunteers from four units of Y.&AMP; R. are
collaborating on the pro bono campaign, contributing advertising,
direct marketing, corporate identity and public relations work that
ranges from low-key commercials to a distinctive redesigned logo
that adds the words ``AIDS research'' under the Amfar acronym.
</P>
<P>
   Those contributions from Y.&AMP; R. Advertising, Wunderman Cato
Johnson, Landor Associates and Burson-Marsteller will be
supplemented by outdoor and transit posters from Kenneth Cole
Productions in New York, the fashion retailer, which has been
donating ads to Amfar as part of its long-running cause-related
marketing efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Television and radio networks, magazines and outdoor advertising
companies have agreed to donate more than $2 million worth of
commercial time and ad space for the campaign. But Y.&AMP; R. and Amfar
are seeking additional commitments worth at least $3 million to
further expand the campaign's reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This epidemic is not going away any time soon,'' said Jerome
J. Radwin, executive vice president and chief executive at Amfar in
New York, ``so we needed to sustain a long-term communication
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed said that's exactly what he can bring to the table,'' he
added, ``and that has made an enormous difference to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the campaign, the Y.&AMP; R. volunteers decided that Amfar ought
to be treated as a brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little odd to think of an organization like that,''
said one volunteer, Peter C. Diamond, vice president and account
director at Young &AMP; Rubicam New York, a unit of Y.&AMP; R. Advertising.
</P>
<P>
   But the branding approach was chosen because the idea is to
``make sure Amfar stands for something,'' he added, and because
previous pro bono campaigns ``lacked a cohesive, unified image.''
</P>
<P>
   Radwin described the campaign's premise as ``a very, very
difficult balancing act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The success we've had with biomedical research gives us every
reason to believe that it will provide solutions,'' he said, ``but
we have to get people to understand we're not there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   So, a print advertisement, showing a discarded, tattered AIDS
ribbon, carries the headline ``Apparently, the AIDS virus is so
smart it can convince people that it's no longer a threat.'' And
the TV commercials talk about the future for people who have the
virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   One spot declares that an HIV-positive child can ``look forward
to new sneakers, summer vacations, a later bedtime.'' Another spot
asserts that an HIV-positive mother can ``look forward to seeing
first steps, going to school plays, sharing the big popcorn at the
movies.''
</P>
<P>
   In both instances, those lists of upbeat expectations end with
the phrase ``and eventually, getting AIDS.'' That's when the new
theme appears on screen.
</P>
<P>
   The media that have agreed so far to donate time and space are
the broadcast networks ABC and CBS; the cable channel Lifetime; CBS
radio; TDI, the outdoor advertising company, and Entertainment
Weekly, Esquire, People and Sports Illustrated magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Other nonprofit organizations that have benefited from pro bono
campaigns by Y.&AMP; R. include UNCF/The College Fund, formerly the
United Negro College Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was worried about becoming involved with a
cause like the fight against AIDS, which many Americans still
stigmatize, Vick replied: ``I'm not concerned about anybody's
reaction. It could be worse; you could represent a political
candidate.''

SHEFFIELD'S MOOD DOESN'T IMPROVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Gary Sheffield is frustrated. His right
shoulder hurts, he's struggling with his move from right to left
field and he's unhappy with the way the Dodgers' reinstituted the
facial hair policy.
</P>
<P>
   The team hoped the two days off for family business would help
Sheffield, but on Tuesday, he was still unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to play if I'm not 100 percent,'' said
Sheffield, who then talked about retiring. ``I always feel like
that when I get injured. Is it worth it to take your body through
what I have to take my body through just to get on the baseball
field? Everybody can look at it and say it's a lot of money, but
everything in life isn't about dollars and cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The thought of retirement) comes and goes, but it's one of
those things that until I get healthy it's going to stay on my
mind, and you never know. You might react to certain things. I
guess I have to leave an open mind both ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he's scaling back Sheffield's
work until the shoulder feels better. Sheffield, in the second year
of a six-year, $61 million contract, isn't expected to play for the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Normally a right fielder, Sheffield has played five games in
left field this spring. He's had limited chances and made one
error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't feel like I was accomplishing anything out
there,'' Sheffield said. ``I went two games without getting a ball
hit to me so I didn't learn anything that day. I played well one
day, so I have to build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also concerned about the facial hair policy. Last year
the team relaxed the rules but decided to reinstate them during the
offseason. Team officials talked to players individually, but
Sheffield would like them to address the players as a group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think out of respect, out of playing 11 years, they will
eventually address the team about the issue,'' Sheffield said.
``One-on-one they have, but I feel if you're going to address it,
sometimes it's better to address the team....
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to have facial hair and the rest of the guys
won't. I'm going to abide by the rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said Sheffield
hasn't contacted them about his issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to Gary a lot lately and he hasn't expressed
anything to Davey or I,'' Malone said. ``His only concern is that
his shoulder is not feeling well and he's a little uncomfortable in
left field. Other than that, there's no other issues that I'm aware
of.''
</P>
<P>
   Osuna setback: The Dodgers were taking it slow with right-handed
reliever Antonio Osuna's comeback from elbow surgery, but it hasn't
helped.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna had his bullpen outing cut short Tuesday and was
complaining about elbow soreness. Johnson was hoping to have Osuna
available for opening day, but that's looking less and less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he hoped to use the one-time Dodgers closer in a
spring game late in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm usually optimistic about things, but I don't know where
we're at,'' Johnson said. ``I feel discouraged about things and I
know so does he.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster cuts: The first large chunk of roster cuts were announced
Tuesday without surprise. The Dodgers optioned outfielder Hiram
Bocachica and pitchers Arnold Gooch, Mike Judd, Steve Montgomery
and Ricky Stone to Triple-A Albuquerque, pitchers Eric Gagne and
Luke Prokopec were optioned to Double-A San Antonio and pitcher
Randy Galvez was optioned to Single-A San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also reassigned pitchers Dan Hubbs, Matt Herges,
Matt Jarvis and Gavin Osteen, infielders Pete Rose Jr. and Jason
Thompson and catcher Hector Ortiz to their minor-league camp.

TOP-LEVEL EXECUTIVE SHIFT MADE AS TWA CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Trans World Airlines said Tuesday that William F. Compton, the
carrier's president, will take over as chief executive in May,
succeeding Gerald L. Gitner, who will remain as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes at a time when TWA has been losing money while
the industry has had record profits for four consecutive years. TWA
lost $120.5 million last year on top of a $110.8 million loss in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   It also comes amid bitter contract negotiations with the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
which represents about 16,000 of TWA's 22,000 employees. In
December, the union called on both Gitner and Compton to resign,
citing their inability to turn the airline around.
</P>
<P>
   Gitner, who is 53, is a longtime airline industry executive who
joined the TWA board of directors in 1993 and became chairman and
chief executive in early 1997. He said in an interview Tuesday that
the change was his idea. As chairman, he said that he would focus
on managing TWA's fleet and finances, and negotiating partnerships
with other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are in place,'' he said, referring to the airline's
stronger balance sheet, better on-time performance and a recent
order for 125 new jets. ``I felt it was time for me to address more
of the longer-term strategic issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Compton, 51, joined TWA in 1968 and spent most of his career
there as a pilot before being named president 15 months ago.
Between 1991 and 1995, he led the local chapter of the Air Line
Pilots Association, which represents TWA's pilots.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Tom Brown, the union's newly elected leader, said:
``The TWA pilots are not satisfied with the current operational and
financial performance of our airline. We welcome any changes that
promise improvement to the status quo.''  &QL;
</P>

   The International Association of Machinists could not be reached

REFEREE CALLS LEWIS WINNER
</HEADLINE>
  (See related BOX-BERKOW-COLUMN) 
 (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Arthur Mercante Jr., the referee in Saturday's
controversial draw between Lennox Lewis and Evander Holyfield, said
Tuesday that he felt Lewis was the clear victor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took the fight to Evander,'' Mercante said of the 12-round
fight at Madison Square Garden. ``If I were scoring, I'd have given
Holyfield three rounds. Lewis wanted it so bad. And Evander, he
really wasn't focused and into the fight. His mind looked like it
was somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should go back to the old days and let the referee
score the fight. If they need his card, they should use it.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges' decision in the heavyweight unification bout has
inflamed the boxing world and led Manhattan District Attorney
Robert M. Morgenthau to agree to a request by City Council Speaker
Peter Vallone on Tuesday to investigate the fight.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Athletic Commission launched an investigation
on Monday. Mercante will testify at a hearing to be held Thursday
by state Sen. Roy Goodman. A second hearing, by state Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer, is set for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a crime for the sport I've been around all my
life,'' said Mercante, whose father, Arthur Sr., is a legendary
referee.
</P>
<P>
   Mercante said Holyfield's best round was the third, the one in
which he predicted he would knock Lewis out. ``But then he laid off
and Lennox took it right to him,'' Mercante said. ``I think Lennox
could have done more. He'd throw three or four punches, then tie
up, and I'd have to say, `Come on, guys, let's go.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Larry O'Connell, one of the three judges, scored the fight a
115-115 draw, but was quoted this week as saying that he was wrong.
Eugenia Williams, who scored the bout, 115-113, for Holyfield, has
vigorously defended her scoring. The third judge, Stanley
Christoudoulou, voted for Lewis, 116-113.
</P>
<P>
   Mercante said his father kept copious notes of the fight from
his seat at the Garden and scored the fight for Lewis, 9 rounds to
3.
</P>
<P>
   Also at the fight was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a fight fan who
has sponsored legislation to regulate boxing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said Tuesday that Lonnie Ali, the wife of Muhammad Ali,
called to tell him that ``Muhammad is indignant and wants me to do
something about it because it was a disgrace to boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Congress passed legislation co-authored by
McCain to strengthen health and safety measures for boxers.
</P>
<P>
   He has also reintroduced a bill, the Muhammad Ali Boxing Reform
Act, to reform the sanctioning organizations, protect boxers from
exploitation by promoters and require financial disclosure by the
organizations and promoters. An identical bill passed the Senate
last year but died in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday's fiasco could help it pass the House,'' McCain said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   McCain, who is seeking the Republican presidential nomination in
2000, said he might amend the Ali Act to prohibit sanctioning
organizations from choosing judges. The World Boxing Council,
International Boxing Federation and World Boxing Association did so
for the Holyfield-Lewis fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judges being selected by the alphabet soup folks is not
acceptable,'' McCain said. ``It should be the state boxing
commissions who choose the best qualified people.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said the promoters should not pay the judges. The
Holyfield-Lewis judges were paid $5,150 each, with the money coming
from Don King, the promoter, through the sanctioning bodies.
``Judges should be completely independent,'' he said. ``The money
should could come out of the gate, not the promoter.''
</P>
<P>
   One provision of McCain's bill would limit options between
boxers and promoters to one year. If the law were in place, he
said, it might prevent King, Holyfield's promoter, from a role in
the expected rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Mercante said that after the fight, Panos Eliades, Lewis'
promoter, screamed from ringside at the New York state Athletic
Commission members about the judges. ``I had to intervene,''
Mercante said. ``I said, `The commission didn't appoint the judges,
the sanctioning bodies did.' ''

COURT WON'T PERMIT DELAY IN N.J. RACIAL PROFILING CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ A New Jersey appeals court refused Tuesday
night to give the administration of Gov. Christie Whitman more time
to appeal a judge's ruling in 1996 that state police tolerated a
``de facto policy of racial profiling'' on the southern half of the
New Jersey Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, the state attorney general, Peter Verniero, said
publicly for the first time that his office was considering
dropping the appeal, as civil rights lawyers, black ministers and
some Democrats have been demanding for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero said in an interview that his final decision on the
fate of the appeal awaits completion of the racial profiling aspect
of his office's broad investigation of a variety of state police
practices, including trooper discipline, promotion, training, and
the department's handling of complaints from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Verniero said after the ruling by a three-judge panel of the
appellate division of New Jersey Superior Court that he hoped to
complete the review into racial profiling as quickly as possible
because, he said, he wants to base a final decision on the appeal
on as much information as possible. ``We may withdraw from the case
depending on what the review shows,'' he said. ``We do have
concerns about these issues. We've always acted appropriately. I
have been second to no one in wanting to get to the bottom of these
allegations because they trouble me greatly as chief law
enforcement officer of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Verniero's office has spent several months preparing its appeal
of the 1996 ruling. In it, Judge Robert Francis of the state
Superior Court found that a disproportionate number of black
drivers on the southern half of the turnpike were being pulled over
by troopers searching for narcotics. Although he did not find that
state police had a formal policy of profiling, he said the
department's superiors had tolerated what amounted to a policy of
racial discrimination through indifference.
</P>
<P>
   Arguments on the state's appeal have been scheduled for April
28.
</P>
<P>
   On March 5, Verniero's office asked the court for a four-month
delay in the hearing, contending that it needed additional time to
conclude its investigation. Critics of the Whitman administration,
including civil rights lawyers who pressed the case before Francis,
charged that Verniero was seeking the delay to avoid defending
state police on the eve of hearings by the Senate Judiciary
Committee into his nomination to the state Supreme Court. Those
hearings are scheduled for May 6.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also questioned the Whitman administration's objectivity
in conducting an investigation of profiling at the same time it was
denying the existence of the practice in its appeal of Francis'
decision.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling Tuesday night, the three-judge appeals court panel
refused to grant the four-month delay. The two-paragraph ruling
gave the attorney general's office an option of asking the court
that will hear the appeal to delay its decision until Verniero's
staff reaches a decision on whether to drop the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   William Buckman, a civil rights lawyer who helped assemble the
statistics that led to Francis' decision, praised the court for
rejecting the extension Verniero wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strips politics out of the process at least for the time
being,'' Buckman said.

HIS LAWYER SAYS DIALLO LIED ON REQUEST FOR POLITICAL ASYLUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Amadou Diallo, the Guinean immigrant who was killed
in a fusillade of police bullets last month, had applied for and
received political asylum under false pretenses, one of his
family's lawyers said Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Kyle B. Watters, said Diallo had claimed to be from
Mauritania on his application for asylum, and had said his parents
were killed in fighting there. The application had been approved
last year by an immigration judge, Watters said, but the
Immigration and Naturalization Service was appealing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Family members, friends and lawyers have said previously that
Diallo had a three-year work or study visa that was to expire next
month. Apparently, Diallo applied for asylum because he ``was
seeking to stay here on a long-term basis,'' Watters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he was from Mauritania and his parents had been killed
in fighting to buttress his claim that he had credible fear of
going back to his country,'' Watters said.
</P>
<P>
   The INS describes someone eligible for asylum as ``an alien in
the United States who is unable or unwilling to return to his or
her country of nationality because of a persecution or a
well-founded fear of persecution.'' There is no indication that
Diallo, who came from a well-educated and relatively well-off
Guinean family, feared persecution in Guinea, and Watters said he
did not believe Diallo had ever tried to apply for asylum as a
Guinean citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials say it is not uncommon for immigrants to
apply for asylum even though their main motivation for wanting to
settle here is economic.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, barely a dozen Mauritanians annually were
granted asylum by immigration service district directors and asylum
officers, one of several ways applicants can receive asylum. But in
1995, the figures took a sudden jump, with 275 Mauritanians
receiving asylum that year, and 407 the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Mauritania is a country of about 2 million people that has been
dominated by light-skinned Arabic-speaking Moors since shortly
after it attained independence from France in 1960. There is a
large black minority, but the country officially promotes itself as
an Arab republic. It has long been under attack by human rights
groups as one of the last bastions of slavery in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Watters said that the asylum information should have no effect
on the investigation into the shooting of Diallo, whose death has
become a cause celebre in the city and beyond. ``I don't think it
has any effect on whether these officers were justified,'' he said,
adding that he thought it would be ``offensive'' if the immigration
situation became an issue in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who fired at Diallo as he stood in the vestibule of
his apartment building knew nothing about his immigration status,
Watters said. Nor did he think the situation would have made Diallo
more fearful of the police. Diallo's asylum application was
fictitious, Watters said, ``but he was here legally'' because of
his temporary visa.

DODGERS HOPE BELTRE IS THE ANSWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ The Dodgers are doing everything they can to
take the pressure off Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Davey Johnson awarded him the third baseman's job, short
of Beltre booting every grounder from now until March 31. They
don't need him to be their offensive catalyst and, if actions speak
louder than dollars, consider this: General manager Kevin Malone
spent $124 million on free agents in the offseason but never
contemplated pursuing a third baseman because of his confidence in
Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have been rushed last season,'' Malone said. ``I was
sold on this guy's ability from when I saw him (last season). I've
been around enough quality, young players in Montreal to know this
guy was a keeper. He has the potential to be an All-Star.''
</P>
<P>
   Potential? That's baseball talk. However, Beltre's numbers from
last year speak of something else. In his first big-league action,
he hit .215 and made 13 errors in 74 games.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre _ who has four years of professional experience despite
being only 20 _ isn't naive enough to think his status as the No.1
third baseman is a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't prove it here,'' Beltre said of spring training. ``I
have to prove I can play in the big leagues. I have to prove I can
stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   On a club of veterans, some with reputations of being ornery
when players don't make the necessary plays, Beltre is a player
with undeniable tools and a calm demeanor. He's been that way since
playing on the rocky fields of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic,
where a quick glove and smart reflexes keeps you from getting
drilled in the teeth on a bad hop.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre impressed teammates in spring training with his fielding,
especially pitcher Kevin Brown. Brown went as far as to compliment
Beltre after Beltre made a nice bare-handed play on a slow roller
recently against the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   There were glimpses of his talent, although he didn't show the
form that made him a .305 hitter during his three-plus seasons in
the minor leagues. Worse, being called up to the majors as the
replacement for an injured Bobby Bonilla, he let his hitting affect
his fielding.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre said the Dodgers tweaked his batting stance last season
and everything else crumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``They changed my batting stance and that was the principal
thing I had trouble with,'' Beltre said. ``They told me to keep my
body up and close my feet. It didn't work. I think I had such a
tough time last year that if anything happens this year, I can
handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Just to make sure Beltre is comfortable, fellow Dominican Jose
Vizcaino has been tutoring him, helping prepare him for the ups and
downs of the major-league season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a (kid) so I've been telling him what to expect, that
he's got to be smart,'' Vizcaino said. ``He's a good kid and he
listens. It makes it easier for him because he has somebody
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have lots of somebodys this year. They've got
starting pitching (six to be exact) and they've got veteran hitting
(Gary Sheffield, Eric Karros, Raul Mondesi). They know what to
expect with the exception of the bullpen and third base.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre appears to be the solution at third. The only real
question about him is in what season will he become the magnificent
third baseman his talent says he should be. It's not supposed to
happen this season. All Johnson wants is solid play in the field
and a .250 average. On this team, with this lineup and this
pitching, that should be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted him to know that he has time,'' Johnson said. ``I
want him to get his timing down in the field and his timing down at
home plate. That's the key. Anything I can do to help him relax,
I'll do it. He's been fine, expressing his talents and relaxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre has his own expectations, citing confidence from his play
in the Dominican Winter League. Beltre hit .301 with 10 homers and
37 RBI and was named the league's most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hit .250,'' Beltre said. ``If I hit more than
20 homers and have more than 70 RBI and hit the ball hard, that
will be good.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Monique Viele was 6, she vowed to become a veterinarian
once she grew up, but that was before she discovered tennis, and
before the mechanism that packages tennis prodigies with
flavor-of-the-month precision discovered her.
</P>
<P>
   Now 14, she has become a disgruntled tennis prodigy whose
equally disgruntled parents, Rick and Bernadette, have vowed to sue
the WTA Tour if it persists in preventing their daughter from
turning professional and hanging out her shingle, and her star,
right now.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting any longer, the Vieles assert, could be hazardous to
Monique's dream of breaking through and breaking the records for
precocious overachieving set by predecessors like Martina Hingis
and Monica Seles. The predecessors got what the Viele family
considers an unconstitutional leg up on Monique because they were
allowed to ply their trade at 14 without intervention from the
powers-that-be. Instead of making a dream debut on Key Biscayne,
Fla., this week at the Lipton Championships, Viele, who is shopping
for a clothing contract, settled for an invitation to Nike's
on-site clinics and corporate suite.
</P>
<P>
   ``She feels extremely unfortunate that so many other girls
before her were able to turn pro, make history, and maybe break
records at 14, but she can't,'' said her mother.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Viele (pronounced VEEL-ee) isn't yet the champion of
anything more monumental than the 18's division of last summer's
Florida Open, her final event before turning her back on picayune
junior competition, hyperbole has already been heaped on her like
so much glitter. According to the portfolio compiled by her parents
and management team, she's a superstar who could be a supermodel, a
5-foot 9-inch, 125-pound prodigy for the millennium _ except that
she and her parents don't want to wait for the century to turn
before turning her talents loose.
</P>
<P>
   Viele's coach is Rick Macci, whose wife was the lawyer who
composed the family's original letter of challenge to the WTA.
Macci can't itemize Monique's talents without hyperventilating. He
is a veteran tutor of adolescents earmarked as future superstars
whose previous clients included Jennifer Capriati and Venus and
Serena Williams. But Macci swears Viele is the best yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brings more to the table than just great tennis: she does
it all, and she might be the most marketable American player in the
last 25 years,'' said Macci. ``She is the ultimate, total package,
a one-in-a-million can't-miss prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bart McGuire, a lawyer who served as legal adviser to the WTA's
age eligibility commission during the rule's development, is now
the tour's chief executive officer. McGuire said he had no stomach
for battling a 14-year-old in court, but he promised he would do
just that if the Vieles follow through on their threat to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rule we absolutely will defend if we have to,'' McGuire
said. ``It's extraordinary how many parents there are who say the
rule is great in concept, but that we ought to make an exception
for their child.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Vieles aren't convinced that the rule is designed to
protect their prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tragedy in all of this is that the best American to come
along in a long time can't play,'' said Bernadette Viele, who with
her husband publishes a stock market newsletter from their home in
Coral Springs, Fla. ``It's not like we want to go to the time and
expense of filing a lawsuit, but if no concessions are made by the
WTA by the U.S. Open, we will sue.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rule has weathered threats from Serena Williams and
Anna Kournikova, both of whom made a restricted entry to the tour
at 15, the only player to sue was Croatia's Mirjana Lucic. Her
unsuccessful challenge came last year in Sydney, Australia, where
she tried to play the doubles event alongside Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   The WTA says it consulted 91 experts, from physicians to
trainers to prodigies past and present, in the formation of the
extensive age eligibility legislation it adopted in 1995. The rule
phases teenagers into WTA competition gradually: it restricts
14-year-olds like Viele to four International Tennis Federation
events and prohibits them from playing main Tour or Slam
tournaments. The Vieles, like most proud parents, believe their
child is exempt from the pitfalls noted in a rule inextricably
linked to Jennifer Capriati, a former prodigy who went from
can't-miss kid at 14 to a troubled young woman three years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe they came up with the rule because of Jennifer, but
I don't think that what happened to Jennifer had anything to do
with tennis,'' Bernadette Viele said. ``It had to do with hanging
around with the wrong kind of people. If money is the issue, we're
willing to put whatever Monique wins in a trust until she's 18.
It's not about the money for us, it's about competing with the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Vieles embarked on their plan for Monique when Bernadette
sent a videotape of Monique to the International Management Group
when the prodigy was 9. That precipitated a visit to the IMG-owned
Bollettieri Sports Academy, where the renowned coach Nick
Bollettieri offered her a full scholarship; with IMG's help, the
Vieles transplanted themselves from Colorado to Florida when
Monique, who was born in West Covina, Calif., was 10. Both Monique
and her younger brother Gino are home schooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nick immediately said how great she was, that she was better
than Kournikova and better than Seles, and that her most marketable
attribute was her intelligence,'' said her mother. But the
relationship between Bollettieri and the Vieles soured when the
coach decided the parents were too demanding. ``The baggage that
came along with this girl was excessive,'' said Bollettieri. ``We
needed a van for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Something similar happened at Viele's next stop on the road to
stardom, the Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton, Fla. Like
Bollettieri, Chris Evert and her brother, John, were impressed by
Viele's talent and work ethic. John Evert was almost too impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her discipline and perseverance were admirable, but almost to
the extent that I worried about her overtraining,'' he said.
``Ultimately we had a difference in philosophy with them. What she
wanted from the academy would have compromised the integrity of the
program. They wanted her to have her own, private coach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vieles then accepted Macci's invitation to train with him,
and accepted his help in their challenge of the rule. Even though
IMG has encouraged McGuire to reconsider the restrictions on
14-year-olds, Stephanie Tolleson, a senior vice president at IMG,
maintained that the company has no role in the Viele's prospective
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we consider the eligibility rule a work in progress, if
there's a lawsuit, they will be suing independently of us,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Macci admits that the rule is only a temporary speed bump in
Monique Viele's tennis trajectory. ``Sure, when all is said and
done, she's going to be a champion anyway,'' he said. ``But it
would be nice to get in there and spar with the best now if she's
ready. If a kid shows genius-like capabilities at a young age, it
should be a parental decision. The rule is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But the WTA and its experts think otherwise. ``This rule goes
way beyond protecting a player from the seduction of money and
fame,'' said Jim Loehr, a sports psychologist and eligibility
commission member. ``We're also talking about preventing injuries.
All the data shows us that the longer we kind of delay the stardom,
the better the player's chances are of sustaining a successful
career. Knowing what we know, it would be irresponsible to allow
14-year-olds to just have at it.''

ANGELS HOPE GLAUS IS READY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. -- Troy Glaus already has shown he can talk the
talk. The UCLA product is as media savvy as any 22-year-old you'll
find in major league baseball. But the question the Angels want him
to answer this spring is can he walk the walk -- consistently hit
big-league pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Third base is an offensive position,'' Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``You can catch the ball any place. What I want to
see is for Troy to go through camp, and as the pitchers get better
and get in shape, he's got to continue to hit. He's shown he has
power (in the minors). We want to see it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus has had only one full season in professional baseball,
albeit a productive one. But it remains to be seen if that one year
-- which saw him play at three levels -- provided him with enough
experience to beat out veteran Dave Hollins for the starting job at
third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit .306 in Vancouver, which isn't too bad for a kid just
out of college,'' said Jeff Parker, the Angels director of player
development. ``I'd like to see him win that job, but that's up to
Terry. He still needs to develop, and sometimes guys can develop t
that level. I think he can do it. He's a special guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain individuals can handle it, and certain guys need time.
(Darin) Erstad didn't need time. I'm not saying Troy is going to be
like Erstad, but I hope he is. We're rooting for him to make the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus was promoted from triple-A Vancouver to the Angels last
July 30. He held his own defensively in the big leagues, but
struggled at the plate. He hit one homer and had 23 RBIs while
batting .218 in 165 at-bats. He also struck out 51 times -- or 31
percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, though, said he wouldn't trade that experience for the
world. He says it will help him the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned certain adjustments I needed to work on,'' he said.
``How to go out and prepare. I would have liked to have done
better, but through the struggles I learned what I had to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the off-season I dedicated myself to getting better and
being able to perform at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels drafted Glaus out of UCLA as the third overall pick
in 1997. He began his first professional season last year at
double-A Midland, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus played 50 games there, tearing up the Texas League by
hitting .309 with 19 homers and 51 RBIs, earning a promotion to
triple-A Vancouver on May 27. In Vancouver, Glaus hit .306 with 16
homers and 42 RBIs in 59 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Troy's got a lot of ability, especially offensively,'' said
Mitch Seoane, Glaus' triple-A coach at Vancouver last year who is
now a coach at single-A Cedar Rapids. ``But what I remember is when
he came up to us from double-A he read something, I think in USA
Today, that said the Angels were concerned about his defense. He
came to me the next day and asked for early work on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of drive. He's still young. I think he's going to
play in the big leagues, but if he has to play in triple-A (this
season) he'll go down with a good attitude. He knows he can play in
the big leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Seoane said he is confident Glaus will learn from his offensive
struggles with the Angels last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I never forget about him is he hit four home runs
for us in two days. Two to left, one to center and one to right.
But the first week he was with us, he struggled a bit. So he made
adjustments easily. It's pretty much a game of adjustments and he's
got that.''
</P>
<P>
   However, there are some things that are out of Glaus' control.
If Glaus is the starting third baseman, the Angels have to decide
what to do with Hollins.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, 32, will make $2.4 million in the final year of his
contract. He could serve as a utility player or DH, but the Angels
already have an extra outfielder for the DH spot, and an abundance
of players vying for the utility roles, including Todd Greene.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins was productive as the starting third baseman for the
Angels in 1997, when he hit .288 with 16 homers, 85 RBIs and 101
runs scored. Last season he struggled both offensively and
defensively, but was bothered by a sore shoulder that eventually
required surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you can't ignore is what he's done in the past,''
Collins said of Hollins. ``It's why he's making what he's making.
You look at what a Dave Hollins does for a team. He scores 100
runs, drives in 70 to 80 . . . he produces almost 200 runs per
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if he's healthy he can play third base. Last year I
believe his arm bothered him throwing and hitting more than he ever
let on.''

TURNING OIL RIGS INTO FISHING REEFS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH -- A state bill to turn oil rigs into fishing reefs
is in the works and could generate millions of dollars for wildlife
and fishing projects, American Sportfishing Association president
Mike Hayden says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that new reefs would improve the water ecosystem,
improve the habitat, the fishing and provide economic benefits,''
said Hayden, a former Kansas governor and former assistant
secretary at the Department of Interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``ASA believes that there is sufficient scientific evidence
demonstrating rigs-to-reefs is sound public policy. We recognize
that the cautious environmental community desires further
scientific studies to demonstrate that the program is good for
California.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 27 oil platforms between Point Arguello, near Lompoc,
and Huntington Beach. Some of the platforms are 890 feet tall and
in 740 feet of water. When the wells run dry, the oil company must
dismantle the platform. Four platforms already have been abandoned
and dismantled and the oil production from the other platforms is
expected to decline over the next several decades.
</P>
<P>
   United Anglers of Southern California, which recruited ASA in
this project, would like the platform's bases to be left alone,
creating an artificial reef made up of mounds of debris. The shells
would provide new habitat for sea cucumbers, prawns, crabs, mussel,
plumose, anemones and bat stars. Rockfish and perch feast on those
animals and would benefit by an expanded food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the proposal by UASC and ASA is that if it costs
the oil companies $100 million to remove a platform -- a figure
Hayden says is realistic for some of the smaller platforms -- the
companies could remove all but the platform base. The state and oil
companies would then split the savings from the project, with the
state money going to an independent commission that would designate
funds for wildlife, fishing and hunting projects.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden says if the estimated expense was $100 million and the
actual cost was $60 million, the newly formed commission and oil
companies would split the $40 million difference -- the platform
owner giving the commission $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and commercial fishing trawlers have
objected to the proposal. Trawlers say the reefs will ruin their
nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea is controversial, but we think it will benefit the
fish,'' UASC president Tom Raftican said. ``In the long run, it
would provide more fish for the trawlers and the sportsman.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the four platforms that have been dismantled, none of the
shell mounds has been removed. ASA conservation network director
Daniel Frumkes says the state's Lands Commission has an agreement
with the oil companies that those companies must return the sea
bottom to its natural state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't remove habitat,'' he said. ``At these shells, the
resources have yet to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden and Raftican both say all they are really interested in
is getting all sides to begin dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would provide fish habitat forever,'' Hayden said. ``But
it's clearly controversial, and all we want is discussion with
others. This is now the time to do it.''

SAMARANCH'S FUTURE RESTS WITH IOC VOTE ON EXPULSIONS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Utah, Arizona)   (dal) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ A vote to ratify the expulsion of six
delegates of the International Olympic Committee on Wednesday will
essentially be a referendum on Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch, the president of the badly tarnished IOC, has been
lobbying delegates to affirm the expulsions and has phoned
corporate sponsors, promising them that real change is on the
horizon. But any sweeping reforms appear impossible if the
committee cannot oust the six members accused of most seriously
violating the rules of propriety involving Salt Lake City's bid to
win the 2002 Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those who are clearly guilty are not thrown off, I would
have real concerns about the credibility of the IOC after that,''
said James Easton, a delegate from the United States, who has said
he may resign if the expulsions are not carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-member executive board has called for the expulsions of
Augustin Arroyo of Ecuador, Zein El Badim Ahmed Abdel Gadir of
Sudan, Jean-Claude Ganga of Congo Republic, Lamine Keita of Mali,
Sergio Santander Fantini of Chile and Paul Wallwork of Samoa.
</P>
<P>
   A two-thirds vote by the 91 attending IOC members (61 votes)
will be necessary to ratify the expulsions, which were proposed by
the executive board in January. A failure to carry out the
expulsions of any or all of the accused delegates would be seen as
a repudiation of Samaranch and could force him to resign before his
term ends in 2001, Olympic officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC also finds itself under heavy pressure from the outside
to reform itself quickly, particularly from sponsors who spend $40
million or more to underwrite the Olympic movement and from the
U.S. Congress. This week, the committee is expected to change the
way cities bid on the Olympics and to appoint an ethics commission
and a reform commission to examine such proposals as democratic
elections and term limits for IOC delegates, and open financial
records and open meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who heads the Senate committee on
commerce, science and transportation, has threatened to revoke the
IOC's tax-exempt status in the United States. He is also
considering the rerouting of billions in NBC television money from
the IOC to the U.S. Olympic Committee. McCain will hold a hearing
in Washington on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, McCain sent a letter to Anita DeFrantz, the senior
IOC member from the United States, which said, ``In the strongest
terms, let me communicate to you my hope that the IOC will move
quickly to adopt reforms.'' Without such independent action, McCain
said, ``the demand for Congress to act will be irrepressible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must put on the fire water, not petrol,'' said Mario
Pescante, an IOC member from Italy, calling for expulsions and
immediate reform. ``The situation is delicate. If the situation
continues, we risk losing sponsors. If you blend politics with
sport, this is the end.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Wednesday vote approached, rumors abounded of back-door
deals and plots and a palace revolt by officials who may want to
succeed Samaranch. Dick Schultz, the executive director of the
USOC, said in January that he believed that some IOC officials
appeared to be attempting to oust Samaranch. That theory gained
some currency this week when The Associated Press reported that
Samaranch had begun to express his concerns about a revolt from the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping people are not mixing personal prestige into this
problem, but there may be some of that,'' said Gerhard Heiberg, a
delegate from Norway.
</P>
<P>
   A vote of confidence for Samaranch by the IOC assembly is set
for Thursday, but that is expected to come easily, considering that
Samaranch appointed most delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real vote of confidence is what we do,'' said Richard W.
Pound of Montreal, who headed the IOC's investigation of the Salt
Lake City scandal.
</P>
<P>
   One investigation that remains open is that of Kim Un Yong, a
powerful delegate from South Korea who has been censured for
allegedly arranging for jobs for both his daughter and son through
the Salt Lake City bid committee. He has denied any wrongdoing.
However, IOC officials said Monday that Kim could still face a vote
of expulsion on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been some dissatisfaction within the IOC that a
warning, not expulsion, was given to Phil Coles of Australia, who
has been accused of both offering and receiving improper trips
regarding Salt Lake City and Sydney's bid to win the 2000 Summer
Games.
</P>
<P>
   Heiberg of Norway said it was possible that delegates could call
for a vote on expulsion from the floor during Wednesday's assembly,
if they believed that some members had received preferential
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they are equally guilty, I think they should receive the
same punishment,'' Easton said of Kim and Coles.
</P>
<P>
   Anxiously awaiting the outcome of Wednesday's and Thursday's
meetings are corporate sponsors, most of whom are located in the
United States. While the IOC cannot be reformed in two days, a
framework for reform is necessary, said Susan Rosenberg, a
spokeswoman for one sponsor, United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see movement and a clearly defined timetable for
reform, so we can hold them accountable to change,'' Rosenberg
said. ``It's important that a clear message be sent by the actions
they take that they are committed to serious change.''

GIULIANI SAYS SHOOTING COVERAGE SKEWED POLL
</HEADLINE>
   (See related NY-DIALLO-D.A.) 
(nk) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani blamed partisan politics and
an ``obsessive media concern'' Tuesday for the results of a New
York Times poll released this week that showed a sharp drop in his
job-approval rating and a widespread belief among the city's black
and Hispanic residents that the police routinely use excessive
force against them.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, he suggested
that the numbers were skewed because of the way the news media and
various black leaders have responded to the shooting death last
month of Amadou Diallo, an immigrant from West Africa. Four white
police officers killed Diallo, who was unarmed, with a flurry of
bullets while he stood in the vestibule of his Bronx apartment
building.
</P>
<P>
   Black leaders immediately denounced the shooting as indicative
of a Police Department that too readily assumes that black people
pose a threat. After some sporadic demonstrations, the leaders
recently began daily protests of civil disobedience.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor characterized statements by the protesters about
police attitudes as inaccurate and partisan, and he said the
statements were repeated in a ``media frenzy'' that distorted
reality and affected the perceptions reflected in polls.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, Giuliani suggested Tuesday, the Times poll showed
his job-approval rating plummeting to 42 percent, from 63 percent
only five months ago. That is also why, he said, the poll indicates
that fewer than a quarter of all New Yorkers think that the police
treat blacks and whites in an equally fair manner; that nearly 90
percent of black residents think that the police often engage in
brutality against blacks and that one of every three blacks has
felt danger in the presence of a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   As he has since the Diallo shooting, Giuliani emphasized that
statistics have shown a sharp reduction in incidents of excessive
force among the city's police officers, to the point that the
department is among the most restrained in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 70 or 80 percent of the people believe that police officers
in New York City are brutal too often, that's a misperception,''
the mayor said. ``It is driven by a very effective partisan
political campaign, and the fact that there's been an obsessive
concern in the media about it.''
</P>
<P>
   He then used the Waldorf-Astoria, where a guest was killed over
the weekend, to illustrate his point about the ``obsessive media
concern'' _ a phrase he repeated _ that has been shown to the
police shooting of Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we're in a hotel that two days ago, three days ago, had
a horrible murder take place,'' he said. ``If you spent the next
five weeks covering that murder, you would convince people that
there was a murder problem in the city of New York, even though
murder is down by 70 percent.''

POLITICAL BRAWL OVER JOE DIMAGGIO HIGHWAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki agreed Tuesday night to rename
the West Side Highway after Joe DiMaggio, but his announcement was
partly overshadowed by new tensions with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani,
suggesting that relations between the two men are so strained that
they have trouble concurring on whether to put up a few street
signs.
</P>
<P>
   In the days after DiMaggio's death last week, the governor had
withheld support for the mayor's plan to rename the West Side
Highway, saying that he wanted first to consult with the Yankees
and DiMaggio's family.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, Pataki said for the first time that he would sign
legislation to change the name of the West Side Highway, which runs
from Battery Place in lower Manhattan to 72nd Street along the
Hudson River. Lawmakers are expected to approve the bill later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   To save money, the measure calls for a ceremonial, not official,
name change. In other words, signs along the highway would not be
replaced, but signs would be added declaring that it now honors
DiMaggio. The state had estimated that an official name change
would cost several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But while the governor was publicly lauding DiMaggio, he was
said to be privately furious over what his aides called efforts by
the mayor to embarrass Pataki over the issue. The dispute was the
latest in an escalating feud that began in the 1994 gubernatorial
election, when Giuliani crossed party lines and endorsed the
Democratic incumbent, Mario M. Cuomo, who lost to Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's ire Tuesday night was focused on a letter that
DiMaggio's lawyer wrote to Giuliani, which was circulated Tuesday
afternoon around the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   In the letter, the lawyer, Morris Engelberg, assails the
governor for not acceding to the renaming of the West Side Highway,
while also questioning his motives. ``To use Joe DiMaggio's name to
further any political objective is inappropriate,'' Engelberg
wrote, ``and to attempt to do so at this time _ so soon after his
death _ is, in our opinion, in extremely poor taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the letter, Pataki told reporters that Engelberg was
``grossly misinformed.'' The governor's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha,
suggested that the Giuliani administration had orchestrated the
letter to pressure the governor and hurt his reputation. She noted
that Pataki had never opposed the West Side Highway plan, but had
merely called for more discussion before approving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's beyond comprehension why anyone would want to play
politics with this man's memory,'' Ms. Mucha said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Engelberg on Tuesday night both denied the
suggestion by Pataki aides that there had been cooperation on the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters at City Hall, Giuliani sought to calm the
quarrel. He praised the governor for supporting the plan and seemed
to imply that Engelberg had misunderstood the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no politics in this,'' Giuliani said. ``This is out of
respect for Joe DiMaggio, which the governor and I both have.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Engelberg said he wrote the letter
after reading articles about the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't speak to anyone before I wrote the letter,''
Engelberg said. ``I'm not looking for publicity. I just wanted to
protect Joe's name and image, not throw him into this political
arena.''

   BOURBONNAIS, Ill. _ They were just settling in for the night,
comfortably ensconced in the first-class double-decker sleeper car
of a train with a famous name, The City of New Orleans. They had
boarded in Chicago, just two hours before, and their train, its
legend celebrated in a popular American folk song, was due to pull
into New Orleans in the late afternoon of the next day.
</P>
<P>
   But in a single horrifying instant, everything changed. At 9:55
p.m. CT Monday, Amtrak's City of New Orleans smashed into a
semi-trailer truck at a railroad crossing in this rural town about
55 miles south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, at least 13 passengers had been found
dead, all of them in the sleeper car. Local fire officials said
Tuesday night that four people were unaccounted for, but Amtrak
officials and federal investigators declined to say how many they
thought were missing. There were no signs that any of those
unaccounted for were alive.
</P>
<P>
   In what was being called one of the worst accidents in Amtrak's
history, the train derailed and the first five cars were mangled,
twisted like empty soda cans. Flames burst out, visible from miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure at this point I can collect my thoughts enough to
tell you what was going through my mind,'' said Michael
Harshbarger, chief of the tiny Bourbonnais fire department. ``I
don't think I've ever seen anything quite like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials were releasing no details about the dead, whose bodies
were being kept in an old lumber company warehouse turned makeshift
morgue. But a woman in Nesbit, Miss., confirmed that four of those
killed were from Nesbit _ a woman, her grandchild and two other
children.
</P>
<P>
   The grandmother, June Bonnin, was a cancer survivor in her late
40s who had opened a bed and breakfast with her husband while she
was still recovering. She was traveling with her granddaughter,
Jessica Whitaker, 12, two of the girl's friends and her daughter,
so that the girls could shop in Chicago at a store that carried
American Girl dolls and their accessories, which feature historic
details. The daughter, Ashley Bonnin, who is Jessica's aunt, was
injured in the crash and hospitalized in Kankakee, a few miles
south of here.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Bonnin was among 114 people who were injured, at least 11
critically, authorities said. They were rescued along with the rest
of the train's surviving 216 passengers and crew members. Among
those passengers was a group of 20 teen-agers from Mississippi and
their chaperones, returning from a ski trip to Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, who was driving on a probationary permit after
his license had been suspended because of speeding tickets, was
heading east across the train tracks when the train hit. His truck
was packed with heavy steel bars from a nearby steel factory. He
was routinely treated and released, officials said. The collision
shattered the trailer section of the truck.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day Tuesday, rescue crews that had rushed here
from miles away were still combing through the tangled metal,
hampered by piles of crushed debris and the need to make sure the
wreckage would not shift and endanger the rescuers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The once-gleaming sleeper car had been slammed up onto one of
the train's two locomotives. It was broken down the middle and
ravaged by fire, Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The interior is filled with debris from the fire, and it's
necessary to search through that debris to find victims,''
Harshbarger said. ``It's simply a matter of digging with the gloved
hand, turning pieces of debris over in order to find someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Allen, 80, who was traveling with his wife from their home
in Winona, Minn., to visit their son in Florida, described the
frightening confusion of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this violent jerking motion and all of a sudden we
just stopped and the lights went out,'' said Allen, who was riding
in one of the last of the train's 14 cars and had just settled down
to read a book. He heard a loud, grating noise and then, he said,
``All we could see was the smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash was one of the deadliest in Amtrak's 26-year history.
The worst was a 1993 crash that killed 47 people when a train
plunged into a bayou near Mobile, Ala. In 1987, two trains collided
near Chase, Md., killing 16.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the National Transportation Safety Board
arrived Tuesday morning. In addition to investigating the accident,
the board will coordinate efforts to help the families of the dead
and injured, as it does after plane crashes.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, John Ralph Stokes, 58, of Manteno, Ill., a
town near the accident site, had had his commercial driver's
license suspended in January because he had received three speeding
tickets in 12 months, said David Druker, a spokesman for the
Illinois secretary of state's office.
</P>
<P>
   However, since this was Stokes' first suspension, he was able to
take a safety class and receive a temporary probationary permit.
Barring any problems, he would have received his regular license
back on March 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man was driving legally,'' Druker said.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Wykle, the administrator of the Federal Highway
Administration, said the agency would investigate the
safety-compliance record of the company Stokes was driving for,
Melco Transfer Inc. of Peotone, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   No one answered the door or the telephone at Stokes' house on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Cy Gura, a safety engineer with the National
Transportation Safety Board, told The Associated Press that Stokes
had told authorities that he did not see the train or warning
lights until he had already started driving across the tracks.
Later Tuesday afternoon, safety board officials would not confirm
that account.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's chairman, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, held a press
conference Tuesday to say that he had been briefed on the
investigation and believed that the truck driver was trying to beat
the train by driving around the crossing gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The engineer said he saw the lights flashing, he saw the
barriers down, and then he saw the truck stop and try to get around
it,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Illinois Central Railroad, which manages the
railroad crossing, said the crossing was equipped with gates, two
signal lights and a bell, which were functioning properly Monday
night, based on an analysis of a computer chip that records the
previous 3,000 times the crossing equipment functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have every confidence that they were working last night,''
said the spokesman, Jack Burke. He said the blinking lights begin
to flash five seconds before the gates come down, and that the
gates start to come down about 26 seconds before the train gets to
the crossing. He said it would not have been possible for the truck
to get trapped by the closing gates, because the gates would have
hit the truck and broken.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three previous fatal accidents at this railroad
crossing, in 1964, 1968 and 1988. State officials say that is a
relatively good safety record, given the number of trains that
cross the intersection _ about 40 a day, traveling at speeds
between 25 and 79 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Jolene Molitoris, administrator of the Federal Railroad
Administration, said Tuesday that the crossing was considered a
good intersection. The agency's records indicate that the road
crossing the tracks is angled to give drivers a clear view of
oncoming trains.
</P>
<P>
   A City of New Orleans train passes this way every night, pulling
out of Chicago at about 8 p.m. It makes a few stops in Illinois,
stops in Memphis, Tenn., and virtually turns into a local train in
Mississippi, until it reaches New Orleans at 3:30 p.m. the
following day. Another City of New Orleans train makes the same
trip in reverse every day.
</P>
<P>
   The City of New Orleans was the main northbound train of the
great black migration from the South in the 1940s and 1950s. And it
was celebrated in a folk song written by Steve Goodman and made
famous by Arlo Guthrie. The song croons about men dealing cards in
the club car, mothers rocking their sleeping babies and the train
``passin' towns that have no names, freight yards full of old black
men, and the graveyards of rusted automobiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The chorus _ ``Good Morning America, how are you?'' _
memorialized the romance of the railroad age.
</P>
<P>
   The modern-day City of New Orleans is a comfortable ride,
especially in the sleeping car, where passengers have a
``hospitality hour,'' a morning paper delivered to them, and a
24-hour on-call attendant who can ``order you a night-cap if
wished,'' Amtrak's literature says.
</P>
<P>
   National Transportation Safety Board officials said they had
interviewed the truck driver and the train engineer and sent the
train's black box to Chicago to be analyzed. They plan to retest
the crossing gates and lights and the sensor on the tracks that
trips the gates.
</P>
<P>
   They said the investigation was complicated by the presence of
two cars on the side tracks, one full of steel and the other full
of furnace residue from a steel plant. The cars had been struck in
the derailment and were making the search for evidence more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for the first time in a railroad accident, the safety
board deployed a counseling team to work with the survivors, an
approach adopted after a fatal airline crash in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in a stiff winter wind, rescue workers clambered on
top of the up-ended and fractured train cars, searching for any
glimpse of the missing.
</P>
<P>
   Some had worked all night, helping the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were coming off the train searching for their
family members,'' said Karen Brzezicki, a firefighter and paramedic
for the Bourbonnais Fire Department who was one of the first
workers on the scene. ``That was the hardest part, people searching
for their children. This is one of those things you don't want to
see and you hope you never have to see again.''

NINE NORTHWEST SALMON SPECIES LISTED AS ENDANGERED, THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The federal government Tuesday stepped in to do what
the Northwest has failed to do: bring wild salmon back from the
brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Now state and local leaders must start making good on their
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service listed nine struggling
salmon sub-species in Washington and Oregon, including the once
bountiful Puget Sound wild chinook, as threatened or endangered
under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated listingwill force state and local
governments, foresters, farmers, land and home owners, and even big
city apartment dwellers to make financial sacrifices to reverse
more than a century's worth of environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last hundred years as people have moved out here and
developed this part of the country, we've forced the salmon to
adjust to us,'' said Bill Ruckelshaus, leader of a partnership of
Washington corporations and environmental groups monitoring the
salmon-saving efforts. ``This will force us to adjust to the
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders from Seattle, King, Snohomish and Pierce
Counties, state government and Indian tribes crowded before the
microphones Tuesday to assure Uncle Sam of their commitment to
restoring the natural habitat and pristine waterways that once
allowed salmon to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that by pledging stringent new regulations on how much
water their communities use and how much asphalt and concrete is
laid down for new homes and businesses, they can prevent the
federal government from imposing even more draconian measures in
the thickly populated Puget Sound. They're desperate to avoid the
kind of economic paralysis that hit the Olympic penninsula and the
timber industry with the 1990 listing of the spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people understand what (the National Marine
Fisheries Service) did to us today,'' said King County Executive
Ron Sims.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians may not be able to keep some of the promises
they made Tuesday once their constituents take a hard look at the
utility rate hikes and land-use restrictions they're proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Pivotal to Washington's success in keeping federal regulators at
bay is Governor Gary Locke's salmon recovery plan. The $201 million
proposal, designed to give salmon the cool, clean water they need,
is in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Locke's plan would sharply tighten restrictions on water use for
farmers and surburbanites alike, and crack down on illegal
withdrawals. His proposed ``Forest and Fish'' plan, negotiated over
months by the timber industry, state and federal government, and
some tribes, would put 15 percent of existing commercial timber
land permanently out of production. Locke is calling for adding 180
new state employees to enact the recovery effort, shortening salmon
fishing seasons, and forcing developers and private landowners to
expand protection of wetlands and stream-sides.
</P>
<P>
   The first-term governor's ambitious proposal includes the kind
of dramatic, science-backed measures the federal fisheries agency
likes to see. But it's hard to find a Democrat or Republican from a
rural district who is backing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that average salmon must travel through 28 different
government jurisdictions to reach its spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rural lawmakers complain Locke's plan concentrates too much on
the fish habitat in Washington, and not nearly enough on the
environment at sea where salmon spend most of their lives. It does
nothing to address the sea lions, terns and Canadian fisherman
capturing Washington salmon, they say.
</P>
<P>
   And it exacts too much flesh from farmers and homeowners without
clearly spelling out how much sacrifice will be enough, they say.
Small timber land owners depending on their property to finance
retirement or a college education shouldn't be forced to give up
land, they say, for vaguely defined fish recovery goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Chandler, co-chair of the House Agriculture and Ecology
Committee, hails from Grant County, whose dry land was transformed
60 years ago by the Columbia Basin irrigation project into
sprawling fields of beans and peas. He said Locke's demands that
farmers give up water would rob them of their hopes of ever
expanding their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's plan is centered on taking water from people,''
he said. ``Do that, and you turn off the economy's tap too.
Agriculture is the number one industry in this state, employing the
most people.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are casting stones at Locke's plan too. They
say the Forest and Fish plan doesn't protect enough stream-side
forest land to guarantee salmon will recover.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schmidt, Gov. Gary Locke's top salmon adviser, cautioned
that with six weeks of the session left, it's premature to predict
the plan's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, Rep. Jim Buck, co-chair of the House Natural Resources
Committee and Dave Mastin, co-chair House's Salmon Restoration Task
force, all rural Republicans, said they're confident they'll
deliver a plan that will satisfy federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the Legislature's salmon package lacks the
teeth that the federal government requires?
</P>
<P>
   It may deter federal lawmakers' efforts to get Washington the
money it needs to enact its plans. For instance, Sen. Slade Gorton,
chair of the U.S. Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, is
seeking $210 million more than the $100 million President Clinton
promised for West Coast salmon recovery. Gorton said last week that
it's essential that the Legislature do its share if it wants
federal help.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and Indian tribes are standing by, ready to
sue to protect salmon where the state does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If governmental entities don't step up to the plate to protect
society from a species becoming extinct, (litigation) will
happen,'' said Ed Zuckerman, executive director of the Washington
Environmental Alliance for Voter Education.
</P>
<P>
   Such suits would invite federal judges in to dictate exactly how
much salmon protection is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have lived to regret the fact that they opened the
door for such lawsuits. In Massachussetts, an environmental group
sued the state, claiming it had shirked its responsibilities under
the Endangered Species Act by not banning fishing nets that were
catching an endangered species of whale. They won, and state was
prevented from granting permits for the nets.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Volusia County was sued by an environmental group
for failing to adopt an ordinance to dim beach-front lights that
were leading nesting sea turtles into the path of oncoming cars.
That case is now awaiting a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. At
issue is whether local governments have an obligation to use their
powers to save endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Johnston, a Seattle attorney who specializes in endangered
species law, said environmental groups in Washington could sue the
state for not leaving enough enough water in streams for salmon.
Such a victory could force lawmakers to enact water-use
restrictions they are balking at now.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the federal government can also take direct
enforcement action against governments, businesses and even
individuals deemed to be harming fish with their actions. But
proving that fertilizing a lawn or washing a car is harming a fish
in court isn't easy, and Johnston said that's the path the
fisheries agency is least likely to pursue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal fishery officials inisted Tuesday that they're thrilled
with the cooperative spirit they've seen so far in local and state
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolland Schmitten, assistant administrator of the agency,
warned, ``please don't mistake our desire to partner as a lack of
commitment. We will (protect the fish) even if we have to do it
alone.''
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx district attorney,
1996 was a trying year. In March, a police officer, Kevin
Gillespie, was shot and killed, and a former convict was arrested
for his murder. Convinced that Johnson, who previously stated that
he would not seek the death sentence, would not pursue it in this
case, Gov. George E. Pataki removed him from it.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after the stunning ouster, the trial of Francis X.
Livoti, a police officer accused of killing Anthony Baez with an
illegal choke hold, concluded with an acquittal. Again, Johnson was
under fire, this time from the Baez family, some members of the
public and, more subtly, from the judge in the case, all of whom
suggested his office had bungled the prosecution. In one year, the
district attorney found himself accused of being both soft on
police killers and soft on the police.
</P>
<P>
   But 1999 may make 1996 seem easy. The killing of Amadou Diallo
by four police officers, who fired 41 rounds at the unarmed African
immigrant in the vestibule of his apartment house late one night
last month, has presented Johnson with the most politically charged
case of his 10-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   While it is a grand jury, which is now hearing evidence in the
shooting, that will decide whether to bring charges against the
officers, Johnson and his prosecutors will decide which charges the
jurors consider _ and shape how they see the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a city of distinctive prosecutors, Johnson, up for
re-election in November, is neither crusader nor publicity hound.
Nor does he seem to trim his sails according to the political
winds.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it would be difficult for Johnson, the only black
district attorney in the state, to miss the emotions swirling
around the Diallo case. Protesters pressing for an indictment rally
outside the Bronx County Courthouse almost daily. Johnson declined
an interview request by saying that he did not want to talk about
the Diallo case _ and these days, all conversational roads lead
there.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, Johnson's constituents have endured the
worst of the crime wave and felt the relief of crime's subsequent
plummet. But that drop has been coupled with high-profile cases of
alleged police abuse. For Bronx residents, and for the city as a
whole, the Diallo case is evolving into a referendum on how
government handles the misdeeds of the police _ and Johnson's
actions are the first test.
</P>
<P>
   Some police officers, more likely to see the Diallo shooting as
a tragic byproduct of aggressive crime-fighting, fear that the
officers will fall victim to political forces.
</P>
<P>
   For Johnson, good relations with the police are crucial: his
office relies on them to investigate cases and serve as witnesses.
District attorneys know that if they are perceived as being unfair
to the police, securing cooperation for subsequent investigations
of police conduct will be much harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prosecutors are in a no-win position when they try to
prosecute police officers,'' said Joel L. Blumenfeld, a Queens
judge who more than two decades ago supervised a young Bronx Legal
Aid lawyer named Rob Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 51, grew up in an era when the problem for minorities
in the city was not overly aggressive policing but the lack of it.
He was raised in the Amsterdam housing project in Manhattan, and
moved to the Bronx at 16. For several years, he lived in the
Soundview section, where Diallo also lived. Johnson's mother still
lives there.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a born politician, or even, very much, a bred one.
Slim and youthful-looking despite graying hair, he can slip in and
out of a room unnoticed. He and his second wife, Dianne T. Renwick
_ a Supreme Court justice in Bronx Civil Court _ live near Pelham
Bay Park just south of the Westchester County border in the Bronx
with their two young children.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney ascended not through party politics but
through the Bronx criminal justice system. It was a fast rise.
After finishing City College in 1972, Johnson went to New York
University Law School and then became a defense attorney in the
Bronx Legal Aid office.
</P>
<P>
   He soon switched sides, going to work as a prosecutor under
Mario Merola, the colorful Bronx district attorney. In 1985,
Johnson became the head of Merola's narcotics bureau. The next
year, Edward I. Koch appointed him to the Criminal Court bench.
Then Merola died, and the fight to replace him threatened to tear
the Bronx Democratic Party, whose nomination is tantamount to
election, apart. Johnson was brought in as a neutral Democratic
candidate and won.
</P>
<P>
   Former assistants describe him as a hands-on manager who
frequently drops in on courtrooms to watch his assistants in
action. He is considered tough on crime, pushing hard, for example,
for mandatory one-year minimum sentences for defendants caught with
loaded, unregistered guns.
 &UR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's friends and colleagues say his toughness couples with
a commitment to addressing crime's root causes, something of an
old-fashioned concept these days. They point to his willingness to
consider treatment alternatives for low-level drug offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has an unusually strong bond with his constituents. He
shuns the media but attends countless community events. He drives
himself around the Bronx, declining to be chauffeured, and
residents often approach him on the street to discuss problems or
pass on information.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's battle with the governor over the Gillespie case may
not have played well with other public officials, but it does not
seem to have hurt him with his constituents. Community leaders say
he earned respect for standing up for his principles.
</P>
<P>
   Those who disagreed with him thought differently. ``It was
typical Rob _ this is my view and you're not going to budge me,''
said Paul Schectman, Pataki's former criminal justice coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   In the Livoti case, Johnson was accused by the Baez family and
others of applying the law indifferently. ``I was very
disappointed, from the beginning, in the way the entire case was
investigated _ which was not vigorously,'' said Susan M. Karten,
the lawyer who represented the Baez family.
</P>
<P>
   The original indictment was thrown out because of a clerical
error. When Officer Livoti finally went to trial, he was acquitted
by a judge who decried the ``nest of perjury'' he saw in testimony
from the police. It was the prosecution's duty to have sorted it
out, he implied. Livoti was later convicted on federal civil rights
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's defenders point to his success in winning a conviction
against Livoti for applying a choke hold in another case.
</P>
<P>
   That case, and Johnson's largely unsuccessful attempt to
prosecute officers from the 48th Precinct for brutality and
corruption, prompt some officers to say he is too aggressive in
prosecuting the police _ ``not pro-cop,'' in one officer's words.
But the district attorney's bigger problem is that the Bronx
residents who comprise his juries do not trust the police.
</P>
<P>
   Since Johnson has been in office, his conviction rate in jury
trials has never been above 70 percent and has usually hovered
closer to 60 percent. The citywide average, in contrast, has
usually been above 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some defense lawyers blame incompetence or high turnover in
Johnson's office. But many lawyers and judges in the Bronx said the
conviction rate in jury trials reflected the skepticism of Bronx
jurors. And the shooting of Amadou Diallo, they said, can only make
things harder for Johnson.

WHEN IRISH EYES ARE SMILING MALICIOUSLY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the dangers with interviewing Sean Kelly is
that you might find out what your name means, if it happens to be
Irish. (From the Gaelic, Kelly translates as something like
``sacred prostitute.'' Kennedy means ``ugly head.'')
</P>
<P>
   You will also probably hear more than you want about the Irish
saint whose day this is: First of all, he was not Irish but
Welsh-Italian; his given name was not Patrick, it was Succat; he
was not even the first Christian missionary to visit Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But history and green beer aside, Kelly kind of likes St.
Patrick's Day. ``I think because it's the original day in America
when people celebrate their other roots,'' he said Tuesday. ``It's
a festival of immigrants. If there's anything good to be said in
its behalf, I guess it would be that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, a soft-spoken man with a somewhat devilish glint in his
eye, has made his way through a lot of occupations in 58 years _
child quiz-show star, radio actor, advertising copywriter,
substitute professor of Victorian literature, founding editor of
National Lampoon, ill-fated writer for ``Saturday Night Live,''
children's book and television writer.
</P>
<P>
   But pondering and alternately embracing and disparaging Irish
culture and Roman Catholicism has been a lifelong occupation. So
when he recently got together with a friend and Irish-American
collaborator, Rosemary Rogers, they decided it was time to put some
of their collective arcana into a book, ``How to Be Irish (Even if
You Already Are).''
</P>
<P>
   They hope the book makes them some money, of course, but it also
conforms nicely to an important philosophical concept for Kelly _
the sucker punch.
</P>
<P>
   His first experience with this concept came at Loyola High
School in Montreal, where he grew up. Kelly, who viewed high school
less as a place to learn than as a place to drive Jesuits crazy,
was hauled one day to the dark, imposing offices of the rector, the
Rev. Gerald F. Lahey.
</P>
<P>
   The rector, an expert on the Jesuit poet Gerard Manley Hopkins,
told the young Kelly that he had great _ even Hopkinsesque _
potential as a writer, if only he could overcome his attitude
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was flattering,'' Kelly recalled. ``But even at that age I
knew: I was being sucker-punched.''
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, it was a lesson that would stick with him:
give the people something they don't expect.
</P>
<P>
   When he got a job with an advertising agency, for example, one
of his television spots for Canadian National Railways was 58
seconds of ``any kind of footage of crashing planes and people
picking through rubble. And then at the end the screen goes white,
and rain, and through the night _ whoosh _ a train zips past. And
then `Canadian National Railways' on the screen. No voice-over.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't air it, but it was a great commercial,'' Kelly,
beaming, said at home in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn, where
his almost-7-year-old son, Mac, bounded around upstairs. (Kelly's
wife is Patricia Todd, editor in chief of trade paperbacks at Simon
&AMP; Schuster.)
</P>
<P>
   Even as a writer of children's books, he can't help himself. One
of his books, ``Boom Baby Moon,'' is a sweet-looking attack on
baby-boomer excess and the bedside standard ``Goodnight Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   A children's book it is not:
</P>
<P>
   Goodnight intercom in my crib
</P>
<P>
   Goodnight fireproof feeding bib
</P>
<P>
   The slim Irish book looks like one of those funny, impulse buys
that book stores always put near the cash registers. And it is
funny, with a kind of National Lampoon slapdash approach, but
inside there are quotations from many unfunny people, like Edmund
Spenser and Benjamin Disraeli, and discussions of things like
William Butler Yeats' brief dalliance with Ireland's Facist Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what I think I used to do as a teacher,'' he said.
``Which is that it would appear that `You've really lucked out,
kids, because you've got your long-haired, dope-sucking maniac as
your English teacher.' And then a couple of weeks later, you're
actually doing it. You're trying to crack Culture and Anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime freelance writer (``I'm much too sensitive to get
a job,'' he says) Kelly is a mind-boggling generalist.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 minutes of conversation, one can end up learning a little
about Aquinas, discovering that a certain movie director smokes a
lot of marijuana, and finding out about the San Patricios, Irish
soldiers who deserted the U.S. Army during the Mexican-American War
and joined the Mexican side.
</P>
<P>
   He says his deep knowledge of things Irish has always been so
much a part of him that writing about it seemed strange.
</P>
<P>
   He was born on his grandfather's farm in Cushing, Quebec, but
raised in a part of Montreal so Irish ``that I probably didn't meet
anyone who wasn't Irish until I was a teen-ager.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like living in a shtetl,'' he said. ``I had no idea
that there was an alternative to it.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, Charles Kelly, was a draftsman for RCA Victor, who
met his mother, Grace Whelehan, when he helped out with the haying
on her parents' farm. ``Of course she became Grace Kelly when she
married my father.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that he is done with the Irish book, he is not sure what
subject to tackle next. But then the phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy said we could do the Taco Bell book, you know, about the
Taco Bell chihuahua,'' he said afterward. ``Now let's see ... what
kind of money do you ask for to write the chihuahua book?''

KINGS' LAPERRIERE DOES THE LITTLE THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Once upon a time, an 18-year-old forward scored 44
goals and chipped in 96 assists in a season playing for
Drummondville in the Quebec junior league.
</P>
<P>
   It was only six seasons ago, but it might as well have happened
in another lifetime for Kings center Ian Laperriere.
</P>
<P>
   In 206 games as a King, the 25-year-old Laperriere has posted
somewhat less impressive numbers: 18 goals, 41 assists and 59
points, a far cry from his Gretzkyesque final season of junior
hockey in 1992-93, when he had 140 points in just 60 games.
</P>
<P>
   In his 206th game as a King, Monday night's important 4-0
victory over Ottawa, Laperriere did all the little things, as
usual.
</P>
<P>
   On one notable second-period shift, he stole the puck from a
Senator, was held, dropped to the ice, got up, was knocked down
again, battled for the puck from his knees, somehow got it to
linemate Nathan LaFayette, got the puck back, was checked, threw a
punch at Ottawa defenseman Lance Pitlick that was not seen by
referee Don Koharski, then took a punch from Pitlick and dropped to
the ice as if he'd been struck by the Mike Tyson of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   This last bit was witnessed by Koharski, meaning Laperriere had
done his job by drawing a penalty, and Blake scored the Kings'
first goal on the subsequent power play. For good measure, with the
outcome decided late in the game, Laperriere pummeled Ottawa's Bill
Berg so thoroughly that only a Lewis-Holyfield judge would have
failed to give Laperriere the decision in that bout.
</P>
<P>
   Mention Laperriere's name, and Blake breaks out in an instant
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does it all the time,'' Blake said. ``He's done it all year
long. The kid loves to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Laperriere, ``I love to be on the ice, playing hockey,
practicing. I just want to skate and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It was following his impressive career in junior hockey that
Laperriere, a native of Montreal, became typecast as a defensive
specialist.
</P>
<P>
   Chosen by St. Louis in the seventh round of the 1992 draft,
Laperriere had 13 goals and 27 points for the Blues in 37 games
during the 1995 lockout season. But midway through the following
year, the Blues traded Laperriere to the New York Rangers, who had
a different plan for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought I was just a fourth-line guy, and that was it,''
said Laperriere, who next will perpetrate his unique brand of
mayhem Thursday night when the Kings play host to the Mighty Ducks.
``You don't decide what you're going to play. They decide what
you're going to play. They saw more my physical play than my
skills, and decided I was going to be a physical player.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings acquired him from the Rangers later that same
season in a multi-player trade, their plan for Laperriere didn't
change.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wants to play,'' Kings coach Larry Robinson said. ``I
wish all the guys had his attitude. He wears his emotions on his
sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Jay Leach added, ``One day, I said to Ian, `What
makes you go?' He said, `If I don't do this, then I'm back in
Canada, working for General Motors.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of his willingness to accept the role that now appears to be his
destiny, Laperriere said, ``It's from my parents, both my parents
but more my dad (Michel). He never forced me to work hard, but he
said, `If you work hard, you get what you want.'
</P>
<P>

hard. And I'm not a Donald Audette or a Luc Robitaille. If I want
to stay in the league, I've got to work hard.''

GALAXY, FIRE THE ONES TO BEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The two biggest guns in the Western Conference of
Major League Soccer -- Los Angeles and Chicago -- should again
battle for the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire, which captured the MLS Cup and U.S. Open Cup title in
its inaugural season in 1998, seems destined to repeat. The bulk of
its roster is in place, most noticeably foreigners Peter Nowak
(Poland), Lubos Kubik (Czechoslovakia), Jerzy Podbrozny (Poland)
and Roman Kosecki (Poland), collectively known as the ``Eastern
Bloc.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense centers around Kubik, who led defenders in scoring
and could be the most skillful defender in the league. Both C.J.
Brown and defensive midfield specialist Chris Armas have earned
U.S. National team appearances because of last year's showing,
along with goalkeeper Zack Thornton, who boasted a league-low 1.17
goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a very good mix of players,'' said Fire coach
Bob Bradley. ``We need to remember what went into last season and
do our best to work together again and see what happens.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy set every record imaginable last season, including
best record (24-7) and most goals (85). They have tinkered with
their lineup and could start seven players under than age of 25.
L.A. still is trying to obtain the one crown jewel that has eluded
the franchise -- an MLS championship.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City should improve with the acquisitions of goalkeeper
Tony Meola and defender Alexi Lalas.
</P>
<P>
   The most disappointing team in 1998, the Wizards went from a
scoring machine that captured the 1997 regular-season title to a
last-place finish in 1998. Don't expect coach Ron Newman, the
winningest coach in American soccer history, to be in the cellar
again.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizards added proven American veterans Lalas and Meola, both
of whom played big roles for the American team during the 1994
World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, which finished 15-18 last season, will try to avoid the
injuries that plagued midfielders Leonel Alvarez and Jason Kreis
and striker Dante Washington most of last season.
</P>
<P>
   If those three are healthy, goalkeeper Mark Dodd -- along with
solid contributors Jorge Rodriguez, Mark Santel, Mickey Trotman and
late-season acquisition Oscar Pareja -- could make the Burn a
dangerous opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado reached the 1997 MLS championship as the fourth seed in
the West. But until its back line figures out a way to keep
opponents away from the net, the Rapids will have problems.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado ranked 12th in MLS (allowing 69 goals, an average of
2.16 per game) last season and has given up 187 goals in three
seasons -- the most of any MLS team.
</P>
<P>
   To help out, the Rapids acquired defender Matt McKeon from
Kansas City, allowing veteran Marcelo Balboa and Peter Vermes to
move the middle of the central defense.
</P>

MUSEUM IS TOLD TO HOLD AUSTRIAN ART
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state appeals court ruled Tuesday that the Museum
of Modern Art cannot return two Egon Schiele paintings to Austria
until a criminal investigation into their ownership is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling reversed the decision of a lower court, which had
allowed the museum to return the paintings, which it had borrowed
from the Leopold Foundation in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau is examining
charges that the paintings, confiscated from Jews by the Nazis, had
improperly made their way after World War II into the private
collection of Dr. Rudolf Leopold, a Viennese ophthalmologist, who
later sold them to the Leopold Foundation, financed by the Austrian
government.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern, which had borrowed the works for a huge Schiele
retrospective, had moved to quash a subpoena, and last May Acting
Justice Laura E. Drager of state Supreme Court in Manhattan had
granted its motion. She ruled that the works were protected from
seizure of any kind by New York state's 30-year-old Arts and
Cultural Affairs Law and that the subpoena was in effect a seizure.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday the appeals court ruled that the law did not apply
to criminal proceedings like Morgenthau's investigation. The court
disagreed with the contention of the Modern and other museums that
the law was intended to maintain the free flow of art without any
concern about legal challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one disputes that intent,'' the ruling said, ``but it is
not contended, nor could it be, that the public interest is served
by permitting the free flow of stolen art into and out of the
state.''
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the ruling said, a subpoena requiring the Modern to
produce the paintings for the grand jury investigation does not
constitute ``seizure'' of them. It said that there was ``no
evidence'' in the subpoena that ``the two paintings will be sought
to be retained in custody.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, Morgenthau said he felt ``vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We will continue to proceed with our investigation to see if a
crime or crimes have been committed,'' Morgenthau added. ``And the
paintings will stay at MOMA while the grand jury continues its
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Modern, Glenn D. Lowry, the director, called the ruling
``deeply troubling and disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue is a very important one that goes far beyond the
fate of the Schieles,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum said it would appeal the decision.

CREW, UNITED DRAW ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no question, on paper at least, that two-time MLS Cup
champion D.C. United should be the class of Major League Soccer's
Eastern Conference again. Even so, the hottest ticket -- and the
hungriest team -- will be the Columbus Crew.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew's steady rise over the years (fourth in 1996, third in
'97 and second in '98), coupled with its new 22,500-seat
European-style soccer-specific stadium, should give the city of
Columbus a team to get excited about.
</P>
<P>
   The new stadium, which is set to open May 15 when the Crew plays
host to New England, will feature a much wider field than the
narrow confines of Ohio Stadium. That will give strikers Brian
McBride and Stern John, the best forward tandem in the league, more
room to operate.
</P>
<P>
   John, a native of Trinidad and Tobago, emerged from nowhere last
season to lead the league in scoring (26 goals, 5 assists, 57
points). He'll join McBride, Columbus' career scoring leader and
arguably the best striker the U.S. has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the return of veteran Mike Lapper from
reconstructive knee surgery and the arrival of the versatile Matt
Kmosko should bolster the Crew's back line.
</P>
<P>
   The question for United, obviously, is how will it do now that
Bruce Arena has left to coach the U.S. National team? How will this
franchise react after losing the Alan Rothenberg Trophy to Chicago
in the MLS Cup championship?
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that new coach Tom Rongen has proven
credentials after guiding Tampa Bay to the best record in the
league during MLS' inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   United is still solid all-around, boasting striker Roy Lassiter
and Jaime Moreno on the front line.
</P>
<P>
   The league's top playmaker, Marco Etcheverry, returns, as does
1998 Rookie of the Year Ben Olsen, who has spent some time with the
U.S. National team recently.
</P>
<P>
   How this team does following the departures of U.S. veteran John
Harkes and Tony Sanneh depends on the additions of Diego Sonora and
Jason Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Bora Milutinovic, regarded as one of the best coaches on the
planet, has the task of trying to bring the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars their first winning season.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic, who has taken three teams (including the United
States in 1994) to the World Cup, took over the coaching reins late
last season. The MetroStars were swept in the opening round of the
playoffs by Columbus, however.
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic went to work in the offseason, acquiring Costa Rican
standout Roy Myers and former Kansas City Wizards Mark Chung and
Mike Ammann.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Hurtado, the team's top striker, returns, as does
midfield presence Tab Ramos. The MetroStars lost a group of proven
veterans in Alexi Lalas, Giovanni Savarese, Diego Sonora and
goalkeeper Tony Meola.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a quick glance at the Eastern Conference and projected

INSTANT DECISION 
STILL DIZZY FROM `CAROUSEL'? 
JUST A CALDOR GUY FROM LEVITTOWN
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By JAMES BARRON with JOE BRESCIA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don King, the boxing promoter, was in the greenroom, waiting for
his turn in the guest's chair on the public-television interview
program ``Charlie Rose'' on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On a television monitor he watched a segment being videotaped
with Leah Rabin, the widow of Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated
in 1995; their daughter, Dalia Rabin-Philosof, and their
granddaughter, Noa Ben-Artzi Philosof.
</P>
<P>
   They were talking about the Yitzhak Rabin Center for
International Studies in Tel Aviv and their campaign to raise $40
million for the center's educational programs for children of all
ages and backgrounds, including Palestinians and other Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the center, it was a long segment.
</P>
<P>
   King called down to his driver and told him to bring up the
checkbook. King wrote out a check for $10,000 and gave it to Mrs.
Rabin as she came out of the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does things like that,'' King's spokesman, Howie Evans,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still Dizzy From `Carousel'? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Drama League benefit on Monday provided more
drama than anyone had bargained for.
</P>
<P>
   As the mezzo-soprano Audra McDonald was finishing singing a
tribute to the Broadway-boosting talk-show host Rosie O'Donnell,
Miss McDonald fainted and tumbled off the stage in the ballroom at
the Pierre Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   She landed squarely on Miss O'Donnell's table.
</P>
<P>
   Someone called 911. Barbara Walters, who had been in the
audience, began delivering a medical bulletin over the
public-address system, telling the audience that an ambulance was
on its way and that Miss McDonald was up and walking. Miss Walters
went on to report that Miss McDonald had hyperventilated, then
fainted. Careful correspondent that she is, Miss Walters added,
``She also fainted for her audition for `Carousel,' and then won a
Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss McDonald was admitted to Lenox Hill Hospital. Her manager,
Carol Yaple, said Tuesday that Miss McDonald had been released
after the tests were negative, though she was sore from the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the benefit, Swoosie Kurtz and F. Murray Abraham read
from the script of ``Grease'' in the best Olivier or Barrymore
upper-crust accents. And Mary Tyler Moore, Diane Sawyer, Katie
Couric and Liz Smith danced in a number from ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so self-conscious,'' Ms. Smith said later. ``I'm not a
performer. I don't know why they asked me. They just know I'm a big
ham.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a Caldor Guy From Levittown &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One can take Billy Joel out of Long Island, but one
can't take Long Island out of Billy Joel. As he made clear
backstage at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony at
the Waldorf-Astoria on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   First he praised his hometown of Levittown, the Long Island
community whose cookie-cutter houses were lampooned in the Malvina
Reynolds folk song as ``little boxes made of ticky tacky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Levittown,'' he said after he was inducted. ``This is
not supposed to happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Joel, who turned ``Uptown Girl'' into a top-of-the-charts
hit, proved that he is no uptown guy. Madison Avenue? Not his kind
of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like shopping in Caldor's,'' he said. ``I know they're going
out of business. But they're having great sales now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. The Caldor in Bridgehampton, about 15 miles from
Joel's house in East Hampton, closed on Monday.

LA AWARDED NFL FRANCHISE _ WITH A CATCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The city of Los Angeles was awarded the NFL's 32nd
franchise Tuesday, scheduled to begin play in 2002. But the
measure, approved by a 29-2 vote by league owners, comes with a
catch: The would-be ownership group must tighten up its financial
and stadium plans in six months or the expansion franchise will be
awarded to Houston billionaire Bob McNair.
</P>
<P>
   The league acknowledged Tuesday McNair has a proposal that is
more advanced than that of the two prospective Los Angeles
ownership groups. But the ``attractiveness,'' of the Los Angeles
market gave it a decided edge over Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't deny the dynamics of the Los Angeles market, it
has the second-largest television market and it is the
entertainment capital of the United States, if not the world,''
said Carolina Panthers owner Jerry Richardson, who served on the
expansion committee as stadium committee chairman. Los Angeles is,
``a great place to host Super Bowls. I'd like us to go there for
more Super Bowls, but only when there is a team there.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's Ralph Wilson and Oakland's Al Davis were the owners
who voted against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The league will begin deciding on an ownership group for the Los
Angeles franchise next month, when members of the expansion
committee meet to visit the two stadium sites, and check on the
involvement of the business community with each ownership effort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet officials close to the situation have said the league will
award the Los Angeles franchise to real-estate mogul Ed Roski and
construction giant Eli Broad. Roski and Broad already have an
exclusive agreement with the LA Coliseum for two years. They plan
to spend more than $350 million to make the facility
state-of-the-art. Such construction, Roski said, could be completed
before the 2002 season was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a project together, the venue is great, and our
ownership team we've put together is ready to move forward,'' Roski
said. ``We're ready to go. They (NFL) would just like to come to LA
and spend some time to see how things are.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the other prospective ownership group, headed by
Hollywood superagent Michael Ovitz, has made preliminary plans to
build a $350 million stadium on a waste dump site in Carson, Calif.
They would still have to deal with the cleaning up of hazardous
wastes at the site, and highway infrastructure. Such a venture
would not be expected to be completed until after the 2002 season
began.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Los Angeles city councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas was in
Phoenix on Tuesday declaring his municipality was ready to get
behind the Roski-Broad ownership group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're behind (Roski-Broad) and we believe (Ovitz) will join
forces with the people who are ready to make this happen,''
Ridley-Thomas said. ``And if Ovitz doesn't join with the program,
the show will continue to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, that show has been postponed in Houston. It could be
canceled if the Los Angeles ownership group comes through before
the league imposed Sept. 15 deadline, or if no team decides to
relocate to Houston before McNair's exclusive rights agreement with
the City of Houston to build a partially public funded stadium ends
on Jan. 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still in this thing,'' McNair said, ``but certainly
there is a preference for Los Angeles. There is still a lot to be
done in LA There is not as much passion for football there is there
is in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   The league is expected to vote on instant replay and the sell of

<P>
   PHOENIX _ The Atlanta Falcons added depth and created
competition on their offensive line Tuesday, reaching agreement in
principle with unrestricted free agent guard Greg Bishop in a
two-year deal believed to be worth about $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-round draft choice of the New York Giants in 1993,
Bishop started the past 64 games. He has played both left tackle
and right guard for the Giants and will be used at guard by
Atlanta. Richardson said the addition of Bishop will have no effect
on the future of incumbent starting right guard Gene
Williams.Expansion race

<P>
   Los Angeles is in, at least for now, but Houston is not
necessarily out yet as the league voted Tuesday to add a 32nd
franchise for the 2002 season. By a 29-2 vote, owners approved a
resolution that gives Los Angeles until Sept. 15 to meet
predetermined criteria, including a stadium site, financing for the
facility and evidence of support from the business community. ``If
we get the issues resolved, then Los Angeles will have the
expansion franchise,'' said Denver owner Pat Bowlen, a member of
the finance committee. ``If not, we move on to Houston, which seems
to have its house in order.''

NINE NORTHWEST SALMON SPECIES LISTED AS ENDANGERED, THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HEATH FOSTER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The federal government Tuesday stepped in to do what
the Northwest has failed to do: bring wild salmon back from the
brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Now state and local leaders must start making good on their
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The National Marine Fisheries Service listed nine struggling
salmon sub-species in Washington and Oregon, including the once
bountiful Puget Sound wild chinook, as threatened or endangered
under the Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The much-anticipated listingwill force state and local
governments, foresters, farmers, land and home owners, and even big
city apartment dwellers to make financial sacrifices to reverse
more than a century's worth of environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last hundred years as people have moved out here and
developed this part of the country, we've forced the salmon to
adjust to us,'' said Bill Ruckelshaus, leader of a partnership of
Washington corporations and environmental groups monitoring the
salmon-saving efforts. ``This will force us to adjust to the
fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders from Seattle, King, Snohomish and Pierce
Counties, state government and Indian tribes crowded before the
microphones Tuesday to assure Uncle Sam of their commitment to
restoring the natural habitat and pristine waterways that once
allowed salmon to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   They hope that by pledging stringent new regulations on how much
water their communities use and how much asphalt and concrete is
laid down for new homes and businesses, they can prevent the
federal government from imposing even more draconian measures in
the thickly populated Puget Sound. They're desperate to avoid the
kind of economic paralysis that hit the Olympic penninsula and the
timber industry with the 1990 listing of the spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people understand what (the National Marine
Fisheries Service) did to us today,'' said King County Executive
Ron Sims.
</P>
<P>
   But politicians may not be able to keep some of the promises
they made Tuesday once their constituents take a hard look at the
utility rate hikes and land-use restrictions they're proposing.
</P>
<P>
   Pivotal to Washington's success in keeping federal regulators at
bay is Governor Gary Locke's salmon recovery plan. The $201 million
proposal, designed to give salmon the cool, clean water they need,
is in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Locke's plan would sharply tighten restrictions on water use for
farmers and surburbanites alike, and crack down on illegal
withdrawals. His proposed ``Forest and Fish'' plan, negotiated over
months by the timber industry, state and federal government, and
some tribes, would put 15 percent of existing commercial timber
land permanently out of production. Locke is calling for adding 180
new state employees to enact the recovery effort, shortening salmon
fishing seasons, and forcing developers and private landowners to
expand protection of wetlands and stream-sides.
</P>
<P>
   The first-term governor's ambitious proposal includes the kind
of dramatic, science-backed measures the federal fisheries agency
likes to see. But it's hard to find a Democrat or Republican from a
rural district who is backing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   It is said that average salmon must travel through 28 different
government jurisdictions to reach its spawning grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Rural lawmakers complain Locke's plan concentrates too much on
the fish habitat in Washington, and not nearly enough on the
environment at sea where salmon spend most of their lives. It does
nothing to address the sea lions, terns and Canadian fisherman
capturing Washington salmon, they say.
</P>
<P>
   And it exacts too much flesh from farmers and homeowners without
clearly spelling out how much sacrifice will be enough, they say.
Small timber land owners depending on their property to finance
retirement or a college education shouldn't be forced to give up
land, they say, for vaguely defined fish recovery goals.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Chandler, co-chair of the House Agriculture and Ecology
Committee, hails from Grant County, whose dry land was transformed
60 years ago by the Columbia Basin irrigation project into
sprawling fields of beans and peas. He said Locke's demands that
farmers give up water would rob them of their hopes of ever
expanding their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's plan is centered on taking water from people,''
he said. ``Do that, and you turn off the economy's tap too.
Agriculture is the number one industry in this state, employing the
most people.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists are casting stones at Locke's plan too. They
say the Forest and Fish plan doesn't protect enough stream-side
forest land to guarantee salmon will recover.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schmidt, Gov. Gary Locke's top salmon adviser, cautioned
that with six weeks of the session left, it's premature to predict
the plan's demise.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, Rep. Jim Buck, co-chair of the House Natural Resources
Committee and Dave Mastin, co-chair House's Salmon Restoration Task
force, all rural Republicans, said they're confident they'll
deliver a plan that will satisfy federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens if the Legislature's salmon package lacks the
teeth that the federal government requires?
</P>
<P>
   It may deter federal lawmakers' efforts to get Washington the
money it needs to enact its plans. For instance, Sen. Slade Gorton,
chair of the U.S. Senate Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, is
seeking $210 million more than the $100 million President Clinton
promised for West Coast salmon recovery. Gorton said last week that
it's essential that the Legislature do its share if it wants
federal help.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups and Indian tribes are standing by, ready to
sue to protect salmon where the state does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``If governmental entities don't step up to the plate to protect
society from a species becoming extinct, (litigation) will
happen,'' said Ed Zuckerman, executive director of the Washington
Environmental Alliance for Voter Education.
</P>
<P>
   Such suits would invite federal judges in to dictate exactly how
much salmon protection is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have lived to regret the fact that they opened the
door for such lawsuits. In Massachussetts, an environmental group
sued the state, claiming it had shirked its responsibilities under
the Endangered Species Act by not banning fishing nets that were
catching an endangered species of whale. They won, and state was
prevented from granting permits for the nets.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Volusia County was sued by an environmental group
for failing to adopt an ordinance to dim beach-front lights that
were leading nesting sea turtles into the path of oncoming cars.
That case is now awaiting a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court. At
issue is whether local governments have an obligation to use their
powers to save endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Johnston, a Seattle attorney who specializes in endangered
species law, said environmental groups in Washington could sue the
state for not leaving enough enough water in streams for salmon.
Such a victory could force lawmakers to enact water-use
restrictions they are balking at now.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston said the federal government can also take direct
enforcement action against governments, businesses and even
individuals deemed to be harming fish with their actions. But
proving that fertilizing a lawn or washing a car is harming a fish
in court isn't easy, and Johnston said that's the path the
fisheries agency is least likely to pursue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal fishery officials inisted Tuesday that they're thrilled
with the cooperative spirit they've seen so far in local and state
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Rolland Schmitten, assistant administrator of the agency,
warned, ``please don't mistake our desire to partner as a lack of
commitment. We will (protect the fish) even if we have to do it
alone.''

$212 MILLION MAKE-OVER FOR MEADOWLANDS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Even as the Nets and Devils develop
plans for new arenas elsewhere in the state, the New Jersey Sports
and Exposition Authority on Tuesday proposed building a new $212
million home for the teams in the Meadowlands and replacing the
existing arena with a giant entertainment complex.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed basketball and hockey arena would be built
alongside Giants Stadium, while the 18-year-old Continental
Airlines Arena would be demolished. As part of creating what the
Sports Authority called a ``sports epicenter,'' the new retail and
entertainment complex would feature halls of fame, sports
restaurants like ESPN Zone, movie theaters and retailers like Nike
Town that allow patrons to try out the sporting goods.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Sports and Exposition Authority, a quasi-public
agency that runs the sports complex, made an elaborate presentation
in describing its effort, the plan serves mainly as the
Meadowlands' opening bid in determining a future home for the Nets
and the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   It comes a week after John McMullen, the owner of the Devils
hockey team, released his own plan for a $350 million hockey arena
and entertainment complex in Hoboken. Raymond Chambers and the
other new owners of the Nets have said they intend to move the
basketball team to a new arena in Newark as part of a plan to
revive the state's largest city.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be discussions with the two franchises to see whether
this vision is part of their future,'' said Dennis R. Robinson, the
authority's president. ``I think this plan creates the ultimate
sports and entertainment destination that would benefit all the
teams. It's up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Nets and Devils leave the Meadowlands, Robinson said that
the Sports Authority would still demolish the Continental Airlines
Arena and develop the retail and entertainment complex.
</P>
<P>
   Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for the Nets, declined
comment. McMullen was out of town and could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said that Gov. Christie Whitman's first goal was to
insure that New Jersey remained home to the Nets and the Devils, as
well as the Giants, the Jets and the MetroStars soccer team, all of
which now play in the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the Nets have tried to woo McMullen, but he
has steadfastly resisted any notion of moving the Devils to Newark.
Still, there are ample political and economic reasons for the teams
to cooperate, be it in Newark, Hoboken or the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Sports analysts say that an arena is economically viable only
when it is used by more than one team.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it is unlikely that Whitman would provide
state aid for more than one arena. Although each project would
involve at least some private financing, the teams and the Sports
and Exposition Authority want the state to provide highway and
other transportation improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't build two single-team arenas; the governor's pretty
firm about that,'' said Raymond H. Bateman, chairman of the
authority.

STEFAN SCHNABEL, 87, ACTOR ON STAGE AND TV
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)  (nk) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stefan Schnabel, an actor known for his portrayal of Middle
European characters onstage, in films and on television, died last
Thursday at his home in Rogaro, Italy. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, the actress Marion
Kohler Schnabel.
</P>
<P>
   With his wavy mane of hair, German accent and Continental
manners, Schnabel was expert at playing military officers, teachers
and other professionals in plays by Ibsen, Chekhov, Shaw, Gorky and
Schnitzler.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career with the Old Vic, frequently worked on
Broadway (in musicals as well as plays) and acted in a score of
films. But he achieved his most popular following as Dr. Stephen
Jackson on the soap opera ``Guiding Light,'' a role he played for
17 years.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Berlin, the second son of the celebrated pianist
Artur Schnabel and Therese Behr Schnabel, a concert singer. In
1930, the family left Germany for Italy. Three years later,
Schnabel moved to London, where he joined the Old Vic. In England,
he worked with John Gielgud, Charles Laughton and Maurice Evans and
was in ``Hamlet'' with Laurence Olivier.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, he arrived in New York and acted in thousands of radio
programs. He also appeared onstage in Orson Welles' Mercury Theater
productions and portrayed Lopakhin in the 1944 revival of ``The
Cherry Orchard'' by Eva LeGallienne and Margaret Webster. After
serving in the U.S. Army with the Office of Strategic Services, he
resumed his career, beginning with Welles' production of the
musical version of ``Around the World in 80 Days.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently he was in Peter Ustinov's ``Love of Four
Colonels,'' the musical ``Plain and Fancy'' and ``A Very Rich
Woman'' by Ruth Gordon, and at Lincoln Center in ``In the Matter of
J. Robert Oppenheimer'' and ``Enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Hartford Stage Company, he played a philosophical hotel
manager in Tom Stoppard's adaptation of Schnitzler's ``Undiscovered
Country.'' His last principal role on Broadway was in Mike Nichols'
production of Andrew Bergman's ``Social Security'' in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   His movies included ``Journey into Fear,'' ``Houdini'' and ``The
Counterfeit Traitor.''
</P>
<P>
   The Schnabels, who lived for 45 years in Rowayton, Conn.,
founded the Rainbow Theater in Norwalk, Conn., and appeared
together in ``The Confidential Clerk'' by T.S. Eliot and ``The
Physicists'' by Friedrich Durrenmatt, among other plays. In 1992
the couple moved to Rogaro.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by a brother, the
pianist Karl Ulrich Schnabel of New York City and Tremezzo, Italy;
two sons, Peter H. Schnabel of Abbiategrasso, Italy, and David A.
Schnabel of San Francisco; a daughter, Susan Schnabel Ross of
Seattle, and three grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Schnabel accepted his television soap opera success with
equanimity, pleased that his character grew from a curmudgeonly
physician to a more sympathetic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   As he said in an interview in 1981, ``As an actor, if your role
on a soap opera is long-lasting, it's possibly the only financial
security you know, and it enables you to more or less pick and
choose what you want to do with the rest of your time.''

 &HT;    Just another meal at Gary's house
 &HT;    By Paul Reid
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEWALL'S POINT, Fla. _ Not since Aretha Franklin last dined
alone, has so much soul sat down to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Gary. The Rev. Jesse Jackson. Cris Carter of the
Minnesota Vikings. William Graves, bishop. The Drifters. They all
came to dinner at Gary's house.
</P>
<P>
   The house _ 50 rooms, three kitchens, 14 bathrooms and a worn
Bible in almost every room _ belongs to Stuart attorney Willie Gary
and his wife, Gloria. Gary has trod a long road from a shoeless
childhood in a two-room sharecropper's shack to his Sewall's Point
mansion. Tuesday night his path crossed with that of the president
of the United States. Bill Clinton came to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   So did some 250 Democratic party partisans who ponied up $2,500
apiece to join Gary and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   These Democrats live large. Put a tent over Gary's patio Tuesday
night, and you'd have a revival meeting. Politics meets partying on
the St. Lucie River.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Republicans enjoy life, but when you have Jesse Jackson
over there and Willie Gary here and William Jefferson Clinton in
the middle of the room, you have yourself a party.
</P>
<P>
   This guy lights up a room. The smile, the presence. He can shake
hands to his right, talk straight ahead and make eye contact to his
left. He's good. That's Willie. Gary.
</P>
<P>
   The President isn't half bad, either, at working a crowd. And
Tuesday night he was on. He's so good, he could walk into a
Republican caucus and walk out with endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   He and Gary spoke for more than 30 minutes and the crowd
responded, first with a scattering of ``Amen'' and then with more
and then, almost as one, as first Gary and then the President
sermonized on growing up poor.
</P>
<P>
   The speeches came after a dinner of roast beef with bernaise
sauce, asparagus, roasted potatoes and popovers stuffed with
chicken, all garnished with a sprig of thyme. White rose
centerpieces graced the tables and Turning Leaf merlot flowed
freely.
</P>
<P>
   Think what you will about the man and his politics, Bill Clinton
has a genius for working a crowd. And like it or not, working a
crowd is part of a president's job, whether it's a crowd of 200 or
200 million. You gotta move them. And does he ever. The Drifters
got this crowd primed and Willie Gary got them on their feet, but
Bill Clinton knocked them down.
</P>
<P>
   This is a man whose every secret has been aired in the public
square. With grace and good humor, he moved through Gary's home,
chin up, smile in place. If most presidents don't have much of a
private life, he has none. He was on display, X-rayed by 200 pairs
of eyes. More than a few people whispered, ``How does he do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Gary said that the President was among friends. And, Gary said,
he can count on this man as a friend long after he's out of office.

 ALBANY DEMOCRATS URGE 4.6% BUDGET INCREASE  (dal) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The Democrats who control the Assembly called
Tuesday for a 4.6 percent rise in state spending, more than double
the increase Gov. George E. Pataki has proposed, setting the
boundaries for another fierce budget fight.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki assailed the Democrats' plan as irresponsible, raising
the prospect that like last year, he might veto most of the money
the Legislature adds to his proposed budget. Pataki has proposed a
$72.66 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts April 1,
while the Assembly Democrats describe their plan as $2 billion
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the difference lies in the Democrats' rejection of
Pataki's proposed cuts in health care and education. Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver said his house's plan ``rejects the
devastating cuts that would have been funded on the backs of our
children and on the backs of working families and senior
citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   After an 8 percent increase in the budget last year, when he was
running for re-election, Pataki has called for a 1.8 percent rise
this year, vowing to keep the increase within the rate of
inflation, despite a $2 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats charge that the governor is trying to impress
conservatives in other states as he looks toward a possible
campaign for national office next year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan released Tuesday is just the Democrats' opening bid,
but the gap between it and the governor's proposal fed a growing
resignation here to the prospect of a late budget for the 15th
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki; Joseph L. Bruno, the Republican majority leader of the
Senate, and Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat, all predicted
Tuesday that a budget would not be passed by April 1.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the Democrats' plan, Pataki said, ``We have not
seen anything to remotely justify the level of spending we're
seeing from the Assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, said tax revenues were
growing so quickly that his plan would set aside $1 billion from
the current surplus for future needs and still run up an additional
$1.3 billion surplus next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's Republican majority has not released a detailed
budget plan, but Bruno said Tuesday that his house would seek about
$800 million, or 1.1 percent, more than the governor, putting the
two houses $1.2 billion apart.
</P>
<P>
   Budget negotiations between the two houses are stalled on the
fundamental question of how much money is available, and have not
yet even touched on how it will be spent. Silver said he would name
members of budget conference committees on Wednesday, leaving just
two weeks in the fiscal year for the committees to strike deals.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, the governor and the two legislative leaders met
privately to reach a compromise budget. Then last year, the
Legislature met in conference committees to hash out a budget
publicly, without the governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki demonstrated, by broad use of his line-item veto
power, that the new process had freed him from the need to
compromise, increasing his power over the budget.
</P>
<P>
   Silver says he remains committed to conference committees, which
rank-and-file Assembly members enjoyed because it gave them more
say in the process. But aides say he is still searching for a way
to avoid a repeat of last year, slowing talks with the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The April 1 deadline carries new weight this year, because the
law passed in December that gave state officials a pay raise also
requires that legislators' salaries be withheld as long as the
budget is late. If the budget is more than a few weeks late, the
delay in being paid could present a serious hardship for many
lawmakers, adding to the pressure to reach a settlement.

JULE EISENBUD, 90, PARAPSYCHOLOGY RESEARCHER KNOWN FOR
`THOUGHTOGRAPHS'
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Jule Eisenbud, a psychiatrist, author and researcher best
known for his work in parapsychology, particularly his
controversial experiments with Ted Serios, a Chicago bellhop who
appeared to be able to project mental images onto photographic
film, died last Wednesday in Denver. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenbud researched numerous areas of psychiatry,
psychoanalysis, anthropology and hypnosis during his career. His
opinions were also sought on issues ranging from the Kinsey Report
on Male Sexuality to racial prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the courage to explore the unknown,'' said Patrice
Keane, executive director of the American Society for Psychical
Research in New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was Eisenbud's work with Serios, however, that gained him
broader recognition and, to some degree, ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``The World of Ted Serios'' (William Morrow &AMP; Co.,
1967), Eisenbud described Serios' ``thoughtographs,'' which were
said to be dream-like images captured on film, a la Uri Geller's
bending of a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   The book was criticized in a review in The New York Times by
H.J. Eysenck, a professor of psychology at the University of London
and the author of a dozen books, including ``Sense and Nonsense in
Psychology.'' Eysenck wrote, ``Dr. Eisenbud seems to have little
notion of what experiments are and less liking for the rigors and
methodological niceties of scientific research.''
</P>
<P>
   Eysenck also wrote that trickery probably produced the
photographs, although no one, to this day, has been able to show
just how such a trick was performed. ``The possibilities are that
Ted was the culprit, and Eisenbud and his friends the dupes, or
that Eisenbud was an accomplice,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Keane said Eisenbud's professional standing helped shield
him from the sting of such criticism. ``He was brilliant,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She added that Eisenbud's legacy would not be the Serios
photographs but rather ``his observations on how unconscious
processes affect psychic functioning will illuminate the path of
psychical research for years to come.''.
</P>
<P>
   Jule Eisenbud was born in New York on Nov. 20, 1908. He received
bachelor's and medical degrees from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, he began private practice in psychiatry and
psychoanalysis. In 1950, he moved to Denver with his family, where
he continued his private practice and became associate clinical
professor of psychiatry at the University of Colorado Medical
School. He was the first psychoanalyst to establish a private
practice in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenbud was a fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, a
member of the American Psychoanalytic Association and a charter
member of the Parapsychological Association. He also joined with
Dr. Jan Ehrenwald, Dr. Montague Ullman and other physicians in
forming the medical section of the American Society for Psychical
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenbud's wife, Molly, died in 1995. He is survived by two
sons, John and Dr. Eric Eisenbud, and a daughter, Joanna Moldow,
all of Denver, as well as five grandchildren and one
great-grandchild.

C. CLYDE ATKINS, FEDERAL JUDGE IN REFUGEES' CASE, DIES AT 84
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (nk) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   C. Clyde Atkins, a senior judge and former chief judge of
federal District Court in Miami, died last Thursday at Mercy
Hospital in Miami. A resident of Miami, he was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was colon cancer, said his secretary, Diana
Johnson-Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins, a nominee of President Lyndon B. Johnson, drew national
attention as an effective defender of the homeless in his
jurisdiction who set an example for officials elsewhere. But his
efforts to shield Cuban and Haitian refugees from deportation ran
counter to official policy in the Bush and Clinton administrations,
which eventually won on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, he held that the city of Miami had violated the
Constitution by letting the police systematically harass and chase
the homeless off the streets, often destroying their meager
possessions in the process. He ordered local authorities to create
two ``safe zones'' where the homeless might eat and sleep without
fear of arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The city first said it would appeal that ruling but later agreed
to out-of-court negotiations that resolved the matter in late 1997
after nearly 10 years of litigation. The agreement between Miami
officials and the American Civil Liberties Union, which was
supervised by Atkins, called for educating police officers on the
causes of homelessness and the needs and rights of homeless people.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as a model for other cities, the settlement established
a system to help the homeless with shelter, job training,
counseling and other assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins' championship of civil liberties led him to spar for
years with the Bush and Clinton administrations over the fate of
thousands of Cuban and Haitian boat people held at the U.S. Naval
Base at Guantanamo, Cuba. His preliminary injunctions on their
behalf were overturned by appeals judges ruled that the refugees,
not being in the United States proper, could claim no right of
asylum.
</P>
<P>
   In another noted ruling issued in 1970 after poet Allen Ginsberg
had his microphone cut off when he used obscenities in a reading at
Miami Marine Stadium, Atkins ordered the city to give the poet
another reading, free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Freedom of expression,'' he wrote, ``is a sacred
constitutional right.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Clyde Atkins was born in Washington and graduated from the
University of Florida Law School in 1936. He went into practice
that year in Stuart, Fla., at the age of 21.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to Miami in 1941 and worked there as a law partner
until he was sworn in as a federal district judge in August 1966.
In his early years on the bench, he was randomly assigned some
cases that later brought him considerable public attention,
including the desegregation of the Dade County and St. Lucie County
school systems, the Ginsberg poetry case, a National Airlines
strike and an environmental dispute involving Florida Power and
Light's Turkey Point nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
   He served as chief judge from 1977 to 1983. He then took senior
status but continued with a heavy work load and also sat on panels
of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit. He was a
prominent Roman Catholic layman and, from 1989 to 1995, served as
Miami regional chairman of the National Conference of Christians
and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Atkins is survived by his wife of 61 years, Esther Castillo
Atkins; a daughter, Julie A. Landrigan of Arlington, Va.; seven
grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: THE YEAR CHINA POLICY WENT AWRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 17:
</P>
<P>
   Untangling the various strands of the Clinton administration's
China policy will not be easy in the politically charged atmosphere
that prevails in Congress on this issue. But it is essential that
the multiple investigations now under way yield a dispassionate
assessment of whether the White House was lackadaisical about
protecting American security interests, and whether 1996 Clinton
campaign fund-raising distorted policy making.
</P>
<P>
   The White House bridles at such speculation, but it has only
itself to blame for the public concern that the Clinton re-election
campaign may have infected the handling of China in improper ways.
It may well be, as the White House insists, that the turn in China
policy in 1996 from confrontation toward cooperation was
scrupulously insulated from campaign activities. On such a serious
charge, the White House deserves the benefit of the doubt unless
hard evidence to the contrary is produced.
</P>
<P>
   But the picture of potentially overlapping interests in 1996
bears review. Just as the Clinton campaign was eagerly accepting
large donations from contributors who were linked to China or eager
to do business there, the administration was rethinking its policy
and fumbling the first of several warnings that China might be
stealing advanced nuclear weapons designs from the United States.
Congressional leaders must coordinate the work of various House and
Senate committees to look closely at this sequence of events.
</P>
<P>
   There was good reason to reconsider China policy. Relations were
rocky, and 1996 opened with a confrontation over Chinese threats
against Taiwan. Tensions subsided, but both countries were shaken
by the crisis, which included the dispatch of American naval forces
to waters off Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   The subsequent White House review of China policy, it is now
clear, coincided with other developments that could have filtered
into the effort to stabilize relations. American corporate
executives with commercial interests in China were generously
donating to the Democratic Party. Shadowy sources possibly linked
to the Chinese government were making large contributions to the
Clinton campaign that were later found to be improper.
</P>
<P>
   Congress needs to see if the administration's hesitant handling
of the Los Alamos espionage case was shaped in any way by a desire
to avoid any new upheaval in relations with China. It is hard to
understand why the first notification of possible spying at Los
Alamos in April 1996 did not immediately lead the White House to
demand the most intensive investigation possible and to order
tightened security at the lab. The White House, the Energy
Department and the Justice Department let the case drift for
months, even though one Energy aide was closely monitoring the spy
matter and another quickly ordered enhanced security. His orders
were delayed. Congressional leaders say they were not adequately
informed about the possible theft of vital nuclear weapons
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The administration must give Rep. Christopher Cox and his select
committee on China wide latitude in declassifying their report on
the transfer of sensitive military technology to the Chinese. It is
especially important to determine if campaign contributions played
any role in the misguided White House decision in 1996 to make it
easier for American companies to export communications satellites
with potential military applications. One panel member, Democrat
Norm Dicks, reports that all the officials who testified before the
committee denied that campaign considerations played any role in
managing relations with China. If they were correct, the White
House should not fear publication of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at the events of 1996, it is interesting to find
that Warren Christopher, who was then completing his tenure as
Secretary of State, remained wary about rushing to embrace China.
Though armed with a new policy of engagement as he made his way to
China for the last time that November, Christopher dropped the word
``partnership'' from the speech he delivered in Shanghai. It
``sounded a little too cozy,'' he recalled later in his book ``In
the Stream of History.'' The mystery is why so many of his
colleagues failed to see the same thing.

EDITORIAL: THE POLICE AND THE CITIZENS
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, March 17:
</P>
<P>
   The civic muscle that holds New York City together suddenly
feels taut, strained by the danger of communities fracturing along
racial lines. The shooting of an unarmed West African last month by
four white policemen has focused these tensions among New Yorkers,
not only in the ordinary street and subway encounters but also in
official settings like One Police Plaza, where former Mayor David
Dinkins, Rep. Charles Rangel and others invited ceremonial arrests
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani labeled the Dinkins demonstration a
``great publicity stunt'' by his unappeasable political foes. But
he needs to look past the symbolism of these protests to the
substance behind them. There he will find a major test of mayoral
leadership that will weigh heavily in judgments about the success
of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's first term was marked by a remarkable decline in
crime. But his second has seen a disturbing spike in tension
between police and the minority community and a sharp polarization
in black and white attitudes toward the police. A New York Times
poll released Monday found that nearly 9 out of 10 black residents
believe that the police often engage in brutality. Almost
three-quarters of the whites interviewed, by contrast, approve of
how the mayor is handling crime.
</P>
<P>
   This racial polarization is not an invention of the media nor a
public-opinion hiccup generated by a few publicity-seeking
activists. It is a serious civic lament that requires both private
and public leadership from the mayor. Giuliani's aides say that the
mayor has been working hard to defuse the issue in private. He has
publicly expressed regret about the shooting of Amadou Diallo, the
unarmed West African killed in a spray of 41 bullets on Feb. 4. He
has also given speeches admonishing police and police cadets to be
respectful to civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Even a task force report on police-community relations issued
after the torture of Abner Louima while in police custody has
survived the mayor's early mocking to become the structure for a
number of recent changes at the Police Department. Police
Commissioner Howard Safir now says that 84 percent of the task
force recommendations under his department's control have been
started or fully launched. Those changes include more diversity
training for police and focusing on how officers deal with the
public, as well as more contacts between police and community
leaders and extra programs for young people. A $10 million
recruitment drive aimed at city residents is expected to increase
the numbers of minority police.
</P>
<P>
   All these steps are positive, but something larger is needed. We
urge Giuliani to undertake a high-profile public campaign designed
not to refute his political rivals but to calm a diverse and
anxious city. He has moved in that direction with his speeches to
police and his demand that officers abandon the ``disrespectful
attitude'' that feeds charges of brutality and racism. But
sometimes true leadership requires bigger gestures, both as a way
of protecting a political legacy and a matter of calming tensions
of the moment. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty years ago, when Maurice Ashley was 14 and
living in Brownsville, Brooklyn, he was soundly defeated in an
offhand game of chess. Embarrassed and angry, he dug up a paperback
on the game, intending to brush up, to learn a trick or two.
Instead, he fell deeply in love.
</P>
<P>
   The book was about Paul Morphy, a 19th-century Louisianian who
was America's first great player. ``I was stunned,'' he said
Tuesday. ``There were such dazzling plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since that first glimpse of the vastness and intriguing
possibilities of chess, Ashley, an immigrant from Jamaica, has
focused his life on the game. On Monday, he reached the pinnacle of
his passion: He became the latest of the world's 470 grandmasters,
and the first black person to reach the game's highest rank.
</P>
<P>
   Since that first epiphany, Ashley's life has been centered on
chess: playing it, studying it, coaching it and training for it. As
a student at Brooklyn Technical High School, he joined the Black
Bear School of Chess, a loosely defined group of young
African-American chess fanatics in Brooklyn. The young men, who
were mostly in their late teens or early 20s, would gather on
Friday nights for ``chess rumbles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were fighters, gladiators,'' Ashley said. ``You couldn't
enter this group without being ready to go to war. Nobody would
leave until Sunday. They'd shower, sleep a little, and get up and
play. Many a girlfriend was lost over weekend chess rumbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite an inability to play chess, Ashley's girlfriend,
Michele, hung on and became his wife. They have a 4-year-old
daughter, Nia, who does play. They live in the Park Slope section
of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In the clubby, eccentric world of chess, Ashley is known for his
straightforwardness, clarity and determined playing style, said
Allen Kaufman, executive director of Chess-in-the-Schools, a
nonprofit organization that provides expert players to teach chess
in schools in low-income neighborhoods in the New York metropolitan
area.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley attained the rank of grandmaster on Monday as a result of
his play in a tournament sponsored by the Manhattan Chess Club. The
rank is conferred by the International Chess Federation to players
who amass a set number of points in 24 official games played within
a seven-year period, said Eric C. Johnson, assistant director of
the U.S. Chess Federation. Of the federation's 85,000 members, 45
are grandmasters, including 10 in the New York City area, Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before winning his last points Monday, Ashley's rank was
international master, one step below grandmaster.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1997, Ashley was the chess director of the Harlem
Educational Activities Fund, at which he led teams, including one
known as the Dark Knights of Mott Hall, to three national
championships. Three players on the teams won individual
championships in their age groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with coaching,'' Ashley said. ``I fell in love
with the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   But two years ago, he stepped out of coaching to devote all his
time and attention to his dream. ``I was very frustrated,'' he
said. ``My life's dream was to become a grandmaster, and my dream
was on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   He adopted a training routine as rigorous as a prizefighter's.
He worked with a coach and spent hours every day playing and
studying, and attacking his weaknesses, including what he said was
a tendency to drift a bit.
</P>
<P>
   There was the added weight of trying to become the first black
grandmaster. ``It was enormous pressure,'' he said. ``I could not
go to a chess tournament without hearing the question, `Where are
you going to do it?' So many people wanted this to happen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   During the game he won that propelled him to grandmaster status,
his opponent moved a rook to attack Ashley's rook, a misstep that
allowed Ashley to move his bishop to attack his opponent's queen.
When he saw his opponent's mistake, Ashley said, he froze. Before
him was grandmastership, his life's goal. What if, in his terror,
he dropped his bishop?
</P>
<P>
   Since his triumph, he has had a chance to reflect on his
achievement as the first black grandmaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it much sweeter,'' he said. ``It's not significant to
me to be the best black chess player in the world. But it is sweet
to be the first.''
</P>
<P>
   What now? ``I have no idea,'' he said. ``I'm still a beginner,
as far as I'm concerned. There's so much to learn. The game is
still fresh for me.''
