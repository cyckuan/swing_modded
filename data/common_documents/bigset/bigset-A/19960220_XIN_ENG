<HEADLINE> Palestinians Celebrate Eid el-Fitr To End Ramadan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinians in the Gaza
Strip and West Bank today celebrated Eid el-Fitr, which marks the
end of the holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat attended early
morning prayers in Gaza and visited a cemetery to pay his respect
to the dead.
</P>
<P>
In Gaza city a ceremony was held in memory of those who died
during the intifada period.
</P>
<P>
During the day, Arafat also visited the family of Sheikh Ahmed
Yassin, spiritual leader of the Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas), who has been held in Israel's prison since 1989. He
emphasized that to secure Yassin's release was one of his top
priorities, saying he raised the issue with Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres during a recent meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hamas also organized its own prayer rally, during
which it called for more attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the Palestinian territories, several Islamic leaders
 appealed to Palestinians to assemble for prayers on land
confiscated by Israel for building five by-pass roads for Jewish
settlers.
</P>
<P>
This evening, all Moslem families gathered together for the
traditional Eid el-Fitr feast to break the fasting period of
Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Today, Deputy Defense Minister Orri Orr visited Hebron and
told Mayor Elias Freij that the closure imposed on the West Bank
and Gaza Strip last week will be gradually eased.
</P>
<P>
Orr also pledged that Israel will complete troop redeployment
from most parts of the city by the end of March, as previously
planned.

<HEADLINE> Slovak Envoy Wishes Better Cooperation With Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak government is
looking forward to enhancing economic and cultural cooperation
with Nigeria, the Slovak envoy has said.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria today quoted Slovak Ambassador to
Nigeria Aton Hajduk as saying that both countries should
encourage exchanges in the sectors of machine building, glass making
and textile produciton, where Slovakia is willing to share its
expertise with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Exchanges should be worked out in other fields such as in the
production of cocoa, vegetables, fruits and flowers, the envoy
added.
</P>
<P>
The Slovak ambassador also wished to engender closer
people-to-people co-operation by promoting cultural exchanges
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Last September, Nigerian dances staged performances in the
Slovak capital, Bratislava, achieving great success.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia, with a population of 5.2 million, emerged a
sovereign state on January 1, 1993, from the collapse of former
Czechslovakia in eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> S.African Minister Says No Change In Exchange Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government would not seek market or inflation control by changing
its foreign exchange policy, Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg
reiterated today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to delegates at an investment conference here,
Liebenberg said he was delighted with the manner in which the
country had come through the foreign exchange crisis on Thursday
and Friday last week.
</P>
<P>
The government had not "wilted under the pressure" to change
its policies on exchange controls, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's currency Rand dropped 11 cents on Friday on
rumors over President Nelson Mandela's health and speculation
about the removal of exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
The local unit continued its decline on Monday, closing at a
new record low of 3.8450 to the U.S. dollar at Johannesburg Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Liebenberg said the Reserve Bank's lack of action to
strengthen the currency last week proved "beyond any doubt" that
the bank was not targeting the exchange rates to control
inflation.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Defector Leave Amman for Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Hussein Kamel, top-level Iraqi
defector, left here today for Baghdad, Jordan's official news
agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel, together with his brother Saddam Kamel and their
wives, both daughters of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, drove out
of Amman in a convoy.
</P>
<P>
The convoy was accompanied to Jordan's eastern border by Iraqi
Ambassador to Jordan Nouri Elwayes.
</P>
<P>
Petra quoted Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti as
saying in a statement today that Kamel sent a letter of thanks to
King Hussein of Jordan before his departure to Baghdad this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that Kamel's return to Iraq is of his
own choice.
</P>
<P>
Kamel, former director of Saddam Hussein's secret weapon
programs, said here Monday that he would return to Iraq with his
wife and children "within days" after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein "welcomed" his return from exile in Jordan, local daily
Jordan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Kamel's defection to Jordan last August and his call for
overthrowing the Iraqi government were widely seen as a major blow
to the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
Kamel said: "I am ready to return to Iraq without
conditions... Iraq is my country, even though there have been
differences of opinion. My country has begun paving the road
toward comfort and confidence."
</P>
<P>
He declined to say if Saddam has forgiven him for his August 8
defection, which severely embarrassed the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was ready to stand trial in Iraq for his
actions.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to face a court, answer its questions and submit
to a possible punishment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kamel failed to rally Iraqi opposition groups behind him after
his defection, and they described his change of tune to the fact
that he has now run out of options.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants anything to do with him, especially the
opposition, which has not forgotten his role in the repression in
Iraq," the daily quoted an exiled opposition figure said as saying
Monday.
</P>
<P>
After the initial excitement provoked by his defection died
down, Arab countries and the United States also came to the view
that Kamel was not a viable alternative to Saddam's government,
the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here said his overtures to Baghdad may not
be enough to win over the Iraqi president, who publicly described
Kamel as a "traitor" after his defection.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Kamel's return to Iraq indicates
there may be some differences between him and the Jordanian
government on the future of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jordan proposed federation for Iraq last year,
Kamel threatened that he will end his stay in Jordan and go to a
third country if Jordan insists on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also noted that on February 18, one day before Kamel
disclosed his planned return to Iraq, Jordan allowed an Iraqi
opposition party, the Iraqi National Accord, to establish its
regional headquarters in Amman.

<HEADLINE> Mandela To Call Zeroural to Mend Tie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela is expected to make a phone call to Algerian
President Liamine Zeroural in a bid to patch up soured diplomatic
ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The move follows an official protest from the Algerian
government about Mandela's meeting with a delegation of the
outlawed Islamic Salvation Front headed by Algeria's opposition
leader Anour Haddam in Pretoria last week.
</P>
<P>
The protest accused Mandela of "meddling in Algeria's internal
affairs."
</P>
<P>
However, "things are on the verge of being sorted out," said
Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana who added that an official
statement would follow on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo had
held talks with Algerian Ambassador to Pretoria Said Kitouni who
had described Mandela's meeting with Algeria's fundamentalist
group as a "provocation and an insult to the victims of
terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Arab ambassadors to South Africa also met in Pretoria today to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
In a statement from Washington, Haddam said he had urged
Mandela during their Pretoria meeting to approach the
Organization of African Unity to express the urgent need for "a
global, political and just solution to the Algerian crisis."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of lives have been lost in Algeria in the terrorist
attacks since the annulment of the 1992 general elections.

JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo leaves for Rome on Wednesday for the two-day
trade talks with the European Union, said an official statement.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Italian Foreign Minister Susanna Agnelli who

Affairs Council, Nzo is expected to urge the EU to strike a free
trade agreement between South Africa and EU at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The South Africa-EU free trade talks were deadlocked late last

certain provisions of the agreement.

<P>
Nzo will also talk with Agnelli on ways to enhance the
bilateral trade ties between South Africa and Italy.
</P>

After his Rome tour, Nzo will leave for Addis Ababa to attend

<HEADLINE> Mozambique, S. Africa Launches Economic Coop Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique and South Africa
have launched a grandiose plan to build a "Development Corridor"
between Maputo, capital of Mozambique, and Witbank, just east of
Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at boosting the economy along the railways
and roads between the commercial centers of the two southern
African nations.
</P>
<P>
"If the development corridor idea catches alight, there is a
possibility you would double the GDP (gross domestic product) for
the southern part of Mozambique in five years," visiting South
African Transport Minister Mac Maharaj said here after launching
of the plan on Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the governments of both countries had decided to
invest 300 million US dollars to build a quality highway linking
Maputo and Witbank, a satellite industrial town of Johannesburg,
15 million to rehabilitate the Maputo-Witbank Railway.
</P>
<P>
And the 20 million Maputo Port dredging project, which serves
South Africa's industrial heartland around Johannesburg, some 500
kms away, is already underway.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, co-launching the project, Mozambican Minister of
Public Works and Housing Robert White disclosed that the two
governments would co-sponsor an international conference to
attract investment on the "Development Corridor" project.
</P>
<P>
And public bidding is scheduled to be held before May for the
construction of the Corridor Highway, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a joint coordinating committee had been set up to
study the feasibility of the various projects of the ambitious
economic plan.

<HEADLINE> Meeting Between Tanzania, Donors Put Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between the
Tanzanian government and donors, that was to be held on February
13 in Paris, France, has been postponed to a date to be fixed
later this year.
</P>
<P>
The world Bank Representative to Tanzania, Mr. Ronald Brigish,
told reporters here on Monday that there were several issues that
should be cleared before the meeting was held, during which the
government and donors were expected to discuss increased aid to
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the World Bank recently sent an economic memorandum on
Tanzania to the government. He said the World Bank and relevant
government authorities would meet to deliberate on the report.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Brigish said officials from the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) headquarters were also in Tanzania for talks with the
government on the budget.
</P>
<P>
"I hope after gathering the necessary background, we will be
ready for the consultative group meeting. I don't know exactly
when the date will be fixed, but may be next month or April," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to discuss Tanzania's external
financing needs and review the country's progress in
macro-economic management, including efforts in collection of
the government revenue and control of public spending.
</P>
<P>
Several donors had frozen aid to Tanzania, particularly
in relation to the balance of payment support, since late 1994,
following reports that over 70 billion Tanzania Shillings (about
127 million US dollars) in tax revenue was not collected by the
government due to tax evasion and illegal exemptions.

<HEADLINE> Large Number of Serbs Continue Fleeing Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 7,500 Serbs in Hadzici,
a Serb Sarajevo municipality, who do not want to live in the
Muslim-Croat federation, have so far registered in Bratunac, a
Serb city in eastern Bosnia
</P>
<P>
The Tanjug news agency quoted a statement released by the
Bratunac Housing Committee today as saying that the committee has
provided accommodation to 82 of the 320 Serb families which moved
out of Hadzici to Bratunac.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bosnian peace agreement, five Serb Sarajevo sectors,
including Hadzici, will be reverted to the control of the
Muslim-Croat federation by March 19 to make the capital a united
city. However, thousands of Serbs living in these affected
districts would rather leave than stay in Sarajevo that will be
ruled by their former enemies.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the rest of the 320 families have been
temporarily accommodated in two schools where they get food as
well. These are mainly families of the Serb Army soldiers and
officers who have been either killed or invalided out of the army.
</P>
<P>
Bratunac can accommodate another 3,000 persons in the available
housing facilities, it added.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Serbs have left Sarajevo for other Serb areas to
escape possible retaliation by the Muslims even though they were
assured safety by the international community and NATO-led peace
Implementation Force (IFOR) troops. Many of them have even burned
their houses and taken the coffins of their dead relatives with
them for reburial.
</P>
<P>
The Serb government set up an operational staff last Friday to
organize the exodus of the Serb Sarajevans who do not trust the
Muslim government. A mass exodus of Serb Sarajevans will deal a
blow to the peace agreement and to the Muslim government which
wants to see a unified and multi-ethnic Sarajevo.

<HEADLINE> Tough Times for Orphaned Children in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The majority of children whose
parents died from aids-related diseases are facing severe
economic problems and many of them have resorted to begging for
food and other needs, the Zimbabwe National News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of Emakhandeni home-based care group Evelyn
Magonya told the agency that the situation is particularly
desperate for children both of whose parents succumbed to the
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
Health experts estimate that throughout the country, over 300
people are dying of aids every week, creating a frighteningly
high orphan population.
</P>
<P>
Magonya said the children are suffering silently due to the
harsh economic environment as most of them were being forced to
drop out of school, ending up on the streets begging.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is now desperate. The department of social
welfare says it has no money to help out," said Magonya.
</P>
<P>
One of the family of five orphans aged between 4 and 13 years,
now being looked after by an unemployed 92-year-old grandmother,
had virtually no food in the house, she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's police today
launched its service charter which commits the force to providing
effective and efficient service to the public through defined
expected standards of performance.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of Police Augustine Chihuri told journalists at
the launch in Harare that the charter is, among other issues,
aimed at reducing crime and ensuring expeditious investigation of
reported cases.
</P>
<P>
He said the police would strive to attend to crime scenes at
the shortest possible time and to follow up on all information
received through hot lines and suggestion boxes.
</P>
<P>
The public were also expected to inform the officer in charge
of police stations in their areas in the event of their being
dissatisfied with service being offered by members of the force.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner also assured that the police would answer all
telephone calls within 10 seconds (or three rings) and reply
letters requiring response within seven days of date of receipt.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the use of firearms in congested areas, he said
that was still an area of concern, adding that a number of
officers were undergoing training on the safe use of such
weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We shall observe the utmost forbearance in the use of
firearms. We will use firearms only as a last resort when no
other means are possible," he said.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- One of the students remained
in the Prince of Wales Hospital here for treatment of their
injuries sustained during a killer hill fire 10 days ago died in
the hospital tonight.
</P>
<P>
A brief statement issued tonight by the hospital said that Yu
Hiu-woon, a girl, injured in the Pat Sin Leng hill fire, passed
away tonight "despite of full efforts by the hospital to save her
life."
</P>
<P>
She was one of the six hospitalized students in critical

to survive.
</P>
<P>
A media briefing will be held in the hospital tomorrow morning,
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Spokesman: U.S. not to Exert Pressure on Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. are willing to
advise the Turkish government to take some steps towards the
solution of the Cyprus problem but they do not intend to exert
pressure, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides said here
today.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting at his daily press briefing on recent
information that pressure was to be exerted on Turkey by
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides noted that the Americans gave to the Cyprus
government the picture that "they will try in the direction of
Ankara but they did not give us to understand that they will exert
pressure on Turkey."
</P>
<P>
Referring to Monday's meeting between Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides and the Director of the Office of Southern European
Affairs at the U.S. State Department, Carey Cavanaugh, the
spokesman said the U.S. official's visit to Cyprus aimed at
reaffirming the U.S. intention to use their good services in the
efforts to solve the Cyprus problem, without the personal
involvement of Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke, who
resigns from his post this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. initiative on Cyprus would start after the formation
of a government in Turkey, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said that Washington expresses fears for a
possible new Greco-Turkish crisis, this time in Cyprus, similar
to that in the Aegean sea last month.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he said, the Americans want to speed up
efforts for a solution of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides repeated why President Clerides does not expect
developments in the Cyprus problem in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He cited two reasons for President Clerides' opinion, namely
the delay in forming a government in Ankara and the
U.S. presidential elections next November.
</P>
<P>
"These are two negative and independent factors, which do not
send a hopeful message," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The problem has remained unsolved for the part 21 years
despite all U.N. and international peace efforts for a political
settlement.

He is the fifth minister to quit the Rao's government since the

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says Talks with UN Likely to Resume in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi deputy Premier Tariq
Aziz said today that Iraq's negotiations with U.N. on oil for food
deal concluded Monday was positive and is likely to resume in March.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official was commenting on the outcome of the first
round of talks on the sale of Iraqi oil for food, medicine and
other basic needs of the Iraqi people suffering from five years of
trade sanctions imposed on the country by U.N. in August 1990 for
its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the two-week sessions of talks tackled all
aspects of the oil for food and medicine which involves a lot of
details that should be discussed to reach an agreeable formula for
both sides. Both delegations, he said, will report on what has
been agreed or not. The U.N. team will report to the
U.N. Secretary General while the Iraqi delegation will report to
the Iraqi leadership, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that following a study of the outcome of the first
round of technical talks by the leadership in Iraq and the
U.N. Secretary General, Iraq and the U.N. will set a date and
method for further talks which will probably be in March.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that both sides have exchanged views on a wide and
detailed scale to reach a common understanding of all aspects of
the oil-for-food issue.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency (INA) quoted Hans Gorel, head of the
U.N. team, as saying that the two sides have exchanged a working
paper. He described the two-week sessions as very "important."
</P>
<P>
The working paper stressed that the talks tackled a wide range
of technical matters that should be settled to prepare the ground
for the political discussion of the issue in the coming stage of
the talks between the two sides, INA said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, previously rejected the U.N. offer under U.N. resolution
986 allowing 2 billion dollars worth of oil export over six
months to buy food and medicine for its people, now is anxious for
a positive outcome in the talks with U.N. on oil-for-food
deal. However, the talks in next stage is by no means an easy job
for Iraqis because of the tough stance taken by the U.S. and
Britain on Iraq's partial oil sale for humanitarian purposes.

unforgetable: spending Spring Festival in a luxury hotel for the
very first time, along with 49 other orphans.
</P>
<P>
Buddhists and businessmen from Shanghai had arranged the
special day for the kids, most of them from the Shanghai
Orphanage, at the Longhua Guest House.
</P>
<P>
The gathering began with a dance by a group of orphans,
accompanied by a song by Gong Chang, who has a disability but is
now a student at a key middle school.
</P>
<P>
Monks from Shanghai's temples called on the children, to wish
them a happy New Year.
</P>
<P>
"They are really happy kids. And the government is the best
I've ever seen," said Ming Yang, abbot of Longhua Temple.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhuqing, head of the Shanghai Orphanage, said that many
people visited the orphanage during Spring Festival. "Huang Ju,
secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist
Party of China, gave them gifts, and Xie Lijuan, vice-mayor, even
invited an orphan to her home," she told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Many donations came from enterprises, news media, and other
organizations, she noted, and workers at the Longhua Guest House
arranged various activities for the children, including a tour of
Shanghai, China's largest industrial city.
</P>
<P>
It has become a regular feature of such organizations to invite
orphans during the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
In north China's Shijiazhuang City, a party was held on the eve
of Lunar New Year. "I am a happy man," said Wang Jian, 24, who
spent his childhood in an orphanage there. He had returned to
extend greetings to the children.
</P>
<P>
"Workers here gave me greater care than my parents could," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Grounded Tanker May Have Leaked 50,000 Tons of Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The oil tanker Sea Empress that
ran aground off Wales may already have leaked 50,000 tons of oil,
about one third of the vessel's cargo, according to salvage
experts today.
</P>
<P>
BBC television quoted salvage experts as saying that there is
no sign of the tanker breaking up and salvage teams will try to
move the tanker again later today.
</P>
<P>
The salvage teams and the tanker's crew were evacuated Monday
night when blizzards and strong winds hit many parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard spokesman said today that the midship section of
the stranded vessel had been damaged and more crude oil was
expected to leak.
</P>
<P>
Bird hospitals have been set up along the coast of Wales to
treat stricken wild birds while environmentalists have called for
the British government to declare the area a disaster zone.
</P>
<P>
The tanker, carrying 147,000 tons of oil and 28 crew members,
ran aground last Thursday off the southwestern coast of Wales near
the port of Milford Haven, close to a famous seabird haven.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst such accident in Britain since the supertanker
Braer broke up on rocks in the Shetland Isles off the northern tip
of Scotland in January 1993, spilling 80,000 tons of oil.

<P>
MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) and the
Philippines today launched a new economic cooperation program in a
bid to enhance their business ties.
</P>
<P>
The new cooperation program includes a new service facility --
the European Business Information Center (EBIC) -- set up by the
European Chamber of Commerce of the Philippines (ECCP).
</P>
<P>
The new facility is aimed at providing better assistance for
local firms to develop links with foreign firms and facilitating
the transfer of products, services and technical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The EBIC network in Asia and Europe is financially supported by
the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Another cooperation scheme is a business partner search system
called the Business Cooperation Network or the BC-Net, which was
installed by the ECCP to further boost trade links between Europe
and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU, through its business cooperation fund, will
extend funding support to projects aimed at strengthening
alliances between European and Philippine businesses.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Trade and Industry Undersecretary Cesar Bautista
said that the new cooperation program will further foster economic
cooperation between the Philippines and Europe.

<HEADLINE> EU May Use V-Chip to Censor Television Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Viewers in the EU offended by
bad language, sex and violence on television may in the future
have TV sets with an in-built microchip which will rate programs
and even censor them.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament is requiring television manufacturers
to install a microchip, called the violence chip or V-chip, in all
new sets, to give parents greater control over what their children
watch, according to today's Daily Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
The V-chip displays an on-screen menu of cinema-style
classifications for the level of offensive language, sex and
violence in TV programs.
</P>
<P>
Viewers will be able to select programs by choosing a number
from one to five on a remote control handset with number five
representing the most explicit content level. The lower the
number, the fewer the programs the device will let through.
</P>
<P>
The V-chip can also reject all shows without a classification
such as sex channels beamed via satellite.
</P>
<P>
The V-chip was invented by Tim Collings, a father of three and
laboratory engineer at Simon Fraser University in Canada.
</P>
<P>
Interest in the chips has been growing in North America where
cable television companies have announced that they are ready to
offer the control once the technology is available.
</P>
<P>
The United States passed a telecommunications bill earlier this
month which specifies that manufacturers must build the V-chip
into new television sets with screens larger than 13 inches.
</P>
<P>
But the chip will not face such an easy introduction in Europe,
where it depends on agreement among television manufacturers,
government regulators and broadcasters in the 15 EU countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 20 (xinhua) -- The Ugandan environmental
authority announced here today that the country's swamps would no
longer be leased for industrial use.
</P>
<P>
A statement from the Ugandan National Environment of

The swamps, which act as filters of waste before it drains
into lakes and rivers, cover an area of 241,139 square
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the swamps along the Kampala-Jinja Road have been
drained by factories constructed on them.
</P>
<P>
The environmental authority banned all new development, but
the permits which have already been granted to the industrialists
would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ugandan government has also received funds from
the Netherlands to restore some swamps as an effort to encourage
bio-diversity.

<HEADLINE> World's Youngest Readers Found in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Three-year-old twins in east
China's Shandong Province were informed by the Shanghai Guinness
Book of Records that they are the youngest readers in the world.
</P>
<P>
The brother and sister, Zhuang Zezheng and Zhuang Zefang, can
read about 2,400 Chinese characters and nearly 1,000 English
words, Zhuang Shikui, the twins' father, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"The two can read out more than 80 children's books clearly,
correctly, and smoothly. Reading has become an indispensable part
of their lives," say Zhao Jianhua, a former professor at Shandong
Normal University, and Zheng Tongjin, a specialist in children's
literature, after they gave the twins a comprehensive series of
tests.
</P>
<P>
The twin were born 20 days premature. From their earliest days,
the parents told them stories and taught them characters from time
to time.
</P>
<P>
When the sister was one year old, she picked up a newspaper and
began to read aloud word by word. To their great surprise, the
parents later found that the child could even read children's
books.
</P>
<P>
"We never force the children to read. The most we do is to
arouse their interest in reading. Guidance plays a very important
role in improving their reading ability," the father
explained.

<HEADLINE> Fraser Calls for Two-year Ban on Compatriot Riley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Olympic veteran
Dawn Fraser has called FINA to impose a two-year ban on fellow
swimmer Samantha Riley for failing a drug test.
</P>
<P>
Fraser told a commercial radio station in Sydney on Tuesday
that the 100 meters breaststroke world record holder was "stupid"
to have taken an unlabelled tablet at the world short course
championships in Rio de Janeiro in December.
</P>
<P>
Riley tested positively for the banned pain-killer
dextropropoxyphen. Her coach Scott Volkers has admitted the
substance was in a prescription tablet he had mistakenly given the
swimmer after she complained of a headache.
</P>
<P>
But Fraser, who won gold medals in the 100 meters freestyle at
the 1956, 1960 and 1964 Olympics, said that Riley should not have
taken the tablet if she did not know exactly what it was.
</P>
<P>
"I think she's a very, very stupid person to put anything in
her mouth when she didn't know what it was," she said.
</P>
<P>
Riley and Australian swimming officials would hear on Wednesday
what penalty swimming's international governing body, FINA, will
impose.

JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- David Levy, foreign
minister of the former Yitzhak Shamir government, announced this
morning that he has set up a new party called "bridge," reported
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Levy will contest the premiership in the forthcoming general
elections against Prime Minister Shimon Peres and Binyamin
Netanyahu, joint candidate of two major opposition parties of
Likud and Tsomet.
</P>
<P>
Being a statesman who enjoys considerable influence among half
of a million Jews of Moroccan origin, Levy appeared to be apparent
successor to Shamir, only to be defeated by Netanyahu in the party
elections in 1992. Since then he has been on bad terms with the
new party chief.
</P>
<P>
As Peres announced to move up the elections from October 29 to
late May or early June, several new parties have come into being,
ready to participate in the contest for the 120-member 14th
Knesset. They are: Yisrael Ba'aliya led by Zion Natan Sharansky,
immigrant from the former Soviet Union; Third Way led by Avigdor
Kahalani, Labor Knesset Member; Meimad Party led by Rabbi Yehuda
Amital, Current government Minister Without portfolio.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Tibi, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's advisor, is expected
to announce the founding of Arab Movement for Change Party next
month. Tibi, a Palestinian, is an Israeli citizen.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State Sani
Abacha and Cameroonian President Paul Biya have agreed to meet to
discuss the ownership dispute of the oil rich Bakassi Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
To this effect, Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi and his
Cameroonian counterpart, Ferdinard Oyono, will meet in a yet to
be disclosed venue in the first week of March, to work out
modalities for the meeting of the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
The planned meeting was a response to the peace moves of
Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema, at a mediatory meeting
between Ikimi and Oyono at the weekend in Kara, Togo.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued yesterday in Nigerian capital Abuja by the
foreign ministry quoted President Eyadema during the talks as
calling upon African countries to resist playing surrogates to
some world powers.
</P>
<P>
According to Eyadema, some world powers "are seeking to divide
our peoples and nations and distract them from the goals of
economic development, which can only be achieved in an atmosphere
of peace, security, stability and solidarity."
</P>
<P>
The meeting which was held at the call of President Eyadema as
well as the planned parley between Abacha and Biya, were without
prejudice to the on-going process at the International Court of
Justice at the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon filed a suit at the International Court of Justice
after the armed clash between the two countries in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria responded shortly by filing preliminary objections to
the suit which Cameroon is yet to respond to.
</P>
<P>
On February 3, 1996, fresh hostilities broke out between
Cameroon and Nigerian forces in the peninsula in the Gulf of
Guinea, resulting in casualties on both sides.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Nigerian defense spokesman Fred Chijuka said that
there would be high level meetings between top officials of both
countries to prevent future clashes.

MANILA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The US-based Pacific Gas Corp.
has applied to become the Philippine government's strategic
partner in Manila Gas Corp., official reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government, through the National Development
Company (NDC), owns 91.7 percent of the Manila Gas.
</P>
<P>
NDC General Manager Arthur Aguilar today said that the American
firm was the only company yet that has submitted a "letter of
intent" to the NDC.
</P>
<P>
The final selection will be made in May, he added.
</P>
<P>
As of March 1995, the Manila Gas has assets of about 80.23
million pesos (3.21 million US dollars) and current liabilities of
24.1 million pesos (0.96 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It also has a four-percent share of the LPG (liquefied
petroleum gas) market.
</P>
<P>
According to Aguilar, gas companies are interested in buying
the local gas firm because it has the sole franchise to operate a
gas pipeline in the Philippine capital until the year 2012.

<HEADLINE> Prisoners Freed For Moslem Festival In Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Nineteen prisoners were
released today from prisons of the north Mogadishu Islamic court
to mark the moslem festival of Eid-al-Fitri, the end of the holy
month of Ramadan during which all moslems have been fasting.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners who were mainly youngsters have committed such
minor crimes as street theft and disobedience to their parents
against the Islamic rules.
</P>
<P>
The acting chairman of the Islamic Court, Sheikit Abdi Ali
Alasow, said the Islamic court has forgiven all prisoners for
serving sentences ranging from two to twelve months.
</P>
<P>
The released prisoners include two ladies who similarly were
convicted for stealing clothes and packs of cigarettes in the
main market of Bakara and Karan market.
</P>
<P>
According to the acting chairman, the prisoners were released
so as to let them enjoy the happy Eid with their families.
</P>
<P>
Two of the released prisoners were told to compensate 3
million Somali Shillings (equivalent to 410 US dollars) which
they stole from an unguarded business facility.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Alasow said these thieves were not punished with hands
chopping, because the owner of the money did not give enough care
to his wealth.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Alasow declined the existence of a similar forgiveness
to defected politicians who were arrested by the Islamic court
ten days ago. He also said all murderers and those who committed
major crimes won't benefit from the pardon of the Eid occasion.
</P>
<P>
The news of freeing prisoners created a mixed feeling within
the community. It does not delight the parents who had sent their
children to jail for their disobedience, while others are excited
by the release.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Mogadishu is colorful today with well dressed
children celebrating the Eid-Al-Fitri, one of the most important
festivals in the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
No shootouts were heard during the day. Children used toy guns
and ambulances to play in the dusty streets of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, faction leaders in Mogadishu have also spoken to
their supporters on the occasion. Both General Mohamed Farah
Aideed and Ali Mahdi Mohamed had addressed what they called the
Somali people whom they represent as their presidents and wished
their people good health and a prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
Mr Ali Mahdi Mohamed of the Somali Salvation Alliance (SSA)
said he is optimistic that this year will end with the existence
of a representative Somali government. He also said it is
unfortunate that some politicians are still undermining the well
being of what he called the Somali community.
</P>
<P>
General Aideed said in turn that this Eid coincides with the
other Eid of having no foreigners involved in Somalia's politics.
</P>
<P>
He accused Westerners of wanting to colonize the Somali people
politically, economically and socially and urged his supporters
to stand for their rights to defend their country against what he
called the foreign aggressors.

<HEADLINE> Top Iraqi Defector Says He Will Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Top-level Iraqi defector
Hussein Kamel said here Monday that he will return to Iraq
"within days" after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein "welcomed" his
return from exile in Jordan, Jordan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
"I'll be returning to Iraq with my wife and my children,
hopefully within days," said Lieutenant General Kamel, Saddam's
son-in-law and key official behind Iraq's secret weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
Kamel, whose defection to Jordan in last August and his call
for overthrowing the Iraqi government were seen as a major
blow to the Iraqi regime, said his contacts with Baghdad had
never been broken off.
</P>
<P>
He has been "in touch with the Iraqi leadership though
middlemen. "I sent a letter to the president recently asking him
to allow me to return to my country," he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The initial response of the leadership was positive and
welcomed my return," he added. "I hope to receive an answer to my
letter soon."
</P>
<P>
Kamel said, "I am ready to return to Iraq without
conditions ... Iraq is my country, even though there have been
differences of opinion. My country has begun paving the road
toward comfort and confidence."
</P>
<P>
He declined to say if President Saddam has forgiven him for his
August 8 defection, which severely embarrassed the Iraqi
leader. However, he said he was ready to stand trial in Iraq for
his actions.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to face a court, answer its questions and submit
to a possible punishment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kamel reportedly failed to rally Iraqi opposition groups behind
him after his defection, and they described his change of tune to
the fact that he has now run out of options.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants anything to do with him, especially the
opposition, which has not forgotten his role in the repression in
Iraq," an exiled opposition figure said Monday, quoted by the
daily. "Kamel's comments today show he can't be taken seriously."
</P>
<P>
After the initial excitement provoked by his defection died
down, Arab countries and the United States also came to the view
that Kamel was not a viable alternative to Saddam's government,
the daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here said his overtures to Baghdad may not
be enough to win over the Iraqi president, who publicly described
Kamel as a "traitor" after his defection.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Kamel's return to Iraq indicates
that there may be some differences between him and the Jordanian
government on the future of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jordan proposed federation for Iraq last year,
Kamel threatened that he will end his stay in Jordan and go to a
third country if Jordan insists on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also noted that on February 18, one day before Kamel
disclosed his plan to return to Iraq, Jordan allowed an Iraqi
opposition party, the Iraqi National Accord, to open an office in
Amman to be in charge of its affairs in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's official media has been keeping silence on the
matter.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Frees Prisoners to Mark Feast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian King Fahd
Ibn Abdul-Aziz has ordered the release of 5,039 prisoners in an
amnesty marking the Moslem holiday of Eid el-Fitr, a feast that
ends the holy fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi Arabian Interior Ministry source said in Riyadh that
the prisoners including 3,289 Saudis and 1,750 foreigners were set
free last week to allow them to reunite with their families
before the three-day holiday began today, according to the
official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) today.
</P>

However, the agency did dot say when King Fahd issued the
decree. Nor did it provide the nationalities of pardoned
expatriates.

King Fahd routinely issues decrees to pardon prisoners to mark
religious holidays such as Eid el-Fitr, or Lesser Bairam.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Set up 200-Nautical-Mile Exclusive Economic Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan has decided to impose a
200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zone around its shores under
the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The policy was approved at a cabinet meeting early today. The
establishment of an exclusive economic zone is a necessary prelude
to Japan's ratification of the U.N.-sponsored convention which
entered into force in November 1994.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet will seek Diet (parliament) approval for the
convention during its regular session which ends on June 19.
</P>
<P>
As of February 1 this year, 85 countries have ratified the
U.N. convention which is seen as an international constitution on
marine affairs.
</P>
<P>
Actual enforcement of Japan's exclusive economic zone, however,
requires fishery agreements with China and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The exclusive economic zone, once approved by the Diet session,
will include China's Diaoyu Island (known in Japan as Senkaku
Island) and South Korea's Tokto Island (known in Japan as
Takeshima Island).
</P>
<P>
Local press quoted cabinet members as saying that Japan will
conduct talks with China and South Korea separately in line with
the spirit of the U.N. convention to reach fishery agreements as
early as possible.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Troops Leave for Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Some Nigerian soldiers have
left the country for Liberia to join the West African
Peacekeeping Force there known as ECOMOG, Nigerian newspaper
"Nigerian Tribune" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Nigerian Defense sources as disclosing that
the troops, the number of which was not available, are to assist
in the disarmament of Liberia's armed factions to pave way for a
democratic election in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace agreement signed by all parties to the Liberian
conflict last August in Nigerian capital Abuja, an interim
government has been set up to run Liberia till the general
election scheduled for next August.
</P>
<P>
However, the disarmament of some 60,000 fighters of the armed
factions in Liberia, the crucial stage of the Liberian peace
process, has been delayed, mainly due to lack of funds and the
fighting between one armed faction, ULIMO-J, and the Nigerian-led
ECOMOG soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The field commander of ECOMOG, Major-General John Inienger,
last December requested that more troops from ECOMOG contributors
be sent to Liberia to help contain the insurrection of the armed
faction.
</P>
<P>
The inactive response from them prompted Inienger to request
the Nigerian Chief of Defense Staff, Major-General Abdulsalam
Abubakar, that more troops be sent to Liberia to meet the demand
of disarmament of the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Abubakar had tabled the request before
the Nigerian Head of State General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
There are currently some 6,000 Nigerian soldiers in the ECOMOG
force, which was sent to Liberia by the Economic Community of
West African States in August 1990, eight months after the civil
war in Liberia broke out.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Hunting To Earn 2.5 Million US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Professional Hunters
Association of Zambia (PHA) expects to contribute over 2.5
million US dollars in this hunting season to the tourism revenue,
"Times of Zambia" reported today.
</P>
<P>
PHA Chairman Michael Faddy was quoted as saying that all was
set for this year's hunting season which would begin late next
month.
</P>
<P>
More money was expected to be earned following the zero rating
of tax on overseas tour packages announced in this year's budget,
Faddy said.
</P>
<P>
Such an incentive to the professional hunters from abroad was a
positive, he said, adding that a rising number of the clients had
already booked for this year's hunting season.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of professional hunting is one of the
government's measures to increase non-metal export earnings.

<HEADLINE> SAP Criticized In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Structural
Adjustment Program (SAP), introduced in Tanzania 10 years ago,
has thrown the country into unacceptable budgetary deficits,
heavy external and internal borrowing and persistent high
inflation.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator of Parastatal Sector Reform Commission (PSRC),
N. Shimwela said on Monday at a seminar in Arusha, Northern
Tanzania, on the assessment of the SAP impact on the economic and
social sectors in Tanzania, that despite the program which was
heavily supported by the World Bank, the local budget was still
unable to generate any surplus for the development investment.
</P>
<P>
According a report reaching here today from Arusha, he was
presenting his paper on SAP in Tanzania at a one-day meeting
jointly organized by the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Tanzania
(ELCP) and the Church of Sweden (COS) which was also attended by
the Managing Director of the World Bank, S. Sandstrom.
</P>
<P>
"The government is unable to deliver basic economic and social
services to the population. Tanzania is in distress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Shimwela said the average budgetary deficit rose from 8.5
percent between 1981 and 1985 to 28 percent between 1991 and
1994.
</P>
<P>
He said unfortunately much of the government assistance went
to the parastatals whose productivity was below capacity.
</P>
<P>
The coordinator of PSRC told the meeting that a study released
by the World Bank last December showed that fiscal deficit had
been growing from 2 percent of the GDP in 1991/1992 to 10.5
percent in 1993/1994 and dropped to 6 percent 1994/1995 in the
county. He said as a result total internal borrowing by the
government rose from 3.7 percent of the GDP to 4.6 percent in the
period. He added that despite the deficit, inflation rose up from
27 percent in 1992/1993 to 30 percent 1994/1995.
</P>
<P>
Shimwela, who is an economist, said that due to dependence on
foreign aid for development, financing the component had been
seriously affected. He said, according to the current rolling
plan and forwards budget, local financing of development
investment had decline from 63.2 percent in 1991/1992 to 2.8
percent after the donors' decision to freeze their assistance
earlier last year.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian economist further said that by September last
year, Tanzania's total debt stood at 6.9 billion u.s. dollars
which he said was more than 200 percent of the GDP estimated at 3
billion u.s. dollars.

BANGKOK, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas

The Greek government has informed the host country Thailand

</P>
<P>
It is believed that the cancellation by the Greek prime

The official also said that leaders of Spain, Sweden and
Denmark will be absent from the ASEM.

<HEADLINE> Israel Government OK's Loan Guarantees for Fighter Deal with Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 20 (Xinhua) -- A lucrative deal between
Israel Aircraft Industries (IAI) and the Turkish Defense Ministry
will be financed by government loan guarantees, reported the
Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (parliament) Finance Committee approved the 410
million U.S. dollars in the loan guarantees Monday.
</P>
<P>
The project requires IAI to refurbish and upgrade 54 F-15
fighter planes for the Turkish Air Force, at a cost of some 650
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The deal will be financed entirely by loans from Israeli
banks, which Turkey is to repay within five years after a
two-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
The banks are prone to double risks -- the risk of a Turkish
default and the risk that IAI will fail to complete the
project.
</P>
<P>
As the Israel Foreign Trade Risk Insurance Company cannot
handle such a big deal, the Finance Ministry decided to promote
the deal by providing government guarantees for these loans, both
because of the project's diplomatic importance and of its
financial importance to IAI. The project is expected to turn a
fat profit for the company.
</P>
<P>
According to the Treasury, the banks' total risk exposure is
expected to be only 250 million dollars, but it could be larger,
because several of the risk parameters are still unknown. It
therefore agreed to guarantee 84 percent of any losses up to 250
million dollars, 90 percent of losses between 250 million dollars
and 300 million dollars, 95 percent of losses between 300 million
dollars and 350 million dollars, and 100 percent of losses over
350 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government will also fully guarantee a 36 million dollars
deposit demanded by the Turkish government as insurance that the
work will be completed.
</P>
<P>
In exchange for its guarantees, the government will get a lien
on IAI's assets, though this will be of lower priority than the
banks' lien on these assets.

<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Slovak government will
offer policy incentives to attract more foreign investment, Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar announced in the capital of Bratislava

</P>
<P>
Meciar said that foreign hi-tech companies investing in the

<HEADLINE> Anti-corruption Commission Urged In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe should emulate other
countries which set up anti-corruption commissions to effectively
curb the soaring cases of corruption in both public and private
sectors, a judge has said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at this year's first session of the high court here
on Monday, Justice Smith said, ''In order to deal effectively
with corruption some countries have set up anti-corruption
commissions. I consider that our country would be well advised to
do something on similar lines.''
</P>
<P>
Justice Smith called on members of the public to help law
enforcement agencies in the country to fight corruption by
exposing it whenever they became aware of its existence.
</P>
<P>
He said that the payment and acceptance of bribes constituted
corruption, distorted major development programs and escalated
costs, which in the end were expected to be met by the already
overburdened taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
''To award a major development contract to the company which
pays the highest amount to the right official or politician can
have tremendously harmful effects for the country,'' he added.

<P>
Scarcity of cement supply even turned worse in recent months as
dealers exploited the market situation while the government seems
to have no immediate plan to control the market, they said.
</P>
<P>
Although major cement factories had raised prices of their
products by about 10 percent to around 300 rupees (about 5 US
dollars) for one 50 kg sack, dealers are still charging buyers
more than 10 percent higher than the prices.
</P>
<P>
A constructors' organization attributed the worse situation of
cement supply to manufacturers' recent move to appoint more
dealers at a time when their production was on the decline.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from the Nepal Construction Business
Association, the major cement factories in Nepal have nearly 4,000
 dealers altogether at present.
</P>
<P>
The total production capacity of these cement factories is
nearly 35,000 tons but their production only stood at 10 percent
of the capacity in the past months, he said.

<HEADLINE> France Seizes Arms, Arrests 25 Islamic Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- French police arrested 25 people
and seized a cache of arms in raids on suspected Muslim
extremists in the Paris region on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the seized 30 shoulder-fired arms might
have been shipped to Algeria or perhaps used to train young
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Those arrested in Monday's early morning raids on some 15
locations in and around the capital were mostly Algerian and
Tunisian citizens.
</P>
<P>
Only one Frenchman was arrested, at whose home weapons were
found. Police said he was a convert to Islam but they declined to
release his name.
</P>
<P>
The French Interior Ministry said the crackdown was a follow-up
to an investigation opened in 1994 into a Muslim network headed by
the Algerian brothers, Brahim and Mohamed Chalabi, who switched
from drug trafficking to guerrilla acts since the network was
broken up with the 1994 arrests of 93 people.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing
published a record of more than 120 varieties of books for
children last year, today's "Beijing Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper attributed this mainly to greater efforts made by the
municipal publication administration to select topics of juvenile
books and to set up prizes for them, implementing the instructions
of the central government to improve publications for children.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the administration allocated more than one
million yuan worth of aid for major publications.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Publishing House also put more effort into
upgrading the books' editing, printing and publishing.
</P>
<P>
All those helped bring in a large number of publications with
ample knowledge and great interest for children, intending to
educate and enlighten children and enrich their knowledge.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka's Political Crisis Hits Major Export Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi export business
is facing adverse situation with the ready-made garment (RMG),
leather and frozen food sectors being the worst affected ones as a
result of prolonged political crisis, the industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Frozen food export will earn 4 billion taka (about 100 million
US dollars) less in the current fiscal year to be ended in June
than its performance level at 12 billion taka (about 300 million
US dollars) in the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Leather industry sources said earnings from export of leather
goods had also stiffly declined. Latest trade statistics could
not, however, be collected.
</P>
<P>
In the garment sector, big buyers of Bangladeshi apparels are
gradually moving away from here to neighboring West Bengal and
other parts of India, many garment businessmen complained.
</P>
<P>
"The Bangladeshi RMG manufacturers have received only
insignificant supply orders in the last two months and many
factories are facing closure," a leading manufacturer said, adding
that the local RMG sector had lost about 25 percent of business to
others over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The mainstream opposition provoked a nearly two-year-old
anti-government movement and the political impasse still exist
after the February 15 national polls boycotted by opposition.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Export Promotion Bureau said that
export growth in the first half of the current fiscal year was
still higher than the same period of the last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the second half of this fiscal year could face export
debacle if the political situation continued to remain unchanged,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Bank Backtracks on Loan Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam's bank for foreign
trade, Vietcombank, has reversed its decision to suspend bank
loans and guarantees for many importers, the latest issue of
the Vietnam Investment Review reported.
</P>
<P>
Vietcombank branches first announced the loan suspension in
january, following a decision by the central bank for foreign
trade on january 11 advising caution in providing loans for
several lines of imports.
</P>
<P>
According to the English-language weekly, after the decision,
"an outcry has come from companies reliant on such sources for
their survival".
</P>
<P>
The rationale given for the decision was that it was a way to
reduce risk to the bank, but there was also the question of
whether too much of the six types of materials -- steel, cars,
fertilizers, electronic components, fiber and plastics -- were
being imported, causing market saturation.
</P>
<P>
It said the list of six import sectors which vietcombank
previously said would no longer receive loans and guarantees has
been pared down to two: fertilizers and cars.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh city vietcombank's director said there seemed to be
surpluses of steel, iron and fertilers in the vietnamese market
and a survey was needed to determine whether this was caused by
allowing too much of these products to be imported or
miscalculation on the part of the businesses concerned.

<HEADLINE> Peruvian, Ecuadoran Army Chiefs to Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- General Nicolas Hermoza, joint
commander-in-chief of Peru's armed forces, has agreed to hold
another meeting with his Ecuadoran counterpart, Jorge Ortega, to
avoid possible new border disputes, it was confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
The previous meeting between the two men took place in an
Amazon border zone on February 11, one year after their armies
fought each other during a 34-day undeclared war in a mountainous
zone where a 78-kilometer-long border line remains unmarked.
</P>
<P>
During the upcoming meeting, Hermoza and Ortega will try to
build mutual confidence to prevent new armed conflicts and to
evaluate the demobilization process on the Peruvian-Ecuadoran
border, a government source said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesperson for the Joint Command said the two military
leaders will discuss Peru's proposal to carry out military
surveillance that will help ensure disengagement between the
Peruvian and Ecuadoran armies.
</P>
<P>
Peru has established a similar mechanism with other neighboring
countries -- Chile, Colombia, Brazil and Bolivia -- to enable
high-ranking commanders to discuss issues of mutual interests.
</P>
<P>
Hermoza, who is also general commander of the Peruvian army,
said last week that he believed Peru and Ecuador's armed forces
will begin similar talks to consolidate the peace process in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The Hermoza-Ortega meeting will be presided over by the
advisory committee of the Mission of Military Observers for
Ecuador and Peru, which comprises officers from Argentina, Chile,
Brazil and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The advisory committee, the highest level of the peace mission
in the conflict zone, is responsible of overseeing ceasefire in
the disputed border area in compliance with agreements signed by
Lima and Quito on February 17, 1995.

MADRID, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez and his main opponent in March 3 elections, Jose maria
Aznar, today joined about 1 million protesters in a demonstration
against the terrorism of the Basque separatist group ETA.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was a reaction to two assassinations by the
armed ETA in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
A week earlier, Basque separatists shot dead lawyer Fernando
Mugica, one of the most influential Socialists in Spain's Basque
region. Federico Tomas y Valiente, former president of the
Constitutional Court, became another victim of the ETA last
wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An anti-terrorist demonstration was also held in the eastern
city of Valencia, the birthplace of Tomas y Valiente. About 10,000
people attended the march.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators chanted such slogans as "against terrorism
and violence," and "safeguard peace and freedom."
</P>
<P>
The ETA, in its 27 years of fight for a separate state made up
of four northern Spanish provinces and three southwestern French
departments, has launched a series of terrorist activities in
Spain, with some 10 killings since last December.

<P>
KIEV, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid
Kuchma, aiming to seek more economic aid, is scheduled to pay a
three-day visit to the U.S. on Tuesday, Foreign Minister Gennady
Udovenko said today.
</P>
<P>
He said Kuchma will also discuss with his U.S. counterpart,
Bill Clinton, the implementation of a number of bilateral
documents they signed when Clinton visited Ukraine in May 1995.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's May visit has established a strategic partnership
between the two countries, and the U.S. has repeatedly stressed
the importance of its ties with Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma's planned visit, the second after he took office in
1994, is expected to push forward such a relationship.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine, which declared independence from the former Soviet
Union in 1991, has been plagued by many social, economic and
military problems.
</P>
<P>
To solve all these problems, including nuclear disarmament and
the Chernobyl issue, Ukraine needs more economic help from the
U.S., Udovenko said, but stressed it does not mean Ukraine is
begging for money.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has promised to continue support for Ukraine's economic
reform and its efforts to participate in the world trade
integration process, he added.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Kuchma will hold talks with leaders of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to ask for more
economic aid to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Other sources said the issue of the European security as well
as Ukrainian-Russian relationship are also among the topics of the
upcoming summit talks.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma's decision to visit the U.S. came after Russian
President Boris Yeltsin announced a trip to Kiev in early April.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Initiatives Taken for Bangladesh's Talks  on Political Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Some western diplomats in Dhaka
have started contacting the feuding parties in their fresh efforts
to bring about a negotiated settlement of the country's prolonged
political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Some diplomatic sources said that the diplomats would work to
strike a deal before the next Paris consortium meeting, which
decides financial assistance to the least-developed countries
including Bangladesh, to be held on July 10-12.
</P>
<P>
They may also prepare a suggestion for the political parties
during the visit of US congressman Bill Richardson, which will be
obviously based on a "two poll theory", that is, holding another
poll as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats led by the US ambassador had played a mediatory
role between the Bangladeshi government and the opposition before
the polls held on February 15. But they tried in vain to bring
the feuding parties to sit across the table.
</P>
<P>
After the polls, they have already started contacting the both
sides with a view to resuming talks after the EID festival of
Muslims, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
On evaluation of the February 15 elections where the voter
turnout was very low, the sources said that the most important
question before them is whether they should recognize the poll as
they have received many controversial reports on it.
</P>
<P>
They would consult with different election watch organizations
on the issue to get an objective picture of the polls, it was
learnt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a government source disclosed that the Prime
Minister Begum Khaleda Zia recently held a meeting with her
kitchen cabinet and expressed their desire to resolve the
political dispute as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
If the opposition parties agreed to participate in a future
election, the government might indicate its readiness to hold
another election as early as next October or November, the source
added.

<HEADLINE> Flood Costs Costa Rica 10 million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rica is facing a loss
of more than 10 million U.S. dollars due to damage to houses,
roads and bridges in the Atlantic region caused by flood, Sandra
Salazar, spokesperson for the National Emergency Commission (NEC),
said today.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, there have also been losses in agriculture, to banana
plantations in particular, which have been affected in a good part
of their 49,000 hectares," she said.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rains last week left 6 dead, one missing and more
than 20,000 homeless in the cantons of Turriaba and other
localities in northeast of San Jose.

Meanwhile, National Banana Corporation manager Jorge Sauma said
that they are evaluating the impact of the flood on the banana
production in the zone where huge areas were destroyed by the
overflowing of rivers.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said that evacuees are returning to their shabby
homes as the weather improves while close to 1,000 people are
still in improvised shelters because their homes were completely
destroyed or they need to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
"The air lifting of food and drinking water to the homeless
will conclude this Monday due to an improvement on weather
conditions that made ground relief operations possible," said the
manager.
</P>
<P>
In another development, President Jose Maria Figueres announced
that "the government will increase the economic resources
earmarked to help the people affected."
</P>
<P>
On the loss in banana harvest, the president said that "it (the
harvest) will drop 5 to 6 percent."
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is the world's second largest banana growing country
after Ecuador with an average annual harvest of 100,000 boxes. each
box weighs 18.14 kilograms.

NEW DELHI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- India Monday held its
biennial elections to the Council of States (Upper House of
Parliament) with the ruling Congress Party (Indira) winning 22 out
of the 60 contested seats.
</P>
<P>
The largest opposition Bharatiya Janata part bagged only 10
seats, followed by the Janata Dal and the Communist Party of India
(Marxist) with eight and five seats respectively. The rest 15
seats went to other parties and groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Council of States has 244 members, 236 elected by the state
legislatures and territories and eight appointed by the president.
 Members of the Council of States serve six-year terms, one-third
of them retiring every two years.
</P>
<P>
In all, there are 71 vacancies in the Upper House of parliament
this year. However, election was held only for 60 seats because
it cannot be held for 11 seats in Uttar Pradesh where there is no
assembly. Because 19 candidates have been declared elected
unopposed, only 41 seats were actually contested in nine states
across the country Monday.

<HEADLINE> Indian Textile Minister Resigns over Hawala Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Indian Textiles Minister
Kamal Nath, whose name is linked with the hawala case, last night
resigned from the government, the Press Trust of India said.
</P>
<P>
The hawala case refers to a bribery scandal in which some top
Indian politicians allegedly received money from illegal foreign
exchange dealers.
</P>
<P>
In a two-page letter to Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, Nath
said even though the allegation against him in the hawala case
related to a period when he was not a minister, "still, bowing to
the dictates of principles, I hereby tender my resignation from
the Council of Ministers."
</P>
<P>
A late communique from Indian President Shankar Dayal Sharma
has accepted Nath's resignation on the advise of the prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
Nath's resignation came in the wake of reports that the Central
Bureau of Investigation (CBI) was contemplating filing fresh
charge sheets shortly against some more persons including him in
the multi-crore rupee scandal.
</P>
<P>
Nath, who met the prime minister twice during the day, is the
fourth minister to step down from office after V.C. Shukla,
Madhavrao Scindia and Balram Jakhar resigned last month following
CBI's plea for presidential sanction to prosecute them.

<HEADLINE> Gore Unveils $1.5 Billion Plan to Clean up Everglades </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
today announced the Clinton administration's seven-year,
1.5-billion-dollar program to restore the Everglades, a giant
swamp in southern Florida.
</P>
<P>
The Everglades, an ecosystem unique in the world, are now
threatened by pollution as the huge wetlands have been drained and
dammed to one-fifth their former size for farming in the past
century and the water in the remaining undeveloped regions
reportedly is contaminated with mercury and agricultural runoff.
Environmentalists have been fighting for decades to restore the
wetlands.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, unveiled by Gore when he visited the
Everglades National Park, the federal government would spend 100
million dollars a year for seven years to acquire up to 140,000
acres of the land now being used to grow sugar cane and to convert
it into marshals to filter polluted water.
</P>
<P>
The program also includes creation of an "Everglades
Restoration Fund" for land acquisition and a 25 percent increase
in funding for federal Everglades science, land management and
water management.
</P>
<P>
This program is subject to congressional approval and a bitter
fight is expected on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said they believed it had bipartisan
support. "Saving the Everglades is a priority of the United States
of America," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. sugar industry, already deep in a multi-million
advertising war with environmentalists, has expressed bitter
opposition to the administration program. U.S. Sugar vice
president Bob Buker reportedly called the proposal a political
tactic by the Clinton administration to attract environmental
votes in an election year. About 2,000 sugar farmers, sugar mill
workers and sugar industry officials gathered Sunday to protest
a proposed one-cent fee on each pound of sugar produced in
Florida. They complained that since they have already agreed to
pay up to 320 million dollars over 20 years to fund the Everglades
restoration project, the added tax would drive many of them out of
business.

HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is to liberalize
wheat marketing by April this year, allowing for the first time
the private sector to compete with the state-owned Grain
Marketing Board (GMB) in crop imports.

as well.

Farmers are expecting Agriculture Minister Dennis Norman to

</P>
<P>
The government has, however, made it clear it would not allow
export of wheat until national requirements have been met.
</P>
<P>
Up to 200,000 tonnes of wheat may be imported this year to
meet domestic shortfalls caused by reduced production during

<HEADLINE> Arusha Court Names Two Rwandan Genocide Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The first two accused
persons alleged to have taken part in the genocide in Rwanda in
1994 are expected to be brought to Arusha International Tribunal
for Rwanda (ITR) in April.
</P>
<P>
The registrar of the ITR, Andronico Adede, today told
reporters in Arusha, northern Tanzania, that the prosecutor had
already submitted two indictments setting forth charges against
Georges Aderson Rutanganda and Jean Paul Akayesu.
</P>
<P>
Rutanganda was a businessman and served as the Second
Vice-President of the National Committee of Interahamwe, the
youth wing of late President Juvenal Habyarimana's party. He is
currently in detention in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
He is alleged to have taken part in the massacres of Tutsis at
a school in Rwanda's capital Kigali and at a gravel pit in Nyanza
on or about April 11, 1994. Moreover, he is charged with having
been involved in the murders of several people near a garage in
Kigali.
</P>
<P>
Up to one million minority Tutsis and Hutu moderates were
killed in April 1994 in Rwanda by government troops, militiamen
and radicals and the killers fled to neighboring countries
along with over two millions of refugees after they were
defeated in a civil war.
</P>
<P>
Akayesu is also in custody in Zambia. It is alleged that at a
public meeting on or about April 19, 1994, he gave support to the
murderers of a teacher in his commune. Thereafter, the widespread
killing of Tutsis in the place began.
</P>
<P>
Judge William Sekule has signed warrants of arrest for the
accused and requested their continued detention in Zambia until
facilities for a custody in Arusha now being worked on are
available.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Defector Leaves Amman for Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Hussein Kamel, top-level Iraqi
defector, left here today for Baghdad, Jordan's official news
agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Hussein Kamel, together with his brother Saddam Kamel and their
wives, both daughters of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, drove out
of Amman in a convoy.
</P>
<P>
The convoy was accompanied to Jordan's eastern border by Iraqi
Ambassador to Jordan Nouri Elwayes.
</P>
<P>
Petra quoted Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul Karim Kabariti as
saying in a statement today that Kamel sent a letter of thanks to
King Hussein of Jordan before his departure to Baghdad this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister added that Kamel's return to Iraq is of his
own choice.
</P>
<P>
Kamel, former director of Saddam Hussein's secret weapon
programs, said here Monday that he would return to Iraq with his
wife and children "within days" after Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein "welcomed" his return from exile in Jordan, local daily
Jordan Times said today.
</P>
<P>
Kamel's defection to Jordan last August and his call for
overthrowing the Iraqi government were widely seen as a major blow
to the Iraqi regime.
</P>
<P>
Kamel said: "I am ready to return to Iraq without
conditions... Iraq is my country, even though there have been
differences of opinion. My country has begun paving the road
toward comfort and confidence."
</P>
<P>
He declined to say if Saddam has forgiven him for his August 8
defection, which severely embarrassed the Iraqi leader.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he was ready to stand trial in Iraq for his
actions.
</P>
<P>
"I am ready to face a court, answer its questions and submit
to a possible punishment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kamel failed to rally Iraqi opposition groups behind him after
his defection, and they described his change of tune to the fact
that he has now run out of options.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody wants anything to do with him, especially the
opposition, which has not forgotten his role in the repression in
Iraq," the daily quoted an exiled opposition figure said as saying
Monday.
</P>
<P>
After the initial excitement provoked by his defection died
down, Arab countries and the United States also came to the view
that Kamel was not a viable alternative to Saddam's government,
the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here said his overtures to Baghdad may not
be enough to win over the Iraqi president, who publicly described
Kamel as a "traitor" after his defection.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Kamel's return to Iraq indicates
there may be some differences between him and the Jordanian
government on the future of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jordan proposed federation for Iraq last year,
Kamel threatened that he will end his stay in Jordan and go to a
third country if Jordan insists on the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also noted that on February 18, one day before Kamel
disclosed his planned return to Iraq, Jordan allowed an Iraqi
opposition party, the Iraqi National Accord, to establish its
regional headquarters in Amman.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Not To Fix Exchange Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Reserve Bank would not interfere in the foreign exchange market
by fixing the exchange rate for the local currency rand, the Bank
Governor Chris Stals said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an investment conference here, Stals said it was
not possible for monetary authorities to decide what the
equilibrium exchange rate for the Rand should be.
</P>
<P>
"The Bank has no intention of fixing the exchange rate at any
predetermined level," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Bank's intervention in the foreign exchange market
when the currency was continuously in danger of appreciating last
year had created a false impression that the Bank was currently
targeting the exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Stals confirmed that the Bank intervened to some extent on
Friday to bring order to the market and "discourage over-reaction
based on unfounded and obviously mistaken rumors".
</P>
<P>
The Rand dropped 11 cents to 3.7750 to the U.S. dollar on
Friday on rumors over President Nelson Mandela's health and
speculation about the removal of exchange controls.
</P>
<P>
The local unit continued its decline on Monday, closing at a
new record low of 3.8450.
</P>
<P>
Stals stressed that in the present flexible global economic
environment, it would be dangerous to fix rates at an artificial
level.
</P>
<P>
Once the South African market opened further, he added,
intervention in the foreign exchange market should be kept to a
minimum.
</P>
<P>
Stals also reiterated Finance Minister Chris Liebenberg's
commitment to a gradual abolition of exchange controls, saying
the Bank would not advise the government to relax controls if it
believed they would lead to a destabilization of financial
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Namibian Leader Stresses Land Reform In Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 20 (Xinhua) -- Namibian farmers must
use fertile land productively or face expropriation, President
Sam Nujoma said in Windhoek today.
</P>
<P>
The South African Press Association quoted his state-of-the-
nation speech as saying:"We need to accelerate the process of
land reform."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening of the third session of parliament
since the 1994 election, he warned if the farmers were unable or
unwilling to use productive land for productive purposes, the
government would perhaps try to acquire this land and allocate it
to someone else, who was willing to put it to good use.
</P>
<P>
But he suggested that land expropriation would be carried out
in terms of the constitution, which requires among others just
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nujoma promised a three-fold increase in land
redistribution in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
The government had already bought 85000 hectares of land and
received considerable land donation from local chiefs for the
resettlement of the landless, the president said.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma also rebutted opponents who accused his government of
dispossessing Namibians of their traditional lands, saying his
government had made every effort to regain and restore the stolen
land to the indigenous landless people.
