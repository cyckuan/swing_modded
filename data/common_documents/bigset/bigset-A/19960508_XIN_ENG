<HEADLINE> Canada Criticizes U.S. Protectionist Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States is badly
backsliding on its free trade pledges, which may soon stall the
international trade liberalization movement, Canadian Trade
Minister Arthur Eggleton warned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. leaders must remain true to free-trade principles or
risk damaging U.S. interests just as surely as other countries
will be hurt, the Canadian minister noted.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Council of the Americas Conference held in
Washington, Eggleton listed the failure to get Chile into the
North American Free Trade Agreement, the anti-Cuba Helms-Burton
legislation and the Canada-U.S. softwood pact as proof that
U.S. commitment to free trade is eroding.
</P>
<P>
This is a dangerous trend because the U.S. action that points
toward a "beggar-my-neighbor" approach will only force other
countries to react in the same way, Eggleton said.
</P>
<P>
He said:"It is always easy to believe in free trade when one
holds a comparative advantage. The challenge facing all of us
today is to honor our commitments when we do not hold all the
cards."
</P>
<P>
Eggleton told the audience that he is "especially worried that
the U.S. is using its economic weight to get special managed-trade
deals with major trading partners like Canada, Japan and China."
</P>
<P>
These deals "have become code words for 'power should prevail'
and suggest that governments, rather than markets, should
determine market outcomes."
</P>
<P>
"By indulging in managed trade arrangements, we introduce
termites into the edifice of free trade we have constructed --
weakening its foundations and threatening its future," he warned.
</P>
<P>
His comments were welcomed by the executives at the two-day
conference, who agreed that the U.S. government had appeared to
give up on promoting free trade, especially its pledge to have a
free trade zone in all the Americas by 2005.

<HEADLINE> UK Union Urges Jobs Protection in Meat Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Trades Union Congress (TUC)
has urged the government to use up to 1 billion pounds (1.5
billion U.S. dollars) of European Union funds to help protect jobs
in the meat and agriculture industry under the threat of BSE.
</P>
<P>
As the beef crisis caused by the wave of the mad cow disease
scare entered its seventh week, the British government began its
selected slaughter of cattle aged over 30 months in a bid to win
back confidence of the customers.
</P>
<P>
By doing so, the British government intended to urge the EU to
lift its worldwide ban on Britain's beef exports as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
However, the TUC urged the government to apply immediately to
Brussels for money from existing EU funds set up to help rural
areas, reported BBC TV this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It warned that the beef crisis would worsen and 10,000 jobs
were already at risk.
</P>
<P>
But a boss of a huge burger chain said that the source of the
BSE crisis lay in Britain rather than in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the solution to the BSE "fiasco" also lay in the UK,
said chairman of Unilever group Sir Michael Perry, whose burger
chain had refused to use British beef at the start of the beef
crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said consumer confidence was the issue at the heart of the
BSE scare and this crisis should not sill over into wider European
relations.

ULAN BATOR, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Artificial snowfalls have helped
curb the quick spread of forest fires in Mongolia, but government
officials said it is still early to be optimistic about a final
victory.
</P>
<P>
Heavy snow blanketed the central and northern provinces of
Hovsgol, Ovorkhangai and Arakhangai on Monday after cloud-seeding
aircraft and army rain-making artillery were used.
</P>
<P>
However, local officials warned that it needs two or three days
before the fires could be declared dead.
</P>
<P>
The fires, which have raged across the nation for more than
three weeks, have killed at least 17 people and destroyed about
80,000 square kilometers (31,000 square miles) of forests and
grasslands.

<HEADLINE> Study Cites Successes in Open-Admission Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The open-admission policy that 25
years ago transformed the City University of New York by
guaranteeing entry to almost all New York high school graduates has
turned out to be quite successful in educating needy students.
</P>
<P>
The findings were obtained through long-term study of thousands
of students who entered the City University under the
open-admission policy.
</P>
<P>
The study found that more than half of the students received
bachlors's degree and they went on to better-paying jobs as a
result. These students would have been denied entrance to the
university under the selective admission policy in force until
1970.
</P>
<P>
The open-admission program, which went into effect in September
1970, allowed any high school student to enter one of the
university's colleges. In that school year, 35,000 freshmen were
admitted to the university, up from about 20,000 a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Of the 100,000 students who entered the university's colleges
from 1970 to 1972, about 48,000 would not have qualified had it
not been for the open-admission program.
</P>
<P>
Under the program, the university has sizable parts dedicated
to remedial classes for the students held back by poor
preparation. Basic education being offered is still sound, the
study noted.
</P>
<P>
While the open-admission policy helped deliver high education
to disadvantaged students, the university did not collapse its own
standards or lose its standing in the process, the study
concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
The development of the nonferrous market will mainly depend
upon that of the international market, experts said, adding that
since the international price will not vary much, the domestic
price will generally remain stable.
</P>
<P>
"The demand for nonferrous metals is expected to rise to some
extent as a result of lower prices," they said.
</P>
<P>
From the point view of single product, the demand and supply
of copper will remain relaxed, while the supply of aluminum is
expected to outstrip demand.
</P>
<P>
The market for chemical products can hardly remain "bullish",
since the growth of production of light and textile industries,
which are major consumers of chemicals, is expected to be slow;
international chemicals market continue to fall; and the increase
in imports and the decrease in exports will lead to supply
overtaking demand.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the market for building materials, the supply of
cement will remain sufficient and even surpass demand. Generally,
the supply of upbeat market products will not be adequate while
that of mediocre products will show a surplus.
</P>
<P>
Coal consumption is expected to rise by about five percent,
which will be balanced by production.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Grigory Karasin said today that Moscow had lodged "a resolute
protest" over the British espionage, but hoped it will not worsen
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Karasin confirmed that Deputy
Foreign Minister Sergei Krylov summoned British Ambassador Andrew
Wood Monday and expressed "a resolute protest" over the espionage
activities of nine British diplomats.
</P>
<P>
"According to tested data provided by Russian security
services, those diplomats were connected with recruiting
(intelligence) agents from Russian citizens," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "in connection with the incident, Moscow sees
it as its main task to prevent an excessively emotional reaction
and hasty decisions that could have a negative effect on
Russian-British interstate relations, which have been successfully
developing of late."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alexander Zdanovich, spokesman of the Russian
Federal Security Service, told reporters here today that Moscow is
going to expel nine British diplomats who were spies and have been
declared "persona non grata."
</P>
<P>
"All of them have been completely exposed by the evidence of
the agent -- a Russian citizen -- who was caught red-handed,"
Zdanovich pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Russian spy working for the British
intelligence was arrested in April, but the arrest was announced
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Expelled are only those who are in any way connected with the
case of the arrested spy who handed over political and
military-strategic information," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In London, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind called on
Moscow to back up their claim and warned Tuesday that reprisal
expulsions were possible.
</P>
<P>
He said: "If any action is taken against British personnel
there will, of course, be a significant response."

BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China has been paying great
attention to safeguarding the safety and health of workers, an
official with the International Labor Organization said today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Liu Siwu, deputy director of the Beijing Office of the ILO,

improving worker safety and health conditions.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Labor said China has implemented 119 laws and
regulations in this regard, and more than 470 specific standards.

<P>
Liu said China has enhanced supervision on the safety and
health of workers, together with relevant scientific research,

<P>
"However, along with industrial development and the sharp
increase in employed workers, China is facing severe vocational
safety and health situations," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"Particularly in chemical, construction and mining industries,
the current situation and trend of death and injuries at work, and
occupational diseases cannot be overlooked," he said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Experts Caution Against Slackening Inflation Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 7 (Xinhua) -- China should continue to pursue an
appropriately tight monetary policy in order to keep inflation at
bay, Chinese finance experts have advised.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the China Academy of Social Sciences and the State
Statistics Bureau said in a recent report that putting a halt to
the restrictive monetary policy, which has been in place since the
second half of 1993, can make the economy overheat again and fan
up inflation, the growth rate of which has been brought down from
21.7 percent in 1994 to 14.8 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate could be 10.5 percent this year, according
to their estimates, compared with the government's target of
around ten percent.
</P>
<P>
They cautioned that there exits a certain degree of blind
conceitedness arising from the success last year in dragging down
inflation to the target set by the government.
</P>
<P>
"A rather influential view, which says that it is acceptable
for the inflation rate to be no higher than the economic growth
rate, is also harmful to China's inflation control," the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yuxin, a researcher with the academy, said that their
proposal to keep a tight fiscal and monetary policy does not
contradict with the government's recent announcement to lower
interest rates of deposits and loans starting from May 1.
</P>
<P>
Zheng understands the move as being helpful in alleviating the
state-owned enterprises' burden of paying interests for their
loans. He added that it does not mean that China will give a freer
rein to its economy.
</P>
<P>
China's retail price index rose 7.7 percent on a yearly basis
during the first quarter, several percentage points lower than
deposit interest rates, providing a sizable space for the Central
bank to lower interest rates for deposits and loans.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Jingping, an official from the State Statistics Bureau,
also agrees with the Central bank's move, saying that the risk of
increasing inflation is less than the risk of leaving the
resources unused.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the experts said that China's gross domestic
product should keep an annual growth rate of eight to 11 percent
in the remainder of this decade.
</P>
<P>
They noted that China's economy should only fluctuate in a
range of around three percentage points during the remaining five
years of this decade, rather than five percentage points during
the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Be Equipped with US Patriot Missiles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is expected to be
equipped with a network of U.S.-made anti-missile Patriot rockets
early next year, according to Commander of the Kuwaiti Air Force
Air Vice-marshal Saber Al-Suwaidan today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Arabic-language daily Al-Anbaa
(News) published today, Suwaidan said discussions with the United
States to purchase a number of these weapons are currently under
way. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Patriot missiles were used effectively by the Israelis to
intercept the former Soviet Union-made Scud missiles launched by
Januarythe Iraqis against the Israeli targets during the Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
This is the latest effort by the small emirate to strengthen
its defense capabilities after it was liberated from the Iraqi
seven-month occupation in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"The Kuwaiti Air Force is executing programs with timetables
to modernize its equipment and devices to stay abreast of the
developments in the 20th century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Suwaidan said Kuwait is also holding negotiations with the
U.S. to purchase Black Hawk and Apache aircraft. Meanwhile, the
Kuwaiti early-warning system will be upgraded with most up-to-date
devices, radars and computers, he added.
</P>
<P>
His statement coincided with the ongoing joint military
exercises conducted by the Kuwaiti, U.S. and French navies in the
Gulf which lasts from May 4 to 8.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait signed a military cooperation agreement with Washington
following the liberation of the Gulf state from the Iraqi
occupation in 1991. Under the accord, Kuwait obtains military
equipment necessary for the defense of the country and its
military troops hold exercises with U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
Five years later, Kuwait is still trying to rebuild its
military, which lost more than 90 percent of its equipment and
installations in the Iraqi invasion.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait spent about 300 million Dinars (1 billion U.S. dollars)
on defense last year, according to official statistics.

technology.
</P>
<P>
The "Africom '96 Conference on the Information Highway for
Developing Countries" is being organized by the Computer Society

<HEADLINE> WEU to Shoulder More Security Responsibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 6 (Xinhua) -- The Western European Union (WEU), the
European pillar of NATO, is expected to be vested with more powers
to handle military operations in Europe at the WEU Council of
Ministers conference to be held in Birmingham, England, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day conference, foreign and defense ministers from
27 European countries will discuss how to further develop the
operational capability and effectiveness of the WEU, especially in
military operations without American participation.
</P>
<P>
British government officials confirmed that Britain will urge
its WEU partners to play a substantial role in organizing
peacekeeping, humanitarian and crisis management missions.
</P>
<P>
However, the British government is strongly opposed to any
intention of making the WEU subordinate to the European Union
(EU), saying NATO remains to be the cornerstone of European
security and stability.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will also discuss the establishment of the WEU
Situation Center, capable of monitoring future operations, and the
development of an Intelligence Section in the WEU's Planning Cell
to handle intelligence from various sources.
</P>
<P>
Another important issue to be discussed is whether the WEU
should take over the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia when the
US-led NATO peace implementation forces pull out of Bosnia at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
However, Jose Cutiliero, secretary general of the WEU, has
reportedly ruled out any chance of the WEU shouldering the task,
saying the fledgling defense group simply does not have the
capability to mount such a big peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the current presidency state of the WEU, which has
10 full members, two observer states, three associate members and
nine associate partners.

<HEADLINE> Italian FM Ends Middle East Tour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 6 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Susanna
Agnelli left here this afternoon for home winding up a tour of the
region, including Cairo and Amman.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli, heading a European Troika delegation which included
Irish and Spanish officials in addition to the Italian minister,
arrived in the Lebanese capital at noon today and held meeting
with top Lebanese leaders and government officials.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli and her delegation met with Lebanese President Elias
Hrawi, House Speaker Nabih Berri and Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri in the Beirut presidential palace this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Italian foreign minister expressed pessimism over the
formation of a five-state committee in charge of monitoring the
cease-fire in southern Lebanon, and attributed the pessimism to
differences in the proposals raised respectively by the United
States and France on the establishment of the monitoring
committee.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the end of the meeting, Agnelli ruled
out a fast achievement of agreement on the committee's formation,
noting that the peace could not be realized so soon as wished.
</P>
<P>
Comprising the U.S. France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon, the
monitoring committee was provided with a cease-fire understanding
reached on April 26, which was aimed to putting an end to 16 days
of continuous Israeli bombardments and air strikes in southern
Lebanon. The bombardments and air strikes claimed over 160
civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting with the three Lebanese leaders, the
Italian foreign minister held an exclusive meeting with Hariri,
who is scheduled to start a tour of Europe Tuesday. He will visit
Italy, Belgium and France.
</P>
<P>
A meeting was immediately held at the Foreign Ministry between
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz and the European
delegation upon the arrival of Agnelli and her delegation here.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the one-hour meeting, Boueiz announced that the
talks concentrated on the Middle East peace process and results of
the recent Israeli agressions against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the talks dealt with the April understanding,
which put an end to the 16 days of Israeli military operation in
southern Lebanon last month, and the ways to set up "special
mechanism" to implement the understanding.
</P>
<P>
Agnelli said that consultations on the formation of the
proposed five-state committee monitoring the cease-fire in
southern Lebanon were still under way, noting that the Lebanese
foreign minister would have discussions in this regard with
Syrian Leaders while visiting Damascus tonight.
</P>
<P>
"We will see what a role Europe can play in this regard," said
the Italian foreign minister, who is currently chairman of the
European Union.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Europe was always ready to provide help since
"it believes that the (European) Union has a useful role in the
peace process which we want it to be permanent and not limited to
a cease-fire."
</P>
<P>
Underlining a support for U.N. Security Council Resolution
425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli withdrawal from
southern Lebanon, Agnelli confirmed that the European Union has
asked Israel "for thousands of times" to implement Resolution
425.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Govt Hopes to Resume Talks With MQM (A) in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistani government is
optimistic about the resumption of talks with the Mohajir Qaumi
Movement (MQM) (Altaf Group) in May, Law Minister N. D. Khan said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Positive signals have been received from the MQM (A) and
negotiations would be resumed during the current month," Khan, who
is also the head of the government's negotiating team, told local
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Khan said an ideal situation for constructive negotiations has
been created after restoration of peace in the southern port city
of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
The government and the MQM (A) began talks in July last year in
their bid to restore peace in Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and
economic center which was gripped by city violence.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the government also took a strong stand
against the city violence. Police and troops arrested a large
number of alleged law-breakers and killed some, helping the city
return to a comparatively normal life.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks were suspended on December 20 as the MQM (A)
indicated its inability to continue the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Khan said he had held a meeting with MQM (A) negotiating chief
Ajmal Dehlvi on the possibility of resuming talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the law enforcing agencies had been successful in
restoring peace as most of the militants were arrested, killed or
had gone underground.
</P>
<P>
Khan stressed the need for resolving the issues politically.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of the dialogue, Khan said, "Consolidation and
restoration of peace item is a must."

<HEADLINE> Belgrade-Zagreb Highway Reopening Marks Improved Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bajakovo, Yugoslav-Croatian Border, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A blue
ribbon was cut by U.N. administrator in Eastern Slavonia Jaques
Klein here at noon today, marking the reopening of the
Belgrade-Zagreb highway that had been closed for the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
"I think that's a major step forward; it is one of the many
steps in the process of normalization (between Yugoslavia and
Croatia)," Klein told reporters after cutting the ribbon and
announcing the reopening of the road, the shortest route between
the two capitals.
</P>
<P>
"One of our main goals is to get the road open. It will boost
trade and commerce, bring the country together, revitalize the
economy and help the recovery of the region," the head of the U.N.
Transitional Administration in Eastern Slavonia (UNTAES) said.
</P>
<P>
The 400-kilometer-long highway was shut down in 1991 when
Croatia fought a brief war with Yugoslavia in its independence
process. The two countries signed an agreement in 1994 to open the
road but the agreement merely existed in paper and civilians of
the two countries never went to the other side through that
highway.
</P>
<P>
However, with the signing of the Dayting agreement late last
year, the strained bilateral relations began to improve. The two
foreign ministers visited each other's capitals this year and
signed a number of agreements on cooperation, including the
resumption of telecommunications and the reopening of roads and
oil pipelines between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic day which marks a concrete step towards the
normalization of relations between Croatia and Yugoslavia,"
Croatian Deputy Prime Minister Ivica Kostovic said at the opening
ceremony, which was also attended by Yugoslav Transportation and
Communications Minister Zoran Vujovic and other officials of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Although bilateral ties have been bettered since early this
year, the rump Yugoslavia and Croatia have yet to recognize each
other diplomatically due to the controversial Prevlaka peninsula
which is located on the Yugoslav-Croatian southeastern border at
the Adriatic sea. Both claimed sovereignty to the tiny peninsula
which is now under the control of the U.N. peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia, the Serb-dominated region in the northeastern
part of Croatia bordering Yugoslavia, is now under the
administration of the UNTAES and protected by the 5,000-strong
U.N. peacekeeping force comprised of Belgian, Russian, Pakistani
and Jordanian troops.
</P>
<P>
General Josef Schoups, commander of the U.N. troops in Eastern
Slavonia, told Xinhua at the border that he was satisfied with
cooperation with local authorities and he was sure that the
highway will be safe except for mines in the fields along the
road.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Drops in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in the first four
months of the year dropped by more than half to a total of 1.24
billion U.S. dollars, an official report said today.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Investment Review which came out today quoted a
source of the Ministry of Planning and Investment as saying that
the investment total at the end of April was down 52 percent over
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment had amounted to 2.579 billion dollars in the
January-April period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the official did not give any reason for the decrease.
</P>
<P>
Year-on-year investment declined by 28 percent in Ho Chi Minh
city, the biggest city in Vietnam, and the drop was attributed to
a change in regulations concerning land lease procedures in the
metropolis.
</P>
<P>
A senior ministry official said that short-term comparison does
not attest to a general slowdown in foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the magazine as saying that foreign investment
increased by 17 percent in the first quarter as compared with the
corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted that as more projects are likely to get
investment licenses later on, the influx of foreign investment may
amount "to an astonishing level within the next few weeks."
</P>
<P>
Twenty projects are awaiting approval from the ministry and may
bring 80 million dollars in new investment into Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
Industrial projects are being given priority this year as 64 of
the 87 licensed projects so far are industrial in nature which
have drawn as much as 1.028 billion dollars or 83 percent of the
foreign investment total.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Africa is spending four billion
U.S. Dollars annually to cover the costs of foreign experts
working in the continent, Assistant Secretary General of the
Organization Of African Unity (OAU) Vijay S. Makhan said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing to the on-going 31st session of the Economic
Commission For Africa (ECA) and the 20th meeting of the
conference of ministers responsible for economic and social
development and planning.
</P>
<P>
Makhan said despite the improvement of African education in
the past decades, Africa still depends on experts from the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Some African states are more readily disposed to accepting
foreign experts than African nationals, he said.
</P>
<P>
The continent has been left behind, ill equipped and plagued
by endless conflcits, wars, poverty, diseases and environmental
degradation while others are preparing on solid grounds for the
21st century, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The ECA ministerial conference which entered its second day
today spent much of its time deliberating on Africa's social and

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Denies Secret Supplement to Understanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon vehemently today denied any
secret supplement to a cease-fire understanding ending the 16-day
Israeli military operations in southern Lebanon which claimed over
160 civilian lives.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on the existence of a secret supplement
to the understanding, Lebanese House Speaker Nabih Berri said,
"There is no secret supplement at all, and I repeat there is no
secret supplement at all."
</P>
<P>
Milhem Karam, president of the Lebanese Journalists Association
(LJA), asked Berri in an interview on the recent statement by
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres that there was a message from
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher which constituted a
guarantee regarded (by Israel) as a supplement to the
understanding reached on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The house speaker replied that "I say the position of Lebanon
and Syria, I affirm there is not any supplement" with the evidence
that if there were a secret agreement it would have included the
subject on how the proposed five-state monitoring committee should
work.
</P>
<P>
"Now part of my regret is that we did not discuss how the
monitoring committee should work at that time," Berri told the
head of the LJA in his office.
</P>
<P>
According to the April 26 understanding, a committee
comprising representatives from Lebanon, Syria, Israel, the United
States and France is to be set up to monitor the enforcement of
the cease-fire in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Berri described the understanding as "the best one in the
circumstances which we were experiencing," noting that there was
not a possibility for his country to obtain a better one in light
of the pressures exerted on Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Israel's bombardment at a military camp of the
U.N. peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon on April 18 in which
more than 100 refugees were killed, Berri said "the massacre was
deliberate and intended," announcing that he had evidences to
prove his charge.
</P>
<P>
He added that more than 15 artillery shells fell at the center
of the international emergency force at Kana, where the innocent
civilians sought shelter.
</P>
<P>
"The massacre committed by Israel was thrown upside down on
Israel" and the Jewish state was forced to stop the 16-day
aggression in southern Lebanon, the house speaker said.
</P>
<P>
He repeated Lebanon's call on U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali to publish a report the international organization
prepared on its investigation into the Kana event.

ATHENS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Greek currency drachma
appreciated in April against the basket of all foreign currencies,
including European currencies, according to the weighted parity
indices compiled by the Exports Research and Studies Center of
Greece.
</P>
<P>
The weighted index for the basket of all foreign currencies
depreciated by 0.82 percent against the drachma based on Greece's
overall external trade, while the corresponding depreciation of
European currencies reached 0.93 percent.

<P>
With respect to the other currencies -- the Swiss franc,
Norwegian krone, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Japanese yen
and Cyprus pound -- but not the U.S. dollar, the weighted parity
index dropped by 0.96 percent against the drachma on the basis of
the participation of each in the country's total external trade.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative depreciation of foreign currencies against the
drachma in the four-month period of January-April this year,
against the average rates in the corresponding period in 1995, was

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Leeds, the Yorkshire city, is the car
crime capital of Britain, with 5.5 percent of motorists having had
their cars stolen or broken into last year, according to a survey
by the insurance company Eagle Star.
</P>
<P>
The survey, the first to rank cities by theft and car crime,
was based on claims from the company's 1.5 million motor policy
holders. It puts the national average of car crime at 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Birmingham it is 5.1 percent and Newcastle is at 5 percent,
followed by Glasgow and Manchester at 4.7 percent. London is
apparently far from top of the theft league, with the car crime
proportion standing at 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The lowest English figure is Southampton with a 1.2 percent
level.
</P>
<P>
The survey said that social and economic differences between
cities can account for some of the contrasts in crime rates.
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Star survey came as the Home Office attempted to
improve car crime statistics by relaunching its Crack Car Crime
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ruling Party Urged To Return To </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambian opposition parties, in a
joint communique today, urged President Frederick Chiluba and his
ruling party delegation to return to the inter-party meeting to
discuss national affairs.
</P>
<P>
Issuing the communique to the press here, Secretary General of
National Party Akashambatwa Mbikusita Lewanikwa said the
opposition parties had decided that the inter-party meeting
should resume before May 13 and the delegation of the ruling
Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) had been given to
choose a date of their own before May 13.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties had also maintained that a neutral body
other than President Chiluba should chair the meeting, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda, he added, the opposition parties wanted to
discuss the forthcoming general elections, the public order act,
the 1996 draft constitution and other national affairs.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties also demanded that this year's general
elections should be held under the 1991 constitution, he added.
</P>
<P>
The MMD delegation led by President Chiluba walked out the
meeting on Monday over a procedural issue of chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party has insisted that President Chiluba, having a
mandate from the people, has the right to chair the meeting.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Egypt Seeking to Push Forward Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt, being a state with great
political weight in the Arab world and the first Arab state to
have established diplomatic relations with Israel, is seeking to
push forward the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt acts as an active mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace
process, especially on the Palestinian-Israeli and the
Syrian-Israeli tracks.
</P>
<P>
As far as the Palestinian-Israeli track is concerned, Egypt was
a main scene for the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations resulting in
the signing of an agreement on establishing Palestinian self-rule
and another one for expanding that self-rule.
</P>
<P>
During the negotiations, President Hosni Mubarak and other
Egyptian officials were in close contact with the two negotiating
parties.
</P>
<P>
Whenever the negotiations stumbled, Egyptian officials would
directly or indirectly intervene to break the deadlock and narrow
the gap between Palestinian and Israeli negotiators.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Palestinian-Israeli talks on expanding the
Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank entered a crucial stage
last September in the Egyptian town of Taba.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to intensified Egyptian mediation efforts, the two sides
managed to reach an accord for the expansion of the Palestinian
self-rule, which was officially signed in Washington late in the
same month.
</P>
<P>
After that, the Syrian-Israeli track of the peace process
became a central key to achieving an overall and lasting peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
To break the deadlock in the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations,
Egypt has made great efforts to bring views of the two sides
closer together.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, President Mubarak and Foreign minister Amr
Moussa have visited Syria several times. Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara have also visited
Egypt frequently for consultations.
</P>
<P>
Even Israeli Prime Minister and Foreign Minister have come to
Egypt more than once in recent years with the aim of pushing
forward the Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt firmly supports Syria's call for a complete Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau Israel
seized from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, in return for an
overall peace with Israel.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Egypt is seeking to persuade Syria to adopt
a more flexible attitude in its peace negotiations with Israel in
order to reach a solution acceptable to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Late in February and early in March this year, four suicide
bombing attacks were carried out inside Israel by elements
belonging to the Palestinian Hamas movement, killing 60 people and
injuring hundreds of others.
</P>
<P>
As soon as those bombings occurred the Israeli government
suspended its talks with the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
and once again the peace process came to a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
In order to save the peace process from collapsing, President
Mubarak called for holding an international anti-terrorism
conference and made relevant contacts with the PNA President
Yasser Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres and
U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
This initiative of Mubarak met with immediate response and
strong support from many countries of the world.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, a summit of peace-makers was held in the
Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh. Leaders of some 30
countries attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic efforts made by Egypt in connection with the
Middle East peace process are highly appreciated by the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts think that Egypt will continue to push
forward the Middle East peace process and will act as an
important mediator in the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations,
especially in the Palestinian-Israeli final stage negotiations
which opened in the Egyptian red sea resort of Taba on May 5 and
will continue for three years.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Continue Border Closure on Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Chief of Staff
Lt.-Gen. Amnon Lipkin-Shahak declared today that Israel will
continue its closure on the Palestinian territories for fear of
terrorist attacks, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said that security forces have recently received a general
warning on possible terrorist attacks and for this reason Israel
continues to bar the entry of Palestinian workers.
</P>
<P>
He made the justification after he appeared before the Knesset
(parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
Dealing with the controversial issue of redeployment from
Hebron, Shahak spoke of the tension both among Jews and
Palestinians in the city due to the uncertainty which prevails
over when the Israeli army will redeploy its troops.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that warnings of potential attacks continue to
come even though they are not specific. That is why Israel
continues to prevent Palestinian workers from the West Bank and
Gaza Strip to cross over into Israel, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Shahak also defended Israeli army's version of the incident
surrounding last month's artillery shelling of the
U.N. peacekeeping camp in Kafr Kana, which killed more than 100
Lebanese refugees. He insisted that the army did not intentionally
target the U.N. position.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Speaker Raps the West for Double Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish parliament speaker Mustafa
Kalemli today criticized the West for their "double standards" on
human rights, saying there is no lesson Turkey can learn from
other countries on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Kalemli made the remarks during a meeting with a delegation of
the Turco-American Associations Assembly in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"Western countries have been misinformed on the human rights
violations in Turkey," Kalemli said. "It is not right for them to
try to judge Turkey on the basis of lies or incorrect reports".
</P>
<P>
Some officials from certain countries were coming to Turkey to
investigate human rights violations with the aid of judges or
prosecutors, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But human rights violations take place in the United States
and Germany too. I feel very sorry about those violations," said
the speaker.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been the target of criticism by its western allies
for alleged human rights violations, especially the treatment
toward its former Kurd-origin parliament deputies and torture
cases during police detention.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Government Sends Intercepted Parcel to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today gave
the green light for delivering cardiograph spare parts for Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash after a parcel containing the heart
monitor gear was intercepted by customs at the Larnaca airport.
</P>
<P>
The 72-year-old Turkish Cypriot politician suffered a heart
attack earlier this year and the monitor had been sent for
repairs in Finland.
</P>
<P>
According to the Cyprus News Agency today, the parcel which
arrived Monday at Larnaca International Airport, was confiscated
when it was noticed that it was addressing the so-called
"President" of the illegal Turkish Cypriot regime in the northern
island.
</P>
<P>
The parcel was sent from Finland for special delivery via
Athens on a plane of the Cyprus Airways, the island's national
carrier. It carried a distorted address which included the names
of towns in both Turkey and Cyprus, namely Mersin and Larnaca
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The company, which was responsible for the transportation of
the parcel, decided to send it back to Finland because, as a
company spokesman said, it does not have dealings with the
Turkish Cypriot regime on the Turkish-occupied northern areas.
</P>
<P>
However, following arrangements by Permanent Secretary of the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs Alecos Shambos and U.N. Secretary-
General's deputy special representative to the island Gustave
Feissel, the parcel was finally handed to the U.N. to be forwarded
to Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The island's Commissioner for Humanitarian Affairs Leandros
Zachariades described the government's decision to hand over the
parcel to Denktash as "a humanitarian act."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized northern third of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Central High Court Continues Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A former member of the prison
police said today that he saw with his own eyes when 59 senior
officials of the Haile Selassie government were gunned down to
death at the Addis Ababa Prison in 1974.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old man, the fifth witness of the prosecutor told
the first bench of the Central High Court that many shots were
fired at one and same time at the helpless victims handcuffed to
one another so that they could not escape the brutal killings.
</P>
<P>
The witness said the 59 butchered officials of the imperial
government were taken from the Grand Palace to the Addis Ababa
Prison where they were shot dead by a killing squad.
</P>
<P>
"But I don't know who gave the shoot and kill order," the
witness added.
</P>
<P>
The witness was cross-examined by the defense lawyers after
which the court adjourned the hearing to May 9.
</P>
<P>
The court heard the third and fourth witnesses of the
prosecutor on April 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Central High Court began to hear testimonies against
former Mengistu governmental officials on April 9, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The trial of 66 former governmental officials started on
December 13, 1994. 45 defendants were brought into dock while 21
were tried in Absentia including former president Mengistu
Haile-Mariam and former acting president Tesfaye Gebre-Kidan.

<P>
ANKARA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
today called on foreign textile firms attending the 12th
International Apparel Convention in Istanbul to invest in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the convention, Yilmaz pointed out
that Turkey, whose leading exports are textile and clothing
products, is among the very few world's self-sufficient countries
in textile raw materials.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that with the completion of the Southeastern
Anatolia Project, the Harran Plateau will turn into "a second
Cukurova", Turkey's major cotton producing area near its Aegean
coast.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said the textile sector will flourish in the provincial
centers of the southeast such as Gaziantep and Diyarbakir.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of international cooperation in
the textile industry, adding that the holding of the convention in
Turkey is an important step toward developing the Turkish textile
sector's international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister invited foreign textile
industrialists to invest in machinery production in Turkey rather
than trying to supply machinery for Turkey's textile industry.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade-Zagreb Highway Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milan
Milutinovic said today the reopening of Belgrade-Zagreb highway
and the KRK-Pancevo oil pipeline were an important step in the
normalization of relations between Yugoslavia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released to local press, Milutinovic said the
step practically "marked the beginning of the implementation of
the accord" reached on March 11 this year when he visited Zagreb.
During that visit, he signed a number of agreement on cooperation
with the Croatian government, including the reopening of highway
and pipeline and resumption of telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The 400-kilometer highway, which was closed in 1991 when
Croatia was gaining independence from the former Yugoslavia, was
formally reopened today by the U.N. Transitional Administrator in
Eastern Slavonia Jacques Klein and representatives from Yugoslavia
and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the reopening of the highway and the
oil pipeline were a further confirmation of Yugoslavia's
constructive peace policy and its lasting commitment to the
consolidation of peace, stability and and good-neighborhood in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The move would also enable a normal movement of people and
goods between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister believed that the move would also help stabilize
the situation in the Serb-dominated Eastern Slavonia region where
the highway passes through, and would boost the local population's
faith in the possibility of living together with Croats.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia, now under U.N. administration for a one-year
transitional period, is the only Serb region in Croatia which was
not taken over by force by government troops. The three other Serb
regions were seized by government forces last year, forcing tens
of thousands of Serbs to flee their homes to neighboring
Yugoslavia and Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Cameroon Continues Attack Of Nigerian Position In </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian military high command
said here today that Cameroon had continued its bombardment of
Nigerian positions in the disputed Bakassi Peninsula in defiance
of the recent instructions of the International Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon continued to employ heavy artillery weapons,
helicopters, gunships and gunboats, said Director of Defense
Information Fred Chijuka, adding that the attack were
particularly vicious last Sunday when the Cameroonian Forces
launched severe push against the Nigerian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He said that Nigeria has not declared war on Cameroon but
emphasized that with the intensity of the Cameroonian attacks, it
looked like that country was bent on going to war with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The defense spokesman said that if Nigeria would declare war
on Cameroon, "we would let the people know," and if Nigeria ever
did, only few country in the world dare to blame it after all the
patience the country has exhibited.
</P>
<P>
He said if Nigeria had declared war on Cameroon, the border
would not have remained "relatively open and our team would not
have gone there to play football."
</P>
<P>
According to the News Agency of Nigeria, the country has
already reported to the United Nations over the current
intense military attacks Cameroon has launched in the Bakassi
Peninsula.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: East Asia Continues Rapid Output Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) --Remarkable export performance and
strong investment continued to underpin East Asia's rapid output
growth in 1995, the World Bank said today.
</P>
<P>
In its 97-page report entitled "Global Economic Prospects and
the Developing Countries 1996," the Bank noted that for the second
year in a row the region's GDP growth exceeded 9 percent and
almost all countries continued to outstrip their respective
10-year trend growth rates.
</P>
<P>
Current estimates indicate that East Asia's export volumes
surged 21 percent over 1994 while imports rose 18 percent. This
growth exerted a significant pull on the economies of trading
partners both within and outside the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the Chinese economy appears to be
achieving a soft landing. Output growth slowed from the 13 percent
pace sustained in the three years to 1994 but remained over 10
percent in 1995, and a further mild slowdown is projected in 1996.
Meanwhile, consumer price inflation, which peaked at 24 percent in
1994, is estimated to have come down to 17 percent in 1995 and
tight monetary policy has, however, complicated the process of
improving the financial performance of indebted state-owned
enterprises, and this remains an overriding challenge in further
reforming the economy, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the East Asian region is forecast to slow slightly
over the next 10 years, though only in line with slowing
population growth and per capita incomes are expected to increase
by an annual average of 6.9 percent, the same as in 1986-1995. The
income growth will be accompanied by further strong progress in
countries' integration with global and regional economies. Various
regional and unilateral trade liberalization measures, such as
China's recent announcement of planned tariff cut and growing
investment links within the region are expected to continue to
fuel intraregional trade, which has advanced at rates in excess of
20 percent a year in current U.S. dollar terms in the 1990s, the
World Bank report said.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Says Globalization Accelerating, Gap Widening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) --Global economic integration
accelerated dramatically over the past five years, with key
developing nations leading the way, but many countries lagging
behind, noted the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
This finding highlights a World Bank report released here
today, which is entitled "Global Economic Prospect and the
Developing Countries 1996." It asserted that too many developing
countries are failing to open up to the world economy, thus
creating severe dispartities and the threat of a permanent gap
between fast and slow integrating economies.
</P>
<P>
From 1985 to 1994, the ratio of world trade to Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) rose three times faster than during the previous
decade, and foreign direct investment (FDI) doubled as a share of
global GDP, according to the report. Developing countries have
been key participants as well as a major source of strength in
this new economy.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, the overall ratio of trade to GDP in
developing countries rose 1.2 percent a year, while the FDI going
to developing countries increased to more than one-third.
</P>
<P>
Though developing countries in the aggregate kept pace with the
world rate of trade integration, the report noted, the ratio of
trade to GDP actually fell in some 44 out of 93 developing nations
observed over the past ten years. A further 17 countries recorded
only moderate rises. Moreover, three-quarters of the increase over
the period was accounted for by just 10 countries, which include
China, Malaysia, Brazil, South Korea, Mexico, India, Thailand,
Saudi Arabia, the Philippines and Argentina. Similarly, although
the developing countries's share of FDI increased to 38 percent of
the world's total, two-thirds of these flows went to just 8
countries which include China, Argentina, Indonesia, Mexico,
Thailand, Hungary, Malaysia and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report said three policy areas that are critical
to successful market liberalization: Macroeconomic policy, trade
and FDI regimes as well as telecommunications and transportation
infrastructure reform.
</P>
<P>
The report asserted that the overall outlook for the world
economy is bright, and the global opportunities for developing
countries are better than they have been in a long time. Generally
favorable conditions projected in the industrial nations,
including stable energy prices, low interest rates and inflation,
movement toward reducing budget deficits, and advancements in
communications and transportation technology, have created an
environment highly conducive to market liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Economic Integration Pushes Continued Growth in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) --Next to East Asia, South Asia was
the fastest-growing developing region over the past decade, with
GDP growth averaging 5.1 percent, the World Bank notes in a new
report entitled "Global Economic Prospects and the Developing
Countries 1996," released here today.
</P>
<P>
It says that once-closed economies in the region also showed
some of the largest advances in integration with the world
economy.
</P>
<P>
The report projects continued long-term growth for the South
Asian region averaging 5.4 percent in the next decade, reaching
close to 6 percent in later years. The implied per capita GDP
growth of 3.7 percent constitutes a big improvement both on the
past ten years and in terms of poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
India, which accounts for 80 percent of the region's GDP,
continued to draw substantial benefits from the trade and
investment liberalization undertaken following the 1991 balance of
payments crisis. In the fiscal year ending in March 1995, the
country maintained growth at 6.3 percent, and growth is projected
to remain in a 5.5-6.0 percent range in the new fiscal year ending
in March 1996. India's exports grew around 20 percent in dollar
terms while manufacturing output growth averaged more than 10
percent in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Pakistan, growth in GDP improved to an estimated
4 percent in the fiscal year ending in June 1995 and has further
improved in the current year, but inflation remained high. In
Bangladesh, political crisis and violence reduced investor
confidence and held back GDP growth to 4--5 percent. In Sri Lanka,
inflation edged higher, and continued civil strife dampened
private sector development and held growth to an estimated 5
percent.

JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- South African President Nelson
Mandela warned today if opposition parties don't agree to the
draft constitution scheduled to be passed by Wednesday, the
African National Congress (ANC) would have to write the
constitution on its own.
</P>
<P>
The president made the warning at a media briefing in Midrand,
north of Johannesburg, after attending a graduation ceremony for
teachers who had completed a technology course.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: ''I am confident we will be able to pass a
constitution which has been agreed to by all parties.''
</P>
<P>
"If not, the ANC would have to write its own constitution
because it had a mandate to bring about change, transformation
from an apartheid system to a fully democratic and legitimate
one," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
''We cannot let down our people,'' added the president.
</P>
<P>
However, he hoped a compromise would be reached by parties who
were arguing over the property, lock-out and education clauses in
the country's new constitution, scheduled to be adopted on May 8.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Africa Records Its Highest Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) --The World Bank said early
estimates show that for the first time since 1989, the income of
individual Sub-Saharan Africans is growing.
</P>
<P>
According to a new World Bank report, Global Economic Prospects
1996, released here today, as the region's GDP rising 3.5 -4
percent in 1995--its highest growth rate of the 1990s, the
economic pick-up continues in coming years. Economies are on the
rise across the continent, with 30 of Sub-Saharan Africa's 48
countries recording increase in GDP better than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed Africa's positive economic performance to
various factors which include high world commodity prices over the
last two year, more liberal economic policies in many countries,
the relatively peaceful political transition of South Africa and
the movement from war to peace in several parts of the continent.
Besides, the devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 have
helped 14 West and Central African French-speaking countries
further boost the competitiveness of their exports.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Uganda's GDP is estimated to have
grown by nearly 10 percent in 1995, one of the largest growth
rates recorded by any economy in the world and is expected to grow
a consistent 5 percent or more a year throughout the next decade
if the present pace of reform is maintained.
</P>
<P>
In the decade from 1986-1995, the Sub-Saharan Africa had 1.7
percent growth in GDP, the growth is projected to reach some e3.8
percent in the current decade from 1996-2005. Meanwhile, its GDP
per capita in the past decade was actually decreased by 1.2
percent. The income could pick up to 0.9 percent in the next
decade.

<HEADLINE> Africa Records Highest Economic Growth In Decade, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The income of individual state
in sub-Saharan African region was on the rise for the first time
since 1989, said a World Bank report obtained here today.
</P>
<P>
According to ''Global Economic Prospects 1996'', released
today in Midrand, north of Johannesburg, where the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development was held, the region's gross
domestic product (GDP) was increased to 4 percent in 1995,
its highest growth rate of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Economies were on the rise across the continent, with 30 of
sub-Saharan Africa's 48 countries recording increases in GDP
better than 3 percent, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Africa's positive economic performance was reportedly
attributed to various factors -- high world commodity price over
the last two years, more liberal economic policies in many
countries, the relatively peaceful political transition of South
Africa, and the movement from war to peace in several parts of
the continent.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that South Africa, the region's largest
economy, had continued to recover for the second consecutive
year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's 3.5 percent GDP growth last year, although
modest, was expected to carry spill-over benefits for the area
through faster regional economic integration and increased trade
and investment flows, it added.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Latin America Shows Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) --In recent years, tight fiscal and
monetary policies have reduced the average inflation rate in Latin
America and the Caribbean, according to "Global Economic Prospects
and the Developing Countries 1996", a report released by the World
Bank here today.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, trade volumes have increased, and overall
investment rates have recovered from their levels in the 1980s,
raising expectations of a higher level of income for the region,
it says.
</P>
<P>
The 97-page report projects that progress on inflation in the
region will continue. For the period 1996-2005, inflation for the
median country is expected to fall to 8.7 percent, down from 20.4
percent for 1986-1995. And growth in export volumes will fall
slightly in the next 10-year period to 6.1 percent, but it will
remain well above the average rate of 4.4 percent in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report forecasts that Latin America and
Caribbean will grow at a yearly average of 2.6 percent in 1996 and
1997, a little below the 1991-1995 average of 3 percent. However,
growth is projected to increase to 3.8 percent a year for the
1996-2005, rising above 4 percent a year in the first five years
of the next century. In per capita terms, that represents an
annual growth rate of 2.3 percent, well above the 0.4 percent
gained in 1986-1995.
</P>
<P>
The report asserts that even higher growth could be achieved in
the Latin America and the Caribbean region if the domestic
investment rate, measured as a percentage of GDP, were closer to
East Asia's average yearly rate of 36 percent in 1991-1994. The
East Asian rate is projected to rise to over 40 percent in the
next 10 years, while the Latin American and the Caribbean regional
domestic savings rate presently at 19 percent, is well below the
developing countries average of 25 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Wang Slows Her Time in 10,000-Meter Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Wang Junxia
didn't shot for another world best in the women's 10,000-meter
final, while world women's shot put champion Huang Zhihong was
beaten Wednesday, last day of the Chinese athletics Olympic trials.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who set the world 3,000 and 10,000 meter records in 1993,
followed the early pacer in the first half of the race, and ran a
little bit faster during the remaining laps to clock 31 minutes
and 11.59 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The time was slower than her 31:01.76 in Tuesdya's heat that
was 3.23 seconds faster to last season's world best, set by world
champion Fernanda Ribeiro of Portugal in Gothenburg.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Wang passed the 5,000-meter mark in 15:55.03
behind Ren Xiujuan. But she took the pace after 8,000 meters and
ran over the final lap in 71 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Wang didn't kicked hard, because the last lap was nearly six
seconds slower than her Tuesday's.
</P>
<P>
Rui finished second in 31:13.21, ahead of Wang Mingxia,
31:31.14.
</P>
<P>
"I am tired after yesterday's heat, so today I just want to
win," said the talented winner, who left coach Ma Junren's team in
1994 after a bitter dispute broke out.
</P>
<P>
Her new coach is Mao Dezhen, who took the position last July
and trained Wang in different ways from her former coach Ma, who
is lying at a hospital in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Mao's training method is not like Ma's. But coach Ma made me
in peak form in 1993. Coach Mao is a helping coach," said Wang,
who also said that Ribeiro and Ethiopian Derartu Tulu would be her
opponents at Atlanda.
</P>
<P>
"I have not run against world best runners since the world
championships in 1993, but I know they are prety runners. I don't
know how fast I can run at the Olympics, but I will try my best to
win."
</P>
<P>
Wang told the press that she had already won the gold medals
for the World Cup and world championships, but the Olympics will
be her first time to join.
</P>
<P>
"My coach and I just took the trials to check up the results of
my winter training, I am satisfied with the marks," the slim girl
said.
</P>
<P>
Mao aslo said Wang could do better later this season.
</P>
<P>
"Now she is in a period of recovering. I hope she can break her
own world record in the future," said Mao, who used to be a
distance running coach in Liaoning team.
</P>
<P>
While Wang shone brightly here, Huang Zhihong, world champion
in 1991 and 1993, was edged to second place by the 37-year-old Li
Meisu in the women's shot put final Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Li, Seoul Olympic bronze medalist who is holding the Asian
record of 21.76 meters, made her debut after retiring in 1988. She
tossed 19.39 meters to Huang's 19.37. Sui Xinmei finished third at
18.78.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to compete in the Olympics, but I has a knee injury and
that affected my training. If everything goes smoothly, I am
likely to do a 20-plus toss at the Games," said Li, the mother of
a three-year-old girl.
</P>
<P>
Huang, who arrived in Nanjing last night from Japan, was
bothered by her knee injury during the battle.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Muster to Participate in HK Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The world's top two men's players
Pete Sampras of the United States and Thomas Muster of Austria
have confirmed their participation in the annual Marlboro Tennis
Championships in Hong Kong, organizers announced here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This year's Championships, the ninth of the annual series, will
be held on October 15-20 on the Victoria Park courts.
</P>
<P>
The competition to achieve the world No.1 ranking has proved
especially heated over the last three months with Sampras and
Muster frequently trading places in the order of merit. Muster
seized the coveted position during the first week of February but
has since exchanged rankings with Sampras on no less than three
occasions.
</P>
<P>
Muster, the "King of Clay", represents an incredibly tenacious
player whose armory includes a punishing forehand and a fighting
desire to win every point.
</P>
<P>
Sampras is in equally dominant form. Widely heralded as the
most complete player ever, he frequently displays almost flawless
performance on court. With quite a few Grand Slam titles, he
achieved both his third straight Wimbledon and third US Open last
year.
</P>
<P>
This year's Championships will continue to adopt highly
successful round-robin format for the singles and a knock-out
format for the doubles.
</P>
<P>
The men's singles will involve a total of 12 players divided
into four groups of three. Upon completion of the preliminary
round-robin matches, the winner of each group will proceed to the
semi-finals and knock-out phase.
</P>
<P>
All singles players will compete in the doubles with an
additional two further pairs from Hong Kong, China or another
Asian country. A total of eight pairs will be competing in the
doubles event this year.
</P>
<P>
The tournament provides an impressive prize of 4,648,800 HK
dollars (596,000 US dollars) for the singles and 986,700 HK
dollars (126,500 US dollars) for the doubles.
</P>
<P>
The total and final entry of the event will be announced later,
the organizers said.

<HEADLINE> Kim Young-sam Reshuffles His Party to Tighten Grip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 8 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam
appointed Wednesday close aides to key posts in the reshuffle of
the New Korea Party (NKP), in an attempt to tighten control over
the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Former South Korean Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo was appointed
party chairman, The second person in NKP leadership, to replace
Kim Yoon-hwan yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Kim Young-sam, also president of the NKP, retained Kang Sam-jae
as party secretary-general, the third most important post in the
ruling camp.
</P>
<P>
Legislator Kim Deok-ryong was named minister for political
affairs, Lee Sang-deuk chief policy-maker, Suh Chung-won floor
leader in the National Assembly, Park Bum-jin chief secretary to
the party president, Kim Chul the party spokesman and Lee Wan-koo
chief secretary to the party chairman.
</P>
<P>
Suh Chung-won and Kim Deok-ryong have been close to Kim
Young-sam since his days as a dissident in the 1970s when South
Korea was ruled by military-backed presidents.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the reshuffle reflects the president's
intention to place the governing party under his own clout without
breaking the party.
</P>
<P>
Kim Young-sam is banned by the constitution from seeking
re-election after his term ends in February 1998, so the
appearance of a strong party leader could have loosened his grip
on the NKP. Former Prime Minister Lee Hong-koo, who joined the NKP
shortly before the parliamentary election, has no followers of his
own within the party.
</P>
<P>
Lee has declared he had no intention to run for the presidency
next year immediately after his appointment. Kim Deok-ryong's
appointment as the minister in charge of political affairs is an
exception as all the other NKP presidential hopefuls were excluded
from major party positions.

southern Lebanon last month, described the aggressions as a "big
mistake complicating the Middle East peace process."
</P>
<P>
Sorour made the remarks today at a meeting with his Lebanese
counterpart Nabih Berri in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting, Sorour told a press conference that the
Egyptian position was "clear, and that is: we want the peace and
the Israeli aggressions in Lebanon were a big mistake which have
complicated the peace process."
</P>
<P>
Before a cease-fire understanding was reached on April 26,
more than 160 Lebanese civilians had been killed and 400 others
wounded in the 16-day Israeli bombardments and air strikes at
southern Lebanese towns and villages and some half of a million
people became refugees.
</P>
<P>
Sorour announced that he had expressed to Berri the support of
the Egyptian People's Assembly for the Lebanese people and the
condemnation against the Israeli aggressions.
</P>
<P>
He noted that an Egyptian parliamentary delegation had
canceled a scheduled visit to Tel Aviv to protest against the
aggressions after the Israeli military operations were launched.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the aggressions against Lebanon were "a
violation of decisions of the Sharm el Sheikh summit," an
international peacemaking summit held at the request of Egypt on
March 13 in Egypt following a wave of suicide bomb attacks by
Hamas activists in Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The Sharm el Sheikh summit did not give a green light to the
Israeli aggressions," Sorour said.
</P>
<P>
"We see it a step to reach the peace to implement the
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for Israeli
withdrawal from southern Lebanon, and to enable Lebanon to defend
its security by itself," the Egyptian official underlined.
</P>
<P>
He said that the delay in implementing the resolution
"means a continuity of the resistance operations" against the
Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
"We want Israel to realize that the continuity of its
aggressions would distance it from the peace which should be
based on the will of the two sides," he added.
</P>
<P>
Sorour also talked about an Israeli bombardment at the
southern Lebanese town of Kana on April 18 in which more than 100
Lebanese refugees, who sought shelter in a military camp of the
U.N. peacekeeping force in the area, were killed.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the Kana massacre will leave bitterness in the
(Lebanese people's) mind which can not be healed by the time."
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for the peace and we ask Israel to work for
the peace and ask the United States to force Israel to abandon
its aggressive policy for the achievement of the aspired peace in
the Middle East," the Egyptian speaker stressed.
</P>
<P>
"The Egyptian people are supporting the procession of the
Lebanese people with all steps, because this procession could
lead to the just and comprehensive peace which is what Egypt is
desiring and working for."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Lebanese resistance (movement) could
not be named as terrorism, noting that "the terrorists are the
extremist Israelis who reject the peace and are working against
it."
</P>
<P>
Sorour, who arrived in the Lebanese capital Tuesday afternoon
on a three-day official visit to Lebanon, also held a meeting this
morning with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Send Mission on Chemical Weapons Left in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Japan will send next month a
fact-finding mission on chemical weapons left behind in China by
former Japanese Imperial Army troops in closing days of World War
II, the Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
The mission, to be made up of officials at government
ministries and agencies as well as the Japanese Embassy in China,
will stay in China from May 14 through June 3.
</P>
<P>
The team will visit a local area in Jilin Province,
northeastern China, to investigate the quantity of buried chemical
weapons and examine the environment in the region, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
The mission will also hold talks with Chinese officials on
Japan's future surveys of the abandoned chemical weapons in China.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese military left some two million poison gas shells
in the country at the end of the war of Japanese aggression
against China. China has urged Japan to solve the problem as soon
as possible since the chemical weapons threaten the safety of
local residents and pollute the environment.

<HEADLINE> British PM Calls For EU Summit on Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major has
urged European Union (EU) Commission to hold a special summit on
the worldwide ban on the exports of British beef products,
according to the Downing Street officials.
</P>
<P>
"The Prime Minister has written to EU Commission President
Jacques Santer suggesting an emergency summit meeting to discuss
the issue if there is no progress of lifting the ban in the near
future," a British government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that no written reply has been
received, but the EU Commission is reported as saying that it
"understands Britain's concerns."
</P>
<P>
Britain has started slaughtering some of its cows last week in
a bid to restore the consumers' confidence and achieve an early
lifting of the EU ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the global ban on British beef exports in April
when the British government admitted that there was some possible
link between BSE or mad cow disease and its human equivalent CJD
disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU Veterinary Committee is holding a conference in
Brussels today to seek a possible solution to the beef crisis.

JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's year-on-year inflation

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM Receives Message from Iranian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez
Boueiz received here today a message from his Iranian counterpart
Ali Akbar Velayati which was conveyed to the former by a visiting
Iranian senior official.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Gazem Al-Konsari, Director General of the Middle East
and Northern Africa Department in the Iranian Foreign Ministry,
described the message which he delivered to Boueiz as "friendly
and brotherly", but he declined to specify its contents.
</P>
<P>
At the end of a 90-minute meeting with the Lebanese foreign
minister, the Iranian official said that his visit to Lebanon
came within the framework "of the third stage of Iran's standing
on the Lebanese side."
</P>
<P>
He clarified that the first stage came just a few days
following the start of Israeli "savage" aggressions against Lebanon
(last month) and was represented by the arrival of Iranian
assistance to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The second stage came when the Iranian foreign minister visited
Lebanon during the Israeli attacks and in which Iran "stood
politically and practically on the Lebanese side," he said.
</P>
<P>
The third stage, the Iranian official added, was "epitomized
in Iran's willingness to provide help to Lebanon for this
country's reconstruction of the dwelling areas devastated by the
savage Israeli aggressions."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the delegation accompanying him included those
who "have long and rich experiences in the field of construction."
The delegation will study the damages, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official disclosed that he and the Lebanese
foreign minister had exchanged views "on the general situations
in the region."
</P>
<P>
He said that the two sides had agreed to work for a further
development of the bilateral relations between Iran and Lebanon
in which the interests of the two peoples were existing.
</P>
<P>
On a proposed international committee which will be
responsible for monitoring the cease-fire in southern Lebanon, the
Iranian official said that he held a meeting in Damascus Tuesday
with Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-shara in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Calling for a "delicate" enforcement of the understanding
reached on April 26, which put an end to 16 days of Israeli
bombardments and air strikes in southern Lebanon, Konsari noted
that the interests of the Syrian and Lebanese peoples "do not
allow any breach of the understanding."
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on a Lebanese paper regarding the
monitoring committee, the Iranian official reiterated Iran's
support for Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
According to the April 26 understanding, a committee
comprising representatives from Lebanon, Syria, Israel, the United
States and France, is to be set up to monitor the enforcement of
the cease-fire in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Consultations are under way between the parties concerned on
composition, function, headquarters and finding of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Beirut's leftist daily, As-Safir, today quoted its sources as
saying that Lebanon wanted the headquarters of the monitoring
committee to be at the southern Lebanese town of Naqura and under
the supervision of the U.N. peacekeeping force in the region.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon also wanted the function of the five-nation committee
to be strictly limited to the military field.

<HEADLINE> S'pore PM Hopes For Over 60 Percent Votes in Coming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong said that it would be a "terrible let-down" if the ruling
People's Action Party should get less than 60 percent of the votes
in the next general election, due by April 1997, local television
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Brunei where Goh is on a
three-day informal working visit, the prime minister said the 60
percent he had previously quoted was not a target, but was just a
benchmark.
</P>
<P>
Goh said that five years ago when he did not have a track
record as Prime Minister, the government got 60 percent of the
votes in the General Election then. Now, he said, he would be
contesting the coming General Election on the basis of his track
record, one which showed what he had delivered in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
With his record now, and the programs he had in mind for
Singapore, Goh said it would be a "terrible let-down" if his party
should get less than 60 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
However, if the party did not suffer a drop in votes, he would
accept that his track record had the support of the Singapore
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said the People's Action Party will field more than 20
new candidates in the next general election, including a woman and
three to four minority candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister stressed that he has to convince
Singaporeans that the government has a good system going for them,
and that the right people are in charge.
</P>
<P>
The important question was whether there was real support for
the government, and whether Singaporeans knew what their long-term
interests were when they voted, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Hails S.Africa's New Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Never again would the law of
South Africa rend people apart or legalize oppression and
repression, South African President Nelson Mandela pledged this
morning after the formal adoption of the country's first
democratic constitution.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited new constitution was formally adopted by the
Constitutional Assembly (CA) this morning by 421 votes to 2, with
10 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said the adoption of the new constitution is a
historic step and that unity and reconciliation have been written
into the hearts of millions of South Africans.
</P>
<P>
"They are an indelible principle of our founding pledge. They
are the glowing fire of our new patriotism. They shall remain the
condition for reconstruction and development, in as much as
reconstruction and development will depend on unity and
reconciliation," the president proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution obliged the government to strive to
improve the quality of life of South Africans.
</P>
<P>
To this extent, Mandela said the national consensus recognized
that there was nothing else that could justify the existence of
government but to redress the centuries of unspeakable
privations, by striving to eliminate poverty, illiteracy,
homelessness and disease.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the social diversity, Mandela said, "we affirm in
no uncertain terms that we are mature enough to derive strength,
trust and unity from the tapestry of language, religious and
cultural attributes that make up our nation".
</P>
<P>
Last night, an eleventh-hour compromise agreement between the
African National Congress and the National Party made possible a
required two-thirds majority in the CA for the adoption of South
Africa's first democratic constitution.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Propose Measures to Combat False Figures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China has been urged to take steps
to deal with the worsening problem of false statistics. Its top
legislators claimed in Beijing today that deceitful figures have
affected policy-making decisions of governments.
</P>
<P>
False and exaggerated figures pose a problem, said many members
of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee when
reviewing draft amendments to the Statistics Law at the
legislature's current session.
</P>
<P>
Blame for the spread of false figures was leveled at officials
who set unrealistic goals, the current official promotion system
based mainly on "statistics," ideological problems and unreliable
statistical methods, said Pang Xianzhi, member of the NPC Standing
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Various measures are necessary to solve the problems, he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
"Accurate figures are the basis of scientific policy-making for
governments at various levels, and are vital to the healthy
development of a national economy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Unrealistic goals set for lower levels of government bodies to
achieve should be banned, with officials rewarded and promoted for
their actual achievements, instead of on the figures they
report. The proficiency level and job ethics of statistical
workers should also be improved, and more scientific statistical
measures adopted, he said.
</P>
<P>
The stipulations in the draft law which ban officials from
forcing statistical agencies to distort or falsify figures, and
mainly rely on periodical surveys or frequent random samples
instead of reports from government bodies, have won wide-range
approval from Chinese lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Lawmaker Wu Changshu further defined the law in respect of
specific time spans for statistical work, the frequency of surveys
and sampling. Another lawmaker Li Maosen proposed criminal
charges against "officials intentionally making up fake figures."
</P>
<P>
Bai Shangwu, Ye Shuhua and other legislators said the law
should include articles to encourage the public to report
illegal activities relating to statistical work.
</P>
<P>
They demanded statistical bureaux provide sources of their
numbers and other background information when publicizing figures,
and an assessment system be established to discuss the accuracy of
major statistical results, such as the rates of inflation and
jobless. They also want to see better public supervision over
statistical work.
</P>
<P>
Other members of the committee said the law should make it
clear that Chinese statistical methods and quotas should be
consistent with international standards.
</P>
<P>
"This will help make Chinese figures more scientific and
accurate, and be conducive to the country's economic and
scientific cooperation and exchanges with other countries," said
Lin Lanying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the lawmakers attending the panel discussion over the
draft law agreed to put the draft law to a vote at the end of this
NPC standing committee session on May 15.

<P>
NICOSIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will host an international
scientific seminar on "Osteoporosis Present and Future" on May 12.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar, organized by the Endocrine Society of
Cyprus (ESC), will be participated by 35 experts from neighboring
countries, including Qatar, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, ESC President
Krinos Trokoudes noted the people's ignorance about the disease
and stressed the need for precautionary measures.
</P>
<P>
Osteoporosis makes bones fragile and prone to breaking and it
is usually more common among women than men.
</P>
<P>
"The number of people to suffer in the future is very great
and the financial consequences will also be great if no
precautionary measures are taken," Trokoudes said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that osteoporosis in Cyprus is on similar levels with
neighboring countries even though the way of living, nutrition
and sunshine place it in a better position than other European
countries.

<HEADLINE> Clean-Up Call For China's Rivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators today demanded
the setting up of a special pollution watchdog patrol system to
protect China's vast river areas.
</P>
<P>
They want a task force of special and independent organs to
fight against pollution in the drainage areas of the country's
rivers, in a major clean-up drive.
</P>
<P>
The legislators, in Beijing to attend the 19th session of the
Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's legislature, made the call during a debate on a draft
amendment to the law on the control of water pollution.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment, intended to ease the current situation of
serious water pollution in China's major rivers, adds to existing
laws in the field of pollution control in river drainage areas,
urban sewage treatment and disposal, and protection of potable
water sources.
</P>
<P>
It also proposes new stipulations on pollutant discharge
permits and sewage treatment fees for polluters.
</P>
<P>
However, legislators noted that the new measures failed to
provide a satisfactory solution for water pollution in rivers
flowing through several cities and provinces.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's main rivers, such as the Yangtze River, the
Yellow River, and the Huai River, cross a number of provinces,
autonomous regions and municipalities, making the country's water
pollution control a more complicated issue.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of special organs responsible for combating
pollutions in the entire drainage area should be written clearly
into the law," legislator Xia Jiajun stressed.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Qingquan, member of the NPC Standing Committee, noted
that the fight against water pollution should begin at the sources
of the rivers.
</P>
<P>
"Only green mountains can generate pure water," he pointed out,
adding that much importance should be attached to afforestation
and fighting soil erosion in the river-source regions.
</P>
<P>
He also urged national departments to take resolute action
against small paper mills and tanneries in the mountainous areas,
which produce heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
The draft amendment will be put to vote at the end of the
nine-day session.

<HEADLINE> Full Steam Ahead for New Asia-Euro 'Silk Road' Rail Link: Li Peng </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's three major steps to enhance
a continental bridge linking Asia and Europe were spelled out by
premier Li Peng in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Describing the pan-continental rail link as a new "Silk Road"
for the 21st century, Li Peng stressed its key role in boosting
trade and the economies of countries from China in the east to
European countries in the west.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has maintained an active attitude
towards the development and cooperation among countries along the
new Euro-Asia Continental Bridge, said Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with participants at the on-going
International Symposium on Economic Development of Regions along
the New Euro-Asia Continental Bridge, Li Peng said China has
worked on three major programs over recent few years to make the
bridge a truly international rail link.
</P>
<P>
First: China completed a railway from Urumqi to Ala Pass,
turning the rail link between Asia and Europe into a smooth
transportation passage.
</P>
<P>
Second: China has double tracked the railway line from Lanzhou
to Urumqi, greatly increasing capacity.
</P>
<P>
Third: China has coordinated cargo transportation together with
Russia and five Central Asian countries to make best use of the
international railway, making it a major artery, or a "New Silk
Road" extending from China's eastern coastal areas to Rotterdam in
the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Li said the Euro-Asia Summit held in Bangkok in March this year
was an important historical meeting which proposed the
establishment of new partnership relationships.
</P>
<P>
"Asia needs Europe and Europe needs Asia," said Li, adding that
the construction of the new Euro-Asia Continental Bridge is a
concrete step for the establishment of such partnership
relationships. This in turn will bring about new opportunities for
the countries along the bridge, he added.
</P>
<P>
The most important way of expanding economic cooperation
between Asia and Europe is enhanced cooperation in transportation
and telecommunications, said the premier. The continental bridge
traverses vast areas in which there are both developed countries,
and developing countries that have rich resources and large market.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng expressed his wishes that the United Nations and
international finance organizations will offer support and help to
the regional economic cooperation along the new Euro-Asia
Continental Bridge.
</P>
<P>
By building the new Euro-Asia bridge towards the 21st century
as the focus, the international symposium which opened yesterday
and ends tomorrow has attracted more than 460 participants from
countries along the route, international organizations as well as
officials from Chinese provinces along the railway line.
</P>
<P>
Present at today's meeting were Song Jian, Chinese State
Councillor and minister in charge of the State Science and
Technology Commission, Ling Syargei, vice-premier of the Republic
of Belarus, and Jin Yongjian, undersecretary general of the United
Nations, and representatives from the relevant international
organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Senior drug control officials from
Cambodia, China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam and the United
Nations Drug Control Program (UNDCP) held a one-day meeting here
today on subregional cooperation in drug control.
</P>
<P>
It was the first meeting of the senior officials of the six MOU
member countries and the Program Steering Committee of the
1995-1998 Subregional Action Plan on Drug Control since the
ministerial meeting and the senior officials' meeting in Beijing
on May 27, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegation was led by Liu Zhimin, deputy
secretary-general of China's National Narcotics Control
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Liu said at the meeting that the senior officials' meeting
would further promote the cooperation in drug control in the
subregion.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Chinese government has all along attached
great importance to drug control in China and to the subregional
cooperation on the issue.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, 57,524 cases of drug smuggling and
trafficking were uncovered in China last year with 2,376 kilograms
of heroin seized. Actions were also taken to crack down on 12,000
drug-related criminals.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, over 500 rehabilitation centers had been
set up across China and over 60,000 people rehabilitated annually,
Liu added.
</P>
<P>
Two project documents -- Project for the Precursor Control in
East Asia and Project for Reducing Illegal Drug Use in the
Highlands of East Asia -- were signed at the meeting today.
</P>
<P>
China, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and the UNDCP signed the MOU on
drug control in New York in 1993, while Cambodia and Vietnam
joined the MOU membership in Beijing in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Number of Foreign Tourists in Hanoi Stagnates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- State-owned hotels in Hanoi, Vietnam's
capital city, are suffering big drops in occupancy as tourst
numbers stagnate and new privately-owned hotels scoop up remaining
business, report here said.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the "Vietnam Investment Review" quoted
Hanoi Tourism Department as saying that only 70,000 foreign
toursts visited Hanoi in the first three months of the year, 30
percent below an expected 100,000, only fractionally above the
69,000 who visited in the first quater of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi traditionally attracted 30 percent of tourists visiting
Vietnam. However, last year only 20 percent came to the capital.
</P>
<P>
While the whole tourism sector has been affected, Hanoi's
state-owned hotels have been hit particularly hard, as more
tourists stay in newly-opened private hotels.
</P>
<P>
Occupancy at state-owned hotels was down 30 percent in the
first quater campared to the same time last year, a high-ranking
official was quoted.
</P>
<P>
The tourism department hopes foreign tourist number will boost
to 400,000 this year after a total of 358,000 visitors came to
Hanoi last year.
</P>
<P>
Hanoi tourism department is aiming for 500,000 visitors in 1997
and about two million in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reiterates Support for Comprehensive Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Ahmed Fathi Sorour, Speaker of the
Egyptian People's Assembly (parliament), stressed here today that
his country was working for a just and comprehensive peace in the
Middle East instead of a peace of "surrender."
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
Sorour underlined Egypt's desire to support Lebanon "because the
peace can not be realized unless through a liberation of the
peoples."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed his country's support for the implementation of
U.N. Security Council resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sorour voiced his "categorical condemnation" of the Israeli
aggressions in south Lebanon last month. More than 160 civilians
were killed and hundreds of others wounded in 16 days of Israeli
bombardments and air strikes at southern Lebanese towns and
villages.
</P>
<P>
He especially denounced the massacre committed by Israel
against civilians in a U.N. military base in southern Lebanon on
April 18.
</P>
<P>
Israel shelled a military camp of the U.N. peacekeeping force
at the southern Lebanese town of Qana, where some 1,000 civilians
in the area sought shelter. Over 100 refugees were killed and more
others wounded in the bombardment.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has accused Israel of "deliberately and intentionally"
carrying out the bombardment, a charge vehemently denied by the
Jewish state. The United Nations has opened investigations into
the shelling.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian parliament speaker arrived in Beirut Tuesday on a
three-day official visit to lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He is to meet with his Lebanese counterpart Nabih Berri today
and hold a joint press conference with him following their
meeting.

<HEADLINE> Clothing Industry Facing New Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's profitable garment industry
had more than a decade of skyrocketing growth and 450 billion yuan
(54.2 billion US dollars) in sales and pre-tax profits of 26.5
billion yuan during the 1991-1995 period, but has run up against
some tough challenges both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
There are 47,000 clothing plants in China, where 2.6 million
sewing machines turn out 8.7 billion garments annually. Statistics
show that the country produced about 30 billion garments over the
past five years, and had yearly growth of 21 per cent.
</P>
<P>
"It seems like a millennium's evolution after I saw a nation in
Mao suits twenty years ago," said Mikihiko Banno, managing
director of Japanese Brother Co., Ltd, at the China International
Clothing and Accessory Exposure last month in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
In mirroring Banno's optimism about the industry, a number of
of foreign clothing company representatives in Beijing said that
the rapid development will extend into the next century without
pause.
</P>
<P>
But domestic garment people are not so confident, and have been
showing signs of worry recently.
</P>
<P>
Dong Binggen, general secretary of the Chinese Garment
Association (CGA), said that in the next five years the industry
could find itself in a lot of trouble ranging from price hikes in
raw materials and labor to low efficiency and backward technology.
</P>
<P>
The challenge will first come from foreign trade, according to
analysts here. The world's garment business will accelerate the
transformation toward a technical and capital-intensive industry,
leaving a shrinking market share for the labor-intensive
production model one finds in China. The country's advantage will
also be challenged by the much cheaper labor of neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The association's statistics show that the growth in garment
exports dropped sharply since March, 1995. Then there was a 4.4
per cent drop in exports of shuttle-woven garments and
accessories, which account for 55 per cent of the total export of
the industry, last year, bringing the country's four-decade
garment export increase to a halt.
</P>
<P>
Sheng Caiqing, vice-president of the China National Garment
Corporation, said that the high growth of the past five years is
hard to keep up unless the industry upgrades its technology and
improve its efficiency rapidly, so as to increase competitiveness
of Chinese garments in overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The CGA and the National Textile Council of China jointly
launched a "brand-name strategy" among domestic garment
enterprises this spring to produce more Chinese brands and to
compete with foreign products on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The program will target investment in technical renovation of
domestic clothing plants, improving the quality of coats and
lining materials, and fashion design.
</P>
<P>
It will also open a group of special stores for domestic
brand-name garments in large cities over the next three years, and
set up a development conglomerate for famous-brand garments by
integrating several major plants.

<HEADLINE> Competition Among Airlines in Kuwait benefits Travelers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
Kuwaitis planning to spend their vacation abroad are glad to see
an intensified competition among various airlines operating in
Kuwait to reduce ticket prices to attract customers.
</P>
<P>
An agent from a tourism office here said Kuwaiti residents
planning to go to other countries to shun the burning hot weather
at home in the current season from May to October will be
benefited from the ticket prices reduction war among the airlines.
</P>
<P>
Now there are more than 30 foreign airlines in Kuwait
providing passenger carriage services to nearly half of the 1.6
million Kuwaiti residents who usually go abroad to evade the
summer heat.
</P>
<P>
Every summer, business for the airlines is booming and it is a
season that would bring them much more business returns. Also, the
season usually see a fierce competition among them to reduce
ticket prices.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, thirteen foreign airlines flying the
Asian lines agreed on a minimum price limit for various
destinations. But it was not long after the accord came into
effect the limit was broken by themselves. Ticket prices for both
the direct and transit flights from Kuwait to various Asian
destinations were reduced to the level lower than that offered
before the 1996 New Year.
</P>
<P>
"You could only give 475 U.S. dollars for a return ticket for
a direct flight from Kuwait to India's capital of Delhi or its
southern city of Bombay, and a 9 percent agent fee also is
included in the sum," said a passenger.
</P>
<P>
Actually only 432 dollars go to the pocket of the airline.
</P>
<P>
Competition among various agents is equally fierce as some of
them give a 5 percent of the service fee to the customers as
incentives to attract them to buy ticket through them, making the
passengers pay 30 dollars less than the original price.
</P>
<P>
Transit ticket prices are even lower as prices for a transit
ticket from Kuwait to Delhi via other country are usually less
than 430 dollars. Besides, most of the airlines allow an
extra baggage weight of more than 50 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Some airlines have even taken more favourite measures. They let
the agents to give out two tickets free of charge for every 12
tickets sold and this give a much more freer hand for the agents
to cut the prices and refrain from criticism from other
competitors. A travel agent who asked no to be identified said
that the price for a return ticket for traveling to Lahore,
Pakistan, is originally at 495 dollars, but after being given two
tickets as gifts, the real price come down to 412.5 dollars."
</P>
<P>
Ticket to Dhaka, Bangladesh, is sold at the lowest prices. One
foreign airline has been offering return ticket on its flight for
420 dollars, 230 dollars lower than the agreed minimum price
by the airlines.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Election Campaigns at High Gear in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Campaigns for the Israeli general
elections, scheduled for May 29, switch into high gear today with
the disappearance from regular radio and TV newscasts of all
candidates in adherence to election rules.
</P>
<P>
But political propaganda broadcasts on television will be
officially launched this evening. For the next three weeks,
campaign "commercials" will fill the airwaves, and activities on
the street will intensify.
</P>
<P>
The broadcasts will appear on Israel Television Channel 1 at
8:40 p.m. local time (1740 GMT) and on Channel 2 at 10:30
p.m. (1930 GMT) for half an hour.
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the major parties' television broadcasts will
particularly target the "floating" voters, who are still amenable
to influence, since the majority of the population has already
made up its mind.
</P>
<P>
However, the gap between the candidates seems so narrow that
the attitudes of the "undecided" voters will be very crucial in
the election for the next premier, although they amount to no more
than 2 to 3 percent of the electors.
</P>
<P>
Israel's prime minister, for the first time, will be elected
along with the Knesset (Israel's parliament) elections, and Labor
Party leader Shimon Peres, the current prime minister, and Likud
Party Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu are the candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Likud Tuesday night showed reporters some of what it had
been putting together for the broadcasts. One of the party's
strategists, Eyal Arad, said that in contrast to previous years,
the Likud will opt for short, fast-paced spots, as seen in the
American election campaign.
</P>
<P>
In one such ad, Peres is described as "detached from reality
when he depends on Yasser Arafat," President of Palestinian
National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Peres is shown walking hand in hand with Arafat and smiling
broadly. "Such a team poses a danger," viewers are told.
</P>
<P>
Other clips will feature disenchanted Labor Party and Meretz,
another left wing party, supporters who have decided to vote for
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Likud Knesset Member Dan Meridor, who heads the Likud strategy
team, said his party "will concentrate on our own messages and not
get sidetracked by reacting to Labor provocations."
</P>
<P>
"They will not dictate our agenda," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, assassinated
last November by a Jewish extremist, Peres, and hundreds of
youngsters will be the main figures in Labor's television
broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
Labor is planning a sharp attack on Netanyahu, which will
include negative statements about him by candidates on his own
party's list.
</P>
<P>
Footage of Rabin and Peres will also be broadcast to remind
voters that Peres, who took over as the prime minister after
Rabin's assassination, is the heir to Rabin's legacy and he is
continuing his peace policy.
</P>
<P>
The broadcasts show Peres surrounded by hundreds of youths
singing one of the campaign jingles "we are with you" and hugging
and kissing him, an answer to the issue raised by the Likud's
campaign about Peres's advanced age, compared to Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Labor's information staff has also collected hundreds of video
clips with statements made by Netanyahu and other Likud leaders,
and of demonstrations reflecting the incitement and violence
prevalent before Rabin's assassination and the attempt to
delegitimize the government.
</P>
<P>
However, Labor's campaign information director Haim Ramon, the
interior minister, said he has not yet decided whether to use all
or any of these materials.
</P>
<P>
It is assumed that Labor will use the clips only if the Likud
broadcasts pictures of mass terrorist attacks and hints that Peres
is responsible for them.
</P>
<P>
Some broadcasts will present the achievements of the
Rabin-Peres government, in contrast to the failures of the
previous Likud government.
</P>
<P>
Others will show Netanyahu making contradictory statements
concerning talks with the PLO, the Oslo peace accords and other
issues.

<HEADLINE> Australians Hold Rally Against Public Servants Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 public servants
rallied outside the Parliament House here today to demonstrate
their anger at the federal government's proposed public sector
cuts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally, Joint National Secretary of the
Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) Wendy Caird accused the
government of treating the public sector with scorn and contempt.
</P>
<P>
According to the CPSU, up to 15,000 public servants could be
sacked under the government's plan to cut 8 billion Australian
dollars (6 billion US dollars) in spending over the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Caird said she expected most of the CPSU's 65,000 public
sector members to take part in national stop work meetings around
the country tomorrow where plans for further campaigns would be
discussed, including a possible 24-hour strike.
</P>
<P>
The government has already announced about 6,000 job cuts after
the coalition government coming into office since last March. By
noting this, Australian Democrats leader Cheryl Kernot said the
government had already broken its promise to cut just 2,500 public
service jobs with the 6,000 job losses already foreshadowed.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Insurance Company Launches Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Natinal Insurance Corporation
(NIC) on Tuersday launched the country's first livestock insurance
policy at a ceremony attended by the Minister for Agriculture and
Co-operatives, Mr. Paul Kimiti, in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Kimiti said the livestock protector policy had come at the
right time when the livestock sector was being given priority by the
government.
</P>
<P>
He said international organisations like the World Foof Program
(WFP) were supporting small-scale farmers while some banks had
launched studies on how to finance large investors in dairy farming.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore a timely coincidence that you in the NIC have now
decided to sell your livestock insurance cover to Tanznians," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said this should rejuvenate the farming industry as a whole and
make it more attractive to young people migrating to urban areas on
the pretext of non-availability of economic activities in the rural
sector.
</P>
<P>
The Managing Director of the NIC, Mr. Octavian Temu, said he
expected that the livestock insurance policy would lead to a faster
commercialisation and monetarisation of the livestock sector.
</P>
<P>
"Some banks and financial institutions will accept the insured
livestock as good security for loans, and so livestock keepers will
have better access to loan financing," Mr. Temu said.
</P>
<P>
The NIC Chief Marketing Manager, Mr. Israel Kamuzora, said earlier
that the insurance would cover dairy cattle between six months and 10
years, stud bulls 18 months to 10 years, beef cattle between six
months and five years of age.
</P>
<P>
It would also cover Oxen between two years and eight years,
traditional cattle between six months and 10 years, provided kept
together with the "exotic breed" as the same flock.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe University Faces Serious Financial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The University of Zimbabwe is facing
serious cash-flow problems since January and has frozen all vacant
academic, administrative and technical posts.
</P>
<P>
A senior administration officer said yesterday that all the 72
department heads were recently instructed to ensure there was no
further staff intake until the financial situation improved.
</P>
<P>
The country's largest institution of higher learning faces a
shortfall of neary 3.2 million US dollars, the official said.
</P>
<P>
''The financial problems started in january this year because,
since then, the government has not given us enough funds. We are
supposed to get 29 million Zimbabwe Dollars (over 2.9 million US
Dollars) every month for salaries but out of that we sometimes get 8
million Zimbabwe Dollars (0.8 million US Dollars) short,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The freezing of posts badly affected the teaching services which
were already strained by the brain drain of lecturers to universities
in neighboring countries offering better working conditions.
</P>
<P>
This had affected a number of services offered to students, one of
which was the liberary, which might to open for less hours because
of the staff shortages, the official said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Foreign Financial Institutions Doing Well </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign financial institutions in
south China's Guangdong seemed to parallel the province's
prosperity, with profits of more than 80 million yuan last year,
according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The first foreign bank opened in Shenzhen in 1982. Since then,
the number of foreign financial institutions in the province,
mainly set up in Guangzhou, the provincial capital, and three
special economic zones of Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou, has risen
to 112. Fifty have gone operational.
</P>
<P>
A local official said that assets of foreign banks and
financial companies in Guangdong are nearly six billion US
dollars, over 30 percent of the total for foreign financial
institutions in China.
</P>
<P>
They currently have more than four billion US dollars in
outstanding loans and about 900 million US dollars in
deposits. The two figures are 33 and 28 percent, respectively, of
national total for foreign financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The official said that foreign financial institutions have
played a "very positive" role in Guangdong's economic development
and opening-up.

<HEADLINE> Model Town Created For Mentally Retarded Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A town that contains hospitals, post
offices, and even intersections in a miniature form has been
created for mentally retarded children in Yuxin Primary School in
Harbin, capital city of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Teachers of the school, which helps mentally retarded children,
hope the 20,000 yuan model town will be a means of helping its
students learn a common sense approach to life.
</P>
<P>
Although the school has "learning how to exist" as its basic
education objective, teachers still find that their students need
to be accompanied when making the trip to school and back by their
parents simply because they are unable to tell the difference
between red lights and green.
</P>
<P>
Qu Xiuying, headmaster of the school, decided therefore to
simulate a society, in a belief that the miniature version, which
is quite like the larger one, could facilitate learning in such
mundane areas as seeing a doctor, posting a letter, or crossing an
intersection.

ground for enhancing national understanding and unity. enditem

<HEADLINE> Likud Platform Challenges Labor's Peace Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Likud, the major opposition party
in Israel, has unveiled its platform offering the Palestinians a
limited autonomy as the campaign for the Israeli general elections
switch into high gear.
</P>
<P>
The platform, released for publication Tuesday night, opens
with a declaration saying that "the right of the Jewish people to
the land of Israel is eternal and inalienable, as is the Jewish
people's right to security and peace."
</P>
<P>
According to the platform, peace will become a central
objective for a new Likud government and it will negotiate
directly with Arab states to achieve peace.
</P>
<P>
But security is judged to be "the basis without which a
lasting peace in this region is not possible. Israel will make
certain that security is maintained as a primary condition for
any peace arrangement," the platform says.
</P>
<P>
It says that a Likud government "will respect international
agreements, will continue the diplomatic process in quest of a
just and lasting peace, will recognize facts created on the ground
by previous agreements, and will strive to minimize the dangers
inherent in these agreements to Israel's future and security."
</P>
<P>
Israel will negotiate with the Palestinian Authority (PA) to
achieve a final status agreement on condition that the PA fully
lives up to all of its undertakings and, in particular, will
nullify completely and unequivocally those clauses of the
Palestinian covenant calling for Israel's destruction, and will
prevent terror and put an end to anti-Israel incitement, the
platform says.
</P>
<P>
Under a new Likud government, the platform adds, immigration to
Israel will be increased, settlement enhanced and the decision to
freeze settlement will be rescinded.
</P>
<P>
Other key points in the platform are as follows:
</P>
<P>
The government will enable Palestinians to freely run their
own affairs in the framework of an autonomy. But foreign
relations, security and those matters which require coordination
will remain under Israel's control.
</P>
<P>
The government will oppose the creation of an independent
Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Employment opportunities will be developed in the PA areas to
reduce the number of Palestinians working in Israel. The
government will seek to limit Israel's dependence on foreign
labor.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem, united and indivisible, is Israel's capital. The
government will outlaw activity to undermine the status of
Jerusalem as Israel's capital. PLO and PA institutions in
Jerusalem will be closed, including Orient House.
</P>
<P>
Eliahu Ben-Elissa, who heads the Likud platform committee, said
Tuesday night that "a Likud government will make sure that Gaza
and Nablus are not turned into safe havens for terrorists. Our
aim will not to retake these cities, but we reserve the
freedom to send the Israel Defense Forces in and act, should
the need arise, and once our mission is accomplished we will
pull out."
</P>
<P>
Likud information campaign head Limor Livnat said that "should
(PA President Yasser) Arafat and the PA indeed fully live up
to their part of the bargain, we will deal with him and
meet with him."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli general elections are scheduled for May 29.

<HEADLINE> Rich Oil Reserves Shunned In Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Not less than 16 billion US Dollars
worth of crude oil is presenly trapped in marginal oil fields
in Nigeria due to oil companies' reluctance to prospect the
fields.
</P>
<P>
According to today's the Punch newspaper, the amount
represents the minimum recoverable reserve of 800 million
barrels underneath the oil fields located in the reservoirs
of the Niger Delta Basin where the bulk of Nigerian crude
oil is concentrated.
</P>
<P>
The fields, abandoned and considered marginal or uneconomical
by the major oil prospecting companies in the past 38 years,
have remained unexploited, thereby reducing Nigeria's
producibility capacity and proven reserve base, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At a professional workshop here yesterday, the Ministry of
Petroleum Resources emphasiezed the need to tap these neglected
reserves.
</P>
<P>
Minister Chief Etete, represented by the minitry's Director-
General Alhaji Salihu Mohammed Jega, said at the one-day workshop
there was the need to unlock these production capacity.
</P>
<P>
"These marginal fields could become economical based on the
adopted strategy of field development and production management,"
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has noted the problems and is putting
necessary framework to encourage the development of existing
marginal fields. enditem

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's New Constitution Assured Of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's long-awaiting new
constitution is assured of the required two-thirds majority in the
constitutional assembly (CA) today, reported local media sources.
</P>
<P>
An eleventh-hour compromise agreement, reached between the african
National Congress (ANC) and the National Party (NP) before midnight
and approved by the CA's Constitutional Committee in early hours on
Wednesday, paved the way for the CA to adopt the constitution today.
</P>
<P>
The ANC-NP agreement on new formulations for the education,
property rights and lock-out clauses finally ruled out the prospect
of a damaging referendum split, and even fresh elections, if the CA
failed to adopt the constitution today, said the local daily ''the
Star''.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the agreement, the NP made compromises on education
and lock-out while the ANC on property.
</P>
<P>
The NP dropped its insistence on the entrenchment of mother tongue
schooling, and its demand for a tougher labour relations clause
regarding an employer's right to lock out striking workers. While the
ANC agreed to stronger private property guarantees under a
reformulated property clause.
</P>
<P>
After having been briefed by CA Chairman and ANC Secretary-General
Cyril Ramaphosa and other ANC negotiators, President Nelson Mandela
said he was satisfied the ANC had stuck to its ''well-considered
bottom lines'' on the three outstanding issues, despite making
''countless concessions''.
</P>
<P>
After the agreement was sealed at a final meeting of the
constitutional committee last night, NP chief negotiator and party's
Secretary-General Roelf Meyer was quoted as saying that ''we have a
settlement, we have done it.''
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an equally upbeat Ramaphosa said: ''I think we have
reached a stage where a real breakthrough can be reported.''
</P>
<P>
However, the Inkatha Freedom Party and the Democratic Party said
last night they would challenge the new constitution before the
constitutional court. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwait-based Arab Fund for
Economic and Social Development is considering to extend an
emergency loan to Lebanon for repairing public works damaged by
the Israeli bombardment from April 11 to 27.
</P>
<P>
The fund had sent a team to Lebanon to evaluate its need for
finance to rehabilitate electricity and water installations and
housing facilities, said Abdellatif Al-Hamad, chairman of the fund.
</P>
<P>
He added that the team will submit a report to the board of the
fund, one of Arab world's leading institutions providing soft
loans for development.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that Lebanon should not be ignored," he said.
</P>
<P>
The fund, with shares owned by 21 Arab governments, extends
loans mainly to projects that promote Arab economies, with

million dollars for repairs to other electricity facilities in the
country .

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lauds Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has commended
the Tanzanian government for its policies, saying Tanzania was
now doing well economically than many countries in the sub-
Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank Resident Representative, Ronald Brigish,
told a press conference here on Tuesday, that while the Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) growth in sub-Saharan Africa was about
3.0 percent, Tanzania registered a GDP growth of 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
Brigish, however, said that Tanzania had bright prospects
and could register economic growth of even 10 percent a year
like Uganda.
</P>
<P>
He added Tanzanian government should continue with such policies,
striving to attain efficiency in tax collection, liberalisation
of trade and curbing budget deficits should be continued, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is better off economically than many sub-saharan
countries, but it still has budget deficits which in turn lead
to high inflation rates at around 30 percent", Brigish said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he was looking forward to increased co-operation
between the Tanzania government and multilateral donor institutions
like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Brigish pointed out that the economies of sub-saharan
African were reportedly on the rise, a trend that has been
attributed to higher commodity prices in the world market,
liberal economic plicies and peaceful transition to multi-party
politics.
</P>
<P>
Giving the highlights of the world bank report entitled
Global Economic Prospects and Developing Countries 1996,
Brigish said the income of individual sub-Sahara Africans
was growing and had registered a highest average growth rate
since 1989.
</P>
<P>
He said 30 countries out of 48 in the region, recorded GDP
increases of more than 3.0 percent a year, a level that was
slightly above population growth.
</P>
<P>
Brigish said third world countries like tanzania could
benefit provided they exploit most of the areas in which they
have comparative advantages, citing examples as a lot of potential
in horticulture, farming of flowers and etc. enditem

<HEADLINE> China Intent on Speeding up Western Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The time is ripe for picking up
the pace of economic development in west China, a senior Chinese
official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Both the fundamental changes in China's economic structure and
the sustained development of its national economy call for faster
growth in the under-developed parts of west China, said Zhang
Haoruo, vice-minister of the State Commission for Restructuring
the Economy.
</P>
<P>
In the long view, accelerated development in western China
would benefit not only the west but also the east and the nation
as a whole, Zhang said at a national seminar on the reform and
opening of west China that started in Panzhihua, Sichuan Province,
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
It is not merely a matter of economics, but a political one, in
that it is vital to China's long-term development and stability,
he told those at the four-day seminar, which is attended by over
100 economists and other scholars.
</P>
<P>
Because of China's vast size and large population, disparities
in economic growth between regions is unavoidable, but they should
be kept within a certain range, he noted, pointing out that in
order to do so and to work for common prosperity, the Chinese
government launched an anti-poverty campaign in 1994, pledging to
help the country's 80 million people living in poverty to improve
their lives in seven years.
</P>
<P>
The country's Ninth Five-Year Plan and the long-term program
for economic development up to 2010 unveiled earlier this year at
the fourth session of the Eighth National People's Congress
established guidelines for speeding up economic and social
development in central and west China.
</P>
<P>
To improve the economy there, breakthroughs should be made in
reforming state-owned enterprises because they account for 75
percent of the total industrial firms in central and west China,
Zhang explained.
</P>
<P>
While maintaining public ownership, central and west China
should at the same time encourage the development of non-state
sectors by granting them equal status in applying for bank loans,
in obtaining the rights of land use, and in foreign trade and
taxation, the vice-minister said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to increase development of
township-run firms, because they are flexible in both production
and management, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In his concluding remarks, Zhang urged central and west China
to seize every opportunity possible and to open wider both to
other regions and to the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> Traffic Expected to Be Busy on New Continental Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Container traffic on the new
Eurasian Continental Bridge will probably surpass 20,000 TEUs this
year, according to well-informed Chinese sources.
</P>
<P>
In the first four months of this year, nearly 1,000 TEUs were
loaded on trains at Lianyungang, the start of the continental
bridge in China's coastal Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
Running 10,800 km from Lianyungang Port to Rotterdam in the
Netherlands, the new continental bridge is the shortest railway
line between the Pacific and the Atlantic, some 8,000 to 15,000 km
shorter than the ocean route.
</P>
<P>
The first international container train crossing China left in
December 1992. Since then, China has made every effort to increase
the amount of traffic on the bridge, said Cheng Zhipei, head of
the Continental Bridge Transport Co-ordinating Group of
Lianyungang City.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese State Council has approved several administrative
documents on international container transport on the bridge, and
has reached an agreement with Kazakhstan, allowing the latter to
export products from Lianyungang Port.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities have chosen the China National Foreign
Trade Transportation Corporation and three other companies as
international container transport agents on the route, and they
have established strong business ties in the region.
</P>
<P>
Two container berths with an annual capacity of 200,000 TEUs
have been put in service in Lianyungang, which now operates five
container lines to Asia and Europe, with 24 liners each month.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, and
four Central Asian nations have agreed to ship their containers
via the bridge, said Cheng.

KATHMANDU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali Congress (NC), the
country's main ruling party, opened its 9th general convention
today when nearly 1,500 NC representatives from the country's 75
districts along with thousands of supporters gathered here in the
capital city.
</P>
<P>
Before NC President Krishna Prasad Bhattarai announced the
opening of the convention, former prime minister and senior NC
leader Girija Prasad Koirala in his speech said that the four-day
meeting would help strengthen the party's solidarity and make it
stronger in politics.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of other major parties, including NC's ruling
partner the National Democratic Party (RPP) and main opposition
Communist Party of Nepal (UML) delivered their congratulating
messages on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The convention was scheduled to adopt the party's policy and
programs for the next five years and select a new party
leadership.
</P>
<P>
Senior leader Koirala was expected to be elected new party
president though altogether three candidates have registered for
the NC presidential election to be held at the end of the
convention.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1947, the NC is the oldest political party in Nepal.
It became the first ruling party in 1991 soon after the country
introduced a multi-party parliamentary system.
</P>
<P>
The present NC-led coalition government was formed last
September after NC joined with RPP to pass a no-confidence motion
against the minority Communist Party (UML) government in the lower
house.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed
and five others were wounded last evening when fierce fighting
broke out between opposing militiamen of General Mohamed Farah
Aidid in the southern port town of Merca.
</P>
<P>
The armed confrontation is said to have rooted back to a
serious quarrel between a new officer nominated by the
selfstyled government of Aidid for the port administration,
Sheikh Jama Haji Hussein, and the former port officer.
</P>
<P>
Militiamen loyal to the new officer stormed into the port
calling everybody else to leave the port premises. Just a few
minutes later, seven technical war wagons with more than 90
heavily armed militiamen have surrounded the port facility
ordering those in the port to surrender their weapons.
</P>
<P>
The shooting which ensued forced the militiamen inside the
port to flee and they captured a strategic building in the
town. However, the building was also surrounded by the wagons.
</P>
<P>
The shooting has forced many Habar Gidir elders to stand up to
intervene.
</P>
<P>
Although no shooting is heard, the town of merca remains
tense but calm this morning.
</P>
<P>
The port operation has been suspended due to the fighting.

<HEADLINE> Belgium's Bank to Expand Operation in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Belgium's major bank Generale Bank
is making efforts to expand its operations in Asia, especially in
China's mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan, a leading official of the
bank said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ferdinand Chaffart, Managing Director and Chairman of the
bank's Executive Committee, said at a press conference here today
that discussions are being held for opening Generale Bank branches
in Guangzhou in South China, Hong Kong and Taipei.
</P>
<P>
The Generale Bank has long been involved in such areas as trade
financing, Chaffart said, adding that "we are now determined to
offer Asian clients our ever-expanding range of associated
products and services."
</P>
<P>
"As one of the most prosperous and successful economies in the
region, Hong Kong is obviously a vital element in any ongoing
Asian development strategy," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the Generale Bank's major operating entity in the Far East,
the Hong Kong-based Belgium Bank began operations in 1935.
</P>
<P>
The Belgium Bank has progressed and expanded to become one of
the leading European banks in Hong Kong and one of the most
profitable. The Belgium Bank will have up to 30 branches in Hong
Kong by 1997.
</P>
<P>
"China, as a major component in the development plans of
leading international banking institutions and all of them wish to
establish a strong presence in this rapidly growing market,"
Chaffart said.
</P>
<P>
With representative offices set up in Beijing and Shanghai as
early as in the 1930s, the Generale Bank has steadily moved into
the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
And last year, it established a joint subsidiary called Grand
Generale Asia Limited with Grand Resources, a Hong Kong-based
subsidiary of the Guangdong Development Bank. It began operations
on August 18 last year, concentrating on securities, brooking and
asset management in the Hong Kong market.
</P>
<P>
This joint venture will facilitate shareholders' efforts to
develop financial services in both Europe and China.
</P>
<P>
The Generale Bank is now making efforts to establish a branch
in Hong Kong later this year to realize its worldwide 24-hour
banking operations. It will operate alongside with the Belgium
Bank in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Generale Bank is a major pan-European banking organization
with consolidated assets of BFr 4,379 billion or 1,240 billion HK
dollars (159 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Last year's consolidated net profit rose 8.1 percent to BFr
13.7 billion or 3.62 billion HK dollars (464 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Generale Bank with over 1,100 branches in
Belgium, has embarked on a determined expansion program, both in
Europe and Asia.
</P>
<P>
"As Asia is becoming more and more important, therefore it is
normal that we shift part of our treasury operations here,"
explained Chaffart.
</P>
<P>
The Belgium Bank will mainly be in charge of the local treasury
operations while the Generale Bank will take care of the global
operations.
</P>
<P>
And applications have been filed for opening branches in
Guangzhou and Taipei, in order to take part in the financing of
the growling trade in the region. The Guangzhou branch is
expected to begin operating sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
"We will expand our operations wherever the local economies can
support it," said Chaffart.
</P>
<P>
"We also have our representative offices in Indonesia, Thailand
and Japan. We have made the Belgium Bank as our main base and
therefore we will remain based in the most important country in
the area which is China," he added.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Telephone Number Upgraded to Eight Digit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The telecommunications authority in
the Chinese capital announced that the work to upgrade telephone
numbers in the city from seven-digit to eight-digit had been
successfully finished by 00:00 (Beijing time) today.
</P>
<P>
A special ceremony was held before Li Qiyan, Mayor of Beijing,
announced that the upgrading work was successful and operation of
the whole telephone network normal.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Posts and Telecommunications Wu Jichuan, other
officials with the municipal government and telecommunications
departments and the capital's media witnessed the whole upgrading
procedure.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Li Peng and Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo extended
congratulations to the success.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications companies of Hong Kong, France, Britain, the
Republic of Korea and Singapore also sent representatives to the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Many of Beijing residents tried to dial the new phone numbers
this morning, who only need to add "6" before the former
seven-digit numbers.
</P>
<P>
"It's really easy to remember the new telephone numbers," Zhou
Guilan, a housewife living in Chongwen District, told Xinhua by
phone.
</P>
<P>
Local telecommunications department spent more than one year to
finally decide the upgrading methods, and changed and tested
dozens of equipment to ensure their normal operation, the
authority said.
</P>
<P>
Ni Yilin, director of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau,
said that changing phone numbers is "very necessary for future
development of Beijing's telecommunications sector".
</P>
<P>
Beijing had 4.09 million lines of phones and 1.5 million
subscribers by the end of last year, compared with 26,000 lines
and 17,000 subscribers in 1949, and 300,000 lines and 86,000
subscribers in 1980.
</P>
<P>
"Seven-digit phone number resource can no longer satisfy the
rapid growth of demands for phones," Ni said.
</P>
<P>
Eight digits, currently used in Paris, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and
Shanghai, are expected to enlarge Beijing's telephone exchange
capacity to 40 million, far more than potential demand for phones
in this city of 11 million people, before the year 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
The city plans to expand phone exchange capacity to seven
million lines by the year 2000, enabling phone coverage rate to
reach 45 percent in the whole area and 62 percent in urban
districts, compared with 24 percent in the whole area and 35.5
percent in urban districts in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city will have more than 800,000 mobile phone
subscribers by 2000.
</P>
<P>
The city will install four million new phones in the next five
years, so that each Beijing family can have a phone by then, Ni
noted.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Complain About Motorized Bicycles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Motorized bicycles, which are
convenient and fast, have become quite popular in Shanghai, where
there are some 400,000 of them - but they are also a real headache
for many of the city's residents.
</P>
<P>
According to today's "Guangming Daily", the exhaust from
motorized bicycles and other motor vehicles in China's leading
industrial city, which is one of the most crowded cities in the
world, has seriously polluted the air and is one of the major
causes of lung cancer, which has the highest incidence among all
diseases in the city.
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say that exhaust emitted by motorized
bicycles is four times denser than that from other automobiles
because of their primitive technology.
</P>
<P>
To check the rapid increase of motorized bicycles, the city
came up with production standards in 1994, but no regulations have
so far been drafted to cope with the existing machines, which are
roaming the local streets as carefree as ever.
</P>
<P>
The local environmental protection bureau seems to have little
say in the matter, the paper points out. In contrast, China's
capital, Beijing, has banned the riding of motorized bicycles and
motorbikes inside its ring-road area.
</P>
<P>
Experts suggest that stringent measures be developed to stop
the spread of motorized bicycles in large cities.

WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese women's volleyball
team is to hold four matches with its U.S. counterpart on May 8-13
in southern California, as a warm-up for the summer Olympic Games
starting July 19.
</P>
<P>
Their four matches will be held respectively on May 8 at the
University of California-Irvine's Bren Events Center; May 10 at
the University of California San Diego's RIMAC Arena; May 11 at
California State San Bernardino's Coussoulis Arena; and may 13 at
EastLake High School in Chula Vista, California.
</P>
<P>
Both the teams were designed as the one-two seeds in Pool A of
the 1996 Olympics by the International Volleyball Federation
(FIVB) recently.
</P>
<P>
The two teams, among top three finishers in 1995 World Cup,
have long been ticketed to Atlanta. They will be joined in the
same Pool by third-seed South Korea and three yet-to-be-determined
teams.
</P>
<P>
Pool B will feature top-seed Cuba, along with second-seed
Brazil, third-seed Russia and three others.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's team, led by captain Lang Ping (currently
the team's head coach) won the gold medal in its first-ever
Olympic appearance in 1984, defeating Team USA. Four years later,
at Seoul, the Chinese girls took the bronze medal, while the
U.S. squad slipped to seventh place. However, At Barcelona in
1992, the two teams traded places.
</P>
<P>
China won 11 straight matches played against Team USA in 1993
and 1994, but the Americans enjoyed revenge last year with a 4-0
mark against the Chinese team.

<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's gross domestic
product (GDP) grew 4.1 percent last year, largely because of lower
inflation and sharp growth in services.
</P>

In 1995, Brazil's annual per capita income was 4,053.72 reals,
or about 4,000 dollars, reflecting an increase of 2.7 percent.
Meanwhile, inflation was 23 percent.
</P>
<P>
Services accounted for 52.3 percent of Brazil's GDP last year,
followed by industry, 34.4 percent; agriculture, 13.3 percent; and
finance, 7.7 percent.
</P>

WELLINGTON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government has
decided to inject 130 million NZ dollars (88 million US dollars)
into public hospitals in the next three years to clear the backlog
of elective surgery.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision today, Health Minister Jenny Shipley
said she is confident the extra money will go "a very long way"
toward wiping out waiting lists.
</P>
<P>
At present, nearly 94,000 people are waiting for surgery in
public hospitals, up 50 percent from 1993 when NZ started a
health reform aimed at increasing the efficiency of the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The extra money announced today will not be allocated to
specific regions but will be set aside in a special fund which
hospitals will have to compete for.
</P>
<P>
Only patients waiting for surgery as at today's date or waiting
for their first specialist assessment will be considered.
</P>
<P>
Before they can apply for the extra money, hospitals will be
expected to go through waiting lists and identify those people who
most need treatment.

HAVANA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Cuba is ready to continue

the Cuban Foreign Ministry said today, denying that the talks were

JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government has decided
to provide 115 million US dollars to Indonesia to help the
less-developed villages in the country, Antara news agency today
quoted an official source as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese financial assistance will be utilized for the

<HEADLINE> France Sets Up Watchdog Body on Religious Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The French government set up a
watchdog body to supervise activities of religious sects today,
urging authorities to protect people vulnerable to indoctrination
by suicidal cults.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a cabinet meeting today, President Jacques Chirac
said that "it's the state's responsibility to protect the weakest,
especially children" while respecting personal liberties.
</P>
<P>
So the government will use legal methods to counterattack
illegal religious activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "observatory against sects," which is led by
Prime Minister Alain Juppe, will submit a report annually to
parliament on the activities of sects in the country and offer
proposals for dealing with their illegal activities.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said laxity toward sects could allow the problem of
ritual suicides and murders to spread out of control.
</P>
<P>
Last December, 16 members of the Order of the Solar Temple died
in a remote French Alpine forest clearing in a ritual
suicide-cum-murder. In 1994, 53 members of the cult died in
Switzerland and Canada in similar circumstances.
</P>
<P>
At present, 173 out of the more than 400 sects existing in
France are preaching their superstitious ideas such as the end of
the world, constituting potential dangers for the lives of their
members and the national economy.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Production to Reach Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rice production this
year will reach 51.16 million tons, an increase of 2.6 percent
over 49.86 million tons last year, an Agricultural Department
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"If the target is reached, it would be Indonesia's largest to
date," Director General of Food and Horticulture Amir Kahar said,
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said rice and grains production in 1995 was higher than the
target and "the 1996 target therefore will not be hard to meet."
</P>
<P>
Data from the Bureau of Statistics (BPS) showed that corn
production last year went up 19.7 percent with a total output of
8.2 million tons while soybeans increased 7.94 percent with a
total production of 1.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Other commodities such as peanuts, green beans and sweet
potatoes increased 19.9 percent, 12.9 percent and 15.85 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kahar said efforts had been made such as the development of
intensive-farming methods and high-quality gogo-type rice, the
extension of farming areas in irrigated regions and the opening of
new rice fields in tidal areas and peat land in central
Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
Through these efforts, he said, the target of 51.16 million
tons of rice production in 1996 is likely to be reached.

BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Fraudulent tax claims have caused
great anxiety to the Thai Revenue Department because they have

Director-General of the department Suchart Jaovisith said "it

While tax fraud is a concern, "shell" companies are another.
</P>
<P>
Recently authorities arrested three suspects in a
128-mllion-baht (5.12 million US dollars) tax fraud. The three
were lured to form "shell" companies, which did not do any
business, but were used as fronts to claim tax reimbursements.

<HEADLINE> EU May Increase Imports of Latin American Bananas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) may
increase banana imports from Latin America by some 14 percent,
raising quotas by 350,000 tons to 2.5 million tons a year, a top
EU official has told growers.
</P>
<P>
But he rejected calls from the region's banana growers for a
guarantee of an annual increase in the quota and the abolition of
import tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Alexander Tilgenkamp, director of the organization of product
markets for the EU, said the decision to increase imports is
subject to ratification at the next meeting of the council of EU
ministers.
</P>
<P>
Tilgenkamp was attending a meeting of some 100 banana growers
in San Jose, Costa Rica, on Latin American banana sales to EU
countries. The meeting, organized by the National Banana
Corporation of Costa Rica, discussed the "framework agreement"
signed in 1994 by Costa Rica, Colombia, Venezuela and Nicaragua
with the EU on the distribution of export quotas of banana.
</P>
<P>
The EU currently imposes an annual import quota of 2.2 million
tonnes on Latin American bananas, operates an import license
system among its members and levies a tariff of 75 ECU on every
ton of bananas imported from the region.
</P>
<P>
The regime was set up to protect banana growers, mainly in the
Caribbean, who are former colonies of some of the 15 EU member
countries. Only licensed EU countries can import bananas from
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rica is demanding the EU eliminate the banana tariff
while Ecuador, the world's largest banana grower, is calling for
annual imports of 2.75 million tons of Ecuadoran banana by the EU.
</P>
<P>
Federico Rojas, president of the Association of Independent
Banana Growers of Costa Rica, asked the EU to increase the number
of import licenses for Latin American bananas by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the EU representative told the meeting that the license
will be increased by between 70 and 74 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi High Court Issues Rule on Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's high court division has
restrained nine government officials from performing their
functions because they "had participated in the non-cooperation
movement" launched by the former opposition parties led by the
Awami (people's) League (AL) in March.
</P>
<P>
According to a high court rule issued upon the present
caretaker government and the Election Commission (EC) Tuesday, the
nine officials including Syed Ahmed, principal secretary to the
chief adviser of the caretaker government, and eight deputy
commissioners and returning officers in respective districts have
been restrained for a period of 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The high court also asked the government and the EC to show
cause within a week as to why a direction should not be issued to
initiate disciplinary proceedings against the above officials in
addition to ten others including secretaries and joint secretaries
of different ministries, the highest level of the country's civil
servants.
</P>
<P>
In late March, these officials together with many other civil
servants of various ministries stopped their work and joined a
political podium called "Janatar Mancha" created by the AL to
express their solidarity with the non-cooperation movement against
the then government of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).
</P>
<P>
The high court issued the rule on a writ petition filed by
Asaduzzaman Ripon, editor of the weekly Janatar Daak and president
of the National Democratic Foundation, which alleged that the
respondents as civil servants violated the Government Servants
Conduct Rule by exposing themselves as "supporters" of a political
party.

<HEADLINE> Panama's Teachers Oppose Extension of U.S. Military Presence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Panamanian
Teachers declared today its opposition to the presence of
U.S. military bases in the country beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced of the imperative need to decentralize and
neutralize the Panama Canal and for that reason we are opposed to
maintaining the presence of the U.S. military in the country,"
said the teachers in a statement published today by the press.
</P>
<P>
Panamanian officials have said they are prepared to negotiate
an extension of the lease on U.S. military installations. The
United States maintains eight military bases with a contingent of
7,800 soldiers on the banks of the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
The teachers noted that Panama's constitution establishes that
national territory "can never be ceded, transferred or sold,
temporarily, nor in part, to another state."
</P>
<P>
"We propose that up to the year 2000 the U.S. army limit itself
to canal defense sites that do not alienate the population nor
become factors that could adversely affect the attainment of our
identity," said the teachers.
</P>
<P>
The Torrijos-Carter Treaty signed by Panama and the United
States in 1977 stipulates the withdrawal of all U.S. forces from
this Central American country by December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Last September, U.S. President Bill Clinton declared in
Washington that "we will explore" some form of U.S. military
presence in Panama beyond the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Joe R. Reeder, U.S. undersecretary of the army, said Monday in
Washington that "in less than two months' time," talks will begin
over the future of the U.S. military bases in Panama.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Panama and the United States are to hold
informal talks about the bases this June, according to a source
close to the Panamanian government.

<HEADLINE> Germany Vows to Maintain Leading Status in Scientific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Government adopted an
annual report on scientific research today, stressing the need to
maintain Germany's leading status in scientific research in the
present-day world.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Research and Technology Juergen Ruettgers told a
press conference that Germany's research on science and technology
is under the pressure of foreign competition. To keep its leading
place in this area, Germany must increase its research funds.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, 16.9 billion marks (11.4 billion U.S. dollars) were
allocated for research and development, and 700 million marks (476
million dollars) more will be added to it this year.
</P>
<P>
Research funds in enterprises last year accounted for 60.3
percent of the total government investment, but in 1989 the figure
was 63.7.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the traditional emphasis on engineering, auto,
electronics and chemical industries, the government from now on
will put more emphasis on multi-media, biological projects,
environmental protection and energy resources.
</P>
<P>
priorities will also be put on small and medium-sized
enterprises and new technology-intensive enterprises, according to
the report.

<HEADLINE> International Oil Market Remains Stable, OLADE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The international oil market is
maintaining a marked stability and the prices exceed 20 dollars a
barrel, the Latin American Energy Organization (OLADE) said today.
</P>
<P>
The market strengthened with the contraction of the reserves in
January and February in Europe and the United States following the
winter, and the drop in the production in Angiers, the United Arab
Emirates and Libya, the OLADE said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The report also pointed out that high consumption periods are
registered in the fourth and first quarters of each year, and low
consumption periods in the second and the third.
</P>
<P>
Even when prices begin to drop in May, the OLADE predicted,
they will maintain an even average for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Ecuador, the hike in prices had a favorable
repercussion, the regional organization asserted.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account the price differences in crude oil with
respect to the benchmark quotations, an average price of 15
dollars per barrel can be expected for this year, it added.
</P>
<P>
The oil reserves decreased in January and February due to an
unusually cold and long winter which increased the demand in
Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In addition, due to diverse reasons, there was a reduction in
oil production in Angiers, the United Arab Emirate countries and
Libya during the first quarter, it added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The International Civil Aviation
Organization (ICAO) will postpone until June publication of its
conclusion on an inquiry into the downing of two U.S. light
aircraft by the Cuban Air Force, the official Cuban newspaper
"Granma" said today.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the ICAO, based in Montreal, Canada, announced the
postponement of its final report after investigators presented a
provisional report analyzing data submitted by the Cuban
authorities.
</P>
<P>
The ICAO said the incident requires a more thorough
investigation and postponed the final report until next month
although the 60-day period granted by the United Nations Security
Council expired on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The provisional report said that ICAO investigators are in
contact with U.S. officials to complete its collection of data on
the incident.
</P>
<P>
It said Cuba had complied fully with all requests for
information on the downing of the two small planes by Cuban
fighters on February 24. The planes were piloted by members of
"Brothers to the Rescue," an anti-Castro organization based in
Miami.
</P>
<P>
The United States insists that the planes were shot down over
international waters while Cuba insists that they were violating
Cuban airspace.

SANYA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- People on Hainan Island, China's
southernmost province, are looking forward to a plentiful, cheap
supply of Hami melon this winter, since agronomists here have
succeeded in cultivating this fruit of northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Wu Minzhu, head of a Sanya research team, said that the Hami
melon developed in Hainan not only keeps its original flavor and
sweetness, but also has a pleasing shape and color.
</P>
<P>
"It has passed the trial phase in the fields and shows very
good resistance to disease," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that, compared to Xinjiang, Sanya has better
conditions, with its double-cropping even after the onset of
winter, but there is only one harvest a year back in its native
area.
</P>
<P>
Winter harvests, between New Year's and the Spring Festival,
will not only improve the province's winter fruit market, but also
satisfy demand on the mainland and even in other countries, market
analysts say.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Launches Massive Manhunt for Escapee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian police launched a
massive manhunt Tuesday after a convict with the 20-year sentence
escaped from a prison near Jakarta, the police said here today.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Oetojo Oesman ordered the country's
immigration offices and airports to keep a sharp lookout for the
escapee, who fled highly-guarded Cipinang Jail in east Jakarta
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
the 42-year-old convict, Eddy Tansil, was formerly a local
businessman with the ownership of the Golden Key Group. He was
convicted in 1994 of embezzling 1.3 trillion rupiah (620 million
U.S. dollars) from the state-owned bank Pembangunan Indonesia and
was sentenced to 20 years in Jail for the bank fraud, said chief
spokesman of the police Nurfaizi.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the Justice Minister has
suspended Cipinang Jail's chief warden Mintardjo for his
carelessness in letting Tansil go and failing to promptly report
the escape.
</P>
<P>
Some 28 prison officials, including a picket chief, are now
under investigation. They are suspected of having taken part in
Tansil's escape, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The national police have already blocked all airports and sea
ports, and deployed extra officers there to prevent Tansil from
leaving the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Indonesian National Central Bureau of Interpol
has also contacted its counterparts in a number of countries for
the possibility of Tansil's seeking refuge there, the sources
added.

<HEADLINE> Censure Debate Begins in Thai Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A three-day no-confidence debate in
the Thai parliament began here today, with 10 of the 49 cabinet
members targeted by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 ministers and deputy ministers to be grilled by the
opposition, Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa, in his capacity as
the interior minister, is on the censure list for his alleged
ethical improprieties.
</P>
<P>
The opposition claimed to have evidence suggesting that in 1979
Banharn falsified his late Chinese father's nationality to make
himself qualified to stand as a candidate for a member of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
If it is proved that Banharn did make the alteration, the
opposition would move to revoke Banharn's MP status, which, if
successful, would terminate his status as Prime Minister

of the loans.

ownership scandals.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The following is a brief summary
of major economic news in Latin America during the past few days:
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Foreign Debt Reaches Record High in 1995
</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's foreign debt reached a record high
of 157.4 billion U.S. dollars in 1995, an increase of 27 percent
with respect to 1991.
</P>
<P>
In contrast with the 1970's, the government did not get into
debt in 1995 while the private sector registered 67.1 billion
dollars in debt, said Gustavo Franco, director of the external
division of the Brazilian central bank.
</P>
<P>
The private sector's foreign debt was 129 percent higher than
that of 1991.
</P>
<P>
Venezuelan Iron Ore Exports Drop
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- Venezuelan iron ore exports shrunk by 32.4 percent
in 1995 with respect to the year before due to an increase in
internal demand as well as production problems.
</P>
<P>
Exports of iron ore totaled about 719,000 tons in 1995
compared with the 1.065 million tons in 1994, according to Orinoco
Sidor, the state-owned steel company. Even with the drop in
exports, these totaled 276 million dollars in 1995 to strengthen
Venezuela's presence in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador Receives Loan To Modernize Agricultural Services
</P>
<P>
QUITO -- Ecuador's Agriculture Ministry received a 30 million
dollar loan from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) for its
modernization of agricultural services program.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract signed in Washington on April 30, the loan
will be paid back in 20 years with a 5-year grace period. The
Agriculture Ministry program will cost 41.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's Imports Drop
</P>
<P>
CARACAS -- Venezuela's imports were down 16.2 percent in the
first two months of this year, according to statistics from the
Central Bureau of Statistics and Information.
</P>
<P>
The imports in January and February were worth a total of 1.124
billion dollars, 16.2 percent less than the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in imports can be attributed to the problems in
exchange controls and the rigidity in the granting of dollars at
preferential rates.
</P>
<P>
Peru Has 8 Billion Dollars Of Foreign Investments
</P>
<P>
LIMA -- Peru has absorbed foreign investments worth a total of
8 billion dollars so far this year, or seven times more than what
it had in 1990.

<P>
Alberto Pandolfi Arbulu, president of the Council of Ministers,
said the increased foreign investment is a reflection of the
success of the economic program.
</P>
<P>
Macro-economic stability has enabled the country to continue a
successful process of reinsertion in international financial
markets, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil reported an unemployment rate of 6.38
percent in March, the highest since May 1992, said the Brazilian

PRAGUE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian lawmaker said today
his country is opposed to NATO's expansion toward Slovakia and
other east and central European countries.
</P>

NATO was the outcome of the Cold War, said Vladimir Lukin,
chairman of the foreign affairs committee under the State Duma

The Russian lawmaker said that the NATO expansion should be
postponed indefinitely and that the new European security system
should be built upon a consensus among the European Commission,

<HEADLINE> Final Peace Accord to Be Signed in Guatemala in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTELIMAR, NICARAGUA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The social and
agricultural agreement signed by the Guatemalan government and
rebels in Mexico on Monday has paved the way for the signing of a
peace accord on September 15, Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo
Stein Barillas said today.
</P>
<P>
"The socio-economic agreement signed on Monday is, for us, the
most important moment in the negotiation process since it
surmounts the most difficult issues in the peace talks," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
Monday's accord "allows us to visualize that the next
issue: the role of the army in a democratic society, can be worked
out and negotiated in an even shorter period of time," Stein said.
</P>
<P>
The minister, along with other Central American foreign
ministers, is visiting Nicaragua's Pacific coast to prepare for
the regional presidential summit on May 8-9.
</P>
<P>
He said peace negotiations between the government and the
guerrillas had got bogged down in the previous administration.
When Guatemalan President Alvaro Arzu took office in January he
put forward possibility of signing the final accords in September,
but many people thought "we were crazy or maybe daydreaming".
</P>
<P>
The fact that negotiations have covered such complicated ground
so successfully in just a few short weeks shows that the signing
of a final peace accord on September 15 "is becoming more and more
real," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We feel we are in the 'final sprint,'" said the foreign
minister. He added that since a virtual cease-fire was reached a
few weeks ago, attacks have been called off without the shedding
of any Guatemalan blood.
</P>
<P>
The Guatemalan government and guerrillas have been negotiating
to end the 35-year old civil war, the last in Central America,
since April 1991.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, the two sides have signed agreements on human
rights, on indigenous peoples' rights and culture and on setting
up a panel to investigate war crimes.

<P>
NANCHANG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The southern part of east China's
Jiangxi Province is expected to become the largest subtropical
fruit-producing area in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Kowloon railway runs through 32 townships and towns
in the area, providing convenient transportation, and acreage
planted in fruit there has reached nearly 130,000 ha, making it a
major production base for exports to overseas including Taiwan,
Hong Kong, and Macao.
</P>
<P>
The seven cities and counties along the railway line are
expected to generate a total of nearly 22 billion yuan worth of
gross domestic product by the turn of the century, which will
account for 70 percent of the total of the southern part of the
province.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more than 67,000 ha of high-quality rice,
livestock, poultry, special aquatic products bases, 16,000 ha of
vegetables, and more than 67,000 ha of forests and fruits bases
have been set up in the area.

Last year it attracted a large amount of funds from Hong Kong
for more than 500 projects, 66 of which are in fruit, aquatic
products, livestock, poultry, and processing of farm and side-line
products.

<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
phoned his American counterpart Bill Clinton today, saying it was
his constitutional duty to ensure a free and fair presidential
election as scheduled on June 16.
</P>
<P>
The 20-minute phone conversation between the two leaders was
apparently prompted by comments by Yeltsin's security chief
Alexander Korzhakov that he personally favored delaying the poll
to avoid potential election-related disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Korzhakov said Russians should be given more time to cool down
and think about who they will vote for.
</P>
<P>
But Yeltsin dismissed that idea on Monday, vowing that the
election will go ahead as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted U.S. White House spokesman
Mike McCurry as saying Clinton was very satisfied with Yeltsin's
commitment to the election timetable.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents also discussed bilateral and international
affairs and both emphasized the need to maintain the momentum of
nuclear disarmament started during the recent Moscow summit on
nuclear safety, said Itar-Tass.

Sino-US automobile ventures in particular.

<P>
The Pudong branch of ICBC is the largest bank in the new area,
with loans valued at 11.72 billion yuan. So far it has provided
more than 50 billion yuan in loans for the new area's development.

<HEADLINE> Waldner Wins European Table Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Olympic Champion Jan-Ove Waldner
claimed the men's singles title at the European Table Tennis
Championships in Brastilava on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 3O-year-old Swede, who was gold medallist at Barcelona,
defeated his oldest rival and closest colleague, Jorgen Persson.
</P>
<P>
The pair had already partnered each other to win the team final
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Their previous two world singles confrontations had been shared
at one apiece.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's final could have gone either way, with Waldner losing
the first game then trailing 17-19 and 19-2O in the important
third game with Persson serving, before he triumphed 16-21, 21-15,
22-2O, 21-15.
</P>
<P>
Uncharacteristically, it was the delicate precision of
Waldner's return of serve that lead him to victory.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish champion is better known for his brilliant serve
and follow-up.
</P>
<P>
Persson has not won a big title for a long time because of a
car accident two years ago which injured his back and kept him out
of competition.
</P>
<P>
But against Waldner he proved that he is back to a standard
which will make him a medal candidate at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
At one point Persson, produced an astounding forehand which
went around the net and rolled along the table to capture the
first game.
</P>
<P>
He also showed determination in the deciding fourth game,
fighting back from 3-1O down to reach 14-16 and remain in
contention.
</P>
<P>
At the end, Waldner's characteristically impassive face was
converted into rare expressions of joy, as he tossed his bat in
the air and hugged his opponent.

<HEADLINE> Australia's New Government Support Rate Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The coalition government of
Australia saw its support rate among voters rise since the federal
election.
</P>
<P>
Results of the AGB McNair AgePoll, one of the major opinion
polls published today, showed that the Liberal-National coalition
government had widened its lead over the Australian Labor Party on
a two party-preferred basis.
</P>
<P>
Making a choice between the coalition and Labor, 60 percent of
the surveyed supported the government, while 40 percent were for
Labor. This was compared with the coalition's 53-47 lead over
Labor at the election.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said that Prime Minister John Howard's stand on
adopting a nation-wide ban on semi-automatic guns after the Port
Arthur massacre helped boost the coalition's image.
</P>
<P>
This was in conformity with the result of other opinion polls.
The latest Newspoll conducted last weekend showed that 83 percent
of voters supported a total ban of automatic and semi-automatic
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Age poll showed that 61 percent of the voters preferred
Howard as the better Prime Minister, against 25 percent endorsing
Labor leader Kim Beazley.
</P>
<P>
On a multi-party basis, the coalition government's support rate
rose to 53 percent from 47 percent in the elections. Labor's
support rate dropped to 31 percent from 39 percent in the
elections. Other parties such as the Greens and the Australian
Democrats enjoyed steady support rates.

<HEADLINE> Donadoni Joins MLS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Roberto Donadoni, who just
Won the Italian league soccer title with AC Milan, has joined the
MetroStars of the Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
Donadoni's debut brought the club its first victory in the
fledgling United States' league, rallying from three goals down
for a 4-3 shootout triumph over Tampa Bay at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's Giovanni Savarese scored twice for the MetroStars
to earn league player of the week honors. But the team's long-term
success on and off the field rests with Donadoni, the Italian
World Cup star.
</P>
<P>
"I am enthusiastic to play here," Donadoni said. "The squad
will continue to improve. I have just arrived and there are so
many changes."
</P>
<P>
Donadoni must adjust from having support from Italy's Franco
Baresi and Paolo Maldini, or Milan teammates Roberto Baggio and
George Weah, to playing alongside strangers Tab Ramos of the
United States and Ruben Dario Hernandez of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Donadoni, a divorcee with one child now engaged to a Milan
businesswoman, makes the MLS maximum 175,000 dollars but has
bonuses from sponsors to reach the million-dollar level.
</P>
<P>
Money is a key point. Donadoni was made a three-year
counter-offer to stay with AC Milan, but plans to honor his
commitment to MLS, to the relief of US league talent recruiter
Sunil Gulati.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rules Out Nuclear Response to Libyan Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today ruled
out use of nuclear weapons to destroy an alleged underground
chemical weapons plant in Libya.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that nuclear weapons would be necessary to
be used in a preemptive way against a plant like this," Pentagon
spokesman Ken Bacon told a press briefing. "We have a wide range
of conventional weapons but before we get there we are using
diplomatic and other methods to deal with that."
</P>
<P>
"There is no consideration to using nuclear weapons and any
implication that we would use nuclear weapons preemptively against
this plant is just wrong," Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the statement when asked to comment on
recent remarks by U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry that
Washington did not rule out using nuclear arms in response to a
nuclear, chemical or biological attack on the United States or its
forces.
</P>
<P>
Bacon said that former U.S. President George Bush and Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney had also promised such a devastating
response and had refused to rule out nuclear weapons in all
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that the Libyan project, a massive labyrinth built
into the side of a small mountain, is more than a year away from
being capable of producing chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) Director John Deutch
told a U.S. Congress committee earlier this year that if Libya is
allowed to complete the project it will be the largest underground
chemical weapons facility in the world.
</P>
<P>
However, Libya had repeatedly denied that the facility is a
chemical weapons plant and has accused Washington of trying to
bully it.

BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Former national captain Lothar Matthaus
suggested here on Tuesday that his international career was over
by confirming he would not take part in Germany's European
Championships campaign next month.
</P>
<P>
The 35-year-old Bayern Munich captain, speaking on the private
television channel SAT 1, said he was struggling with injuries and
poor form and would in future concentrate on his club rather than
the national team.
</P>
<P>
German trainer Berti Vogts has already suggested that Matthaus
would not be in his squad of 22 players for the championships in
Britain next month, saying that his first-choice sweeper would be
Matthias Sammer.
</P>
<P>
Matthaus was capped a record 122 by Germany, scoring 22 goals.
He switched from midfield to sweeper with mixed success.

<HEADLINE> WEU to Further Develop Operational Capabilities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, England, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Western European
Union (WEU) ministers have agreed to take concrete measures to
develop the operational capabilities of the the European defense
pillar as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day WEU Council of Ministers conference in
Birmingham today, foreign and defense ministers from 27 European
countries have decided to establish a permanent Situation Center
and Intelligence Section to control and monitor future WEU
operations.
</P>
<P>
The Birmingham Declaration, which was issued at the concluding
session of the conference, pointed out, "It is particularly
welcome that the Situation Center will be operational" for the WEU
military exercises.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the participants also reached agreement on
measures to implement WEU military exercise policy which is aimed
at setting out a coherent and progressive exercise program.
</P>
<P>
On the WEU-NATO relations, the Declaration said that the
ministers emphasized the need to develop and strengthen further
WEU's relations with NATO in order to develop WEU as means to
strengthen the European pillar of the Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Close practical cooperation between the two organizations will
be essential if WEU is to fulfill its operational potential," the
document said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministers also stressed the need to continue to further
WEU's relations with European Union (EU), saying the the EU will
build up WEU in stages "as the defense component of the EU".
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say the WEU ministers tried not to touch the
sensitive issue of making WEU subordinate to EU in a bid to avoid
a confrontation with the British government.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the British Prime Minister John Major has
made clear that the British government is strongly opposed to any
intention of a possible merger of EU and the WEU.
</P>
<P>
Britain is the current presidency state of the WEU, which has
10 full members and 17 associates, observer and associate partner
states.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The breast cancer death rate for
American women dropped further, the National Cancer Institute said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
From 1989 to 1993, the breast cancer mortality rate for
American women was down 5 percent, from 27.5 per 100,000 women to
25.9 per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
The age-adjusted breast cancer mortality rate fell about 6
percent in white women and rose about 1 percent in black women.
</P>
<P>
The median age at death for white breast cancer patients is 68
years, and 62 years for black patients.
</P>
<P>
The decline was attributable to early detection and improved
treatment
</P>
<P>
According to researchers, early detection alone can't account
for the decline.

<HEADLINE> UN Report Indicates Israel Deliberately Bombed Qana Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. report released on
Tuesday said that Israel deliberately shelled the United Nations
compound in Qana on April 18, 1996.
</P>
<P>
"As indicated in the report, while the possibility cannot be
ruled out completely, the pattern of impacts in the Qana area
makes it unlikely that the shelling of the United Nations compound
was the result of technical and/or procedural errors," said U.N.
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali in introducing the report
to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The report was drafted by Major-General Frank van Kappen of the
Netherlands, the secretary-general's military adviser following
his mission to Lebanon and Israel.
</P>
<P>
He was sent by Boutros-Ghali in light of the Qana tragic
envents, in which more than 100 Lebanese civilians were killed in
the headquarters of the Fijian battalion of the U.N. Interim Force
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The major findings of Major-General van Kappen are:
</P>
<P>
i.  The distribution of impacts in Qana shows two distinct
concentrations, whose mean points of impact are about 140 meters
apart. If the guns were converged, as stated by the Israeli
forces, there should have been only one mean point of impact.
</P>
<P>
ii. The pattern of impacts is inconsistent with a normal
overshooting of the declared target (the mortar site) by a few
rounds, as suggested by the Israel forces.
</P>
<P>
iii. During the shelling, there was a perceptible shift in
the weight of fire from the mortar site to the United Nations compound.
</P>
<P>
iv.  The distribution of point impact detonations and
airbursts makes it improbable that impact fuzes and proximity fuzes
were employed in random order, as states by the Israel force.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Cigarette Producers Not to Aim at Teens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday called on cigarette manufacturers not to aim
advertisements at young people.
</P>
<P>
"You in the tobacco business now surely see the clear, emerging
consensus in America that advertising, billboards and promotions
should not appeal to the children of this country," the Associated
Press quoted Clinton as saying in Woodbridge, New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was addressing an audience of 3,000 people made up
mostly of students at Woodbridge High School, who were marking
"Kick Butts Day," a national anti-smoking campaign.
</P>
<P>
Last August Clinton proposed regulations that would reduce
young people's access to cigarette vending machines and free
samples, and restrict advertising that appeals to youngsters. The
regulations are still under review at the Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
Clinton asked tobacco companies, to "do the right thing," and
play their role in stopping this problem before it starts for
millions and millions and millions of young Americans.
</P>
<P>
He said 3,000 youngsters become regular smokers each day and
nearly 1,000 of them would eventually die as a result of smoking.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also demanded responsibility from America's teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
"Our obligation is to live as long and as well as we can,"
Clinton said. "We should not be self destructive. We should do no
harm."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said businesses have the right to sell tobacco, but
they also have the legal and moral responsibility to prevent the
sale to minors.

<HEADLINE> Ogata Says Refugees Can Decide Where They Will Stay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) Sadako Ogata said today refugees and displaced persons in
ex-Yugoslavia could decide whether they would return home or
remain where they were currently.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Bosnian Serb Premier Rajko Kasagic in Serb
town Banja Luka, Ogata said persons who decided to remain outside
their entity must be guaranteed human rights and maximum
assistance.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, currently on a Balkan tour to get first-hand
acquaintance with the refugees situation in Bosnia, told reporters
she had agreed with Kasagic that regular bus lines between Banja
Luka, the biggest Serb city in northwestern Bosnia, and Drvar in
the west and Zenica in central Bosnia be opened, Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner said the introduction of the bus lines
should contribute to freedom of movement and gradual
confidence-building among the peoples in Bosnia's two entities --
the Serb republic and the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Although the civilians in Bosnia have the right to move around
freely under the Dayton agreement, but the freedom of movement has
yet to be realized in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kasagic told reporters that Republika Srpska had so
far got only an 2-million U.S. dollar aid contributed by the
European Union, while the Muslim-Croat federation had already been
granted 230 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Although the Dayton accords specify that the two entities are
economically independent, all assistance still goes through
Bosnian Muslim authorities, which is unacceptable for the
Republika Srpska," he said.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Debt Increases But Slows Pace in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
reported today that Americans' consumer debt rose at a 7.3 percent
annual rate in March, the smallest gain in six months.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said that consumer credit increased by 6.4 billion
dollars in March, about half the 12.2 billion advance in February.
It was the smallest increase since installment debt grew 4.1
billion last September.
</P>
<P>
The advance boosted total consumer debt in U.S. to 1.054
trillion dollars, 13 percent higher than the 933 billion in March
1995.
</P>
<P>
Consumer credit includes all household debt not secured by real
estate.
</P>
<P>
Among all loans, auto loans in March edged up a barely
perceptible 0.2 percent rate, nearly stalling after jumping at a
12.6 percent rate a month in February and 9.9 percent in January.
</P>
<P>
The advance was the tiniest since October 1992, when auto loans
fell at a 6.3 percent rate. The increase left motor vehicle debt
outstanding at 360 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The category that includes loans for mobile homes, education,
boats, trailers and vacations increased 1.5 billion to 283.2
billion. But the 6.5 percent annual rate of growth was just half
the 13.5 percent gain a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Still, revolving credit, which includes credit cards, shot up
at a 14.1 annual rate on top of increases of 15.9 percent in
February and 17 percent in January. The 4.8 billion gain pushed
total revolving credit to 410.9 billion dollars.
