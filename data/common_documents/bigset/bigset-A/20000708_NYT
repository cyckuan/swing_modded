SAN FERNANDO VALLEY HOME GAINS UNEXPECTED EXPOSURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By ORITH GOLDBERG  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With memories of her own childhood and a fondness
for the image of a classic suburban ranch-style home, artist Anne
Marie Karlsen snapped a picture and secured a place in history for
a small triplex near one of the San Fernando Valley's new Metro
Rail stations.
</P>
<P>
   Little did the owner or tenants of the Klemp Avenue house know
that the residence is depicted for thousands of commuters to see in
a painted-tile mural titled ``Present Day North Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm speechless about it, and yet it's so odd this house was
chosen,'' said the owner of the home after she was informed of the
mural. ``Maybe it's because it's the only one that doesn't have a
fence.''
</P>
<P>
   Recollecting her first visit to the street in April 1997, the
artist couldn't pin down just what it was about this particular
house that inspired her. ``It was a really nice example of a house
that had been really well maintained,'' Karlsen said.
</P>
<P>
   The modest owner, who wished to remain nameless, said she had
purchased the home in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an enjoyable residence for me ... and I've had a
really delightful experience with the tenants,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Karlsen was one of four artists commissioned to work on the
murals depicted at the three Valley Metro Red Line stations, which
opened late last month.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven of her murals at the North Hollywood station have drawn
numerous people to stand and reflect on the images displayed as
fragments of reality. The ``Present Day'' mural took three years to
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The subway station marks a new medium for Karlsen, who mainly
paints on canvas. In addition to showing her work professionally,
she also spends her time as an art professor at Santa Monica
College. But the challenge of piecing together small tiles to form
a big picture posed a unique opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a personal level, I see the world as a complicated place,''
Karlsen said. ``The idea of taking fragments and reassembling them
is much of how our own memory works.''
</P>
<P>
   The light-colored Klemp Avenue home is depicted at the center of
the mural, with a red Ford truck parked in front, palm trees on the
side and a night view of the San Fernando Valley in the background.
</P>
<P>
   The painting portrays a light-gray home with two neatly
manicured bushes in front. The real house, with Christmas lights
that hang year-round from the eaves, hasn't changed from the day
Karlsen first saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Pale pink flowers decorate the real house, which is light blue.
There's no red Ford in the driveway. It was inspired by a truck
Karlsen had seen parked in front of a company, east of the subway
station, that provides vehicles to the film industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because the angle of the old photograph and the mural shows only
the front of the house, when Karlsen visited the home again on
Friday, she was surprised to see it was actually a triplex.
</P>
<P>
   She produced her work at the Urban Clay ceramic tile studio in
Los Angeles, with the help of 14 artisans.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Garris, the Metro Art project manager for all three Metro
Rail stations, said Karlsen was selected from 200 applicants
because of her thorough research into the history of the Valley and
her organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her work was very successful in capturing the
community, both historically and in its present state. She combined
a lot of images that were unique.''
</P>
<P>
   Garris said the ``typical'' Valley home displayed is a flat,
plain home that, through its depiction, has become an icon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted people to look at things they are familiar with a
different way,'' Karlsen said. ``I wanted them to see the gems in
their community.''
</P>
<P>
   Karlsen said the home reminded her of what early residents
moving into the Valley _ mainly families with relatives in the
aerospace industry _ aspired for in the 1950s and 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The image conjures recollections of her own childhood just
outside Detroit where square ranch houses lined up in rows. It was
the dream of the typical suburban family.
</P>
<P>
   She had also chosen the home because she thought residents
living close to the station would appreciate seeing something from
their own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   But no one at the Klemp Avenue residence knew about its newly
acquired star status until the Daily News brought it to their
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The owner said she guessed the home was built in the 1940s and
that she's been happy in the home and is in no hurry to leave it _
not even to see its likeness on the subway walls.
</P>
<P>
   She will take a trip to the tunnel to see the mural, she said _
``one day when it's not so hot to walk over (to the station).''

L.A. CITY COUNCIL RESCINDS PLEDGE OF PROTEST HAVEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Under attack by police and downtown business
owners, Los Angeles City Council members voted Friday to rescind
their pledge to designate downtown's Pershing Square as a protest
zone during the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's time for the council to admit it made a mistake
and to try to undo all of the harm that was done,'' Councilman Joel
Wachs said before the 12-1 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The vote culminated bitter debate over whether the council had
jeopardized public safety by inviting protesters to the congested
business district. Council members voted earlier to do so in
exchange for Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg's support for a $4
million contribution to the Democratic National Convention
committee.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the council narrowly defeated, in a 7-6 vote, a
motion to withhold the remaining $2 million of the $4 million
pledge.
</P>
<P>
   After that vote, Mayor Richard Riordan - who chipped in $1
million of his own money for the convention's host committee and
has been personally raising funds for it - issued a sternly worded
statement warning the council to stand by its full $4 million
pledge of public funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of hosting an historic presidential
convention and yet a few members of the City Council appear bent on
embarrassing Los Angeles,'' Riordan said. ``Any action to rescind
the contribution would represent a gross breach of commitment by
the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan's statement took aim at council members, including Wachs
and Goldberg, who support a pullback of the final $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg opposed the Pershing Square change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would any organization want to hold a convention here
knowing that there are a few unreliable, waffling City Council
members who would renege on its promise?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, whose niece is a lead organizer of the protests, said
she was disappointed with the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe that it is the job of the Police Department
to decide where protests can take place or not take place, but it
can decide how to handle it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A council committee had recommended reversing the earlier
approval of the park site as a gathering place, despite assurances
by demonstration organizers that they are planning peaceful
gatherings.
</P>
<P>
   Pershing Square, which is bordered by Olive and Hill streets to
the east and west and 5th and 6th streets to the north and south,
is adjacent to the Jewelry District and across the street from the
Regal Biltmore Hotel, where many delegates and party officials will
be staying. Law enforcement officials had warned that as many as
50,000 protesters and anarchists could paralyze the area.
</P>
<P>
   Next, police and city officials will study other possible
demonstration staging sites, including Exposition Park and
MacArthur Park.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the presidential nominating convention, to be held
Aug. 14-17 at Staples Center, initially said it would require no
public subsidy, but recently sought city help to fill a budget gap.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Nate Holden accused other council members of using
the protest issue to gain standing in the eyes of voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should use whatever our goals are to exploit
an issue that affects us all,'' he said. ``A demonstration site
getting out of control over there would be devastating to this
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Goldberg, who is Councilwoman Goldberg's niece and a
member of Direct Action Network, which is coordinating protect
activities surrounding the convention, called the council's latest
vote a ``missed opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a real opportunity to work in concert, work
together to make the most clear and effective situation for
everyone,'' she said. ``They've created a conflict that didn't need
to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   But business owners and representatives applauded the council's
decision, which followed more than a week of lobbying aimed at
convincing city leaders to withdraw the designation of Pershing
Square.
</P>
<P>
   Some warned that protesters can still be expected to congregate
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have a lot of hard work ahead of us because people are
still going to be at Pershing Square,'' said Hilary Norton Orozco,
director of legislative affairs for the Central City Association,
an organization of downtown businesses.

TASK FORCE TO PREPARE CONSUMERS FOR HIGH WINTER HEATING BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Kansas regulators on Friday brought together a task
force of state agencies, gas utilities and community groups to
begin preparing consumers for higher heating bills expected this
coming winter.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Corporation Commission hatched the idea for a task
force within the last month as natural gas prices reached levels
nearly double those from a year ago. At current prices, consumers
can expect to pay an additional $200 to $300 to heat their homes
this winter.
</P>
<P>
   John Wine, the commission's chairman, said there are increasing
concerns about the potential effect of rising natural gas prices on
consumers. He said thousands of Kansas families could be
economically devastated by their heating bills this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt it's going to be a problem this winter,''
Wine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas task force plans to meet a half-dozen times. While it
is still formulating plans, the emphasis will be on education.
Caulking, weatherstripping and other conservation techniques will
be stressed. Consumers also will be asked to consider the
level-payment plans offered by utilities that spread out the amount
owed.
</P>
<P>
   Wine said higher natural gas prices will affect most gas
customers, but poor residents will be particularly hard hit. Some
federal assistance is available to help pay utility bills, but the
task force is exploring other sources of revenue that could be used
to supplement those funds.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale gas prices on Friday were about $4 per 1,000 cubic
feet, down 10 percent from last week's prices. But that price is
still nearly double a year ago and earlier this year. Higher gas
prices are passed directly to a gas utility's customers.
</P>
<P>
   The average household uses 120,000 cubic feet per year and most
of that in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is caused by tight supplies. Electric
utilities are using more gas to generate power at the same time gas
utilities are buying fuel to put in storage to meet winter demand.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the expected $200-to-$300 rise in heating bills
for an average household this winter, expenses could go higher if
there are additional price spikes or a colder-than-normal winter.
The last two winters have been warmer than normal.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Johnson, a spokesman for Kansas Gas Service who also is on
the task force, said the utility will put inserts in its bills this
fall advising consumers of gas prices and their effect on heating
bills.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gas Service recently got approval to spend up to $6
million on its hedging program, which provides some protection from
price spikes in the winter. A hedge works by purchasing financial
options that put a cap on how much a utility pays for the natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
   The cap, under current market conditions, would be above $5 per
1,000 cubic feet of gas. Johnson said Kansas Gas Service has
decided the hedge is still worthwhile because the volatile market
for natural gas could cause prices to climb above those levels.

   NY-COURTS-ABUSE (New York) _ As the supervising judge in Bronx
Family Court, Judge Clark Richardson handles all of the cases when
the city's child welfare agency has removed children from their
homes because one of their parents has been the victim of domestic
abuse. The city can take children into foster care if a parent is
believed to ``engage in acts of domestic violence.'' In practice
that usually means that a mother who is a victim of abuse can be
charged with a failure to protect her children from danger. Often,
she may have done nothing wrong or negligent, but simply lacked the
financial or emotional resources to leave an abusive partner. In
such cases, it falls to Richardson and other Family Court judges
across the state to decide whether those mothers get their children
back, and under what terms. By Somini Sengupta.

Episcopal Church, meeting here, is to take up a proposal that would
unite the 2.4 million members of the Episcopal church and with the
5.2 million members of the Evangelical Lutheran churches. Church
leaders see the proposal for ``full communion,'' which the
Lutherans have already approved, as a landmark step for the two
denominations. It would be more a pact than a merger, but would
allow the churches to recognize each other's sacraments, share
clergy and pool resources, particularly in inner city and rural
areas where congregations are often small and financially
hard-pressed. Although the two churches are close in matters of
theology and liturgy, and both ordain women, they have had
significant differences over the role and authority of bishops,

hopelessly small-minded and provincial by Sinclair Lewis in his
novel ``Babbitt.'' Duluth is still no New York or Los Angeles, of
course. Or even a place like Rochester, home of the Mayo Clinic.
But it has focused more on the wider world not just because of its
shipping trade through the Great Lakes but also because of its

FORMER CARONDELET HEALTH EXECUTIVE SENTENCED FOR DEFRAUDING
MEDICARE

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Richard Michael Abell, former president and
chief executive officer of Carondelet Health, was sentenced Friday
to five months in a halfway house and five months home detention
for defrauding Medicare of more than $91,000.
</P>
<P>
   Abell, 61, of Overland Park, Kan., also must spend three years
under supervised release and must pay a $15,700 fine. U.S. District
Judge Ortie D. Smith imposed the sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The case is part of a government crackdown on health-care fraud,
said Chris Whitley, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Abell waived indictment and pleaded guilty to one
count of felony health-care fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Abell falsely claimed more than $361,000 in personal expenses as
business expenses, and the hospital reimbursed him for those
expenses, according to federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Abell's fraudulent business expenses, in turn, had been
submitted over several years to Medicare, the government health
program for the elderly. Medicare reimbursed St. Joseph Health
Center in Kansas City for a portion of that amount, more than
$91,000.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors said Abell had committed fraud from about
Jan. 1, 1993, to Oct. 5, 1998. He spent the money on a variety of
items including travel, meals, entertainment and gifts, Whitley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Abell was fired by Carondelet, which includes St. Joseph Health
Center and St. Mary's Hospital of Blue Springs, Mo., in October
1998 after an internal audit.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Abell was the recipient of the Missouri Hospital
Association's Distinguished Service Award. Abell had been a
hospital administrator for nearly 30 years and had held executive
positions at hospitals in Tennessee and Kentucky before moving to
Kansas City in 1986 to join St. Joseph Health Center as its
president.
</P>
<P>
   George A. Zara, who replaced Abell as Carondelet's president and
chief executive officer in 1999, issued a statement Friday, saying
it was time the hospital put the matter behind and moved forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hope is that this sentence will serve as the beginning to
the end of a 20-month process and healing can take place for all
parties involved,'' Zara said.

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Chris Koster, the prosecutor of Cass County,
Mo., and Paul Morrison, the district attorney of Johnson County,
Kan., want the same thing: to try John E. Robinson Sr. for murder.
</P>
<P>
   But they aren't in total agreement on how to go about it.
</P>
<P>
   Koster said Thursday that he wants to bring the serial murder
suspect across the state line from Kansas soon to begin Missouri's
case against him.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, when Morrison heard about the plan to arraign
Robinson in Missouri and then return him to Kansas, he said it
probably wouldn't work and might jeopardize the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is there are serious legal problems with
bringing a prisoner back and forth over state lines while there's a
charge against him,'' Morrison said. ``We're not going to inject
any legal difficulties into this case.''
</P>
<P>
   After five women's bodies were found in barrels in Linn County,
Kan., and Cass County, Mo., early last month, Robinson was charged
in Kansas with two counts of capital murder and in Missouri with
three. Authorities also have connected him to three women and a
baby missing since the 1980s. Robinson remains held in the Johnson
County Jail on $5 million bond.
</P>
<P>
   When the charges were filed, Koster indicated that he would wait
for Kansas to finish its case.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, he's working with the Missouri attorney general on
a plan that would allow Robinson to be transported between Missouri
and Kansas, so that Missouri can begin its pretrial discovery
process, which includes collecting statements from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Koster stressed that he's not trying to keep Robinson in
Missouri but just wants to arraign him and then send him back to
Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   But under the federal Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act, if
a trial is not held on an indictment, information or complaint
before a prisoner is sent back to his original place of
imprisonment, the case will be dismissed and cannot be refiled.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Kansas and Missouri agreed to move Robinson across the
state line, another problem would remain. Either Robinson would
have to agree to the plan, or each move would trigger an
extradition hearing that could take months, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just can't control all the variables, and it would be an
understatement to say we would be playing with fire if we attempted
any of that,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   Koster said he's not trying to be antagonistic. But if Missouri
has to wait until Kansas completes its case, it could be four years
before both cases are finished, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If Missouri's case is put on hold, Koster said, he would have to
deal with witnesses' fading memories and old evidence. He wants
access to witness statements in the Kansas cases so the witnesses
will not have to give the same information several years later.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said Kansas investigators would continue to share
information with Missouri, as they have since June, when the case
led from bodies on Robinson's Linn County farm to a storage locker
he rented in Raymore in Cass County.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said supporting a case with old memories and evidence
is a common problem that prosecutors must deal with regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Koster said he expected Missouri to indict Robinson sometime
this month, while Robinson's preliminary hearing in Kansas is not
scheduled until October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Missouri's ready to go,'' Koster said. ``I believe we have
everything needed to try this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Before he spoke to Morrison on Friday about stepping up
Missouri's part of the case, he had said he thought authorities in
Kansas would go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``A spirit of cooperation has permeated the entire case, and I
have every expectation it will continue,'' Koster said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he thought the technical issues involved, such as the
legality of transporting Robinson back and forth, could be worked
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``His crimes did not pay any heed to the border that runs down
state line,'' Koster said. ``Neither should prosecutors benefit
John Robinson with such technicalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Koster said, Missouri's case has an added sense of urgency
because the law is harsher on murderers of police officers and
corrections workers. Beverly J. Bonner, one of the women whose
bodies were found in Raymore, once was a corrections worker at a
Missouri prison where Robinson served time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that added sense of seriousness,'' Koster said. ``I
don't believe it needs to wait to have justice done.''

HARRY POTTER'S SPELL WORKS ITS MAGIC ON READERS AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ After months of anticipation that seemed more
like years to children, bookstores began selling Harry Potter and
the Goblet of Fire at 12:01 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   Booksellers across the area, nation and world opened late Friday
night for Harry Potter pajama parties to welcome the fourth book in
J.K. Rowling's series; sales started ringing up just after the
stroke of midnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been waiting January, February, March, April, May,
June and finally JULY!'' said 8-year-old Chase Hodge of Fairway.
</P>
<P>
   Chase and his mother, Mary, and sisters Caroline, 10, and Lissy,
5, made arrangements to get up late Friday night and troop off to
Rainy Day Books in Fairway, Kan., where their reserved copy awaited
them. The family reads the books aloud together, but it has been a
long drought since last year's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of
Azkaban.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're this excited, I can certainly get up and get the
book in the middle of the night,'' Mary Hodge said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's finally here,'' said Jan Snyder, manager of The
Last Chapter Bookshops in Overland Park and Shawnee, both in
Kansas. ``Everything in my life the last couple of days has been
oriented around Harry Potter.''

OFF-DUTY OFFICERS KILL MAN WHO ATTACKED THEM ON PARKWAY, POLICE
SAY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two off-duty police officers Friday fatally shot a
man who began punching them after a bizarre traffic altercation on
the Grand Central Parkway in Queens, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Although police officials did not explicitly defend the shooting
at a news conference Friday night, they suggested that it was
justified, saying that the shooting victim relentlessly punched the
officers and grabbed at one of their handguns. The officers had
apparently stopped on the parkway during what seemed like a traffic
accident, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began around 6:20 p.m., when the shooting victim,
Darnell Cisco, a chef in his early 20s from Rome, Ga., leaped out
the passenger side of a moving green Kia Sephia four-door sedan
being driven by his friend, the police said. The car was traveling
in the far left lane of the parkway near Francis Lewis Boulevard
and going up to 45 mph, the police said. Police officials said they
did not know why Cisco jumped, but that the impact peeled skin off
the right side of his body. Cisco was wearing a T-shirt, baggy
shorts and work boots, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   An airport cab run by All Seasons was coming up behind the
Sephia and swerved to the left shoulder to avoid hitting Cisco, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The two off-duty Queens officers _ a male sergeant and a female
detective _ were traveling in a black Dodge Dakota pickup truck
behind the cab. The sergeant, who was driving, stopped on the
roadway at a 45-degree angle to avoid hitting Cisco, a senior
police official said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco then got up and ran around to the driver's window and
began punching the sergeant, the police said. The sergeant stepped
on the gas to get away, but slammed into the rear of the cab,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco ran around to the passenger side and tried to drag the
detective out the open window, the police said. She resisted, and
both officers pulled out their badges and identified themselves,
the police said. But Cisco punched the detective and tried to wrest
a handgun away from her when she drew it, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the officers began shooting, the police said. The sergeant
fired one shot, and the detective fired three, but it was unclear
how many shots hit the assailant, officials said. He died at the
scene.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether the victim was armed, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   ```We have no idea why he did it,'' said William Allee, chief of
detectives. ``We don't want to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's body was found slumped over the seat in the pickup truck
the officers were in, and later covered with a white plastic bag.
</P>
<P>
   Mattie Real, the victim's grandmother, said in a telephone
interview that he had never been involved in any kind of trouble.
He had been staying with her and his mother, Regina Real, in their
apartment in Glen Cove because Cisco's aunt was sick, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very sweet person,'' Real said between tears. ``He
doesn't get involved with anybody. That's what I don't
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that Cisco liked music and often went to a studio
somewhere in the city to cut tapes with his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Real said she saw Cisco earlier that morning before she went to
work at a day care center in Glen Cove. He was going to take a nap,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities did not release the names of the officers
involved in the incident.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers suffered bruises to their faces and were taken
to North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset.
</P>
<P>
   The incident comes at a time when the New York Police Department
is under scrutiny after a series of high-profile shootings of
unarmed men. Those victims included Amadou Diallo, who was killed
last year in the Bronx, and Patrick Dorismond, who was shot earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The police were questioning the driver of the Sephia FRiday
night. He was not injured. No arrests had been made.
</P>
<P>
   The cabdriver and his passenger were not injured.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours after the incident, traffic was still slowed to a
crawl in the eastbound lanes of the parkway. The police had shut
down two of the three major lanes, leaving only the far right lane
and an exit lane open. About 15 marked and unmarked police cars,
two tow trucks and an Emergency Service Unit vehicle were parked at
the scene. The three cars involved in the incident were still on
the shoulder, with the front of the pickup truck smashed into the
rear of the airport cab.

 JOB OF FIRE TOWER LOOKOUT A REMINDER OF EARLIER TIMES  &HT;     By JANET WELLS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNT ELIZABETH, Calif. _ Fire lookout Herb Self is sure that
his office _ a 65-foot-tall, glass-walled aerie overlooking the
Stanislaus National Forest _ is the ideal place to be during a
Sierra lightning storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fireworks. Beautiful,'' said Self, a grizzled, bearded
man who favors short sentences and the long silences of the forest.
``Thunder here sounds like you got your head stuck in a cannon.''
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days shy of his 70th birthday, Self is one of the old
guard of the forest, a vanishing breed of folks who spend hour upon
hour peering at a bird's eye view, waiting to spot a telltale wisp
of smoke before it can turn into a raging blaze ravaging mountain
towns and thousands of acres of timber.
</P>
<P>
   California once boasted more than 700 lookout towers staffed by
the National Forest Service and the California Department of
Forestry, forming the backbone of a vigorous program to protect
more than 20 million acres of public and private lands.
</P>
<P>
   Now, because technology and poor air quality are making human
eyes obsolete, only 55 federal and 30 state lookouts are staffed
during fire season.
</P>
<P>
   While California's dwindling use of the towers mirrors a
decades-long trend across the country, there is a growing movement
of fire look o)YyJWKw &UR; buffs. The Forest Fire Lookout Association
formed in 1990, and now has chapters in 25 states.

of the post-cowboy United States, the idea of the lone foO

 STOCKS LIKE SLOWER U.S. JOB GROWTH  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rocket-powered U.S. economy appeared to be headed for a soft
landing Friday as the latest employment numbers suggested that a
year of steady interest-rate increases are finally starting to pay
off.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, for its part, responded in high style, with the
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index erasing most of its losses for
the year.
</P>
<P>
   So just how cool  &UR; is  &LR; Alan Greenspan?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pretty amazing,'' said Jeff Lancaster, a portfolio
manager at San Francisco investment firm Bingham, Osborn &AMP;
Scarborough. ``It's as if he foamed the runway with just the right
touch.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks like the Federal Reserve chief has pulled off the neat
trick of slowing U.S. economic growth _ thus keeping inflation at
bay _ while at the same time maintaining a high level of confidence
among Wall Street investors.
</P>
<P>
   The latest evidence that Greenspan's tactics appear to be
working came as the Labor Department reported that U.S. companies
hired fewer workers than expected last month and that wages rose
only modestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data would support the conclusion that Alan Greenspan is
doing a darn good job,'' said James Meyer, research director at
Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses added a mere 11,000 jobs in June, the Labor
Department said. Economists had been expecting payrolls to expand
by about 250,000 positions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, average hourly wages gained 0.4 percent, or 5 cents,
to $13.71, in line with expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors liked the sound of that. The Nasdaq climbed 62.63
points to finish the week at 4,023.20 _ its first close above 4,000
in more than two weeks and just 46 points below its level at the
start of the year.

</P>
<P>
   While a slowing economy and potentially tighter labor market may
not be the best of news to Main Street _ employers will have to pay
more to retain workers _ for Wall Street it's an enormous relief.
</P>
<P>
   If subsequent data bear out the trend, the Fed is unlikely to
raise interest rates at the next meeting of its policy-making
committee on August 22. The Fed left rates unchanged when Greenspan
&AMP; Co. convened last month.
</P>
<P>
   Janney's Meyer said the latest jobs data indicate that while the
economy is slowing, it is by no means screeching to a halt. Growth
will continue, he said, albeit at a more moderate clip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is taking this to mean that we will not have a
recession and that we will have a soft landing,'' Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald in New
York, said investors were looking for any sign that the economy is
throttling back to a pace more to the Fed's liking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that came in reasonably close to expectations, or
better, was going to be met with pretty aggressive buying,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors favored a number of old standbys. Hewlett-Packard
jumped $6.38 to $124.75, while Sun Microsystems advanced $2.56 to
$90.06.
</P>
<P>
   Among the handful of losers Friday, Yahoo dropped $5.88 to
$116.50 after an analyst downgraded the stock to ``buy'' from
``strong buy,'' while Qualcomm tumbled more than 8 percent to
$56.63 after South Korean wireless operators opted to go with a
rival's technology.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said that while he is encouraged by the latest jobs
numbers, he isn't yet ready to say that Greenspan is done raising
rates for the year. Another quarter-point increase next month is
not out of the question, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After that it gets a little tricky. This is an election year,
and the Fed historically has refrained from fiddling with interest
rates ahead of a presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts believe Greenspan would be risking considerable
political fallout were he to raise rates at the Fed's fall
get-together in October.
</P>
<P>
   Al Kugel, senior investment strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham in
Chicago, said investors hope that past increases will continue
putting the brakes on economic growth and that the Fed will be
content for the remainder of the year to reap the fruit of past
labors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's managed to make things work out exactly the way he wanted
it,'' Kugel said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of ECONOMY0 (64111 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Looking ahead, he expects to see solid earnings for leading
companies and for the market to remain robust through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have 5-percent economic growth, but instead growth in
the 3 percent or 4 percent range,'' Kugel said. ``And 3 percent
growth is still good enough.''

 AIDS DRUGMAKER TO DONATE DOSES TO POOR NATIONS  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An international pharmaceutical company that markets a powerful
antiviral AIDS drug announced Friday that for the next five years,
it will donate free supplies of the drug to every nation in the
developing world that asks for it.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, called nevirapine, has been shown to prevent
transmission of the AIDS virus from pregnant women to their infants
in a significant number of cases. The problem of mother-to-child
transmission of the virus has been an important factor in the
epidemic now raging uncontrolled throughout sub-Saharan Africa,
India and many other impoverished nations.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Boehringer Ingelheim, the German drugmaker,
came on the eve of the 13th International AIDS Conference, which
opens tomorrow in Durban, South Africa. At the meeting, about
10,000 people _ including physicians and AIDS researchers, as well
as community leaders from countries hardest hit by the epidemic _
will share their experiences and discuss efforts to prevent and
treat the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, director of UNAIDS, the U.N. agency working to
curb the devastating global epidemic, said in a statement from
Durban that the drugmaker's announcement ``holds out great hope for
many millions of women.''
</P>
<P>
   It is, Piot said, ``a significant development in helping to make
the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV a reality in
the developing world.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Rolf Krebs, vice-chairman of Boehringer Ingelheim,
concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that our initiative for the prevention of
mother-to-child transmission will help make an impact on the
HIV/AIDS epidemic,'' he said. The company developed nevirapine and
markets it in 75 countries under the trade name of Viramune.
</P>
<P>
   The drug is given in only a single dose to pregnant women
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, and in another
single dose to their babies after birth. In clinical trials in
Uganda involving more than 600 volunteer women, it proved twice as
effective as AZT.
</P>
<P>
   A new U.N. study announced Friday found that AZT, taken in
conjunction with another drug, 3TC (lamivudine), loses much of its
effectiveness in protecting breast-fed babies after 18 months,
according to the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, which involved 1,797 people and is the largest
ever performed on the transmission of AIDS from mothers to
children, followed children who were born to these mothers and
found that by 18 months, the initial benefit was completely lost as
the infants who had been spared infection at birth later became
infected through breast-feeding.
</P>
<P>
   At the sixth week of the study, 6.7 percent of the babies born
to mothers who took the AZT/3TC combination were infected or had
died, compared with 16.4 percent in the group that received no
drugs. But the infection and death rates after 18 months were 21.3
percent in the treatment group compared with 26.8 percent in the
placebo group.
</P>
<P>
   AZT also can cost as much as $1,000 for several months of
treatment for a mother and child, while the cost of two doses of
nevirapine is only $4. Yet even the modestly priced drug could
bankrupt the public health budgets of many countries where the AIDS
epidemic is rampant.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates by UNAIDS show that at least 800,000 infants are born
with HIV infection each year, virtually all in the developing
world. In the absence of preventive treatment, HIV-positive women
pass the virus to their offspring about one-quarter of the time.
With breast-feeding, the infection rate climbs to one-third or
higher, depending on the mother's health and the age at which the
child is weaned.
</P>
<P>
   There are still many unanswered questions about nevirapine _
including whether some mothers will be resistant to the drug and
whether it can help prevent HIV transmission in the breast milk of
nursing mothers who are infected with the virus. Research is
continuing in an effort to answer these questions, according to
Boehringer Ingelheim officials.

AVENGERS OWNER EXCITED ABOUT FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ OK, so you got swept up in the Lakers'
championship run or those oh-so-exciting early-season baseball
pennant races and you never found the time to catch up with Los
Angeles' newest professional team, Arena Football's Avengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers, who conclude their inaugural home schedule tonight
against the San Jose SaberCats, won't make the playoffs and won't
even have a winning record, but team owner Casey Wasserman
proclaims victory in his battle to establish the Avengers as a
viable player in the city's already crowded sports market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every team looks to win every game it plays,'' said Wasserman,
whose team is 3-9. ``Any competitive person must have that mindset,
but as an expansion team, our goals were a little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the season, I said five wins would be a success, but
more important than that, we wanted to establish a fan base, and
the support from the Los Angeles fans, the way they have embraced
the franchise, has been incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say that winning cures all ills and losing is the cause
of those ills, but the fans have been with us and our fan support
has been more loyal than many of the teams already well established
in the league, even when we weren't playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Another average-sized crowd tonight will allow the Avengers to
boast that they brought in well over 11,000 fans per game to watch
a sport that had failed miserably in its two previous Southern
California incarnations, the Los Angeles Cobras of the late 1980s
and the Anaheim Piranhas of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman knew from the beginning that the Avengers would have
to be different to succeed in a city that never lacks for
entertainment options, thus the creation of those infamous
billboards.
</P>
<P>
   The billboards, which featured sexual innuendo and references to
violence, offended many motorists and residents, and did exactly
what Wasserman wanted them to accomplish. Before long, every
columnist and newscaster in the city was talking about the
Avengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people found out about the Avengers because of those
billboards,'' Wasserman said. ``Now, going into our second year,
you won't see those billboards again, because we have a different
set of goals in marketing the team, but if I could go back and do
the first season over, I'd absolutely put them up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the billboard controversy died down, the more immediate
concern was the product on the field. A league labor dispute, which
nearly canceled the entire 2000 season, left the Avengers with
little time to evaluate players before the season.
</P>
<P>
   They were competitive from the beginning but lost their first
seven games, and it was clear that head coach Stan Brock was not
happy with the roster. Every week, one or two new wide receivers or
defensive backs would show up as Brock, also the director of player
personnel, tried to find the right people for his system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never want to start a season like that,'' Wasserman said,
``but it was not entirely bad, because during that time I learned a
lot about Stan and what type of leader he is. But it was difficult,
because those labor problems put us far behind some of the other
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   The first victory finally came, in week eight on the road
against New England, and slowly things started to click for the
Avengers.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Todd Marinovich, signed as a backup just before the
start of the season, picked up the arena game quickly, overcame the
distraction of sexual-assault charges that were dismissed and
became the starter in week seven.
</P>
<P>
   Marinovich quickly established a good relationship with a
talented group of receivers, particularly Chris Jackson and Shannon
Culver, and in week 10, against Houston, he tied a league record
with 10 touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to know me as the billboard guy and now they know
me as Todd's boss,'' Wasserman said.
</P>
<P>
   The turn in fortunes came too late for the Avengers. Twelve of
the league's 17 teams make the playoffs, but last week's loss to
Milwaukee all but ended the Avengers' faint playoff hopes.
</P>
<P>
   They can finish with Wasserman's hoped-for five victories (the
season ends next Friday at Buffalo), but the focus is already on
next year. If Marinovich isn't picked up by a NFL team, which is a
possibility, he would return, along with Jackson, Culver, Travis
Hannah, fullbacks Andy Chilcote and Brian Easter and lineman Victor
Hall to lead a strong offensive unit.
</P>
<P>
   That strong core of players, along with a strong fan base, has
Wasserman already excited about next season and the future of the
Avengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have two overriding goals,'' Wasserman said. ``The first is
to improve on the field, to pick up some free agents who will take
us to the next level and improve the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other part is to build our base off the field, with the
fans. We've had a great response from the fans and we want to
expand our base to include more people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very excited about what we accomplished this year. It's
been a lot of fun.''

TEST OF PROPOSED U.S. ANTI-MISSILE SYSTEM IS BEING WATCHED AROUND
THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (UPDATES with test beginning)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A gleaming 63-foot Minuteman II rocket carrying a
mock warhead thundered into the sky from a Cali- fornia air base
early Saturday, in what is expected to be the decisive test to
determine whether President Clin- ton proceeds with a plan to begin
development of a $60 billion national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket lifted off from Vanden-H burg Air Force Base, 125
miles north of Los Angeles, at 12:19 a.m., and headed toward the
Marshall Islands 4,300 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one minutes later, a 54-inch, 130-pound ``exoatmospheric
kill vehicle'' was launched from Kwajalein Atoll in an attempt to
find, intercept and smash into the approaching warhead in space
above the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The test was awaited anxiously by protesters, who took to the
seas, skeptical scientists and Pentagon planners.
</P>
<P>
   The test lasted only 30 min- utes; it cost $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   The test was being watched around the world. Not since 1983,
when President Reagan envisioned a defense based in space that
would render nuclear weapons obsolete, has an issue of military
technology seized the imagination of U.S. policy-makers and
politicians and alarmed America's friends and foes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also entered the presidential campaign, with Vice
President Al Gore endorsing a limited version of the plan and Gov.
George W. Bush backing a more ambitious system.
</P>
<P>
   And it has raised a chorus of criticism from a sizable swath of
scientists in the United States, some of whom argue that the
proposed $60 billion system is not feasible and that the tests are
rigged.
</P>
<P>
   The test involved sending the 37-year-old remodeled Minuteman
missile with a mock warhead and a decoy balloon thundering aloft
over the Pacific from the tightly-guarded launch pad at Vandenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, a 54-inch, 130-pound ``exoatmospheric kill
vehicle'' was launched from Kwajalein Atoll about 4,300 miles away
in the Pacific and to guide itself to a collision with the incoming
mock warhead in midflight. If the kill vehicle destroys the mock
warhead, the sky will be filled with a blinding flash.
</P>
<P>
   The test had been scheduled to take place during a four-hour
win- dow that began late Friday night. But a last-minute technical
problem set back the launching by about two hours. The problem was
related to electronic signals that keep the ground control informed
about the missile's flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting a bullet with a bullet,'' is the way one Pentagon
official described the hoped-for collision. ``Steel on target,''
said another.
</P>
<P>
   The test follows two previous tests attempts to intercept a
target, part of a series of nineteen planned tests.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon hailed its first intercept test as a
complete success, but later acknowledged that the kill vehicle
initially had drifted off course and picked out the large bright
decoy balloon instead of the mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In the next and more complicated test in January, the kill
vehicle missed the mock warhead by between 300 to 400 feet after a
cooling line clogged and shut its heat-seeking sensors. ``There was
an ice cube in one of the lines,'' a Pentagon official explained.
``We fixed that problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the last test, this time a communications system was
added that transmits information directly to the kill vehicle about
the location of the target after it has lifted off. Called a
global-positioning-system transmitter, it used the same technology
that helps motorists from getting lost.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the new test is a misleading guide because it
is taking place under conditions that do not reflect a real attack.
They say that the decoy is not a true decoy, but is more like a
lure that attracts the kill vehicle to the real target, and that an
adversary would use many decoys, not one. About three to four weeks
after the test, Secretary of Defense William Cohen is to give
Clinton a formal recommendation of whether it is feasible to build
the system. Even if the test is a failure, he may recommend that
the plan proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to decide this fall whether to push the
United States down the road to a national missile defense system by
starting construction of a radar in the Aleutian Islands.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Administration lawyers have advised Clinton that, in their view,
he could begin building this first phase of the missile defense
without violating the 1972 AntiBallistic Missile Treaty with
Russia, one of the cornerstones of arms control agreements between
Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But the administration has been hit by a storm of criticism from
prominent scientists, arms control experts, former officials and
the General Accounting Office over the cost, technology and effect
on relations with other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Korb of the Council on Foreign Relations called the
entire system a ``shield of dreams'' whose supporters believe that
``if you build it, it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within the administration, a debate is raging among
intelligence and Pentagon officials and policy analysts over the
nature and extent of the potential threat from countries like North
Korea, Iran and Iraq that is the official justification for
building a missile shield. Some senior Pentagon officials have
warned that the administration's schedule is much too accelerated
and therefore risky, because testing would continue even as
construction has begun.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to stop the test, Greenpeace, the anti-nuclear
organization, said that a small team of missile defense opponents
entered the grounds of Vandenberg Air Force Base on foot. Equipped
with survival gear and supplies for several days, they intended to
stay inside the area as long as they could, according to a
Greenpeace statement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Dutch vessel Arctic Sunrise threatened to enter
one of the hazard zones designated by the Pentagon in the shores
off Vandenberg.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified man was caught entering the base, but base
spokesman John Cherry said that there was no evidence of intruders
in the heavily-guarded area around the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing in Washington, a group of business leaders
and scientists weighed in with eleventh-hour criticism of both the
test and the entire plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop this insensate and tortuously rationalized arms race that
drains money away from our vital civilian programs,'' said Alan
Kligerman, the chief executive officer of Akpharma Inc., and a
board member of Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, which
seeks to cut military spending. He added, ``If I would represent my
products and sell them with the same shortcomings in the products
as regard to what they are supposed to do, I would be indicted. My
products would be seized'' by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, president of the Center for Defense Information,
argued at the same briefing that the development of a national
missile defense is justifiably seen by Russia as a threat to its
nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia today can barely cope with U.S. offensive power, let
alone a combination of offense and defense, a one-two punch that
could deliver the knockout blow to their strategic forces,'' Blair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China are adamantly opposed to aU.S. missile defense
because they consider it a threat to their ability to defend
themselves. European countries are also distressed that the United
States would take such a position without regard to Europe's
security.

 EX-AIDE SAYS QUACKENBUSH OK'd MOVES  &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ A former top aide to Chuck Quackenbush says the
insurance commissioner was fully involved in the decision to use
settlement funds for political advertising, his lawyer said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   George Grays, who resigned from the department earlier this
year, is prepared to tell investigators that such deals were
routinely discussed in executive staff meetings, said William
Portanova, one of Grays' criminal defense attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Grays' testimony could be crucial to investigators in
determining what role, if any, Quackenbush played in coercing
insurance companies to pay money into foundations in lieu of paying
fines, and then funneling the money to political events for the
commissioner. So far, investigators have not named Quackenbush as
the focus of a criminal probe.
</P>
<P>
   But Grays, who invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege before the
investigating legislative committee and has been named by the
attorney general's office as the person who directed the
foundation's operations, has some serious credibility problems.
Among other things, he has been accused of forging foundation
checks and taking $90,000 in kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's done something criminal it makes him useless as a
witness,'' said one attorney familiar with the case. ``He doesn't
get any more valuable, he gets less valuable.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Grays' account Friday, a spokesman for Attorney
General Bill Lockyer said a criminal investigation is continuing
and there has been no deal with the former Quackenbush aide.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; `Mistakes' Acknowledged
</P>
<P>
   Without discussing specifics, Portanova acknowledged Friday that
Grays' ``mistakes'' make skepticism justifiable, but said others
have said similar things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who is more credible, the person who made the mistake and
denied it or the person who made a mistake and is trying to tell
the truth?'' he said. ``What he is saying is consistent with
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush resigned last week to avoid almost certain
impeachment by the Legislature. Lawmakers were investigating
Quackenbush's creation and use of a nonprofit foundation financed
by his department's settlements with insurance companies after the
deadly Northridge earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   His resignation came after he learned that two of his top
deputies were prepared to confirm that they heard Quackenbush say
he ``needed $4 million for a media buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Portanova said there were similar exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Grays is prepared to testify that the linking of the
insurance settlement contributions to the insurance commissioner's
foundations with the purchasing of media buys was well-known and
openly discussed at executive staff meetings at which the
commissioner was present,'' said Portanova.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has denied any wrongdoing, and his lawyer said
Friday that Grays is not telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's gotten caught with his hand in the cookie jar, and now
he's trying to extricate himself by putting the spin of criminal
behavior on what has happened,'' said Donald Heller, Quackenbush's
attorney. ``He's trying to say things to extricate himself that are
false.''
</P>
<P>
   Heller said that the foundations were established but that the
goal was outreach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were never designed for purpose of benefiting Chuck
Quackenbush politically,'' he said, adding that Portanova's
decision to describe Grays' story to the media without first
reaching a deal with prosecutors is ``reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer's probe has focused on what the foundations did with the
money. One legal issue still unresolved is whether the department
had the authority to create the foundations in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   An opinion by the legislative counsel has said no, but lawyers
for the department have insisted that they do. An opinion on that
matter by Lockyer's office is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has gone to court and has effectively shut
down the foundation. The remaining $6 million has been frozen by a
judge, pending the outcome of a lawsuit filed by two taxpayers who
want the money returned to the state's general fund.
</P>
<P>
   If Quackenbush is found to have been part of a conspiracy to
divert money from the foundation's stated purpose, there is
potential criminal activity, said Joe Remsho, a San Francisco
attorney who is not involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crime if a group of people conspire to divert funds,''
he said. ``It is not just the person who signs the check _ it can
be the criminal intent,'' he said. ``The problem always is in
proving that.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, Acting Deputy Insurance Commissioner Clark Kelso
accepted the resignation of Deputy Commissioner Dan Edwards. The
move came a day after six other top staff members in the department
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Kelso is a law professor who has been tapped to run the
department until Gov. Gray Davis can name Quackenbush's successor.
Kelso also appointed Elaine Bush, the former director of the
Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, as his chief deputy.

 &HT;    MERCY FLIGHTS ALONG BORDER(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a)

 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - The U.S. Border Patrol is borrowing airplanes to fly
extra missions of mercy along Arizona's remote frontier as the
death toll rises among illegal border crossers.
</P>
<P>
   The Tucson sector, which includes most of Arizona's border with
Mexico, has been this year's hot spot for immigrants in distress,
the Border Patrol said. The numbers tell the story: 844 people
rescued and 52 dead since October.
</P>
<P>
   Three out of five rescues on the nation's Southwestern border
have taken place in the region. The number of deaths so far this
fiscal year is nearly twice that of last year's.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol announced Friday that seven planes from Texas,
California and Washington are reassigned to Arizona's southern
deserts for 90 days, nearly doubling the number of aircraft
available to patrol during the hottest months.
</P>
<P>
   Putting more eyes in the sky improves the agency's chances of
finding and helping immigrants flogged by the desert elements,
Border Patrol spokesman Rob Daniels said. They may also discourage
some crossers from even attempting the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's an enforcement tool as well,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Stepped-up enforcement is partly to blame for the rising death
toll. More agents are patrolling populated border communities,
pushing undocumented immigrants into rugged, isolated corridors
where they are easier to spot and catch {ndash} and where they also
are more vulnerable to the elements.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists say pressure is building to abandon the
tactic because of the human toll.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain cold has claimed lives along California's border, while
heat and cold both have been deadly in Arizona's deserts this year.
</P>
<P>
   In one particularly gripping case in May, a 19-year-old Mexican
mother died under a paloverde on the Tohono O'odham Reservation
west of Tucson after giving her 18-month-old infant her last sip of
water. The child survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that any effort by an organization to prevent people
from dying in the desert is a good thing,'' Guadalupe Castillo of
Derechos Humanos, a Tucson immigrant rights group, said after
hearing of the new air patrols.
</P>
<P>
   But Castillo added, ``Until their (immigration) strategy is
terminated, we will continue to see deaths in the deserts of
Arizona, the mountains of California and the rivers of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona rescues are most common in the arid plains and mountains
from the Tohono O'odham Reservation to the mountains east of Yuma,
and in a narrow desert corridor stretching from the mountains east
of Nogales nearly to Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants often cross with little or no water or food, and
without proper clothing for the elements.
(beginitalic)Coyotes(enditalic), the smugglers they pay to lead
them across the border, sometimes abandon their charges in the
middle of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Two airplanes and seven helicopters already patrol the Tucson
sector using special technology to scour the desert for people- and
drug-smuggling activities day and night. In the first half of the
fiscal year, the Tucson air wing helped stop more than 23,000
border crossers and $11.1million in narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the undocumented immigrants who are rescued are detained
for processing and immediate return to Mexico or deportation to
their country of origin. Those who need it are given food and
water.
</P>
<P>
   Although more people are likely to be stopped with the new air
support, Daniels hopes to disarm critics by focusing on the
agency's humanitarian concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you imagine if we ignored this?'' Daniels said. ``We are
being compassionate. These guys are putting themselves at risk to
help these folks.''

<P>
   James Quayle, father of former Vice President Dan Quayle and
one-time owner of the weekly (beginitalic)Wickenburg
Sun(enditalic), died Friday in a Sun City West nursing center. He
was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was not known, but he had been in ill health
for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, a big, bluff ex-Marine whose conservative beliefs
influenced those of his politician son, had lived in Wickenburg
with his wife, Corinne, at least part of the year since the late
1970s, when he bought the (beginitalic)Wickenburg Sun.
(enditalic)In recent years, they were full-time residents. In 1987,
he sold the newspaper to his son, Michael, who sold it again three
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Among other community activities in Arizona, James Quayle was a
member of the Thunderbirds public-service organization.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, who belonged to the ultraconservative John Birch Society
in the 1960s, spent most of his adult life as a small-town
newspaper publisher.
</P>
<P>
   He was not shy about expressing his politics. At his death, he
was chairman of the board of Huntington Newspapers Inc., owner of
the (beginitalic)Huntington (Ind.) Herald-Press(enditalic), which,
in the days when he actively ran the paper, was known in some
Democratic circles as the ``Herald-Suppress'' because of his
disinclination to publish stories favorable to his political
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Though some people were put off by his views, they found him
charming personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was a very gregarious, very likable individual, as
conservative as the day was long,'' said Mike Dooley, a columnist
for the (beginitalic)Fort Wayne (Ind.) News-Sentinel (enditalic)who
at one time worked as a reporter for one of Quayle's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Shover, former public affairs director for (beginitalic)The
Arizona Republic(enditalic), seconded that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim was a very affable, fun-loving man who enjoyed life to the
fullest,'' Shover said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's irrepressible personality got the best of him during
his son Dan's 1988 campaign for the vice presidency. The elder
Quayle was quoted by the (beginitalic)New York Daily News
(enditalic)as saying Dan's main interests in school had been
``broads and booze.'' Later, James said he had been misquoted. ``I
said, `If he's anything like his old man, it was probably broads
and booze,''' the father said. ``He (Dan) isn't that kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   James Cline Quayle was born May 25, 1921, in Joliet, Ill. As a
youth, he worked for his family's business, the Chicago Dowel Co.,
making the famous Lincoln Log toys.
</P>
<P>
   He attended DePauw University in Indiana, where he met and
married Corinne Pulliam, the daughter of newspaper magnate Eugene
C. Pulliam, who founded Central Newspapers Inc., which recently
sold (beginitalic)The Arizona Republic(enditalic) to Gannett Co.
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   From 1943 to 1945, Quayle served in the Marine Corps, seeing
combat in the Pacific Theater of World WarII as an air transport
crewman. He later named his politician son James Danforth Quayle
after a serviceman and friend, James Danforth, who was killed in
the war.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Quayle began a long career in the newspaper
business. He worked in advertising sales for the
(beginitalic)Lebanon (Ind.) Reporter (enditalic)and the
(beginitalic)Portsmouth (Ohio) Times(enditalic), then was
advertising manager from 1948 to 1955 at the
(beginitalic)Huntington Herald-Press (enditalic)in Huntington, Ind.
He then moved his family to Arizona and worked from 1955 to 1963 as
public relations and personnel director for (beginitalic)The
Arizona Republic (enditalic)and (beginitalic)The Phoenix
Gazette(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, he returned to the Huntington paper as publisher, and
he and his wife bought it the following year. In addition to his
role at the (beginitalic)Huntington Herald-Press(enditalic), he
also was publisher of the (beginitalic)Muncie (Ind.) Star and
Evening Press (enditalic)from 1972 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, he served on the board of Central Newspapers Inc.,
stepping down in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle is survived by his wife; sons James Danforth of Paradise
Valley, Michael of Vincennes, Ind., and Christopher of Phoenix;
daughter Martha and several grandchildren.James Quayle was the
father of former Vice President Dan Quayle and one-time owner of
the  &UR; (beginitalic)Wickenburg Sun(enditalic)(beginitalic).

ORTIZ GETS PLENTY OF SUPPORT AS ANGELS WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Ramon Ortiz returned to a big league mound Friday
night for the first time in nearly two months, and his Angels
teammates welcomed him back in a way only a pitcher can appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   With home run, after home run, after home run in a 12-4 victory
over the Colorado Rockies before 29,826 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   The three home runs were not the most the Angels have hit in a
game this season, but these were bombs. Bengie Molina hit a grand
slam, and Troy Glaus hit two home runs, including a three-run homer
that was estimated at 465 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus now has 25 home runs this season, matching the most ever
by an Angel before the All-Star break (Leon Wagner had 25 at the
break in 1962). He also seemed to bang his way out of a slump that
had him 1 for 29 going into the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had 13 hits in all, including three by Mo Vaughn and
two each by Darin Erstad, Kevin Stocker and Glaus.
</P>
<P>
   While all the offense certainly was pleasing to the Angels,
offense has not been a problem. The problem has been keeping five
starters healthy and productive. Ortiz got his opportunity Friday
because Tim Belcher returned to the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz was sent to Triple-A Edmonton on May 10 after struggling
in six starts with the Angels (2-2, 6.90 ERA). He was told to work
on his command and let his pitches work for him by not
overthrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, it was time well-spent.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz pitched hit best game of the season, going eight innings
and giving up three runs and five hits. He hit 96 mph on the radar
gun while striking out Mike Lansing in the first inning, and 93 mph
as late as the eighth inning. But it was more than velocity that
made Ortiz better.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz (3-2) seemed to have more confidence in himself,
challenging hitters and letting the defense make plays behind him.
He walked only two and hit a batter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies took a 1-0 lead in the first after Tom Goodwin
tripled and scored on a groundout by Todd Helton. But they trailed,
4-1, by the time they scored again. In the fifth a double by Brent
Mayne and a triple by Neifi Perez led to two runs to cut their
deficit to 4-3, but that was as close as the Rockies would get.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels pecked and nibbled in the early innings, scoring once
in the first and second innings and twice in the third. Stocker was
thrown out at home in the fourth, trying to score from first on a
double by Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels broke the game open in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   It started with a walk by Scott Spiezio, followed by a single by
Vaughn. After Tim Salmon lined out, the key play of the inning came
with Garret Anderson at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit a grounder up the middle that barely scooted under
the glove of pitcher Kevin Jarvis (2-4). Had Jarvis fielded the
ball, it probably would have been an inning-ending double play.
Instead, the ball rolled into center field, scoring Spiezio and
sending Vaughn to second.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus followed with a walk to load the bases, and that was it
for Jarvis. Lefty Scott Karl entered the game, but Molina slugged
his first pitch over the fence in left field for his first career
grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels added three more runs in the sixth on Glaus'
three-run homer.

L.A. BUSINESSES FEAR RUIN FROM DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION PROTESTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By ERIK NELSON  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Despite assurances Friday from police and city
officials, downtown Los Angeles business owners said they cannot
rely on police to protect them from protesters who threaten to
target the area during the Democratic National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   Still reeling from the riotous Lakers' championship riot that
caused as much as $750,000 in damage, business owners said they are
planning to work together and may hire private security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we feel safer now? No. Not at all,'' said an irate Jason
Kim, sales manager of Pico Store Equipment and one of 50 business
owners, residents and officials who attended the closed-door
meeting at Patriotic Hall downtown.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, police, convention planners and city
officials mapped out a strategy to protect lives and property, but
business owners said they were not impressed _ and were frustrated
by a lack of detail.
</P>
<P>
   A k1%ce Cmdr. David Kalish said police have tried to provide as
much information as possible about their plans, but ``obviously the
department must be sensitive to what type of information can be
released so that confidential information is not provided.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly understand their apprehension,'' Kalish said.
``However, the Police Department is absolutely committed to
protecting the people and property of this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Protest organizers have threatened to flood downtown streets
with as many as 50,000 demonstrators who will target banks and
corporate offices, including the World Trade Center at Figueroa and
Third streets.
</P>
<P>
   The department plans to deploy about 2,000 officers on the
street each day of the convention, which runs Aug. 14-17. Other law
enforcement agencies, including the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department and the California Highway Patrol, also will be on alert
to send more officers if needed, Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Lakers riot, Kim's store sustained $30,000 in damage
after looters smashed windows, stole cash and made off with
mannequins. Now, store managers are contemplating equipping their
store windows with a transparent covering that renders glass
unbreakable.
</P>
<P>
   His mood was reflected by other business owners who attended the
meeting, which was organized by the Figueroa Corridor Partnership,
a coalition of businesses along Figueroa and Flower streets. The
area was hardest hit by Lakers riot looters and vandals.
</P>
<P>
   Ishai Jesse Hizami, who owns the Kentucky Fried Chicken
restaurant at 3850 S. Figueroa, harkened back to the 1965 Watts
riot and the 1992 riot after the acquittal of four Los Angeles
Police officers accused of beating African-American motorist Rodney
King. Hizami, too, said he was unimpressed with the official
response to damage caused by mobs after last month's championship
game and parade.

WNBA ROOKIE ADJUSTS TO PRO LIFE, BUT MISSES MOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Lynn Pride said the toughest part of professional
basketball is not trying to guard players such as Sheryl Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   Or get playing time.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even that Portland, an expansion franchise, is stuck in
seventh place. All those things have to do with basketball, Pride's
comfort zone during her playing career at Sam Houston High School
in Arlington, Texas, and the University of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   The hard part is that Pride and her mom, Charla Pride-Lofton,
haven't seen each other since Senior Night at Kansas in March. The
normal two or three phone calls per day have often been replaced by
a quick ``hello,'' from a hotel room in various cities. For Pride,
21, adjusting to the real world _ getting a first job, moving into
an apartment, the constant travel and missing her mom _ is proving
the toughest adjustment of all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still wish I could see my mom every day, but I guess it's
all part of growing up,'' Lynn Pride said during a road trip
through Houston. ``I think we've both been doing a pretty good job
of handling it. This is the hardest part, all the travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Back home in Garland, Pride-Lofton keeps up with her daughter's
progress by watching television and checking the WNBA box scores
after each game. Before the season started, Pride-Lofton ordered
the special WNBA television package. So far, she's not happy with
what she receives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems the Portland games are never on,'' she said. ``Every
day, it's Houston or Los Angeles or somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when your daughter's team is 4-13.
</P>
<P>
   Pride, a 6-foot-2 forward and three-time All-Big 12 pick at
Kansas, was the seventh overall pick by the Fire in this year's
draft. After getting selected, she didn't even have enough time to
clean out her dorm room before heading to Portland. Pride-Lofton
and Lynn's stepfather, Lonnie Lofton, drove to Kansas and hauled
her stuff back to Garland.
</P>
<P>
   Portland coach Linda Hargrove said the team chose Pride on
potential, hoping her resume in the WNBA will someday resemble what
it did at Kansas. Pride improved each season for the Jayhawks,
finishing her career with a 17.4 scoring and 7.9 rebounding
average.
</P>
<P>
   For the Fire, Pride is averaging 3.8 points per game and 14.9
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the results confirm that Pride has a long way to go to
reach stardom, Kansas coach Marian Washington said it might by only
a season or two away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's learning and she's toughening it out,''
Washington said. ``Lynn is the type of person who responds to a lot
of encouragement, and I think she needs a confidence boost. That
will come as she learns more and gets more used to the league. She
has the type of personality that will make her successful because
she's able to see the whole picture.''
</P>
<P>
   Pride's playing time is less than second-round pick and former
Michigan forward Stacey Thomas. That's hard for a parent to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time she messes up, they take her right back out of the
game,'' Pride-Lofton said. ``How can she perform if she's scared? I
just tell her, `Get on out there!qnd work hard bEcY].Y

DODGERS GET CLOSE LOOK AT RODRIGUEZ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE - Let the dance begin, but tentatively.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle shortstop Alex Rodriguez will be a free agent after this
season. The Dodgers are expected to make a run at Rodriguez in the
offseason. What club with deficiencies in the middle of the infield
and deep pockets wouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   So this weekend, as the Dodgers face the Mariners, general
manager Kevin Malone will watch Rodriguez, who will command far
more than the $4,362,500 he earns this season. The Dodgers already
have a $90 million payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had Alex Cora starting at short Friday. Cora, 24,
has a bright future, but his bat (.268, 1 HR, 6 RBI entering
Friday's game) isn't nearly as strong as Rodriguez's .347, 24 HR
and 77 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy might be the best in his position in the history of
the game,'' said Rodriguez's agent, Scott Boras.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it was Cora's knee that knocked out Rodriguez -
literally - during a play in the fifth inning. Rodriguez hit his
head against Cora and was taken to the hospital for X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   No Dodger official or Boras can comment on Rodriguez's plans
unless they want to face tampering charges. But this much is
certain: Rodriguez likes the color blue, although he was quick to
point out the Mariners have blue in their uniform, too.
</P>
<P>
   Boras, in town and planning to accompany Rodriguez to the
All-Star Game in Atlanta, said his client is as happy as he has
ever been in Seattle because the Mariners are winning. Despite the
loss of Ken Griffey Jr., Seattle leads the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic about the way things are going,'' Rodriguez said.
``I don't look at it as my free-agent year because we're having so
much fun this year. The issue hasn't been me. It's been the whole
team.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, there's no guarantee Rodriguez is a Mariner for life.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rodriguez said Seattle is his first choice, he wants to
play on a team that's committed to winning every year. He wasn't
happy that Seattle floundered the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Beside, Boras said, two of his other clients, Atlanta pitcher
Greg Maddux and New York outfielder Bernie Williams, supposedly
were on their way when their contracts expired, yet they're still
in Atlanta and New York.
</P>
<P>
   So after the season, Rodriguez will assess his and the other
interested teams' situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you commit to an organization, you want the organization
to be committed to you,'' Rodriguez said.
</P>
<P>
   Experience factor: Members of the Seattle clubhouse staff wrote
on Jim Leyritz's nameplate: ``Welcome home. What took you so
long?''
</P>
<P>
   The joke is Leyritz has played more games at Safeco Field than
probably any other visiting player. He was traded from the Red Sox
to San Diego last year - just in time to play in the inaugural
Safeco game on July 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days later, he was traded to the Yankees, who soon enough
played at Safeco.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Leyritz and the Yankees were here April 7-9. Now,
he has returned with his third different club.
</P>
<P>
   As is common with playing in a park for the first time, the
Dodgers took early batting practice Friday to get a feel for
things. Leyritz was there, too, but he already knew plenty.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing, it's not a hitter's park,'' Leyritz said. ``Don't
try and hit home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Infielder Mark Grudzielanek was a late scratch
Friday because of the flu.... Reliever Gregg Olson, in a rehab
appearance Thursday night at Single-A San Bernardino against Lake
Elsinore, got hit on the elbow by a batted ball. He stayed in the
game and finished the inning, giving up just two hits with a
strikeout. Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Olson will rest for
two days and throw again Sunday. A return to the parent club after
the All-Star Break remains possible, he said.... Dodgers announcer
Vin Scully was named ``Sportscaster of the 20th Century'' by the
American Sportscasters Association. Scully wins out over the likes
of Howard Cosell, Mel Allen, Red Barber and Bob Costas.

SEGUI'S BASES-LOADED SINGLE IN 10TH LIFTS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ David Segui's bases-loaded single in the
bottom of the 10th inning off reliever Matt Whiteside scored Luis
Alicea with the winning run and gave the Texas Rangers a 5-4
victory over the San Diego Padres at The Ballpark in Arlington on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Catalanotto, pinch hitting for shortstop Kelly Dransfeldt,
started the game-winning rally with a double to deep center, and
Luis Alicea drew a walk. Rusty Greer followed with a grounder up
the middle, and Padres second baseman Bret Boone made a terrific
diving stop. But shortstop Kevin Nicholson dropped the flip as he
tried to turn the double play, and Alicea slid in safely, loading
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough Green, who entered the game as a pinch runner for
Rafael Palmeiro in the eighth inning, then tried to surprise the
Padres with a bunt. But third baseman Phil Nevin jumped on it and
forced Catalanotto at home.
</P>
<P>
   Whiteside then got Ivan Rodriguez to pop out, but Segui grounded
a single through the right side to win it. The victory gives the
Rangers a four-game winning streak, and it was their first victory
in five extra-inning games this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like this win,'' Alicea said. ``This was a good win. We've
won four in a row now. Hopefully, we'll win two more before the
All-Star break and be flying into the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Davis, on an exhausting night for the Rangers bullpen, got
the victory with a 1-2-3 inning in the top of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of guys out there who came through with one
or two big plays that kept us in the ballgame,'' manager Johnny
Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez provided the Rangers with their first four runs
with a first-inning grand slam, the second of his career and the
second this season by a Ranger. Alicea started the inning with a
single off Padres starter Woody Williams, who then walked Greer and
gave up another single to Rafael Palmeiro.
</P>
<P>
   All of that, plus a double by Segui, came with nobody out, and
it appeared Williams would be finished early. But suddenly he found
himself and found a way to get the Rangers out, holding them
scoreless on two hits over 7 1/3 innings. It was only Williams'
second start after missing two months because of surgery needed to
remove an aneurysm in his right armpit.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers starter Matt Perisho lasted 5 1/3 innings, allowing two
runs on three hits, including a two-run homer to Boone in the
fourth. He also walked four and threw 111 pitches, which forced
Oates to go to the bullpen quicker than he had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were ahead 4-2 when Perisho left, but the Padres
tied it with a run off Jeff Zimmerman in the seventh and one off
Tim Crabtree in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, who found out earlier in the day his father had died,
struck out four in his 1 2/3 innings of work, which suggested he
brought his best stuff to the mound. But he walked Eric Owens with
one out in the seventh and that cost him. Zimmerman struck out
Ruben Rivera, but Owens stole second on the third strike, then
scored on Ryan Klesko's bloop single into center field.
</P>
<P>
   Crabtree got himself into trouble with one out in the eighth
when he hit Wiki Gonzalez with a 1-0 pitch and then walked Dave
Magadan, who was in a 2-for-33 slump. Crabtree got Damien Jackson
on a liner to left, but Nicholson grounded a single through the
middle to score Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland's ninth inning was just as adventurous, beginning with
a leadoff walk to Rivera. Ryan Klesko forced Rivera with a grounder
to shortstop before Nevin singled to left, putting runners at first
and second.
</P>
<P>
   Boone followed with a sharp grounder up the middle. Wetteland
knocked it down with his barehand, scrambled quickly to recover,
then threw high to third base. But Mike Lamb reached high to grab
the throw, then reached back and got the tag on Klesko for the out.
Wetteland then got out of the inning when shortstop Dransfeldt made
a nice play on Gonzalez's high chopper.

KENNY IRWIN JR. DIES IN CRASH AT NEW HAMPSHIRE TRACK

<P>
   Kenny Irwin Jr., who credited his NASCAR Craftsman Truck victory
at Texas Motor Speedway in June 1997 with helping him land a
Winston Cup ride, was killed Friday in a crash while practicing at
New Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, 30, died of ``multiple injuries'' after his car slammed
into a wall at 150 mph while entering Turn 3 of the 1.058-mile oval
in Loudon, N.H. Irwin crashed at almost the same spot where
19-year-old Adam Petty was killed while practicing for a NASCAR
Busch Grand National race on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, the 1998 Winston Cup Rookie of the Year, was entering the
third turn when his car struck the wall and flipped onto its roof
during practice for Sunday's New England 300, a Winston Cup race.
The upper part of his body was covered with blood, and he appeared
lifeless when removed from the car.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Dearborn, Concord Hospital spokeswoman, reported that
Irwin died of multiple injuries but offered no other details.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation centered on a stuck accelerator that would have
prohibited Irwin from slowing enough to complete the turn. That
also was believed to have been the reason for Petty's crash,
although NASCAR has been unable to verify the cause.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was three races into his rookie Craftsman Truck Series
career when he won at the Homestead-Miami Speedway in Florida in
March 1997. Three months later, Irwin won the inaugural Pronto Auto
Parts 400K under the lights at TMS. That victory marked Irwin as a
bona fide Craftsman Truck Rookie of the Year candidate, and boosted
his stock in the Winston Cup garage.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, team owner Robert Yates introduced Irwin, a
native of Indianapolis, as driver of the No. 28 Texaco Havoline
Ford during a news conference at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``That win (at TMS) helped a tremendous amount,'' Irwin said at
TMS in April 1998. ``To the Winston Cup car owners, this (TMS) was
probably the most controversial track on the circuit (in 1997). So
when we were able to come in here and run good and win the race, it
showed that I had what it took to run Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still had to do the calling to Robert Yates. This just
helped to get him on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin recorded the second of his three career Winston Cup poles
at TMS in Fort Worth on March 26, 1999, when he toured the 1.5-mile
quadoval at 190.154 mph. It was the track Cup record until broken
by Texan Terry Labonte in March.
</P>
<P>
   Despite early comparisons to three-time Cup champion Jeff
Gordon, Irwin's Cup career never took off with Yates, who fired him
after the 1999 season. Irwin signed with flamboyant team owner
Felix Sabates and Sabco Racing. He stood 28th in the standings
after 17 races with only one top-five and one top-10 finish. Irwin
was winless in 87 career Cup starts.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Petty, Adam's grandfather, said it was a coincidence
that two drivers were kil,jb$zpvwBo\59q at 15 &QC; M!Bn! 2HHspot at the
New Hampshire track.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those things are circumstances beyond human control,'' said
Petty, the king of stock car racing with a record 200 victories and
seven championships. ``There ain't nothing the matter with the
racetrack.''
</P>
<P>
   But other drivers were quick to criticize the track, which
features corners banked at a relatively flat 12 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Pole-sitter Rusty Wallace said there is a bump at the end of the
long backstretch, where cars reach about 150 mph, and that most
drivers are prepared for it. Wallace also said dirt and rubber
buildup on the asphalt surface make the oval among the slickest on
the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Martin said the track's design left little margin for
error.
</P>
<P>
   ``This racetrack and Martinsville are a particular danger to
stuck throttles because the corners are so sharp,'' Martin said.
``At a lot of the bigger racetracks with sweeping corners, you have
a chance to do something about stuck throttles.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton, visibly upset after visiting Irwin in the infield
care center before his friend was taken to the hospital, said he
would like to see the almost-flat turns banked higher in view of
the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two's a problem,'' Burton said. ``I think it needs to be
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Geof.~hO2ine, who survived a parts-spewing crash during a
Craftsman Truck race at the Daytona International Speedway in
February, said the deaths of Petty and Irwin had left him feeling
numb.
</P>
<P>
   ``My body is shaking it's so numb, knowing what happened here,''
Bodine said. ``We have to cope with it. Everyone has to. When we
climb in these windows,  &LR; XICknow &QC; 5Q!%9

JOHNSON LIKES HIS SUMMER JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clippers began their summer league mini-camp on Friday -
with a coaching vacancy still hanging over the franchise's head.
Not that people don't want the job.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Johnson woke up Friday morning at 5:30, excited to be the
summer league coach for the Clippers. Without a coach since the end
of last season, Johnson, a candidate to fill the spot, has been
assigned to lead the team of 13 players.
</P>
<P>
   For two hours Friday morning, Johnson, in sweatpants and a
T-shirt, led the summer league Clippers through the team's first
mini-camp practice, going over defensive and offensive plans.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Johnson said he felt ``pretty dog gone good'' about
being the man running the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got up this morning it was at 5:30, it wasn't because
of nervousness,'' Johnson said. ``It was because I was at the helm
and a head coach. Again, it may be for the summer it may not
be..We'd all like perfect situations but there's still only 29 of
these jobs, actually there is only two of these jobs (the Clippers
and Pacers have openings). You do what can to impress the people
you need to impress and then you go on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Elgin Baylor, vice president of basketball operations, said that
he has narrowed his list of candidates down to at least five but
gave no names or timeframe for the selection of a coach. He said
Johnson is still a candidate. John Lucas, an assistant with the
Denver Nuggets, has been championed by agent David Falk for the
position.
</P>
<P>
   While Baylor and Johnson balked at calling the summer league
coaching job an audition, both said it was a chance for Johnson to
show his skills as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will help to give an idea of what he can do as far
as running the team,'' said Elgin Baylor, vice president of
basketball operations. ``It would be a good indication of how well
he works with the players and his organization as a coach, his
style, his technique. There are various different things you find
out about his coaching ability.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor said that his evaluation of Johnson had been ongoing.
While Johnson said he wants to show Baylor what he can do at the
position, the two hadn't spoke specifically about any evaluations .
</P>
<P>
   ``My interaction with guys is whatever it is,'' Johnson said.
``It's never been a question. If that's basis of hiring you might
as well do it right now. I think my interaction is very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``My skill on the court, and I know better than anybody, I
haven't been a coach in the NBA but I have prepared myself for this
by going through assistant to assistant to assistant and then being
a head coach in the CBA. I've very confident with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was an assistant with the Boston Celtics for four
seasons. Before becoming an assistant with the Clippers in the
middle of last season, Johnson was the coach for the LaCrosse
Bobcats in the CBA. As a player Johnson was a three-time NBA
champion with the Seattle Supersonics and Boston Celtics, playing
in a total of five NBA finals.Johnson could be an assistant if he
loses out on the head coaching position, but that choice would be
up to the new coach, Baylor said. For the time being Johnson isn't
thinking that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't gave (being an assistant) any thought,'' Johnson
said. ``I think its almost like a fighter's syndrome. If you are
thinking like a sparing partner you are going to go out on the mat
like a sparing partner. I'm thinking like a head coach. If I happen
to get whooped its going to be by a knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   DRAFT PICKS NOT IN CAMP
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a coach has limited the Clippers. First round draft
picks Darius Miles, Keyon Dooling and Quentin Richardson will not
be at the mini-camp and probably not at the summer league citing
the lack of a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Other NBA teams have their first round draft picks in camp. The
Dallas Mavericks, who also ended up with three first round picks,
have all three on their summer league roster.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers had two free agent rookies in camp on Friday, North
Carolina point guard Ed Cota and Delaware center Ndongo N'Diaye.
</P>
<P>
   MAGGETTE AND STRONG IN L.A.
</P>
<P>
   Swingman Corey Maggette and power forward Derek Strong passed
their physicals on Friday, completing the draft day trade that sent
the two and Dooling to the Clippers for a lottery-protected
first-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette, an athletic 6-foot-6, 215-pounds, had planned on
playing with Orlando in the Summer Pro League at the Pyramid. But
with the trade, he decided to play and workout in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette said he benefited in his rookie season last year from
the guidance of Magic coach Doc Rivers and said the best coach for
the Clippers would be someone who favors an uptempo style.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a coach that wants it like we do, kind of like a
player coach like Doc was, someone who knows our guys strengths and
knows our weakness and knows what we can do to achieve our goals
that we set for ourselves,'' Maggette said. ``By looking at our
team, we are a team who can really run on the floor. With Lamar
(Odom) he is a great ball handler and shooter, he's a great
all-around player..plus you are going to have guys running the
wings with him that can help him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong, a 6-9, 240-pound power forward, is making his second
return to Los Angeles. Strong, who went to Pacific Palisades High
School, played the 1995-96 season with the Lakers. Strong will be
playing in the summer league but not with the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   SKINNER BACK
</P>
<P>
   Brian Skinner returned to the practice court on Friday, after
missing the last 26 games, and 43 games overall, with a high ankle
sprain.
</P>
<P>
   The long holdout wasn't due to any complications with the
injury, just the need for rest and more rehabilitation, Skinner
said. ``It's still sore a little bit playing on it trying to back
into rigors of it,'' Skinner said.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner looked comfortable running through drills with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like he is in pretty good shape,'' Baylor said ``He
looks healthy it looks like his ankle is fine. I watched him run
and jump and move..as far as his mobility it was very good.
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers waived point guard Charles Jones on Friday. Jones
averaged 3.4 points and 1.7 assists per game last season..Former
UCLA star Charles O'Bannon was added to the Clipper summer league
roster. He played last season in Poland...Baylor said that the
Clippers are talking with teams and agents about offseason deals.
For right now the Clippers are over the salary cap and would need
to renounce some free agents. Without free agents Maurice Taylor
and Derek Anderson, the Clippers would have more than $5 million in
cap space.
</P>
<P>
   Clipper forward Etdrick Bohannon didn't practice with the
Clippers Friday and underwent an MRI on his left knee. The results
will be back on Monday. Bohannon, signed through 2001, hurt himself
during offseason workouts.

MAVERICKS PROMISE NO REPEAT OF SMITH FIASCO
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   DALLAS _ To the outsider, Mark Cuban's spending habits may seem
a bit wacky.
</P>
<P>
   He bought the Dallas Mavericks for an NBA-record $280 million in
April. He bought a $42 million executive jet _ on the Internet.
Friday, he basically bought a person, paying $125,000 to have a
local sports radio personality _ KTCK//1310 AM's Gordon Keith _
change his name to Dallasmaverick (one word) for one year.
</P>
<P>
   But even if Cuban's habits seem unorthodox, he finds value in
each buy.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the investment Cuban made in the players selected
in last week's NBA Draft isn't taken lightly. Cuban and the
Mavericks coaching staff did their homework on Etan Thomas,
Courtney Alexander, Donnell Harvey and Eduardo Najera. But the
risk, for Cuban, doesn't end with pre-draft background checks. The
Mavs suffered from the Leon Smith fiasco last summer _ before Cuban
arrived _ and the rookie owner has set up a system to hopefully
avoid similar scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plan is to put together very specific programs for the
players and (assistant coach) Kiki (Vandeweghe) is going to
coordinate and develop all of that,'' Cuban said. ``Everything from
media training, to nutrition, to eating, to strength and
conditioning. Things that they may not pay as close attention to as
you or I.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the current rookie class, Harvey has been slated to do
individual work with Vandeweghe. Harvey, 19, played only[ just] a
season at Florida and though he remembers the Smith situation,
Harvey said his circumstance is different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read what happened but this isn't the same,'' said Harvey,
drafted 22nd in the first round by New York before being traded.
``I feel like I an ready to play in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, drafted at the end of the first round by San Antonio and
traded to the Mavs, had a much-publicized falling out with
assistant coach Donnie Nelson at minicamp last summer. Smith's
emotional problems, which included a suicide attempt, led to his
eventual negotiated release from the Mavericks, who were criticized
for their handling of the rookie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than having him learn on the job, like we've all had to
do in various jobs, it sort of gets him in a corporate-training
introduction program,'' Cuban said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Nelson: ``The NBA is such a mental game. These young kids
just don't know those elements that go into our sport and are
really taken aback when they're first exposed to them. With Harvey,
it's no different. He seemed to pick things up pretty quickly out
there, but he's a young man. Guys like him, it generally takes a
little bit longer.''
</P>
<P>
   While Harvey's off-the-court skills are polished, it's his play
on the hardwood that has the Mavs optimistic about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be quite honest, Donnell plays like a man,'' Alexander
said. ``I think Donnell, in that respect, will be fine. Obviously
he has a lot of growing to do, he has a lot of learning to do, but
he doesn't fear too much. I'm just hoping he can carry over what he
did in college to help our team.'' BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   _ The NBA fined the Mavericks and Milwaukee Bucks $50,000 each
Friday for violating league rules that prohibit teams from having
more than four draft-eligible players competing on the court at the
same time during workouts and from having those players compete
against veteran NBA players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought the fine was a bit heavy,'' Cuban said. ``If we did
something, we'll go ahead and pay it. I just want to make sure they
weren't picking on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban said the team had some five-on-five scrimmages when draft
eligible players were in town and suspects that was what the
violation was, although he hadn't received details from the league.
</P>
<P>
   _ Draft picks Etan Thomas and Eduardo Najera signed contracts
Friday, leaving Donnell Harvey as the only unsigned rookie.
Courtney Alexander signed on Thursday. Thomas' deal, the maximum
for the 12th pick of the draft, is for three years at $4,479,128,
with club options for a fourth and fifth season. Najera, who
arrived from Mexico for minicamp Friday on a tourist visa, signed a
two-year deal starting at just over $300,000 for next season.
</P>
<P>
   _ Summer-camp signee Gheorghe Muresan arrived Friday and he's
expected at Saturday's afternoon practice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Free-agent center Bruno Sundov said his sprained left ankle
will probably keep him off the court two more weeks. nn

ANTI-MISSILE TEST FAILS OVER PACIFIC, PENTAGON REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
  (UPDATES with failure of test)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a major setback for the Clinton administration's
plan to build a missile shield to protect U.S. soil from enemy
attack, a missile fired from the Marshall Islands in the Pacific
failed to hit a mock warhead launched 4,300 miles away in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We failed to achieve an intercept this evening,'' said Brian
Whitman, a Pentagon spokesman.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The most recent test, conducted in January, also ended in
failure. In that case, the kill vehicle missed the mock warhead by
between 300 to 400 feet after a cooling line clogged and shut down
its heat-seeking sensors.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:19 a.m. EDT Saturday, a 37-year-old remodeled Minuteman
rocket containing a mock warhead and a decoy balloon thundered
aloft over the Pacific Ocean from a tightly guarded launching pad
at Vandenberg Air Force Base, 125 miles north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one minutes after that, a 54-inch, 130-pound
``exoatmospheric kill vehicle'' was launched from Kwajalein Atoll
in the Pacific Ocean. Instead of guiding itself to a collision with
the incoming mock warhead in midflight, it missed.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon gave no immediate details to explain the failure.
</P>
<P>
   The test was counted on to determine whether President Clinton
proceeds with a plan to begin development of a $60 billion national
missile defense that administration officials contend is crucial to
defend against missile attacks from countries like North Korea,
Iran and Iraq, but opponents charge is technically unsound,
unnecessary and a waste of money.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some senior Pentagon officials said that a decision
to move forward was possible even if the test failed, Friday
night's miss will make it politically more difficult for Clinton to
move forward with even the most basic decision to issue contracts
for pouring concrete for a radar guidance system in the Aleutian
Islands, a move under consideration even though many arms control
experts insist that it would violate the 1972 AntiBallistic Missile
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Because of harsh winter conditions in that area of Alaska,
barges must begin ferrying equipment by next spring if the radar is
to be completed by 2005, the date when the administration has
concluded North Korea could have a ballistic missile capable of
hitting the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The test failure is certain to reinforce calls in Congress that
the decision on whether to move forward with a national missile
defense program should be left to the next president.
</P>
<P>
   The final analysis of what went wrong in Friday night's test
will take about three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, the Pentagon initially hailed its first intercept
test as a complete success. But it later was forced to acknowledge
that the kill vehicle initially had drifted off course and picked
out the large bright decoy balloon instead of the mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In a second more complicated intercept test in January, the kill
vehicle missed the mock warhead by between 300 to 400 feet after a
cooling line clogged and shut down its heat-seeking sensors.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1983, when President Reagan envisioned a defense based
in space that would render nuclear weapons obsolete, has an issue
of military technology seized the imagination of U.S. policy-makers
and politicians and alarmed America's friends and foes.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has also entered the presidential campaign, with Vice
President Al Gore endorsing a limited version of the plan and Gov.
George W. Bush backing a more ambitious system.
</P>
<P>
   And it has raised a chorus of criticism from a sizable swath of
scientists in the United States, some of whom argue that the
proposed $60 billion system is not feasible and that the tests are
rigged.
</P>
<P>
   The test had been scheduled to take place during a four-hour
window that began late Friday night. But a last-minute technical
problem set back the launching by about two hours. The problem was
related to electronic signals that keep the ground control informed
about the missile's flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting a bullet with a bullet'' is how a Pentagon official
described the hoped-for collision. ``Steel on target,'' another
said.
</P>
<P>
   The three tests held so far are part of a series of 19 planned
tests.
</P>
<P>
   After the failure of the test in January, a new communications
system was added for Friday's test that transmits information
directly to the kill vehicle about the location of the target after
it has lifted off. Called a global-positioning-system transmitter,
it used the same technology that helps motorists to avoid getting
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the failure Friday, critics said the new test was a
misleading guide because it was taking place under conditions that
do not reflect a real attack. They said the decoy was not a true
decoy but was more like a lure that attracts the kill vehicle to
the real target, and that an adversary would use many decoys, not
one.
</P>
<P>
   In three or four weeks, Secretary of Defense William Cohen is to
give Clinton a formal recommendation of whether building the system
is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is expected to decide this fall whether to put America
on the road to a national missile defense system by starting
construction of a radar in the Aleutian Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Administration lawyers have advised Clinton that in their view,
he could begin building this first phase of the missile defense
without violating the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, one of
the cornerstones of arms control agreements between Washington and
Moscow.

   But the administration has been hit by a storm of criticism from
prominent scientists, arms control experts, former officials and
the General Accounting Office over the cost, technology and effect
on relations with other nations.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence J. Korb of the Council on Foreign Relations called the
entire system a ``shield of dreams'' whose supporters believe that
``if you build it, it will work.''
</P>
<P>
   Even within the administration, a debate is raging among
intelligence and Pentagon officials and policy experts over the
nature and extent of the potential threat from countries like North
Korea, Iran and Iraq that is the official justification for
building a missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior Pentagon officials have warned that the
administration's schedule is much too accelerated and therefore
risky, because testing would continue even as construction has
begun.

<P>
   Russia and China are adamantly opposed to a U.S. missile defense
because they consider it a threat to their ability to defend
themselves. European nations are also objecting.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to stop the test, Greenpeace, the anti-nuclear
organization, said a small team of missile defense opponents
entered the grounds of Vandenberg Air Force Base on foot. Equipped
with survival gear and supplies for several days, they intended to
stay inside the area as long as they could, according to a
Greenpeace statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch vessel Arctic Sunrise threatened to enter one of the
hazard zones designated by the Pentagon in the waters off
Vandenberg.
</P>
<P>
   An unidentified man was caught entering the base, but a base
spokesman, John Cherry, said there was no evidence of intruders in
the heavily guarded area around the launching pad.
</P>
<P>
   At a news briefing in Washington on Friday, a group of business
leaders and scientists weighed in with 11-hour criticism of both
the test and the entire plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop this insensate and tortuously rationalized arms race that
drains money away from our vital civilian programs,'' said Alan
Kligerman, the chief executive officer of Akpharma Inc., and a
board member of Business Leaders for Sensible Priorities, which
seeks to cut military spending. He added: ``If I would represent my
products and sell them with the same shortcomings in the products
as regard to what they are supposed to do, I would be indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Blair, president of Center for Defense Information, argued
at the same briefing that the development of a national missile
defense was justifiably seen by Russia as a threat to its nuclear
deterrent.

UNEASY ACCEPTANCE OF HAZARDS OF THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ For the second time in eight weeks, a pall was
cast over New Hampshire International Speedway after NASCAR Winston
Cup driver Kenny Irwin, 30, of Indianapolis, was killed Friday
morning during practice at the 1.058-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin's heavy wall impact occurred in almost the same spot where
19-year-old Adam Petty was killed May 12 during a morning practice
for a Busch Series race.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement released by Concord Hospital officials,
Irwin died from multiple injuries. Irwin, a third-year veteran of
the NASCAR Winston Cup Series, was in his first year as driver of
the No. 42 BellSouth Chevrolet Monte Carlo owned by Felix Sabates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are deeply saddened at today's passing of Kenny Irwin,''
NASCAR president Bill France said in a statement. ``On behalf of
all of us at NASCAR and the entire NASCAR community, our deepest
sympathies, all our thoughts and prayers are with Kenny's family,
friends, and everyone at Team SABCO. Kenny was a fine competitor
and will be missed very much by the entire NASCAR community.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NASCAR officials declined to elaborate on what caused
the accident, many in the garage area speculated it was the result
of a stuck throttle, which was initially thought to have been the
problem in Petty's crash. NASCAR officials, however, ruled out
</P>
<P>
   any mechanical problems in Petty's crash.
</P>
<P>
   Track rescue workers had no sooner arrived on the scene to
extricate Irwin from his upended car when crew chiefs radioed their
teams to have their throttle rods and linkage inspected and
reinspected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very concerned, but without some answers it's pretty
hard to understand what happened,'' said NASCAR Winston Cup
director Gary Nelson, who indicated Irwin's car had been impounded
and taken to an off-site facility for inspection. ``The car is bent
and twisted so much it's hard to figure out, as we're looking at
it, what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   After Irwin spent his first two years with Robert Yates Racing
as driver of the No. 28 Texaco Havoline Ford Taurus, he was hired
by Sabates to replace Joe Nemechek, whose only victory with Team
SABCO came last September at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   At Sabates's request, Irwin's team withdrew from competition in
Sunday's New England 300 at NHIS and returned to its home base in
Charlotte, N.C. Team SABCO's other entry, the No. 40 Coors Light
Chevy driven by Sterling Marlin, was withdrawn from Friday's pole
qualifications but is expected to qualify Saturday and participate
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was on his first practice lap in a new car when the
accident occurred at 11:23 a.m. The car hit the wall entering Turn
3, rolled over onto the driver's side and skidded through the
corner before landing on its roof in Turn 4.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report from driver Scott Pruett, who witnessed
the accident from the observation perch of his team's transporter,
Irwin entered the corner at a high rate of speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he went to turn in and all of a sudden he went
straight,'' Pruett said. ``He didn't lift (off the gas) and he went
straight into the wall. It looked like as he started to turn, he
had the whole thing locked up. He hit the wall pretty hard _ not at
a straight 90 (degree angle), but almost a 45.''
</P>
<P>
   The fatality was another jarring blow to the NASCAR community,
which arrived here mindful of the circumstances surrounding the
loss of Adam Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrific,'' Pruett said. ``It's devastating for the sport
and the families. Whenever somebody gets hurt in this sport, it's
horrific. When it happens at the same track and the same place, we
need to take a closer look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Andrews, crew chief of the No. 1 Pennzoil Chevrolet driven
by Steve Park, said a stuck throttle could have resulted from any
number of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be something on the floorboard, it could be from a
malfunction on the carburetor, it could be something in the air
cleaner; several things could make a throttle stick, it doesn't
matter where you are,'' Andrews said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Park, ``New Hampshire had an impeccable record in previous
years, but what many people don't realize is that we go in excess
of 150 (miles per hour) here and anything can happen. We all know
the inherent risks of our job, but as I mentioned, you just don't
think New Hampshire would be a life-taking track.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if teams had cause for concern, Andrews said, ``I think
that's a concern throughout the sport any time that happens. Even
if you're lucky enough to get off the throttle and get the motor
shut down before you hit anything, you're still going to do some
damage. That obviously didn't happen with Kenny. He didn't have a
chance to shut anything off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Rudd, driver of the No. 28 Texaco car, had experienced a
similar problem, but not at NHIS. Still, he said the configuration
of the Loudon track, with its long straightaways and tight corners,
left little room to react to a stuck throttle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had 'em stick before and it's not like there's a whole
lot a driver can do about it,'' Rudd said. ``If you get off the
gas, you might get the car settled, but it's still going wide open.
You've got to get your foot on the brake, and that's about all you
can do. But when the motor is wide open and you get on the brakes,
though, it doesn't slow you down a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudd said drivers are sometimes unaware they have a stuck
throttle until it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's usually when you find out,'' he said. ``It's when
you're down the straightaway and you drive it into the last
possible minute and you lift the throttle. If it doesn't come back
up, there's not a whole lot of time to do much of anything because
you're already committed to being in there as deeply as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   After Irwin was pulled from his smoldering wreck, rescue workers
immediately began working to resuscitate him as they placed him on
a stretcher and loaded him into the ambulance. When Irwin was
brought to the track's hospital, adjacent to the garage area, all
activity came to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup drivers waited for the track to be cleared, practice
to resume, and for news of Irwin's condition.
</P>
<P>
   When Ward Burton emerged from the hospital and walked into the
garage, he was approached by reporters for a comment on Irwin's
condition. But he shook his head no and declined to issue a
statement. He walked directly toward Dale Jarrett's garage stall
and delivered the grim news to Jarrett, who had already been
strapped into his car.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, last year's Winston Cup champion, had been Irwin's
former teammate at Yates Racing and had once employed him as the
driver of his Busch Series car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes everything else not really seem to matter,'' Jarrett
said.
</P>
<P>
   Track officials did not release word of Irwin's death until 2:30
p.m., when Winston Cup qualifying was scheduled to begin.
Afterward, it overshadowed the effort of Rusty Wallace, who won the
pole position in record fashion with a lap of 132.089 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he managed to get through the remainder of the day,
Wallace said, ``I don't even know how to say that except that these
are days that make you really sit back and look at yourself in the
mirror and go, `Why do I do this?' ''

WILLIAMS LEARNED LOYALTY AT CAROLINA, APPLIED IT AT KANSAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roy Williams has made the toughest decision that a college coach
ever faced. Williams stayed at Kansas on Thursday, choosing loyalty
to his players over the lure of what everyone thought was his dream
job.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely has a coach had to choose between two high profile jobs
such as North Carolina and Kansas. The Tar Heels are second on the
NCAA's victory list; the Jayhawks are third. Only at Kentucky is
the basketball blood as blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision that I've made came after the toughest seven days
of my life,'' Williams said Thursday night. ``That's quite a
statement because that also means that I'm the luckiest basketball
coach to ever live. I had the options that I had from two
universities and basketball programs that I love.''
</P>
<P>
   Coaches rarely make lateral moves. The goal is to move up the
ladder. Gene Bartow went from Illinois to UCLA, Jim Harrick from
Pepperdine to UCLA. Tubby Smith went from Tulsa to Georgia to
Kentucky. Rick Pitino went from Kentucky to the Boston Celtics.
Mike Krzyzewski went from Army to Duke. Bob Knight went from Army
to Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   When North Carolina coach Bill Guthridge made his surprise
resignation announcement last week, it all seemed so simple. Media
speculators figured that Guthridge had gone to Dean Smith, the
North Carolina Godfather, and told him the news. Smith then called
the Chosen One, Williams, to make sure the Tar Heels had a
successor in place.
</P>
<P>
   But done deals become done deals only when they're done. There
was intense pressure to get the story _ two North Carolina papers
reported that Williams had agreed to change jobs _ but this was a
one-man decision. Only Roy Williams knew what Roy Williams was
going to do.
</P>
<P>
   For Williams, choosing between Kansas and North Carolina was a
gut-wrenching decision. By remaining at Kansas, he will continue to
coach a program that he has lifted to its greatest heights and
consistency. By moving home to North Carolina, he would have been
working in the shadow of Smith's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now he's the Dean Smith of Kansas,'' former Kansas guard Ryan
Robertson said. ``You can't predict what he can accomplish over the
next 10, 15 years with the recruits he's going to get now.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an ironic symmetry between Kansas and North Carolina.
Dean Smith was a reserve on Kansas' first national champion in
1952. North Carolina's first national championship was a
triple-overtime defeat of Kansas in 1957. Williams is a North
Carolina native and a Tar Heel alum. The Tar Heels' last two
coaches _ Smith and Guthridge _ are Kansas natives.
</P>
<P>
   And in this Kansas vs. North Carolina battle, the Jayhawks came
out the winner. Williams was the Tar Heels' first choice. Whoever
they hire to replace Guthridge comes from the ``B'' list. The next
time North Carolina loses to Duke, Tar Heels fans will wonder
``Could Williams have done better?'' The next North Carolina coach
will be fighting a legend and a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' decision goes against the grain. Coaches leave their
teams at the drop of a richer contract. Williams is such a do-good,
dad-gum straight shooter that many people roll their eyes at his
``aw shucks'' attitude. But Williams chose to stay at Kansas using
his gut and his heart. Emotion ruled over logic, devotion won out
over ambition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the decision based on the most important thing _ my
players,'' Williams said. ``My mentors taught me that loyalty is
the most important thing. And, that was the decision _ I couldn't
leave my players. That became more important than my dream of being
at North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Smith's coaching ability is validated by his Division
I-record 879 victories. His ability as a teacher is demonstrated by
Williams' decision to stay at Kansas. That Williams learned the
lesson so well is unfortunate for North Carolina.

GLAVINE MAKES HIMSELF AT HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   As homecomings go, it was a much better night for Billerica's
Tom Glavine than it was for the Sons of Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   A double rainbow penetrated the dark skies that draped the Fens
Friday night but the thunder generated by Sox bats during a
four-game sweep in Minnesota was muzzled by lefthander Glavine in a
5-3 Atlanta win that quieted a sellout crowd of 33,686 until Braves
reliever John Rocker was summoned for his obligatory razzing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being from here, I expected it to be much like it was in New
York for John,'' said Glavine, who was spotted a 5-0 lead by Sox
lefthander Pete Schourek after two innings, then shut out the Sox
on four singles through seven innings until turning a 5-1 lead over
to Rocker with the bases loaded and one out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker, who dashed from the bullpen through a gantlet of boos
that was Cordero-esque in its intensity, required no additional
security like that deployed last week upon his return to New York,
according to Sox spokesman Kevin Shea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd wasn't that bad at all,'' said Sox closer Derek
Lowe, who observed the interaction between Rocker and the
right-field bleacherites from the neighboring bullpen. ``I saw him
giving autographs out there. Everything was fine. The loudest the
crowd got was when he was pitching. There wasn't any extra security
or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What Rocker needed more than another bodyguard was someone to
give him directions to home plate. The lefthanded reliever threw
two quick balls to Ed Sprague, then wound up walking him on a full
count, forcing in the run that made it 5-2.
</P>
<P>
   When he threw ball one to pinch hitter Brian Daubach, Rocker's
night was cut short by manager Bobby Cox, whose intent in bringing
in Kerry Ligtenberg was as obvious as his answer afterward when
asked why he elected to tarry no longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to win the (expletive) game,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox's desired outcome was still in doubt when Daubach, after
fouling off a couple of two-strike pitches, worked Ligtenberg for
another full-count walk to force home a third run. But Jason
Varitek, who had entered the game an inning before as a pinch
hitter for Scott Hatteberg, flied out to end the threat, and after
a two-out single by Jeff Frye in the ninth, Ligtenberg left Nomar
Garciaparra punching the air in frustration after flying out to end
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance,'' manager Jimy Williams said after the Sox'
record in interleague play fell to 3-7, 1-3 against the Braves.
``We couldn't get that one more hit to get us back even. (Glavine)
was tough on us all night.''
</P>
<P>
   While Glavine was styling, Schourek was staggered yet again,
disappearing almost as quickly as the rainbows. Schourek lasted
just five outs, ushered out of the game and perhaps the Sox'
starting rotation by a five-run Atlanta rally triggered by Andres
Galarraga's rain-maker of a home run, a high fly ball that just
cleared the left-field screen.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga's 20th home run of the season came in his first-ever
at-bat in Fenway Park, and should have portended a long night for
the Sox. The Braves are now 17-2 in games in which the
inspirational Galarraga, the 39-year-old first baseman making a
remarkable comeback from cancer, has homered. It was his third home
run in four games against the Sox this season, and fifth in 18
at-bats against the Red Sox in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, who now has not won in 10 starts dating back nearly
two months (May 15), was soon issuing line drives like tickets to
double-parkers on Boylston Street. Javy Lopez laced a single to
left. Bobby Bonilla, the disgraced ex-Met who has proven to the
Braves he still has a few cards left in his deck, followed with a
double to center, sending Lopez to third, and Reggie Sanders's
ground ball brought home Lopez to make it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek was on the verge of escaping trouble when he whiffed
Walt Weiss, but he hit Quilvio Veras in the forearm with a pitch,
then uncorked a wild pitch that allowed both runners to advance
just ahead of Andruw Jones's two-run single through the left side.
When Chipper Jones's liner over the head of Carl Everett ticked off
the center fielder's glove and went for a run-scoring double,
Schourek was done.
</P>
<P>
   The loss dropped his record to 2-8, while his ERA shot to 4.67.
That left Williams fielding as many questions about Schourek's
status as he did two years ago in the playoffs, when he chose the
lefthander to pitch rather than Pedro Martinez on short rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, he's in that spot, yep,'' said Williams, who issued
a similar response when asked if Brian Rose's spot was secure, then
yanked him a day later.
</P>
<P>
   Hatteberg insisted that Schourek's record was not an accurate
barometer of his season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had some great games where we didn't score any runs for
him at all,'' Hatteberg said. ``But after a game like tonight, I'm
sure people will look at his record and use it against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have his fastball tonight. He doesn't just baby the
ball in there. He throws 90, 91 (miles per hour) and when he didn't
have that tonight, it makes it a tough game to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek hoped that his wasn't an easy job to lose, even though
the reemergence of Tim Wakefield, the arrival of rookie Paxton
Crawford, and the pending return of Pedro Martinez gives Williams
some options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't speak for them,'' Schourek said, ``but I would hope
I've thrown well enough and shown enough good games to be able to
contribute in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, meanwhile, has no such worries after shutting down a
team that had cranked out 44 runs on 53 hits and 13 home runs while
sweeping Minnesota. He is now 9-5, and his next scheduled
appearance is in Tuesday's All-Star Game in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather win this game than the All-Star Game,'' said
Glavine, an All-Star seven times, now a winner in Fenway twice
over.
</P>
<P>
   His larger point was that this one counted in the standings,
unlike Tuesday's exhibition. But yes, he acknowledged, ``It's extra
special to win here.''

MADSEN TO MAKE DEBUT AS LAKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SEAN KEARNS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The head of new Laker power forward Mark
Madsen is spinning with options.
</P>
<P>
   Read the defense here, the offense there, make a cut. Such are
the intricacies of the triangle offense and Madsen is a new
student, completing his second day of school in the highly complex
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The triangle offense has so many different options,'' Madsen
said Friday. ``If I get the ball on the wing there are four or five
different options. What you have to do is read what the defense is
doing and you read your teammates as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen will make his debut as a Laker as well as his debut
running the triangle offense tonight at 7:30 p.m. at the Pyramid as
the Lakers summer league team faces the Portland Trailblazers. The
Summer Pro League begins play today and will run through July 30.
</P>
<P>
   The summer pro league is routinely a place where many current
top NBA players have made their profession debuts - Kobe Bryant
comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   This year is no different. While the Clippers won't have their
top picks playing in the SPL, other teams do. The highest pick on a
roster is swingman Mike Miller, taken fifth overall by the Orlando
Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas has its three first round picks on its roster - power
forward Etan Thomas (12th overall), shooting guard Courtney
Alexander (13th) and power forward Donnell Harvey (22nd). The
Trailblazers have point guard Erick Barkley (28th) on their roster.
The Seattle Supersonics have swingman Desmond Mason (17th) and
power forward Olumide Oyedeji (42nd) on their.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have swingman Corey Hightower (54th) and Madsen
(29th) making their debuts today.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen, from Danville, Calif, is no stranger to Long Beach. His
mother Erlyn, went to Millikan High School. Madsen come to Long
Beach to visit his grandfather, Bill Gould, the former president
and CEO of Southern California Edison who resides near Long Beach
State.
</P>
<P>
   The top priority for Madsen during this visit to Long Beach is
to learn the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my big goals coming out of here is an understanding of
the triangle offense and being more equipped to handle the rules
like illegal defense,'' Madsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only has Madsen had his first exposure to the triangle
offense but he's also had his first contact with the Zenmaster
himself, Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about coach Jackson is he really wants to make sure
the team is working together as a team,'' Madsen said. ``He really
wants to blend all the individuals on the floor together.'' So far
Jackson, who has been known to assign books for his players on the
road, hasn't assigned any reading for Madsen. But he has given
Madsen solid NBA advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things he told he is the NBA is a physical league
and for rookies there is going to be an adjustment period because
you have to be physically and mentally ready,'' Madsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Madsen could need that advice sooner rather than later. He has
entered a unique situation for the draftee of an NBA Champion. It
just so happens that the Lakers have a hole in the starting line-up
at Madsen's position.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first exercises for Laker fans at the Pyramid
watching Madsen will be to imagine him next to Shaquille O'Neal.
It's not an exercise Madsen is participating in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an area where they can use some help,'' Madsen said. ``I
feel I can offer rebounding and defense and energy and hustle. I'm
not too worried about my role on the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen, nicknamed the ``Mad Dog,'' has been well known for his
energy and hustle in four years at Stanford. Remember him dunking
on Rhode Island as a sophomore, leading the Cardinal to the final
four?
</P>
<P>
   But the aggressive Madsen is happy not to be on the opposite
side as Shaq during games, even though the two might face each
other in practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'll feel a couple elbows in practice sometimes,''
Madsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ROSTER NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The SPL is always a sort of lottery for what stars will show and
what stars won't. A player might be on a roster but that doesn't
mean he'll actually play. But just for fun, here's a list of what
might happen.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix Sun guard Penny Hardaway is on the roster for the NBA
Pros.
</P>
<P>
   The SLAM roster features a number of star quality NBA players
including Pacer forward Austin Croshere, Pacer power forward Dale
Davis and Rocket swingman Shandon Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Hornet Anthony Mason, who most recently was charge with
trying to start a riot in New Orleans, is on the Primetime roster.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Mason on the Primetime roster is Clipper Lamar Odom, who
has been on summer vacation on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Former UCLA guard and current Charlotte Hornet Baron Davis is on
the SMC stars roster.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST DAY
</P>
<P>
   So who might you see on the first day? Chances are you'll see
the Trailblazers Jermaine O'Neal, the topic of numerous offseason
trade rumors (Bulls GM Jerry Krause, who is interested in O'Neal
might not be very far behind). Also playing should be Seattle
Supersonics forward Rashard Lewis, who will be a highly sought
after second tier free agent.
</P>
<P>
   For local fans, former UCLA guard Toby Bailey is on the Nutriolo
roster.
</P>
<P>
   You could see some high powered coaches: Paul Westphal of the
Sonics, Mike Dunleavy of the Blazers and Jackson of the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   TICKETS
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the Summer Pro League are $8 for general admission
and $10 for reserved seats. Tickets are good for all five games at
the Pyramid each day. Tickets can be purchased at the Pyramid, by
calling the Pyramid Box Office at (562) 985-4949 or by calling

</P>
<P>
   Games start at 10:30 every day, with the last game starting at
7:30 p.m.

UNEASY ACCEPTANCE OF HAZARDS OF JOB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ As ironic as it was for them to do it, several
NASCAR drivers stood here Friday and essentially eulogized one of
their own. Their elegies were for Kenny Irwin, who was fatally
injured when he lost control of his Chevy on Turn 3 at New
Hampshire International Speedway. He was 30.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the men spoke of Irwin's smile and his ability to play
golf. Some of them said they were humbled and sick to their
stomachs. One of them, noting that Irwin's trailer was quickly
closed, said he wouldn't mind if everyone shut down their trailers
and went home for the day.
</P>
<P>
   No one, though, could answer a question that mystifies many of
us: Why do these men do this?
</P>
<P>
   Why do they speed in circles _ seemingly ad infinitum _ knowing
that a single slip of the hand or malfunction of the throttle could
turn an on-site eulogizer into the eulogized? Their fans form an
elaborate necklace from California to Nevada to Texas to Tennessee
to Alabama to the Carolinas to New Hampshire. Why is there such
devotion to a sport that has its participants flirt with death with
each practice and each race?
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace is 43 years old. He has been a pro since 1980. He
said he was saddened by Irwin's death and acknowledged the
unusually high dangers of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the days that make you really sit back and look at
yourself in the mirror and go, `Why do I do this?' '' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   He recently vacationed with his wife, Patti. He was away from
the grease, away from the mechanics, away from the culture where
symbols of capitalism (constant advertising slogans) and racism
(Confederate flags) are often juxtaposed.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace enjoyed his time away and wondered why he should go
back. But he did. Most drivers do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking, `What the hell am I doing at some greasy
racetrack banging fenders with these guys?' he said. ``Here I am
clearing tire rubber out of my eyeballs, and grease out of my
fingernails, and friends getting killed, and these are days that
make you not want to do it, I'll tell you that. It'll really make
you question why you're doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was eight weeks ago when we were asking the same vexing
question: Why? It was also a Friday, just before noon, when
19-year-old Adam Petty also lost control of his car on Turn 3. He
suffered fatal injuries. His grandfather, Richard, was here Friday.
At five minutes before 11, Richard Petty began to give interviews
in the Media Center. Five minutes after he left the infield
facility, there was the crash on Turn 3.
</P>
<P>
   Petty was asked if the track is flawed. The incidents have
happened in the same area, a turn that is believed to be the
fastest point of the 1.058-mile oval. Petty, the man known as The
King of racing, said the layout is fine. No driver here submitted a
rant against the track and its owner, but Wallace did suggest that
a barrier be placed on Turn 3's walls. There would be something to
absorb the car in the event of a crash.
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a crash. That is, these drivers expect that
crashes will happen. They accept this hazard. They accept it the
same way boxers accept that if they are knocked unconscious enough
times, their motor skills may never be the same. They accept it the
way football players accept the hits, knowing that men such as
Darryl Stingley have been paralyzed playing the sport. Drivers
accept the quirks of their job, just as you accept yours and I
accept mine. It is what we all do, even if people outside of our
circles don't completely understand our love of our (often
eccentric) jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing prepares you for this,'' Ricky Craven said Friday.
``It's easy to take for granted. You have a passion for what you
do. You beat yourself up because you didn't qualify by a few
seconds, and the reality is this . . . qualifying is quite
insignificant right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Craven, a 34-year-old driver, tried to explain why he does what
he does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in intensive care twice (because of racing injuries)
and said to myself, `I don't care if I ever race again,' '' he
said. ``And within two or three days, both times, when the pain
started to go away and you begin the recovery process, you have
this form of amnesia. You forget how bad it was and you just get
hungry again. You get competitive. You get real eager.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even understand it,'' he said. ``I can't explain
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin was a spokesperson for BellSouth. He spoke on
disaster prevention. ``Prevention is the key to surviving any
disaster,'' he said May 18. He was talking about the dangers of
hurricanes, not the dangers of his job.

U.S., CANADA MOVE TOWARD SHOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMITOS, Calif. _ The sport happens to be water polo, but
when the United States and Canada get together it isn't the sport
that matters most, it's the rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's Canada and the U.S. it always a big competition,''
said Johanne Begin, the Canadian's leading scorer during the first
four days of the Holiday Cup at the U.S. Aquatics Center in Los
Alamitos. ``Whether it's basketball, water polo or any other
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   If that is indeed true, then Sunday's championship game of the
Holiday Cup will be a big competition as it appears the two nations
could be playing each other for the title.
</P>
<P>
   Canada edged closer to the championship game by holding off
Australia, 6-5, in the first game on Friday. The Canadians (3-1-0)
will advance to the final with at least a tie against Russia in
today's final session of round-robin play at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. assured its spot in the title contest on Sunday at 7
p.m. by whipping winless Kazakhstan, 13-2, before 1,000 in the
nightcap on Friday behind five goals by Ellen Estes, three from
Rachel Scott and another steady game in goal by Gahr High product
Nicolle Payne. The Americans, who are the tournament's lone
unbeaten team after four games, close round-robin play at 5:30 p.m.
today against defending world champion Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the second time in the tournament that the Canada and
the U.S. have renewed a rivalry that began long before any of these
players jumped into the pool. The U.S. trailed for much of the
first meeting but stormed back for a 12-9 victory over the
Canadians on the opening day of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``On that given day, they were a better team than us,'' Canadian
coach Daniel Berthelette said. ``But, in this tournament, it's one
game at a time. It's not do or die (during round robin play). It
will be a new day.''
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian loss on Friday would have pretty much secured a spot
in the final for the Australians. And, according to Begin, beating
the Australians hasn't always been easy for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was mainly mental,'' said Begin, who added that a
victory over the Australians earlier this year got Canada past the
mental block. ``We always had a problem with them for some
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   Begin, who has eight goals in the tournament and six in the past
two games, scored both Canadian goals in the fourth period,
including the winner with 55 seconds left, of the tense game that
never featured a lead bigger than a goal. Australia nearly tied the
score with 28 seconds left but Naomi Castle's crisp shot bounced
off the bar.
</P>
<P>
   There was no drama in the U.S. win as Estes scored three times
in the first period to help the Americans built a 4-1 lead that
grew to 7-2 at halftime. Estes, who only had one goal in the first
three games, added goals in the second and fourth periods to give
her five from the game.
</P>
<P>
   The American offense, which scored 46 times in four games, was
its usual spectacular self as six players scored goals, including
Coralie Simmons, whose two goals gave her tournament best 11 after
four games. Also scoring were Catherine Von Schwarz, Julie Swail
and Courtney Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game, the U.S. was sharp on the 6-on-5 situation,
converting on 4 of 7 in the first half. In the second half,
however, they converted only 2 of 7 attempts.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. also has shown strength in goal with the combination of
Payne and Bernice Orwig. Payne, who was in goal during an earlier
victory over Australia, had six saves in the win over Kazakhstan
and helped hold Kazakhstan to 2 of 9 on the player-advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Netherlands 11, Russia 9: Netherlands (2-2-0) led for most of
the way but it took a tally by Gillian van der Berg with 29 seconds
left to ice the win over Russia (1-3-0).

RODRIGUEZ KNOCKED OUT IN LOSS TO DODGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For five minutes Friday night, the citizens of Seattle
got a taste of life without Alex Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   They stood there, 45,206 strong at Safeco Field, silent,
unnerved by the scene before them _ the last of the Mariners'
superstars prone on his back in the infield, motionless.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez eventually got up, first to a seated position, then to
his feet and the waiting arms of two trainers. He was knocked
unconscious while attempting to break up a fifth-inning double
play. Taken to a nearby hospital as a precaution, the All-Star
shortstop and free-agent prize apparently suffered a concussion
from a knee to the head.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah, the Mariners lost to the Los Angeles Dodgers 3-2 in 11
innings in a game that was as compelling as Rodriguez's injury was
frightening. Eric Karros settled it with a one-out homer, his 25th,
over the fence in right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody be sure and tell Rodriguez who won.
</P>
<P>
   With runs scarce in the interleague matchup, the golden one
tried to keep a rally going. Rodriguez slid in hard and was hurt in
a collision _ ironically, with Alex Cora, the younger brother of
his former Seattle infield mate, Joey Cora.
</P>
<P>
   While the Dodgers infielder writhed on the ground, Rodriguez lay
still. Trainer Rick Griffin moved Rodriguez's gold necklace off the
player's face. Another trainer ran off the field and returned with
two ominous-looking medical bags, one black, the other orange.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Edgar Martinez, whose bases-loaded grounder
started the sequence of events, squatted behind his fallen
teammate. Mariners manager Lou Piniella stood behind Martinez, arms
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd applauded as Cora climbed to his feet, but there was
nothing from Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Rodriguez stirred, almost automatically snapping into a
seated position. He was out five minutes, out before he hit the
ground. He looked around groggily, answered a few questions, then
was escorted from the field, fists clenched. He rubbed an eye
before disappearing into the clubhouse. Forty-five thousand sighs
of relief could be heard in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez might have regained his feet, but his team never did
against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   In Freddy Garcia's long-awaited return, the Mariners spotted Los
Angeles two runs in the first, got one back in the fifth and
squandered late opportunity after late opportunity. Seattle left
the bases loaded in the eighth, two runners on in the ninth and a
runner on third in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   History also was made. In the fifth Ricky Henderson walked. It
was the 2,020th free pass of his career, breaking a tie with Ted
Williams for second all-time. Henderson needs 42 more to catch the
leader, Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Back from a broken leg and a two-month absence, Garcia looked
strong but not sharp. He lasted six innings, walking five and
striking out six. He allowed two runs, on a two-out, bases-loaded
double by Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley. He gave up just four hits.
</P>
<P>
   Against junk-throwing lefty Carlos Perez, the Mariners had
runners on base in every inning. However, they didn't score until
the fifth, when Rodriguez walked with the bases full and one out.
He only had four pitches to savor the at-bat before Martinez
started the fateful play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners tied the game 2-2 in the eighth, when Carlos
Guillen drew a two-out, bases-loaded walk. The inning was extended
when Los Angeles third baseman Adrian Beltre booted a grounder by
the previous batter, pinch-hitter Raul Ibanez.
</P>
<P>
   Karros' game-winning homer broke up up a Seattle no-hitter _ at
least from the third inning on. He made reliever Arthur Rhodes pay
for a grooved 3-2 pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Adding further irony to the evening, Rodriguez's agent, Scott
Boras, was in attendance. Hours before game time, he entertained
reporters asking for updates on Rodriguez, who might become the
most sought-after free agent in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, whose availability for Tuesday's All-Star Game is
unknown, has maintained he won't consider his future until the
season is concluded, but has said a winning team is paramount to
his decision.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, to maintain that bargaining power, he needs
to stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Boras talked about his player's value on the market, breaking it
down four ways: 1) his premium position (shortstop, center fielder,
catcher or pitcher); 2) his slugging talent (40 homers or more); 3)
his leadership traits; and 4) his icon status (ability to draw fans
and attract other players to a market).
</P>
<P>
   ``Most players can never offer that to a franchise,'' Boras
said.
</P>
<P>
   It all flashed before his eyes Friday night.

KARROS' HOMER IN 11TH BEATS MARINERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE - One hit after the third inning, and just five in the
game. Eleven batters strike out. A solid effort by the starting
pitcher wasted.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, a victory for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros' home run to center in the 11th inning gave Los
Angeles a 3-2 victory Friday night in its first game at Safeco
Field in front of a sellout crowd of 45,206.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (44-40), who won their third in a row and National
League-leading 25th road game, managed just four hits through 10
innings before Karros sent Arthur Rhodes' 3-2 offering deep to
center.
</P>
<P>
   The shot made a winner out of Matt Herges (6-0), who pitched two
shutout innings of no-hit, three-walk, four-strikeout ball.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Fetters pitched the 11th for his third save, but it wasn't
easy. He gave up a single to Mark McLemore and walked John Mabry
before inducing John Olerud to ground to first which sent the tying
and winning runs in scoring position. Fetters ended it by striking
out Jay Buhner.
</P>
<P>
   The victory took 4 hours, 27 minutes, eight minutes short of the
team's longest game of the season, May 22 against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes (2-3) struck out three in two innings and gave up just
the one hit.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Dodgers' offense was mostly invisible Friday, the
pressure fell to the pitching, and starter Carlos Perez again threw
well.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers left-hander hasn't won since May 20, he
gave up one run in 6 innings, but the Mariners scored two runs on
bases-loaded walks to keep him out of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Perez had about the worst season possible last year, going 2-10
with a 7.43 ERA and making everyone wonder why he was earning
$5,333,333 this season.
</P>
<P>
   But then came this year. He started 3-1 and led 7-3 in his May 9
start against Arizona but earned no decision when the Diamondbacks
rallied and won in 12 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he's 1-3 with seven no-decisions, but look at some
of those outings: two runs in 6 innings against Philadelphia, one
earned run in seven innings against Oakland and Friday's effort. A
lack of run support hasn't helped.
</P>
<P>
   He also had a couple of five-run outings, too, but then came his
two relief stints, in which he gave up one earned run in 8 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got just five hits, but that was enough.
</P>
<P>
   Leading 2-0 into the fifth inning and never retiring the side in
order, Perez ran into trouble when he loaded the bases (that
included issuing Rickey Henderson's 2,020th career walk, moving him
into second place all-time). Then he walked Alex Rodriguez to force
in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez grounded to short, and Alex Cora turned a 6-3
double play to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   However, when Cora forced Rodriguez at second, he tried to leap
over the Mariners star. Instead, Rodriguez's head hit Cora's knee
and upper thigh. Rodriguez's neck snapped back and both players
fell to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Cora got up after a few minutes and remained in the game.
Rodriguez wasn't so lucky, however. It took several minutes for him
to get up, and he appeared disoriented. He was preliminarily
diagnosed with a concussion and went to a local hospital as a
precaution. Rodriguez's status for Tuesday's All-Star Game could be
up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, meanwhile, went about his business and stopped another
Seattmoqally with Todd Hollandsworth's help.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud led off the sixth with a double. One out later, David
Bell singled to center, and Hollandsworth threw out Olerud at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   When Perez gave up a single to Carlos Guillen to lead off the
seventh and then got Henderson to fly to right, he was gone in
favor of Terry Adams, who retired the side.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle tied it in the eighth, starting with two singles off
Adams. Adams struck out Bell for the second out, but Adrian Beltre
bobbled pinch-hitter Raul Ibanez's grounder to load the bases.
Adams then walked Guillen to force in the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Adams retired the side by getting Henderson to ground to short.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took a 2-0 lead in the first inning on Hundley's
two-run double off Freddy Garcia, who came off the disabled list
before the game, having recovered from a fractured tibia. It was
his first start since April 22.
</P>
<P>
   Hollandsworth had walked with one out and Sheffield had singled.
One out later, Hundley pulled a Garcia pitch down the right-field
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers wasted a scoring chance in the third inning.
Hollandsworth and Sheffield opened with singles, Hollandsworth
taking third. Shawn Green struck out and Karros grounded before
Beltre was intentionally walked. But Garcia got Dave Hansen to
ground to third.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia gave up four hits, none after the third inning, and the
two runs were earned in six innings with five walks and six
strikeouts.

   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ The last time I had set foot in the Beirut
airport, exactly 15 years before, a hijacked Trans World Airlines
jet sat on the runway. A U.S. Navy diver had been murdered and
thrown from the plane, and 39 Americans would be held hostage for
17 days before being freed in Damascus, Syria.
</P>
<P>
   In the filthy shambles of the terminal, pistol-waving hijackers
wearing hoods made from airline pillowcases held a news conference
that turned into a near riot when television cameramen climbed on
the table that the hijackers had carefully laid out with Lebanese
dishes. The windows in the control tower were still shattered from
the time a few years earlier when they were shot out by the man
known as ``Hamzi the Hijacker,'' who was working on his ninth
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The airport was convenient for hijackers in those days. When
they were done, all they had to do was to cross the tarmac to go
home, melting into into the surrounding Shiite Muslim shantytowns.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when I returned in the early summer of 2000, the terminal
was new and clean, partly lined with gleaming tile. An efficient
line processed visas, where once a grimy customs inspector
whispered to me, ``Be careful, my friend, you are in the Orient
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, instead of the chaos I used to know, was an orderly
taxi line with a no-haggling fixed price. A smooth new highway,
swooping through tunnels and overpasses, had replaced the old
rutted road studded with militia checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   We drove past gleaming new high-rises and glittery restaurants
to the Phoenecia, a huge and gaudy palace right on the Green Line,
the no-man's land that once divided the city. The hotel district
was one of the first and fiercest battlegrounds of the civil war
that made a Lebanon a synonym for brutal anarchy in the 1970s and
'80s, and next door the battered, shell-holed hulk of the Holiday
Inn still loomed.
</P>
<P>
   Just to travel across the city back then was to risk your life.
Snipers were dug into the broken buildings on each side: as the war
wound on they became skilled, hitting people in the head more
often.
</P>
<P>
   Christian right and Muslim left were the working cliches for the
journalists, but the reality was much more complex. Christians
killed each other to eliminate rivals, and alliances shifted
bloodily on the Muslim side. Even a traffic accident could set off
a gun battle that quickly spread through a wide area and lasted for
hours. All the militias had their own jails. Piles of rotting
garbage, occasionally set afire, lined the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Lebanese hunkered down through artillery barrages,
power outages and water shortages, siege and invasion, somehow
maintaining the extravagant style that is their endearing hallmark.
There are no real statistics here, but it is generally estimated
that 150,000 people died and 17,000 are still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The morning after I arrived I walked around the streets I used
to know. There were no gunmen and no garbage. A McDonald's stood at
the corner where the Associated Press correspondent Terry Anderson
was kidnapped in 1985; it had valet parking for the Range Rovers.
It was eerie at first to walk on the streets where 15 years before
you could not go, in the city center that had been the heart of the
Green Line, where I once met a gunmen who been in position so long
he had planted a garden.
</P>
<P>
   The old buildings, Ottoman and French Colonial, have now been
meticulously restored into one of the most gorgeous downtowns
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   What happened, I wondered. Could these people have all suddenly
come to their senses?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately not.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you see, it's all a facade, a fake veneer,'' grumbled a
veteran Lebanese journalist, launching into an hourlong tirade
against government corruption and inefficiency, an economic crisis
spinning out of control and Syrian domination _ after, of course,
making sure that his name would not be used.
</P>
<P>
   The new highway and the luxury hotels skirt and conceal the
slums and squatters in much of the city. Even in the flashy stores
on Rue Verdon _ Gucci, Versace, Valentino _ business is down. The
rebuilding was almost entirely the single-minded effort of Rafik
Hariri, prime minister from 1992 to 1998; his enemies are now in
power and cutting off his permits.

 BEIRUT: his permits.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over and over, old friends and new acquaintances, using phrases
like ``rotten'' and ``crooked,'' told me that, fundamentally,
nothing has changed in Lebanon; that politics and economics remain,
as one put it, ``parasitical, feudal and entirely rapacious.''
</P>
<P>
   But of course some things have changed in the decade since the
war ended. By 1990, the paroxysm of violence that had torn Lebanon
since the mid-1970s had turned on itself, so badly that many
Lebanese were desperate to restore an ordinary sense of business
and life. So they welcomed the calm that Syrian control brought
them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, most visibly, the presence of armed militias in which
gunmen ruled has been ended, and that is no small thing. (They are
officially disarmed, except for Hezbollah in the South, although
much of the weaponry is just hidden away.) The remaining
Palestinians are disenfranchised, confined to their camps. The
ability of the Maronite Catholic elite to either dominate the
country or to establish an autonomous entity has been ended.
Perhaps most important for the future is the rise of the Shiite
Muslim movement Hezbollah, or Party of God, to power and
respectability. Politically, Syria calls all the shots now.
</P>
<P>
   But what has not changed is the strict division along religious
lines that defines _ and essentially undermines _ Lebanon as a
country.
</P>
<P>
   When modern Lebanon was formed in 1943 out of a French mandate
granted after World War I, power was apportioned by religion,
mainly to protect the Maronites; they were to hold the presidency,
with other offices apportioned to Sunni Moslems, Shites, Druse and
13 smaller sects.
</P>
<P>
   And that has always been the paradox of Lebanon: What has
enabled its people to survive and even prosper through unbelievably
difficult times, like the civil war, are the tight bonds of family,
village, clan and religion. But the same narrow loyalties prevent a
national social contract.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters for the small band of foreign journalists
throughout those war years was the shabby, beloved Commodore Hotel,
presided over by its suave, impeccably-dressed manager, Fouad
Saleh, who could accomplish anything. The parrot at the bar
imitated incoming shellfire, Fat Tommy the cat slept wedged in the
warmth between the Associated Press and Reuters news wires, and the
telexes, magically, always worked. Guests checking in were asked,
``Shelling side or sniper side?''
</P>
<P>
   One night during the Israeli siege of Beirut in 1982, a
desperately needed truckload of bottled water materialized, bribed
through Israeli lines near the airport. ``You see, we are really
all Levantine together,'' smiled the man from the Democratic Front
for the Liberation of Palestine next to me at the bar.
</P>
<P>
   But in the final five years of the war, when erstwhile allies
turned on each other in a frenzy _ Shiites against Palestinians,
Hezbollah against its Shiite rival Amal, Christians against
Christians, the Lebanese army against Christians _ the Commodore
was destroyed in street fighting between the Druze and a Sunni
militia, the Murabitoun. A Druse gunman carried off the parrot to
an unknown fate.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Commodore has been rebuilt as a fancy Meridien, with a
Benihana Japanese steakhouse. Just off the lobby is a place called
the ``News Bar,'' with a carpet embroidered to imitate newspaper
front pages. When I looked in the other day, it was empty.
</P>
<P>
   Fouad Saleh died a few years back, I was told, and, because of
his mixed marriage, neither the Muslim nor the Christian cemetery
would accept his body. Fouad, the ultimate fixer, had been beaten
at last by Lebanon.

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-FAILURE (Washington) _ A crucial test in the Pentagon's
program to defend the United States from missile attacks collapsed
in failure because the high-speed interceptor that was supposed to
destroy a dummy warhead in space never separated from its booster
rocket, the Pentagon said. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   MISSILE-ASSESS (Moscow) _ With the failure of the Pentagon's
anti-missile test, the Clinton administration has reaped all of the
diplomatic disadvantages of its program to build a national missile
defense and none of the potential rewards. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-VOICES (Tel Aviv, Israel) _ Everyone in Israel, the West
Bank and Gaza is a prisoner of what President Clinton labeled the
``abject dreariness of the pursuit.'' Everyone cares and almost
everyone is afraid to care too much, fearful of having their hopes
dashed or their fears realized. In a day of interviews throughout
Israel and the West Bank, it was only the Jewish settlers, and even
those in settlements unlikely to be uprooted, who were treating the
coming summit as a potentially pivotal event. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-PRICES (Langata Rongai, Kenya) _ Two competing forces have
intensified the international battle over prescription drugs: the
1994 world treaty on intellectual property that underpins free
trade and the AIDS epidemic, which is devastating whole continents
too poor to pay the going rate for patented drugs. The public
health advocates and an increasing number of Third World countries
say the 1994 treaty allows them to manufacture or import much
cheaper generic drugs to avert national disaster; the drug
companies argue that the costs of developing drugs are so high that
they cannot afford to lower the prices of the few that become
wildly successful. A special report. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-ADMIN-SCHOOL (Strasbourg, France) _ For more than four
decades, France's National School of Administration, dedicated to
shaping top students for a life in government, has done just that.
It has not been easy to get into this state-subsidized finishing
school for the elite, known here as ENA. The exams are legendary in
their difficulty. The odds of success have sometimes been as high
as 200 to 1. But not today. In an undeniable sign of all that is
changing in France, the number of applicants to the school has
dropped 30 percent in the last four years alone. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-PUTIN (Moscow) _ President Vladimir Putin assembled both
houses of parliament and a national television audience Saturday to
present his assessment of the state of the nation. In a word, it
was forbidding. By Michael Wines.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-U.S. (Beijing) _ A visiting U.S. official praised China
for becoming ``a major participant'' in nonproliferation efforts in
Asia and around the world but said two days of talks did not allay
concerns about Chinese help for Pakistan's anti-ballistic missile
program. Allegations of such aid to Pakistan have complicated
passage by the Senate of normal trade status for China. By Erik
Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-AIDS-EDUC (Durban, South Africa) ``My boyfriend just
wants sex,'' ``The Naked Truth,'' and ``Oral sex.'' ``Talk about
it.'' These and similar messages have sprung up in recent months on
billboards in South Africa as part of a campaign to encourage young
people to talk freely about sex and the risks of teen-age
pregnancy, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. The erotic
and hard-hitting phrases are part of a funky campaign aimed at
reducing by one-half the rate of infection from HIV, the AIDS
virus, in South Africa in five years. The 4.2 million HIV-infected
people in South Africa is the largest in the world. By Lawrence K.
Altman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   RACE-COPS-DRUGS (New York) _ For Harlem narcotics detectives,
race colors everything. It lies just beneath the surface in an
argument over tactics between a white sergeant and a black
undercover detective. Race is out there in the neighborhood where
African-American informers are pitted against Dominican drug
dealers. Race is in the police radio descriptions (``suspect is a
dark-skinned Dominican, mid-20s ...''), and race amplifies the
anger on the street when the police drive up and arrest yet another
dark-skinned man. In 1998, the killing of a black man, Amadou
Diallo, by four panicky white policemen touched every Harlem
narcotics officer to the core. And yet they do not discuss it. Cops
do not discuss race. It's too risky. They need to get along. By
Michael Winerip.
</P>
<P>
   (Eds: An abridged version of this story,
RACE-COPS-DRUGS-ABRIDGED, is also being filed.)

   With photos.
</P>
<P>
   GENETICALLY-ALTERED-GRASS (Marysville, Ohio) _ Standing in long
rows in Greenhouse No. 3, part of the Scotts Co.'s research
laboratory here, are pots of grass that could be a suburbanite's
dream come true. The grass, which Scotts hopes will eventually
carpet every lawn and golf course around the world, is genetically
altered to withstand applications of the most potent weed killers
and remain shiny, green and healthy, creating fields of unblemished
green. The company is also working on genetically modified roses
and other flowers that will bloom longer than the ones found in
nature. Critics are horrified. By David Barboza.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-BOLINAS (Bolinas, Calif.) _ Long known for its
live-and-let-live attitude, this spirited community of surfers,
poets, artists, writers and aging mavericks about 30 miles up the
coast from San Francisco has reached a tipping point of sorts.
Perhaps nowhere is the Bay Area's relentless collision between
hippie-van and BMW culture becoming more pronounced than in this
preternaturally beautiful place, where earthy hand-built houses

   ALCOHOLICS-MODERATION (Seattle) _ After she founded a self-help
program called Moderation Management seven years ago, Audrey
Kishline became a national spokeswoman for the notion that problem
drinkers could be taught to cut back without abstaining altogether.
Having recently pleaded guilty to two counts of vehicular homicide
after a binge drinking episode last March, Kishline said through
her lawyer that she has a new message: Moderation Management ``is
nothing but alcoholics covering up their problem.'' By Sam Howe

   POTTER-FRENZY (New York) _ Very early Saturday morning,
8-year-old Gabriel Back-Gael was standing guard over the door of

stretched a line of hundreds of children and parents, all awaiting
their first chance to buy ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,''
the fourth book in the wildly popular series about the exploits of
Harry Potter, the boy wizard. To many it was a historic occasion _
some even brought cameras to record the purchase. By David D.

   BUSH-JUSTICES (Austin, Texas) _ In recent weeks, particularly
after the U.S. Supreme Court's 5-4 ruling that the government may
not prohibit doctors from performing a procedure that opponents
call partial-birth abortion, the issue of judicial appointments has
percolated into the presidential race. Vice President Al Gore has
warned that George W. Bush, if elected, would appoint conservative
Supreme Court justices hostile to abortion rights. But a look at
Bush's record in Texas shows that he has appointed justices who
have been a moderating influence on the Texas Supreme Court, often
regarded as among the most conservative and pro-business in the
country. By Jim Yardley.

<P>
   For two years, thousands of bodies packed in white plastic bags
have been awaiting burial in central Bosnia, in a limbo that could
stand as a symbol of the uncertain fate of Bosnia itself _ and much
else in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand of the bags sat for most of those two years in two
tunnels behind the municipal morgue in Tuzla. Rats were allowed to
feast on bodies, according to aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   After a year and a half of planning, the bodies from the tunnels
and other makeshift morgues _ there are 4,700 bags in all that
contain either bodies or body parts _ were finally moved to a newly
built warehouse in April. Now a seven-year, $10 million project is
under way to come up with an exact total of bodies and and identify
the remains, but it needs more money.
</P>
<P>
   The bags contain bodies collected over the last five years from
mass graves and forests around the town of Srebrenica in eastern
Bosnia. That was the site of the worst single atrocity of the
Bosnian war, a series of ambushes and mass executions carried out
by Bosnian Serb soldiers that left 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Finding, unearthing and storing the bodies has proved a tortuous
process that exemplifies the problems that have slowed peace
efforts in Bosnia _ corrupt local officials, a limited
international commitment and internecine political battles. And
where to bury the corpses has now become one more thorny issue for
the international mission in Bosnia to grapple with as it tries to
reconstruct a divided country without fully governing it.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the bodies is that they are keys to how history
will be told. And all sides in the skirmishes that still haunt the
former Yugoslavia understand how important controlling history is
when it comes to controlling power.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, relatives of the missing have been campaigning
to finally begin building a memorial and interring the bodies in
individual graves in a field in the village of Potocari, near
Srebrenica, on this Tuesday, the fifth anniversary of the killings.
They want local Serbs to have to drive by tombstones every day _
row after row of tombstones. Only then, they say, will Serbs be
forced to reckon with the blood on their soldiers' hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs must accept that this genocide happened,'' said
Hasan Nuhanovic, a survivor whose mother, father and brother are
among the missing. ``This grandiose memorial should be a
reminder,'' he said by telephone. ``If they can't accept that, I
don't see how we can live with them again.''
</P>
<P>
   Local Serb leaders, not surprisingly, have a counter-offer: to
bury the corpses on a hillside farther from view. Serb war veterans
go even farther, flatly denying that any killings took place and
warning of violence at a ceremony Muslim survivors plan to hold on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The unresolved fate of the bodies also points to the conflicted
nature of the Western mission in Bosnia. On one hand, war crimes
investigators try to exhume as many bodies and prosecute as many
war crimes suspects as possible. On the other, Western diplomats
and U.S. military officials try to avoid creating situations that
could prompt violence and American casualties.
</P>
<P>
   In that uncertain atmosphere, the bodies have become part of a
broader propaganda battle, being waged across the former
Yugoslavia, Europe and the United States. Aided by the Internet, a
revisionist interpretation of the war has begun to radiate out from
Belgrade, Yugoslavia; some American and European leftists, who a
year ago took exception to NATO's bombing of Kosovo, are now
backing Serb nationalist claims that Western governments and
journalists exaggerated Serb war crimes not only in Kosovo but in
Bosnia as well.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Srebrenica, the slow pace of efforts to recover
and count bodies has created an opening for denials of what
occurred five years ago. After Bosnian Muslims turned their heavy
weapons over to U.N. peacekeepers in exchange for having Srebrenica
declared a protected ``safe area'' in 1993, Dutch peacekeepers and
U.N. commanders did little to protect the town when Bosnian Serb
forces attacked in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7,000 men were reported missing to the International
Red Cross after the fall of the town. But because of a lack of
money, bureaucratic delays and a huge Serb effort to hide bodies by
moving and reburying them, only half of the known graves around the
town have yet been exhumed. To date, 1,866 bodies have been
recovered from mass graves, according to tribunal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty remaining mass graves, believed to hold as many as 2,000
bodies, are to be exhumed by the end of 2001. But tribunal
investigators fear that intermittent funding could dry up again and
that a historic opportunity will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats agree that long-term reconciliation in Bosnia
hinges on an acceptance by average people that nationalists
committed crimes in their name, followed by a rejection of the
nationalists. They point to elections last spring that showed small
gains by moderates as a sign of progress. But they warn that
forcing Serbs to accept memorials now will not work, and could
increase support for nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep the issue alive but not expect that people
will admit to it immediately,'' said Alexandra Stiglmeyer,
spokesman for the international mission in Bosnia. ``Germans were
ready to admit to the crimes only when the Eichman trial began in
the sixties. In the fifties, people were denying it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stiglmeyer said the international community was committed to
building a memorial in Srebrenica, but the fifth anniversary was
not the time. Emotions are running high, she said, and nationalists
on both sides may look to provoke violence that could aid them in
national elections in November.
</P>
<P>
   Nuhanovic scoffed at that explanation and said immediately
building a memorial with ``thousands of graves shining in the sun''
is the only way to ensure that Serbs, the world and future
generations face what happened in Srebrenica.
</P>
<P>
   He said the latest promises from international officials echo
past assurances _ promises that led to 7,000 people going missing,
Serb nationalists flatly denying the killings, and rats being
allowed to gnaw on the corpses of men the world had vowed to
protect.

   One Thing Made Him Sweat
</P>
<P>
   When Queen Elizabeth II knighted Sean Connery in his hometown,
Edinburgh, Scotland, the actor called the occasion ``one of the
proudest days of my life.'' Shame on him. Didn't Connery know that
for James Bond, the legendary superspy he portrayed in seven
movies, the prospect of a knighthood was as horrifying as that of a
vodka martini stirred, not shaken?
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Man With the Golden Gun'' (1965), the last James Bond
novel written by the character's creator, Ian Fleming, Bond is
recommended for a knighthood _ specifically, the Knight Commander
of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG) _ but declines the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never been a public figure,'' Fleming wrote, ``and he
did not wish to become one. He had no prejudice against letters
after one's name, or before it. But there was one thing above all
he treasured. His privacy. His anonymity. To become a public
person, a person, in the snobbish world of England, of any country,
who would be called upon to open things, lay foundation stones,
make after-dinner speeches, brought the sweat to his armpits.''
</P>
<P>
   So in a telegram to M., the head of the British Secret Service,
Bond writes, ``EYE AM A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE WILL ALWAYS FEEL
AT HOME BEING A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE KNOW COMMA SIR COMMA THAT
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MY PREFERENCE AND THAT EYE CAN COUNT ON YOUR
INDULGENCE.''
</P>
<P>
   007, being a Scottish spy, also had a Scottish reason for
spurning a knighthood. In a sentence that he ultimately strikes
from his telegram, Bond says: ``MY PRINCIPAL REASON IS THAT EYE
DONT WANT TO PAY MORE AT HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, presumably, has helped make Connery so wealthy that he no
longer has to worry about such things.
</P>

   Quidditch, Anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, J.K. Rowling, a struggling single mother in
Edinburgh, completed a children's novel, written mostly in coffee
shops. Today ``Harry Potter'' is the biggest publishing phenomenon
in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' and two sequels, all
about an orphaned boy with wizard powers, have sold nearly 21
million copies. The fourth book _ ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire'' _ is being published with the kind of hoopla reserved for
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published Saturday, when a record first printing of
3.8 million copies went on sale in the United States. Scholastic
Inc., released the book at 12:01 a.m., and bookstores around the
nation gave midnight ``Harry Potter'' parties, with clerks dressed
as wizards and witches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been excited about this for months,'' said Barbara
Theroux, owner of the Fact and Fiction Bookstore in Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinary secrecy with which the book was
published, newspapers report that several lucky children in
Virginia received early copies. An 8-year-old girl in Fairfax got
one from a clerk who apparently didn't realize the book was
embargoed, and a Richmond Wal-Mart store mistakenly sold 20 copies
before the book was pulled from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of Scholastic and Warner Brothers, which owns the
movie rights, Rowling has promised three more ``Harry Potter''
books before the series concludes.

this week to try to end a half-century of conflict. Administration
officials cautioned that success was not guaranteed.
</P>

   In a week marked by missteps and contradictory messages, the

cartel.
</P>
<P>
   First Saudi Arabia, the world's largest petroleum producer,
announced it would increase output by 500,000 barrels a day to
drive down high oil prices, and crude futures fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Then, other OPEC members said the Saudis had been misunderstood,
and a production increase was not imminent. Crude prices rose
again. The Saudis have since stayed quiet, and gas prices, not
surprisingly, continued to climb in most of the United States.

<P>
   The truck bomb attacks, which occurred on Sunday night, took
place in towns and cities supposedly under Russian control.

   Two Apples for Gore

American Federation of Teachers in Philadelphia, then flew to
Chicago to address the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers are part of a large labor coalition backing Gore
candidacy, and have been energized by his staunch opposition to
vouchers, which would allow public money to be used for
private-school tuition. His opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, supports
them.

of St. Michael and St. George (KCMG) _ but declines the honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had never been a public figure,'' Fleming wrote, ``and he
did not wish to become one. He had no prejudice against letters
after one's name, or before it. But there was one thing above all
he treasured. His privacy. His anonymity. To become a public
person, a person, in the snobbish world of England, of any country,
who would be called upon to open things, lay foundation stones,
make after-dinner speeches, brought the sweat to his armpits.''
</P>
<P>
   So in a telegram to M., the head of the British Secret Service,
Bond writes, ``EYE AM A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE WILL ALWAYS FEEL
AT HOME BEING A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE KNOW COMMA SIR COMMA THAT
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MY PREFERENCE AND THAT EYE CAN COUNT ON YOUR
INDULGENCE.''
</P>
<P>
   007, being a Scottish spy, also had a Scottish reason for
spurning a knighthood. In a sentence that he ultimately strikes
from his telegram, Bond says: ``MY PRINCIPAL REASON IS THAT EYE
DONT WANT TO PAY MORE AT HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, presumably, has helped make Connery so wealthy that he no
longer has to worry about such things.

   Quidditch, Anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, J.K. Rowling, a struggling single mother in
Edinburgh, completed a children's novel, written mostly in coffee
shops. Today ``Harry Potter'' is the biggest publishing phenomenon
in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' and two sequels, all
about an orphaned boy with wizard powers, have sold nearly 21
million copies. The fourth book _ ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of
Fire'' _ is being published with the kind of hoopla reserved for
the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The book was published Saturday, when a record first printing of
3.8 million copies went on sale in the United States. Scholastic
Inc., released the book at 12:01 a.m., and bookstores around the
nation gave midnight ``Harry Potter'' parties, with clerks dressed
as wizards and witches.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been excited about this for months,'' said Barbara
Theroux, owner of the Fact and Fiction Bookstore in Missoula, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the extraordinary secrecy with which the book was
published, newspapers report that several lucky children in
Virginia received early copies. An 8-year-old girl in Fairfax got
one from a clerk who apparently didn't realize the book was
embargoed, and a Richmond Wal-Mart store mistakenly sold 20 copies
before the book was pulled from the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of Scholastic and Warner Brothers, which owns the
movie rights, Rowling has promised three more ``Harry Potter''
books before the series concludes.

   Camp Clinton Opens For the Summer
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has invited Israel's prime minister, Ehud
Barak, and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, to Camp David
this week to try to end a half-century of conflict. Administration
officials cautioned that success was not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   News of the summit was greeted with skepticism among Palestinian
leaders, while two political parties announced they would pull out
of Barak's coalition government, leaving him with just 59 of the
120 seats in parliament.

   Cartel Comedy
</P>
<P>
   In a week marked by missteps and contradictory messages, the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries seemed more like the
Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight than an immensely powerful global
cartel.
</P>
<P>
   First Saudi Arabia, the world's largest petroleum producer,
announced it would increase output by 500,000 barrels a day to
drive down high oil prices, and crude futures fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
   Then, other OPEC members said the Saudis had been misunderstood,
and a production increase was not imminent. Crude prices rose
again. The Saudis have since stayed quiet, and gas prices, not
surprisingly, continued to climb in most of the United States.

   Just one week after a Russian general proclaimed the war in
Chechnya all but won, a series of bombings killed at least 33
Russian troops in the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
   The truck bomb attacks, which occurred on Sunday night, took

President Vladimir Putin promised to curtail the role in Chechnya

   Two Apples for Gore

   As expected, Vice President Al Gore received overwhelming
endorsements from the two national teachers unions and enormous
ovations when he visited their conventions. Gore spoke first to the
American Federation of Teachers in Philadelphia, then flew to
Chicago to address the National Education Association.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers are part of a large labor coalition backing Gore
candidacy, and have been energized by his staunch opposition to
vouchers, which would allow public money to be used for
private-school tuition. His opponent, Gov. George W. Bush, supports
them.

dealers. Race is in the police radio descriptions (``suspect is a
dark-skinned Dominican, mid-20s . . .''), and race amplifies the
anger on the street when the police drive up and arrest yet another
dark-skinned man. In 1998, the killing of a black man, Amadou
Diallo, by four panicky white policemen touched every Harlem
narcotics officer to the core. And yet they do not discuss it. Cops
do not discuss race. It's too risky. They need to get along. By

   MEXICO CITY _ On the night that Vicente Fox wrested control of
the Mexican presidency from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the jubilant victor rushed out to celebrate with throngs of
supporters who had gathered at the monument of the Angel of
Independence in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of miles away in a rural village in the eastern state
of Veracruz, a small group of potato farmers gathered around a
black-and-white television set to watch grainy images of the
celebration. Sometimes it was hard for them to hear Fox above the
chants from the crowd around him. But what the crowd had to say
came through loud and clear. ``Vicente no nos falles,'' the
televised crowd blared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente, don't fail us.''
</P>
<P>
   The words stirred the farmers in Veracruz, and they picked up
the chant. That simple plea, said one farmer, summed up the deep
sense of betrayal people have long felt toward their government and
their desperation for change. But there was also an edgy challenge
in the plea.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans will no longer hand over their votes and expect little
in return, the farmers said. And what they most expect from Fox are
programs and reforms that will help the nation's new democracy
expand beyond elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of their greatest expectation, however, some
voters do not quite realize that the new president's powers have
also been radically reshaped _ in some ways weakened _ by some of
the same currents that carried him to victory. He is not part of
the one-party apparatus that for 71 years monopolized power in
Mexico but so often failed its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Fox has made a lot of promises to the people, that he
would move the country forward,'' said Alvaro Gonzalez Arenas, 24.
``We have put our faith in him; faith that we are finally going to
be free of corruption and that we will be able to live with
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first step in the development of a democracy _ free
and fair elections _ was accomplished here last Sunday in contests
that displayed an extraordinary level of civility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy, as shown from Central America to the former
Soviet Union, requires more than fair elections. Those in power
must prove able to work in cooperation with their opponents. In
Fox's case, only then can he take on Mexico's urgent tasks:
creating a credible justice system that protects civilians from
crime and corruption, and anti-poverty programs to lift the poor;
and opening education and employment opportunities to the best and
the brightest, rather than the best and most well-connected. Such
goals are extraordinarily complex, of course, and have been set
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have felt so betrayed by promises from candidates that
were never intended to be fulfilled and they not only stopped
believing in the government, but they stopped believing in
themselves,'' said Julio Faesler, a congressman and member of Fox's
National Action Party. ``It took a great leap of faith, and a lot
of internal courage for people to trust in something other than the
PRI. And living up to that confidence will not be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing that he plans to work hard to fulfill his campaign
promises, Fox has barely taken a moment to rest since his victory.
But when he assumes power on Dec. 1, some analysts say he will be
in a weaker position than his PRI predecessors. He will not have
the support of the vast PRI machinery _ its political bosses, its
labor union and farmers' cooperative leaders and the directors of
the wealthiest social welfare programs. These were an important
part of the muscle that could support, and often impose, the will
of a PRI president.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ On the night that Vicente Fox wrested control of
the Mexican presidency from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the jubilant victor rushed out to celebrate with throngs of
supporters who had gathered at the monument of the Angel of
Independence in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of miles away in a rural village in the eastern state
of Veracruz, a small group of potato farmers gathered around a
black-and-white television set to watch grainy images of the
celebration. Sometimes it was hard for them to hear Fox above the
chants from the crowd around him. But what the crowd had to say
came through loud and clear. ``Vicente no nos falles,'' the
televised crowd blared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicente, don't fail us.''
</P>
<P>
   The words stirred the farmers in Veracruz, and they picked up
the chant. That simple plea, said one farmer, summed up the deep
sense of betrayal people have long felt toward their government and
their desperation for change. But there was also an edgy challenge
in the plea.
</P>
<P>
   Mexicans will no longer hand over their votes and expect little
in return, the farmers said. And what they most expect from Fox are
programs and reforms that will help the nation's new democracy
expand beyond elections.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment of their greatest expectation, however, some
voters do not quite realize that the new president's powers have
also been radically reshaped _ in some ways weakened _ by some of
the same currents that carried him to victory. He is not part of
the one-party apparatus that for 71 years monopolized power in
Mexico but so often failed its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Fox has made a lot of promises to the people, that he
would move the country forward,'' said Alvaro Gonzalez Arenas, 24.
``We have put our faith in him; faith that we are finally going to
be free of corruption and that we will be able to live with
dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the first step in the development of a democracy _ free
and fair elections _ was accomplished here last Sunday in contests
that displayed an extraordinary level of civility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   But democracy, as shown from Central America to the former
Soviet Union, requires more than fair elections. Those in power
must prove able to work in cooperation with their opponents. In
Fox's case, only then can he take on Mexico's urgent tasks:
creating a credible justice system that protects civilians from
crime and corruption, and anti-poverty programs to lift the poor;
and opening education and employment opportunities to the best and
the brightest, rather than the best and most well-connected. Such
goals are extraordinarily complex, of course, and have been set
before.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have felt so betrayed by promises from candidates that
were never intended to be fulfilled and they not only stopped
believing in the government, but they stopped believing in
themselves,'' said Julio Faesler, a congressman and member of Fox's
National Action Party. ``It took a great leap of faith, and a lot
of internal courage for people to trust in something other than the
PRI. And living up to that confidence will not be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing that he plans to work hard to fulfill his campaign
promises, Fox has barely taken a moment to rest since his victory.
But when he assumes power on Dec. 1, some analysts say he will be
in a weaker position than his PRI predecessors. He will not have
the support of the vast PRI machinery _ its political bosses, its
labor union and farmers' cooperative leaders and the directors of
the wealthiest social welfare programs. These were an important
part of the muscle that could support, and often impose, the will
of a PRI president.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And, unlike all PRI presidents until the midterm elections in
1997, Fox will not be able to count on enough votes in Congress to
override his opposition. He will have to reach for support across
party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to be a statesman and a mobilizer and an organizer of
the Mexican people,'' said Roberto Mangabeira Unger, an expert on
Latin American politics and a professor of law at Harvard
University. ``If he fails to do that, he will allow the powerful
organized interests to strike back at him, and to limit the margin
of innovation for his government, and to create the stage on which
a new opposition to his government can arise.''
</P>
<P>
   During his campaign, Fox was brash and prone to hurling insults,
and he paid a price: he could not establish partnerships with
logical allies, particularly the left-wing Democratic Revolutionary
Party.
</P>
<P>
   But Mangabeira said those are mostly ``superficial weaknesses,''
because Fox was elected president by a decisive margin in the midst
of a national feeling of rebirth. The challenge will be whether he
can turn the enthusiasm into bold political practice.
</P>
<P>
   One political analyst, Federico Estevez of the Autonomous
Technological Institute of Mexico, said Fox is uniquely well suited
for the challenges ahead _ primarily because he is much more a
pragmatist than an ideologue. For example, he is a devout Catholic
who has said he personally opposes abortion but has also said he
would consider signing legislation to legalize the procedure if he
thought it reflected the will of most Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the president-elect could not win over all of
the Mexican left, he was able to lure several strategists from the
main leftist party to his campaign. In choosing his cabinet, Fox
plans to enlist international headhunting firms, and he has
promised to make his government one that reflects the range of
Mexico's political parties and regions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Fox, who once managed the sale of Coca-Cola across
Latin America, has used his marketing experience to promote his
image and ideas. ``He is a magnificent salesman,'' Estevez said.
``And on top of that, he knows how to inspire people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox has already signaled that he may use the first months of his
administration to push for approval of some of his most
controversial proposals. Last week, he announced plans to rebuild
the nation's federal law enforcement system. And he said he would
travel to the United States to press for a less restricted flow of
Mexican workers across the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``He announces his plans ahead of time,'' said Estevez,
``something that shows he's already treating the public to the kind
of transparent agenda they expect of him, and one that they would
have never gotten before under the PRI.''
</P>
<P>
   Even one of Fox's closest campaign advisers worried, though,
about whether public expectations had been set too high. ``Feelings
of optimism are volatile,'' Adolfo Aguilar Zinser wrote in a column
in the newspaper Reforma. ``If they do not turn into concrete
efforts, they turn bitter and dissipate.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to accomplish our goals,'' he added, ``it will be
necessary to transform our political culture, to respect plurality
and to build, among ourselves, bridges and more bridges.''

<P>
   When the U.S. Supreme Court decided on June 28 that the Boy
Scouts could bar gay members, it agreed that opposition to
homosexuality was part of the organization's ``expressive
message.'' This message, the argument went, was right there in the
Scout Oath and Law, the guiding principles that generations of boys
have had to know by heart and regularly recite, raising their arms
in that familiar three-fingered salute and promising to be (among
many other things) ``clean'' and ``morally straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissenting justices in the 5-4 ruling were perplexed. ``It
is plain as the light of day that neither one of these principles,
`morally straight' and `clean,' says the slightest thing about
homosexuality,'' wrote Justice John Paul Stevens. ``Indeed, neither
term in the Boy Scouts' law and oath expresses any position
whatsoever on sexual matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone looking for an explicit condemnation of homosexuality by
the Boy Scouts has little to go on. The statement posted on the Boy
Scouts' Web site after their court victory was a model of tactful
restraint:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe an avowed homosexual is not a role model for the
values espoused in the Scout Oath and Law. Boy Scouting makes no
effort to discover the sexual orientation of any person. Scouting's
message is compromised when prospective leaders present themselves
as role models inconsistent with Boy Scouting's understanding of
the Scout Oath and Law. Scouting's record of inclusion is
impressive by any standard. However, we do ask all of our members
to do their best to live the Scout Oath and Law.''
</P>
<P>
   For slightly more stem-winding, plain-spoken views on scouting's
mission and message _ and on moral issues, sexual and otherwise _
the justices might have turned to an earlier source: the first Boy
Scout manual, published in 1910 by Ernest Thompson Seton, a
founding father of the Boy Scouts. Seton, an author and self-styled
naturalist, created the Woodcraft Indians, a precursor of the Boy
Scouts, and became the country's first chief scout.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Boy Scouts of America'' says not a word about
homosexuality, it has plenty of other things to say about primal
urges and manly passions.

   &UR; Degeneracy &LR;  is the word. To combat the system that has turned
such a large proportion of our robust, manly, self-reliant boyhood
into a lot of flat-chested cigarette smokers, with shaky nerves and
doubtful vitality, I began the Woodcraft movement in America.
Without saying as much, it aimed to counteract the evils attendant
on arena baseball, football, and racing, by substituting the
better, cleaner, saner pursuits of Woodcraft and Scouting.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Getting together with the guys and some
brews and watching the game? Not very manly, in Seton's view. (END

   The personal interest in athletics has been largely superseded
by an interest in spectacular games, which, unfortunately, tend to
divide the nation into two groups _ the few overworked champions in
the arena, and the great crowd, content to do nothing but sit on
the benches and look on, while indulging their tastes for tobacco
and alcohol.

   What is a camp without a camp-fire? _ no camp at all, but a
chilly place in a landscape where some people happen to have some
things. ...

<P>
   Not in the steam radiator can we find the spell; not in the
water coil; not even in the gas-log: they do not reach the heart.
Only the ancient sacred fire of wood has power to touch and thrill
the chords of primitive remembrance.
</P>
<P>
   When men sit together at the campfire, they seem to shed all
modern form and poise, and hark back to the primitive _ to meet as
man and man _ to show the naked soul. Your camp-fire partner wins
your love, or hate, mostly your love; and having camped in peace
together, is a lasting bond of union, however wide your worlds may
be apart.
</P>
<P>
   The campfire, then, is the focal center of all primitive
brotherhood. We shall not fail to use its magic powers.

   The boy from 10 to 15, like the savage, is purely physical in
his ideals. I do not know that I ever met a boy that would not
rather be John L. Sullivan than Darwin or Tolstoy. Therefore, I
accept the fact, and seek to keep in view an ideal that is
physical, but also clean, manly, heroic, already familiar, and
leading with certainty to higher things.
</P>

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Higher things, yes, but there should be

</P>
<P>
   The clubroom must not be made cosey like a lady's boudoir, as
the boys must be able to romp in it occasionally, or play handball,
or ``Bang the bear,'' etc. So you want furniture that will pack
away into a corner, such as folding wooden chairs, small tables and
a cupboard in which to put away books, games, etc., when the romp
comes on.

   In this handbook I have touched upon many important items of a
boy's education, but there is scarcely one more important than that
of continence. The prudish mystery with which we have come to veil
this important question among the youth of both sexes is doing
incalculable harm. The very secrecy with which we withhold all
knowledge from the boy prompts him the more to take his own line
equally secretly, and, therefore, injuriously.
</P>
<P>
   I have never known a boy who was not the better for having the
matter put to him frankly and fully. For an instructor to let his
boys walk on this exceedingly thin ice without giving them a
warning word, owing to some prudish sentimentality, would be little
short of a crime.

members, grapples much more directly with the issue of sexuality,

<P>
   The young man who holds before his mental vision an ideal of the
home he hopes to establish _ in which a pure wife reigns as queen,
sovereign of his life, and gently governs her brood of lusty boys
and fair girls _ cannot for a moment consider as a sane solution of
his sexual problem periodic visits to a lewd girl or woman, nor can
he expect to develop his powers physically or intellectually, if he
permits himself to contract that habit (masturbation) which, step
by step, undermines his virility. There is open to the young man
only one of these three alternatives, i.e., ``to lead the continent
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The continent life is a goal which every healthy young man
should strive to reach. ... The compensations of continence are
those that come from the assurance that the young man has of his
virility, of his worthiness to take the hand of a pure wife in
wedlock, and from the consciousness of his ability to establish and
maintain a home, and to protect this home against all dangers.

life.''
</P>
<P>
   The continent life is a goal which every healthy young man
should strive to reach. ... The compensations of continence are
those that come from the assurance that the young man has of his
virility, of his worthiness to take the hand of a pure wife in
wedlock, and from the consciousness of his ability to establish and
maintain a home, and to protect this home against all dangers.

<P>
   Though ``The Perfect Storm'' is just now swamping theaters near
you, a still more awesome, irresistible, force of nature threatens
movie audiences not just this summer, but every summer. With
monsoon-like predictability, the fierce winds, towering waves and
torrential rains of movie hype roll in from California every year
at about this time.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since those legendary days, a long, long time ago in a
galaxy far, far away, when ``Jaws'' and ``Star Wars'' showed the
film industry a bold, new way to persuade kids to see films over
and over again during the summer, hype has become its own industry.
Those colossal promotional campaigns that studios create to sell
their films include the repetitive cover stories in glossy
magazines, newspaper and television coverage (including the E!
cable channel, the last letter in hype) and blanket advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Studios usually spend one and a half times the production budget
of a movie on publicity, and with the average summer picture
costing close $70,000,000, that's real money.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1975, the year in which ``Jaws'' ate the box office, the
number of summer releases has grown enormously, and the studios
have had to become more savvy about luring moviegoers into the
theaters. Today, hype can even be subtle, for hype. This usually
occurs toward the end of the summer, as it did with last year's
``The Sixth Sense.'' The trailers for that spare tale didn't give
away the surprise ending, and ``I see dead people'' became part of
the cultural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blair Witch Project,'' which cost under $50,000 to make,
was hustled via a constantly evolving Internet campaign. Artisan,
the releasing studio, ingeniously saw that the Web could be used to
speak directly to an audience that is resistant to standard forms
of hype. Instead, they employed what could only be called e-hype,
and spent a ton doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, however, subtlety is something summer moviegoers have to
do without. Relief, such as it is, generally comes from the
opposite direction, when a movie reaches such a peak of awfulness
as to become the Bummer of the Summer. It's the picture for which
the hype is so incessant that you feel beaten into attending. These
are the films that almost everybody goes to and no one seems to
like. The stench of stale air conditioning lends itself to the
depression that settles in as the picture starts. Play some of
these titles over in your mind as a kind of refresher course:
``Star Wars Episode One: The Phantom Menace''; ``Batman'';
``Armageddon''; ``Batman Forever''; ``Mission Impossible'';
``Lethal Weapons 2-4''; ``Batman and Robin''; ``Con Air''; ``The
Wild, Wild West.'' Perhaps that dull ache at the temples you felt
sitting through these films is now returning _ a final gift from
``Twister.''
</P>
<P>
   The observant can spot the telltale signs, the subtle warnings
of a high level of movie awfulness: constant, incomprehensible
action in the trailers; actors in independent films appearing in
movies whose latte budgets probably exceed the entire budget of,
say, ``Rushmore''; anything ``based upon'' a comic book character;
magazine articles entirely about a movie's ``dazzling'' special
effects.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, something special comes along, something like
``Battlefield Earth,'' a picture that extends the boundaries of the
horrible in such significant fashion that the title should be added
to the synonyms for bad in the Oxford English Dictionary. Such
cathartic experiences, movies that bring the few members of the
audiences together, are, however, few and far between.
</P>
<P>
   The other contender for the Bummer title this summer, though
admittedly coming in a poor second to ``Battlefield Earth,'' is
``Mission: Impossible 2,'' which continues the tradition
established by the first one, a movie that still has people
scratching their heads in puzzlement. ``Gone in 60 Seconds'' is
vying for the title, too, and there are those who may even place
``Perfect Storm,'' with its emphasis on the world's deadliest water
park special effects in lieu of characterization, in this category.
</P>
<P>
   This summer may be the first in three years in which attendance
and box office figures started out a little down from the previous
year. Then the five-day Fourth of July weekend came along with a
slate of movies including ``Perfect Storm'' and ``Patriot,'' which
made the summer of 2000 competitive with previous years.
</P>
<P>
   So the hype is with us and working its magic, and the nation is
where it should be, in its seats, feet sticking to soda spilled on
the floor, looking up at Hollywood's big, bright vision of the
world. There is something reassuring about it all _ finding cool
refuge in the dog days, watching the bad movies the hucksters have
been ballyhooing for months.

<P>
   In this era when the consumer is king, many Americans are
displaying noblesse oblige toward the millions of foreign workers
who make the goods that flood store shelves. High school students
have demonstrated at Disney's Mickey-filled emporiums over the
company's use of low-wage factories in China and Haiti. Nuns
concerned about child labor have distributed leaflets outside Gap
stores. At Duke and Georgetown, students have staged sit-ins to
protest conditions at factories producing apparel carrying their
college logos. And everyone seems to beat up on Nike.
</P>
<P>
   For years, these anti-sweatshop protests accomplished next to
nothing. Many manufacturers responded by simply saying they did not
control the overseas factories that they contracted with. Some
embarrassed designers adopted codes of conduct, which were often
ignored abroad. Before monitors visited, factory owners hid their
under-aged workers and ordered employees to say they worked 40-hour
weeks, not the more typical 75 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But as the anti-sweatshop movement continues to grow _ and grow
louder _ manufacturers have recently taken steps that just might
improve working conditions around the world. Companies see that
many consumers want to know that their clothing was not made under
Dickensian conditions. So for the first time, industry giants have
joined an ambitious effort, the Fair Labor Association, that has
adopted a code and called for large-scale overseas monitoring that
begins this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, Reebok, Liz Claiborne, Philips Van Heusen and other
manufacturers have joined the association, a White House-backed
program that promises to inspect hundreds of factories yearly.
Currently only a factory or two is monitored each month. The
association's leaders say this latest effort, well financed and
international, should make a difference. Monitors, ranging from
accounting firms to union-friendly Jesuit advocates, will visit
factories to check that there is no child labor, that managers do
not sexually harass workers and that no one works more than 60
hours a week.
</P>
<P>
   The days of companies adopting a see-no-evil stance are over,
said Sam Brown, executive director of the association, which
includes several consumer and human rights groups. ``This effort
says for the first time, `You must know, you have to know about
conditions in every single factory, and you have to bear
responsibility,''' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   The association's plans call for monitoring 30 percent of its
members' 4,000 factories over the next three years, with 5 to 10
percent of each company's factories being monitored each subsequent
year. Some critics say the percentage is too small to uncover every
problem, but association members say monitoring, and requiring that
complaints about conditions be investigated, will greatly help.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics say the association and other monitoring efforts
will do little to improve the lives of Third World workers. They
fear that corporations may hide the monitors' findings from the
public, and that the accounting firms doing the monitoring will not
dig hard enough to find problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Fair Labor Association is just window-dressing,''
said Charles Kernaghan, director of the National Labor Committee, a
labor rights group. ``You don't have full disclosure of what's
found, and it doesn't require that factories pay a living wage. And
it allows companies to produce in China, a country that prohibits
independent trade unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other monitoring efforts have sprouted because some groups think
the association is too lenient toward manufacturers while others
believe it is too harsh. Social Accountability International, an
offshoot of the nonprofit Council on Economic Priorities, has
persuaded Toys ``R'' Us, Avon Products and Eddie Bauer to push
their manufacturers to comply with minimum labor standards
developed by a group of companies, unions and nongovernment
organizations. Students from 56 universities including Brown and
Cornell recently formed the Workers Rights Consortium to work with
nongovernment organizations overseas to review conditions at
factories making T-shirts and other apparel carrying college logos.
</P>
<P>
   And the industry's main trade group, the American Apparel
Manufacturers Association, has also adopted a code of conduct.
Stung by criticisms, Nike, the Gap and others have hired their own
monitors, and many critics say these companies have improved labor
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the programs have achieved critical mass yet,'' said
Elliot Schrage, a Columbia University Business School professor who
advises companies on how to improve factory conditions, ``but the
principle that the conditions under which products are made is a
legitimate concern for consumers is now well established.''
</P>
<P>
   The word sweatshop has long been used to describe factories with
low wages and deplorable conditions, but whether a particular
factory is a sweatshop is often in the eye of the beholder. An
American or European may quickly conclude that a Chinese or
Vietnamese factory paying workers $2 a day is a sweatshop. But the
young women working there often say they earn far more than at
other local factories or in the farm villages they left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is to make sure these young people, mostly women
a long way from home, are not abused,'' Brown said. ``Even if the
situation is better than where they were, that doesn't mean there
shouldn't be minimal standards of decency on how you treat
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest apparel union, the Union of Needletrades,
Industrial and Textile Employees, argues that free trade has
encouraged American companies to move factories to countries with
the lowest wages and worst conditions. Hoping to slow this exodus
and help foreign workers, the union wants the World Trade
Organization to allow trade sanctions against countries that
perpetuate sweatshops by not enforcing their laws on minimum wage
and overtime. But the WTO has rejected such proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Monitoring, Brown said, is the best alternative for improving
factory conditions. ``It is the way to think about how you make
free trade into fair trade,'' he said. ``It's a way to ensure that
the goods are produced under conditions that don't shock the
conscience.''

<P>
   Short of dinner theater or being cast in a musical about tooth
decay, there are few terrors that hold more sway over theater folk
than the curse of ``Macbeth.'' Legend has it that the hex dates
from the first production in 1606, when the actor playing Lady
Macbeth died backstage, cursing the play.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, various productions of ``Macbeth'' have been waylaid
by death and disaster. Over the years, the myth has gained such
authority that many actors are loath to utter even the name of the
play, preferring instead to call it ``the Scottish play,'' or
occasionally ``the Scottish play about the guy who wants to be king
so bad he knocks off some other dudes and then watches his wife go
totally bonkers.'' Others refer to it merely as ``the Scottish play
I've never read.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the hex claimed yet another victim when the Broadway
production of ``Macbeth'' starring Kelsey Grammer of the hit
television series ``Frasier'' folded after only 13 performances.
That gave it the shortest run since the 1998 comedy ``More to
Love,'' a four-performance wonder that featured an actress in the
role of an electrical fuse. Just a day after Grammer's reviews came
out, the jinx struck the British actor Antony Sher, who was
starring in a production of the play in New Haven, Conn. He walked
offstage at the end of Act I but did not return. A throat infection
kept him out for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the ``Macbeth'' curse is hardly the only superstition
hanging over the black-magic-laden world of the theater, a
profession in which open incantations of blood lust (``Break a
leg!'') are routine.
</P>
<P>
   The list of taboos is long: never whistle in the dressing room,
never open an umbrella onstage and never, never be cast as an
electrical fuse. So treacherous are these potential psychic land
mines that, in the name of public service, the following is a brief
rundown of some current and ancient omens plaguing the stage:
</P>
<P>
   Cats: According to ``A Brief Dictionary of American
Superstitions,'' by Vergilius Ferm (Philosophical Library, 1959),
it bodes ill if a cat walks across a stage during rehearsal. The
exception, of course, is if you invested in the musical ``Cats,''
Broadway's longest-running musical. In which case, bring on the
kitties.
</P>
<P>
   Chorus girls: If a chorus girl dances on spilled powder before a
performance, it can inspire good fortune. Or a bout of wheezing.
</P>
<P>
   Costumes: It is considered very bad luck to change costumes if
your first performance was a success. It is considered very bad
taste to never change it.
</P>
<P>
   Curtains: According to Ferm, yellow curtains are said to bring
bad luck to a new play. No reason is given, except for the obvious
garishness, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Death: A death in the audience is considered bad luck for the
production. It's particularly unfortunate for the poor theatergoer.
</P>
<P>
   Disney: Considered very good luck for investors; produced ``The
Lion King,'' a sellout for nearly three years; ``Aida,'' Broadway's
second-highest-grossing musical; and ``Beauty and the Beast,''
which is in its seventh year on Broadway. You do the math.
</P>
<P>
   Flowers: Artificial flowers are preferred over the real thing in
the theater, except by actresses, who have divorced men for less.
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsy Robe: One of Broadway's oldest traditions: a chorus
member from the last musical to open passes along a robe to the
most recently opened musical. Each cast embroiders a memento on it
before the robe goes to the next production. When all the space is
used up, a new one is begun and the old robe is retired to the
Museum of the City of New York; the chorus members, meanwhile,
retire to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Horror Movies: ``Carrie: The Musical'' (1988) is widely
considered one of the greatest flops in Broadway history. The play
was a stunning display of both bad taste _ a big dance number
centered around a pig slaughter _ and money ($7 million, all lost).
Its director was Terry Hands, whose most recent credit was
``Macbeth,'' with Grammer.
</P>
<P>
   Knitting: Engaging in this handicraft onstage is taboo,
especially during any big dance scene.
</P>
<P>
   Peepholes: Once considered acceptable on Broadway, where actors
could sneak peeks at the audience. Accidentally banned in 1998 as
part of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's anti-sex campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Sales: According to the superstitions of theater managers, if
the first purchaser of tickets is young, the run will be short. If
the buyer is elderly, it means a long run. By this logic, and the
demographics of Broadway today, every show on Broadway would be a
hit.
</P>
<P>
   Talent Agents Having an agent is considered good luck. Not
having one is considered bad luck. Lately, being Grammer's agent is
considered particularly bad luck.

<P>
   Short of dinner theater or being cast in a musical about tooth
decay, there are few terrors that hold more sway over theater folk
than the curse of ``Macbeth.'' Legend has it that the hex dates
from the first production in 1606, when the actor playing Lady
Macbeth died backstage, cursing the play.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, various productions of ``Macbeth'' have been waylaid
by death and disaster. Over the years, the myth has gained such
authority that many actors are loath to utter even the name of the
play, preferring instead to call it ``the Scottish play,'' or
occasionally ``the Scottish play about the guy who wants to be king
so bad he knocks off some other dudes and then watches his wife go
totally bonkers.'' Others refer to it merely as ``the Scottish play
I've never read.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the hex claimed yet another victim when the Broadway
production of ``Macbeth'' starring Kelsey Grammer of the hit
television series ``Frasier'' folded after only 13 performances.
That gave it the shortest run since the 1998 comedy ``More to
Love,'' a four-performance wonder that featured an actress in the
role of an electrical fuse. Just a day after Grammer's reviews came
out, the jinx struck the British actor Antony Sher, who was
starring in a production of the play in New Haven, Conn. He walked
offstage at the end of Act I but did not return. A throat infection
kept him out for several days.
</P>
<P>

hanging over the black-magic-laden world of the theater, a
profession in which open incantations of blood lust (``Break a
leg!'') are routine.

HIGHWAY PATROL CRACKS DOWN ON ILLEGALLY TINTED CAR WINDOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By ROBERT MONROE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The number of fines for illegally tinted windows
has jumped 28 percent in the first five months of 2000 across the
Los Angeles region, following a new rule that forbids ``fix-it''
tickets for the violation, according to the California Highway
Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the enforcement of the law ordered by the state
courts means police no longer have the discretion to let drivers
remove tint from their front windows to avoid a fine of at least
$77.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the new, tough enforcement is that the state
Judicial Council believes motorists who tint front windows and
windshields purposely violated the law and should be fined.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, police say they present a hazard to officers trying
to see inside cars during stops and to drivers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unsafe,'' said CHP Commissioner Spike Helmick. ``It
reduces visibility. You don't know if it's a 19-year-old driving
with perfect eyes or a 90-year-old man.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Highway Patrol's Southern Division, which
stretches from the Antelope Valley to the South Bay, has issued
3,079 citations from January to May of this year. It had issued
2,410 in the same period last year. About 300 fewer fix-it tickets
have been issued this year compared with the same period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners of cars with tinted windows say the mandatory fine
is a heavy-handed money grab. Others say leniency should be granted
to some looking for a way to beat the California heat - unless
they're blatantly flouting the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's dark to a point where you can't see, they should
definitely get a ticket,'' said Marian Khachukian, a Burbank
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Window-tinting businesses said they favor the change because it
will cut into the business of unscrupulous competitors willing to
place illegal tint in cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of shops that don't follow the laws,'' said
Chris Sugai, owner of Solar Art in the San Fernando Valley
community of Canoga Park.
</P>
<P>
   Helmick said he does not expect the total number of tickets,
whether fix-its or finable, to rise. He acknowledged, though, that
officers in the past have more often considered it a correctable
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Helmick is also among those taking a dim view of the rule his
own agency began following May 15. He said he is in the midst of
drafting a letter to the Judicial Council asking the panel to
reconsider. He believes there is a difference between good-faith
mistakes and blatant law-flouting that warrants different
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the officers should have the discretion,'' Helmick
said. ``We don't make the laws, but there is a wide variance.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Don Lehman of the Los Angeles Police Department's Valley
Traffic Division said officers usually focus their efforts more on
drivers guilty of moving violations than on offenses such as tinted
windows. Although he said he did not know enough about the effect
of the change, he added that helping officers see into cars is
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would assist in having the tint off, and maybe in paying
the fine, (violators) wouldn't put the tint back on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the state Judicial Council ordered the change after
determining that tinted windows were not only a safety hazard, but
did not count as an automotive problem caused by unavoidable wear
and tear, said spokeswoman Lynn Holton. Correctable tickets are
usually issued for such defects as burned-out lights or
nonfunctioning gauges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of intentionally altering the vehicle,'' Holton
said. ``They found that (tinting) goes beyond the wear-and-tear
test.''

GROUPS ORGANIZE TO GET DOGS OUT OF POUNDS, OUT OF L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 &HT;    By JASON KANDEL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the North Central Animal Shelter, dog No. 30821
was hours away from being euthanized, but she was one of the few
lucky ones.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuers got to her first.
</P>
<P>
   The California Rescue Railroad, an Internet-based adoption
agency for unwanted pets, took the 5-year-old Dalmatian out of Cage
16 at the North Central Animal Shelter in the eastern Los Angeles
neighborhood of Lincoln Heights, where she had been held for more
than a month.
</P>
<P>
   The euthanization date had been set, but Gail McKenzie came to
the rescue just in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many dogs who are killed even before they get a
chance to be adopted,'' said McKenzie, 41, the woman from the
upscale Brentwood neighborhood who runs the underground railroad
for pets facing euthanasia.
</P>
<P>
   Saving No. 30821, now named Beauty, proved difficult and her
future still isn't certain. She bit a child in her first foster
home near Modesto and now lives with a family in Sacramento while
McKenzie searches for a permanent owner.
</P>
<P>
   Relentless searches don't come easy for McKenzie, who typically
saves Dalmatians, but often rescues other breeds. Fortunately, she
gets a little help from the Internet. Her e-mail lists contain 150
names of people who carve out whole weekends to drive dogs out of
L.A. shelters to homes up and down the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The dog she saved last month could have been just one of the
tens of thousands of dogs that are euthanized every year. Of the
73,032 dogs brought into the six animal shelters across the city
from July 1998 to July 1999, 51,637 were killed and 11,998 were
adopted, according to the latest department records.
</P>
<P>
   Shelters are brimming with strays. There are only 386 kennels in
six shelters across the city. Officials estimate that 1,533 more
kennels are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The California Rescue Railroad is one of dozens of groups that
have stepped up efforts in the weeks since the general manager of
the city's Animal Services Department proposed an aggressive sweep
of strays during the Democratic National Convention. The L.A.
rescue movement _ with hundreds of Internet sites and scores of
volunteers who will give up just about anything for a little pooch
_ also highlights the unceasing conflict between animal rights and
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are the animal rights people concerned about sweeps of
dogs and not about the sweeps of the homeless during the DNC?''
asked David Grunwald, the chief executive officer of the L.A.
Family Housing Corp., a nonprofit that provides services for the
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Though the city has no plans for clearing the streets, police
and business owners have made overt suggestions for homeless people
to move along, to the dismay of Grunwald. ``Very simply put, human
rights are more important than animal rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But animal activists don't see it that way. They believe that as
a result of the sweeps, more dogs will have to be killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at my own Dalmatian, who I love so very much, and know
that there are thousands of wonderful dogs just like her dying in
Los Angeles shelters every month,'' McKenzie said. Since her work
began in January, her group is responsible for saving more than 30
dogs. But it's not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You rescue one Dal and the next time you go into the shelter,
two more have taken her place,'' she said. ``The ones we save seem
like a drop in the bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern California rescue movement has gained so much
attention that even people from as far away as Washington state are
helping out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're always desperate in California,'' said Britt Trisler
of Seattle. ``The homes just aren't there. There are too many
breeders in California. We don't have as many breeders here in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   After bailing out Beauty, McKenzie, two other rescuers and a few
other lucky dogs met in the parking lot of a veterinary clinic in
Highland Park. The vet visit was for the other dogs, which were
spayed and neutered, and one needed antibiotics for a urinary tract
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Joining that trip were a hairy white Tibetan Lhasa apso, and two
puppies a rare lemon Dalmatian and a Chihuahua mix. Each would be
dropped off at different spots along the route at either temporary
or permanent homes. Volunteers would drive about 100 miles of a leg
each.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the caravan wound up at the home of Audra Taylor,
another volunteer in Salida, a small town north of Modesto, Calif.,
who was working with rescuer Laura Sommerville to find Beauty a
permanent one.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she came to us, she was a rack of bones,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   But it was nothing that a high-calorie diet of raw meat and
oatmeal couldn't fix. Days later, Taylor noted, ``She's starting to
put on a little weight. She's doing pretty good. She's starved for
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the good news. The bad news was that a San Jose couple
backed out of a deal to adopt Beauty for another dog closer to
their home, and an antsy Beauty had to be moved to another
temporary home in Sacramento after she bit Taylor's son.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first biting incident involving a dog that McKenzie
has saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``This can happen with any dog,'' she said. ``It's always a crap
shoot when you rescue dogs from a shelter. You just do the best you
can to evaluate the temperament while the dog is in the shelter,
but you never know how they're going to be with kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Sommerville is out about $250 from Beauty's vet bills, which
included antibiotics for a urinary tract infection. McKenzie also
put up money for the rescue _ $61 for the release that covers
vaccinations, sterilization, taxes and a follow-up vet visit.
Sometimes the new owners will reimburse rescuers, but ``we're
almost always working in the red,'' Sommerville said.
</P>
<P>
   Beauty came to the attention of McKenzie through Marsha Perloff,
a 43-year-old dog rescuer who surveys the North Central shelter
regularly for adoptable dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time, I'm worried that I'll be too late,'' Perloff
said. ``I could not get up every day and do this if I thought about
all the dogs that are no longer there. If I do, I think of them in
homes, as opposed to the other alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The department plans massive adoption outreach programs, and is
hoping voters will pass a $140 million bond measure in November
that will go toward building new kennels.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie David, the department's spokeswoman, said that without
the construction of the new kennels, ``The sad reality is that we
would then have to euthanize some adoptable animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Taylor: ``We have such a disposable society. People don't
think about the fact that this is a living creature.''

   ``Highly social species'': it sounds sweet and clever all at
once, doesn't it? And there's nothing like a spell of hot weather
to remind us of how much we have in common with chimpanzees,
dolphins and other gregarious souls. Dining al fresco on crowded
sidewalks with cell phones grafted to our ears. You scratch my
back, I'll de-flea yours. Synchronized swimming, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly we are party animals by nature, and proud of it.
Biologists believe that the complexities of social life are what
gave rise to big brains and luxurious intelligence in the first
place. Highly social species are, as a rule, the smartest and most
sophisticated species the planet has produced.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that there can be nothing stupider, nothing more
primitive and dangerous, than a crowd of people? If human sociality
has its roots in our primate past _ and it surely does _ and if the
advantages of living in a group predate the evolution of Homo
sapiens, it's worth asking whether the menacing side of a human
crowd likewise resembles group behavior among nonhuman species.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of humans behaving badly abound: a bunch of young
people get together in New York's Central Park after a parade, and
the next thing you know the men are yanking the halter tops off the
women, the women are screaming, and bystanders are watching from
the sidelines with all the dulled wit of wildebeest.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Tailhook scandal, in which scores of women
reported being assaulted by Navy and Marine Corps pilots in a Las
Vegas hotel. Remember ``whirlpooling,'' when boys in New York's
public pools would surround a girl, pull off her bathing suit top
and grope her, stirring the water into an artificial Jacuzzi so she
couldn't escape?
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the crowds at European soccer matches that erupt in
an almost predictable frenzy when their team loses _ or even when
their team wins? Just last month, basketball fans in Los Angeles
rioted after the the hometown Lakers won the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes a good crowd turn madding? And when a crowd turns
mob, is it becoming more ``natural,'' or less?
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that any discussion of similar behavior in other
animals can be misinterpreted as justification, along lines of
`they can't help it, they lose control,''' said Dr. Barbara Smuts,
a primatologist and anthropologist at the University of Michigan.
Nevertheless, pack behavior is systematically studied in the wild,
and field biologists say they have seen some rough parallels to the
actions of human mobs in their observations of other social species
_ among females as well as males.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of species, young males travel together in what are
called bachelor groups or male alliances, and those musky cliques
can be a real threat to other members of their tribe. For example,
among bottlenose dolphins, biologists have discovered that males
aggregate into multi-tiered layers of alliances, from tightknit
teams of two or three dolphins to super-alliances of 14 individuals
or more.
</P>
<P>
   Those alliances serve to spirit away fertile females from
competing gangs of males, and the males, in their efforts to co-opt
females, grow aggressive to the point of viciousness. They slap the
females with their fins, bite them, wham them with their snouts and
flip-flop around them in spectacular, synchronized dives.
</P>
<P>
   And the males don't restrict their group antics to the control
of females. Sometimes they rabble-rouse seemingly out of boredom,
or arrogance, or to show who's pasha.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard C. Connor, a marine biologist at the University of
Massachusetts, recounts a time at his research site in Shark's Bay,
Australia, when he watched two alliances of dolphins get together
for the equivalent of a day of wilding. The males moved through
their home turf and harassed every dolphin or group of dolphins
they encountered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going after females, other males, juveniles, it
didn't matter,'' he said. ``They'd mount the dolphins, or just
blast into the middle of a group to blow it apart, and then they'd
move on to harass somebody else. As far as I could tell, they were
just being surly.''
</P>
<P>
   The objects of their harassment were not strangers, but members
of the males' school: their friends, kin and neighbors. Males in
groups pose a danger to others because group cohesion is often
cemented through flamboyant displays _ of strength, of toughness,
of difference and of sameness.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of the activities that we see in male groups, instead
of explaining it purely as males being interested in trying to mate
with females, we should look at it from the perspective of males
impressing other males, and being under peer pressure and trying to
gain status in a hierarchy,'' said Dr. Frans de Waal, a
primatologist at the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among chimpanzees, he said, adult males often strut around
intimidating others, shaking branches in the air or dropping them
from trees, swinging from vines and hooting, dislodging stones and
rolling them into the river. If the chimpanzees in one community
greatly outnumber those of a neighboring tribe, the males of the
more populous group may rile each other up enough to go on a
rampage. ``The males function more or less as a unit in seeking out
both males and females from the neighboring community who are on
their own and unprotected,'' said Smuts. ``That's when the most
severe, murderous aggression can occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond being keenly aware of the strength of their numbers,
nonhuman males also take care to limit their swaggers and outbursts
to alliances that count, Young men may show off to other men they
don't know or have just met, primatologists say, but nonhuman males
mob up only with relatives, or with longtime associates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In fact, kinship groups are often the deadliest of all, and that
includes groups of females as well as males. Among African wild
dogs, for example, an alpha female and her sisters may kill the
pups of more distantly related females in the group, the better to
ensure that all females devote themselves unstintingly to the
alpha's offspring.
</P>
<P>
   As for primates, the vast majority of species live in
gynocentric societies, with the members of one matriline protecting
one another against competing members of other matrilines. Hence, a
female's worst nightmare may be not a roving band of males, but a
clan of resident, ever-Machiavellian females.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Wallen, a primatologist at Emory University who studies
rhesus monkeys, says the deadliest moments in rhesus life occur
during times of social instability, when a ruling matriline for
some reason becomes weakened by the aging or death of a few key
members, and a subordinate matriline spies its chance to rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we've had one of these overthrows, we've had multiple
deaths in a short period of time,'' he said. ``Seven or eight
females will chase one female around and around until she drops of
exhaustion, and then she's finished.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, though, the advantages of group living outweigh the
dangers. Groups can be brutal, but they also offer protection
against predators, aggressive neighbors and even sexual stalkers.
Smuts points out that the only female primates to share with women
the dubious distinction of being at risk of forced copulation _ aka
rape _ are orangutans. Female orangutans, unlike other apes and
monkeys, are solitary, traveling alone or with dependent offspring.
Should a female orangutan encounter a young male, he may well try
to force himself on her, and being bigger, he often succeeds.
Without the support of a group, she has no one to beseech, no one
who might deign, however grudgingly, to come to her aid.

   ``Highly social species'': it sounds sweet and clever all at
once, doesn't it? And there's nothing like a spell of hot weather
to remind us of how much we have in common with chimpanzees,
dolphins and other gregarious souls. Dining al fresco on crowded
sidewalks with cell phones grafted to our ears. You scratch my
back, I'll de-flea yours. Synchronized swimming, anyone?
</P>
<P>
   Clearly we are party animals by nature, and proud of it.
Biologists believe that the complexities of social life are what
gave rise to big brains and luxurious intelligence in the first
place. Highly social species are, as a rule, the smartest and most
sophisticated species the planet has produced.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it that there can be nothing stupider, nothing more
primitive and dangerous, than a crowd of people? If human sociality
has its roots in our primate past _ and it surely does _ and if the
advantages of living in a group predate the evolution of Homo
sapiens, it's worth asking whether the menacing side of a human
crowd likewise resembles group behavior among nonhuman species.
</P>
<P>
   Examples of humans behaving badly abound: a bunch of young
people get together in New York's Central Park after a parade, and
the next thing you know the men are yanking the halter tops off the
women, the women are screaming, and bystanders are watching from
the sidelines with all the dulled wit of wildebeest.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Tailhook scandal, in which scores of women
reported being assaulted by Navy and Marine Corps pilots in a Las
Vegas hotel. Remember ``whirlpooling,'' when boys in New York's
public pools would surround a girl, pull off her bathing suit top
and grope her, stirring the water into an artificial Jacuzzi so she
couldn't escape?
</P>
<P>
   Or how about the crowds at European soccer matches that erupt in
an almost predictable frenzy when their team loses _ or even when
their team wins? Just last month, basketball fans in Los Angeles
rioted after the the hometown Lakers won the NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   So what makes a good crowd turn madding? And when a crowd turns
mob, is it becoming more ``natural,'' or less?
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is that any discussion of similar behavior in other
animals can be misinterpreted as justification, along lines of
`they can't help it, they lose control,''' said Dr. Barbara Smuts,
a primatologist and anthropologist at the University of Michigan.
Nevertheless, pack behavior is systematically studied in the wild,
and field biologists say they have seen some rough parallels to the
actions of human mobs in their observations of other social species
_ among females as well as males.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of species, young males travel together in what are
called bachelor groups or male alliances, and those musky cliques
can be a real threat to other members of their tribe. For example,
among bottlenose dolphins, biologists have discovered that males
aggregate into multi-tiered layers of alliances, from tightknit

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this election season, helping the elderly pay
for their pills is a political no-brainer: Everybody's for it. The
fight is over how to do it. Republicans, not surprisingly, want
private insurers to run any prescription drug benefits plan.
Democrats, not surprisingly, want the government in control.
</P>
<P>
   But that classic liberal-conservative clash masks the real
issue: how much drugs will cost, and who will set their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps no issue touches as many lives as the cost of
medication, which is why it is consuming the political landscape
this year. Last week, Vice President Al Gore attacked drug
manufacturers, accusing them of price gouging. The week before, the
House of Representatives approved a Republican-backed plan to give
subsidies to insurance companies that offer prescription coverage,
a concept favored by the drug makers.
</P>
<P>
   The furor is justified, economists and policy-makers say. ``It's
the part of the budget that is breaking the bank,'' said Dr. David
A. Kessler, who headed the Food and Drug Administration before
becoming dean of the Yale University School of Medicine. ``Ask any
hospital administrator, ask any HMO. Prescription drug prices is
the one sector that is out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs are now the fastest-growing part of the
nation's health care bill. That is not so much because
manufacturers are raising prices for existing drugs, but because
patients are switching to newly approved medicines that cost more,
and more prescriptions are being written than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans
spent $91 billion on prescription drugs; the total is expected to
reach $243 billion in 2008. The elderly bear a disproportionate
burden: They account for 13 percent of the population but more than
a third of drug expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet any effort to bring down costs is fraught with unanswered
questions. To begin with, drug makers dance around the question of
how they set prices. The official explanation is that the cost of
medicine is justified by the high cost of research and development,
which the industry puts at $500 million per drug, a figure some say
is inflated.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, there is no one set price for drugs. Consumer
advocates often complain that Americans pay higher prices for their
prescriptions than patients anywhere else in the world. And that is
true _ if the patient pays the retail price, out of pocket. (That
is the case for nearly one-third of the elderly, who have health
insurance through Medicare but lack drug coverage.)
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, few people buy retail in this business. Most
have insurance, and their health care providers typically negotiate
discounts with the drug manufacturers. The size of these discounts,
however, is a well-kept secret. The drug makers would like to keep
it that way, which is one reason they are working hard to defeat
any legislation that would put Medicare in charge of running a
benefits plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are totally paranoid about price controls, but I think
the thing that scares them more than anything is public disclosure
of what people actually pay for prescriptions,'' said Dr. Bruce C.
Vladeck, a former administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare. ``They go to enormous lengths
not just to keep that information confidential, but to actually
obscure it.''
</P>
<P>
   A government-run drug benefit plan would change that. If private
insurers offered drug benefits, the pharmaceutical industry could
continue to negotiate behind closed doors. But Medicare would
publish what it pays for drugs, and the private sector would
undoubtedly demand similar discounts. And with every senior citizen
in the nation enrolled in the same Medicare drug plan, the
government's bargaining clout would increase exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is the big gorilla,'' said Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, a
health care economist at Princeton University. ``But there is
another fear: If you go to bed with a gorilla, and the gorilla
shifts, you get squashed.''
</P>
<P>
   The shifting gorilla, of course, is Congress; the drug industry
fears lawmakers will agree to pay for a Medicare prescription drugs
benefit now, in times of surplus, and then cut back on
reimbursements when money grows scarce.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what has happened with the 35-year-old
Medicare program itself. In its early years, said Dr. Drew Altman,
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicare became ``the
largest single cash cow for doctors and hospitals around the
country.'' But amid concerns over rising health care costs in the
1990s, Medicare lowered reimbursements, and now health providers
are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, including Altman, argue that even with the
cutbacks, doctors are better off with Medicare than without it.
Reinhardt calculates the same would be true of the drug makers: A
Medicare benefits plan might bring lower prices, he says, but the
industry would make up the difference in volume.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, disagrees. The drug industry consistently
ranks as the most profitable on the list of Fortune 500 companies.
Yet Holmer warns that lower prices would ``put biomedical
innovation at risk'' by cutting into profits that the drug makers
need to plow back into research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry could be profoundly different,'' said Holmer,
whose two children have cystic fibrosis and have benefited from new
treatments for that disease, he said. ``One of the most frightening
things is that if we were to proceed down that path, we would never
really know which cure we were denied.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Holmer's industry is a victim of its own success.
``We have the best medical armamentarium in the world,'' said
Kessler. ``But what good is it if people can't afford it?''
</P>
<P>
   Because other countries have drug price controls, the
pharmaceutical industry earns most of its profits, and conducts
most of its basic research, in the United States. ``We Americans
fund the bulk of the research for the rest of the world,''
Reinhardt said, ``so everyone else can mooch.''
</P>
<P>
   And because prices are higher here, Americans use their
prescription drugs sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, drugs have become an essential part of American medical
care. ``I have some patients that are choosing between food and
travel to see their children or grandchildren'' or taking pills,
said Dr. Diane E. Meier, a geriatrician at Mount Sinai Medical
Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts are doubtful that Congress will move on drug prices
this year. While the House Republican bill calls for private
insurers to offer drug benefits, the insurers themselves are
against it; they say that even with government subsidies, the plans
would be too costly to offer. At the same time, Republicans and
Democrats may not be able to bridge their ideological gap. In the
meantime, says Vladeck, the industry will continue to draw its line
in the sand. ``The United States is their safety valve in terms of
profits,'' he said. ``I think that adds intensity to their feelings
about this. They are running out of places where they can charge
whatever they want.''

   The furor is justified, economists and policy-makers say. ``It's
the part of the budget that is breaking the bank,'' said Dr. David
A. Kessler, who headed the Food and Drug Administration before
becoming dean of the Yale University School of Medicine. ``Ask any
hospital administrator, ask any HMO. Prescription drug prices is
the one sector that is out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs are now the fastest-growing part of the
nation's health care bill. That is not so much because
manufacturers are raising prices for existing drugs, but because
patients are switching to newly approved medicines that cost more,
and more prescriptions are being written than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Americans
spent $91 billion on prescription drugs; the total is expected to
reach $243 billion in 2008. The elderly bear a disproportionate
burden: They account for 13 percent of the population but more than
a third of drug expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet any effort to bring down costs is fraught with unanswered
questions. To begin with, drug makers dance around the question of
how they set prices. The official explanation is that the cost of
medicine is justified by the high cost of research and development,
which the industry puts at $500 million per drug, a figure some say
is inflated.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, there is no one set price for drugs. Consumer
advocates often complain that Americans pay higher prices for their
prescriptions than patients anywhere else in the world. And that is
true _ if the patient pays the retail price, out of pocket. (That
is the case for nearly one-third of the elderly, who have health
insurance through Medicare but lack drug coverage.)
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is, few people buy retail in this business. Most
have insurance, and their health care providers typically negotiate
discounts with the drug manufacturers. The size of these discounts,
however, is a well-kept secret. The drug makers would like to keep
it that way, which is one reason they are working hard to defeat
any legislation that would put Medicare in charge of running a
benefits plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are totally paranoid about price controls, but I think
the thing that scares them more than anything is public disclosure
of what people actually pay for prescriptions,'' said Dr. Bruce C.
Vladeck, a former administrator of the Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare. ``They go to enormous lengths
not just to keep that information confidential, but to actually
obscure it.''
</P>
<P>
   A government-run drug benefit plan would change that. If private
insurers offered drug benefits, the pharmaceutical industry could
continue to negotiate behind closed doors. But Medicare would
publish what it pays for drugs, and the private sector would
undoubtedly demand similar discounts. And with every senior citizen
in the nation enrolled in the same Medicare drug plan, the
government's bargaining clout would increase exponentially.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicare is the big gorilla,'' said Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, a
health care economist at Princeton University. ``But there is
another fear: If you go to bed with a gorilla, and the gorilla
shifts, you get squashed.''
</P>
<P>
   The shifting gorilla, of course, is Congress; the drug industry
fears lawmakers will agree to pay for a Medicare prescription drugs
benefit now, in times of surplus, and then cut back on
reimbursements when money grows scarce.
</P>
<P>
   That is precisely what has happened with the 35-year-old
Medicare program itself. In its early years, said Dr. Drew Altman,
president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicare became ``the
largest single cash cow for doctors and hospitals around the
country.'' But amid concerns over rising health care costs in the
1990s, Medicare lowered reimbursements, and now health providers
are struggling.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts, including Altman, argue that even with the
cutbacks, doctors are better off with Medicare than without it.
Reinhardt calculates the same would be true of the drug makers: A
Medicare benefits plan might bring lower prices, he says, but the
industry would make up the difference in volume.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan F. Holmer, president of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers of America, disagrees. The drug industry consistently
ranks as the most profitable on the list of Fortune 500 companies.
Yet Holmer warns that lower prices would ``put biomedical
innovation at risk'' by cutting into profits that the drug makers
need to plow back into research.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry could be profoundly different,'' said Holmer,
whose two children have cystic fibrosis and have benefited from new
treatments for that disease, he said. ``One of the most frightening
things is that if we were to proceed down that path, we would never
really know which cure we were denied.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, Holmer's industry is a victim of its own success.
``We have the best medical armamentarium in the world,'' said
Kessler. ``But what good is it if people can't afford it?''
</P>
<P>
   Because other countries have drug price controls, the
pharmaceutical industry earns most of its profits, and conducts
most of its basic research, in the United States. ``We Americans
fund the bulk of the research for the rest of the world,''
Reinhardt said, ``so everyone else can mooch.''
</P>
<P>
   And because prices are higher here, Americans use their
prescription drugs sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, drugs have become an essential part of American medical
care. ``I have some patients that are choosing between food and
travel to see their children or grandchildren'' or taking pills,
said Dr. Diane E. Meier, a geriatrician at Mount Sinai Medical
Center in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts are doubtful that Congress will move on drug prices
this year. While the House Republican bill calls for private
insurers to offer drug benefits, the insurers themselves are
against it; they say that even with government subsidies, the plans
would be too costly to offer. At the same time, Republicans and
Democrats may not be able to bridge their ideological gap. In the
meantime, says Vladeck, the industry will continue to draw its line
in the sand. ``The United States is their safety valve in terms of
profits,'' he said. ``I think that adds intensity to their feelings
about this. They are running out of places where they can charge
whatever they want.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since Israel and Egypt struck their peace deal
22 years ago, Camp David has symbolized U.S. influence: A
superpower brought a divided corner of the world to its own
mountaintop and reshaped it.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that President Clinton chose to use the seclusion
of the Catoctin Mountains again, camping out last week with the
Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat, and the Israeli prime minister,
Ehud Barak, in a grand experiment to determine if lightning can
strike twice in the same place.
</P>
<P>
   It may work, it may fizzle. But whatever the outcome, this
summit raises anew the overarching question dogging Bill Clinton,
his would-be successors and the Congress. Toward what ends should
America harness _ not for a few days in July, but day in and day
out _ the astounding economic, military, political and cultural
power it has accrued?
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, why is the country having so much trouble
establishing its international priorities? The truth is, hegemony's
not all it's cracked up to be. It seemed easier in the early 1990s,
after the Cold War had been won, but before the American economy
had begun its flight into the stratosphere. Twenty million new jobs
ago, making the world safe for U.S. exports, for freer and fairer
trade, was a rallying call that resounded far beyond the Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as U.S. economic might has soared the confusion
about how to wield it has deepened. One day American power is about
expanding democracy, the next it is about a (short-lived) ``Clinton
Doctrine'' of humanitarian intervention, even in places where
America's national interests are remote. In the last two years the
emphasis has turned to new initiatives to combat old threats, from
nuclear proliferation to narco-terrorism, and to bestowing national
security threat status on new issues, such as cyber-crime, global
economic meltdown and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   What unites this laundry list is that none of the items on it
will ever achieve the bumper-sticker simplicity of fighting
communism, the great national purpose for nearly half a century
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the nostalgia is for a single word that is decisive in
every issue that you face, like `containment' was, well that world
is gone,'' said Sandy Berger, the president's national security
adviser. ``Nobody said it would be easy to construct a foreign
policy for a global era.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far the two leading presidential candidates, while eagerly
asserting their intention to make America's international agenda
more cohesive and effective, have shown little inclination to offer
bold answers to the basic question of what American power should be
for.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, both men have calculated, probably correctly, that
there is little political advantage to announcing grand new
architectures for foreign policy. Such pronouncements invite only
mockery now, and trouble later, when the trade-offs of
policy-making collide with the neat slogans of campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   But if the candidates want to sidestep the issue, history
suggests this may not be possible. As the Romans discovered long
ago, and the British not so long ago, the concentration of power in
a single nation invariably creates a balance-of-power reaction.
``It's a law of political physics,'' says Michael Beschloss, the
presidential historian, noting the ``intense American reaction
against British economic and military power,'' which lasted from
the Revolutionary War until World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Americans, however, tend not to be equally mindful of how their
own power is viewed around the world today. It is resented. So much
so, says Beschloss, that ``one of the most important questions
Americans should be asking the presidential candidates is, `How do
you plan to respond if Russia and Japan and China and Europe find
ways to frustrate American power?'''
</P>
<P>
   What sort of foreign policy agenda makes sense at this moment,
when U.S. power is unquestioned, but its authority is anything but?
The first step may be to recognize that the very fact of that power
can make it more, not less, difficult for the nation to act
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   It's also true that, while resistance to America's power is
growing, it is also inconsistent. Chinese students celebrate
Michael Jordan as they denounce U.S. imperialism; Europeans are not
about to give up Microsoft Windows (or McDonald's), despite their
recent obsession with U.S. electronic surveillance systems; and
Russian leaders happily take U.S.-backed aid even as they rail that
the International Monetary Fund is stuffing American-style
capitalism down their throats.
</P>
<P>
   Still, how they react is their business. As Richard N. Haass, a
Brookings Institution scholar and former official in the Bush
administration, noted recently, any ``effort to assert or expand
U.S. hegemony will fail. Such an action would lack domestic support
and stimulate international resistance, which in turn would make
the costs of hegemony all the greater and its benefits all the
smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   A second step is to recognize that even a superpower must focus
its resources. If AIDS and global warming, say, are regarded as
equivalent national security crises to reducing nuclear arms or
stabilizing Russia, then U.S. diplomacy will find its energies and
its influence dissipated.

<P>
   The third step lies in recognizing that the inseparability of
economic and foreign policy is here to stay _ even if State
Department traditionalists and CIA covert operations types continue
to look at trade and globalization as ``low diplomacy'' compared
with the life-and-death struggles of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's lasting imprint on U.S. diplomacy may well be
his recognition that preserving the peace and creating a stable
global economic system are two sides of the same coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we not bailed out Mexico in 1995, I'm not sure we would
have been celebrating the emergence of democracy there last week,''
Berger argues. He may be overstating the case, but even Clinton's
harshest critics say that NAFTA, the administration's first major
international initiative, was primarily about assembling a
political alliance under the guise of a trade accord.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the battle over trade within the Democratic
party got so intense that the White House dropped its drive to
expand NAFTA to much of the rest of Latin America. The
administration allowed the need to placate labor unions to hinder
the United States from exercising its influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. is going to use its power over time it's got to be
committed and consistent,'' said Robert Zoellick, a former top
official under President Bush and now a top adviser to his son.
``The strategy the U.S. applied to Mexico needs to be expanded to
the Western Hemisphere at large.''
</P>
<P>
   Commitment also means following through on the boring stuff even
after it has fallen far off the front page. Clinton couldn't stop
talking about the need for a ``new economic architecture'' during
the Asian crisis. But as the worst effects faded, so did the talk
of lasting solutions.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of how Clinton focused like a laser on
opening Japan's markets in his first term, threatening sanctions if
American carmakers were not given access. Once the U.S. economy
took off, Clinton barely mentioned market opening. Yet American
cars are not exactly tying up traffic in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   A final requirement for a workable new approach to foreign
policy is that it factor in the erosion of national sovereignty _
America's and everybody else's.
</P>
<P>
   When the World Trade Organization rules that the United States
cannot subsidize exporters, or block fish from countries that fail
to protect sea turtles, someone screams, ``Who elected these
guys?'' The answer is that the United States did, when it pressed
harder than any nation to set global rules of behavior, in
everything from trade to war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, as Washington chafes whenever it loses an
international dispute, the rest of the world believes the system is
rigged entirely to America's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If for that reason only, to maintain its influence, America must
be seen to be sharing power, not hoarding it. And that will require
Washington to work in a more subtle and circumspect manner than
either Democrats or Republicans are going to like.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A surge of warmer and more humid air toward the Northeast on
Sunday will produce clusters of showers and thunderstorms from the
Great Lakes to the northern Appalachians. Clouds will thicken
across much of New England as patches of showers arrive later in
the day. The Middle Atlantic region will notice dim sunshine and
higher humidity, but only isolated storms.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave in the Southeast will lessen as less humid air
allows for a small drop in temperatures. A few thunderstorms will
erupt over the central Gulf region along an air mass boundary
Sultry conditions will persist in the Plains, but thunderstorms
will form from the southern Rockies to the northeast Plains along
the perimeter of very humid air. The Northwest will become a bit
cooler with more clouds.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: EUROPEAN EXTREMES
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, temperatures rose above 100 degrees across much of
the central Mediterranean as a blistering heat wave entered its
fifth day. Athens, Greece, hit 104 degrees on Wednesday, and Tunis,
Tunisia, rose to 111 on Saturday. Oddly, the surface winds across
most of this region were from the northeast, or the interior of
Europe. As is true in the winter, temperature extremes on this
continent originate from its eastern section, far away from the
moderating influences of the Atlantic Ocean. The heat wave should
lessen slightly early this week as maritime air returns to sections
of southern Europe  &QL;

<P>
   LANGATA RONGAI, Kenya _ Until recently, Robert Nyantika, 30, was
a strong, straight-backed police officer fighting ``shifters'' _
guerrillas and cattle thieves who make cross-border raids from
Somalia. Now he is a stooped wraith unable to focus his eyes, bathe
himself or walk without help. Speaking in a voice somewhere between
a whisper and a song, he says his best memory is that his unit
never left its wounded behind.
</P>
<P>
   His elder brother, Omari, has the same philosophy. When he heard
that Robert was deathly ill in a faraway clinic, he brought him
home, already gravely thin from AIDS-related tuberculosis and
diarrhea. For a week, overworked doctors at a public Nairobi
hospital were too busy or indifferent to examine Robert, but Omari,
a home health worker in a Nairobi slum, realized what was
happening: Robert had the crippling headaches and stiff neck of
cryptococcal meningitis, an AIDS complication that would blind and
then kill him within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The cure is fluconazole, a drug patented in most of the world by
Pfizer, Inc. and commonly prescribed in America as a one-pill cure
for women's yeast infections.
</P>
<P>
   In Kenya, it costs $18 per pill, a price paid by the tiny number
who can afford Nairobi's one private hospital and escape the
vagaries of a national health budget that averages $5 per citizen
per year. To live, Robert would need two pills a day for eight
weeks _ cost $1,080 _ and then one a day for the rest of his life _
$540 a month. His monthly earnings as a police officer were $43.
</P>
<P>
   Robert's cure became a tiny part of the titanic struggle going
on between pharmaceutical companies and public health advocates
over the cost of drugs like fluconazole and who has the right to
produce and market them.
</P>
<P>
   A cheaper generic version of the drug was available and made
legally in Thailand, which along with South Africa has challenged
the drug companies' monopoly on their most successful products.
This, they say, is the only way to save lives from the AIDS
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai generic, which costs only 60 cents a pill, could not be
brought legally to Kenya, which like many other Third World
countries is only now considering whether to follow the Thai and
South African challenge to the world's pharmaceutical giants.
</P>
<P>
   But Omari knew a nurse at a foreign aid agency where doctors,
furious at Pfizer's pricing policy, were illegally smuggling the
Thai drug into Kenya. They had enough to save two lives. Robert's
became one.
</P>
<P>
   In April, when Robert began taking the pills, he was too weak to
lift his hand to his mouth, but he still had courage, Omari said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He recognizes how expensive the drugs are, and if he vomits,
he throws that away,'' Omari said. ``So he really clings on. He
fights to contain them.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-June, Robert was alive and home in this Nairobi suburb
where goats graze beside row houses and turkeys stalk up and down
the dirt roads. He had survived a bout of malaria and was still
skeletal, but he could feed himself, sit up and walk with help.
Asked where he most wanted to go, he answered: ``Back to my place
of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Omari, who still helps bathe him, is slowly breaking it to
Robert that this is unlikely. He is proud that his care,
connections and good luck have bought his brother a few more
months, perhaps even a few more years of life.
</P>
<P>
   SETTING PRICES: BIG DIFFERENCES AND BIG PROFITS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fluconazole, the best anti-fungal agent invented by modern
science, is equally effective against toenail fungus, children's
oral thrush and cryptococcal meningitis. It is too miraculous for
the poor to live without and too profitable for Pfizer to give up.
</P>
<P>
   Two competing forces have intensified the battle over drugs like
fluconazole: the 1994 world treaty on intellectual property that
underpins free trade and the AIDS epidemic of the 1990s, which is
devastating whole continents too poor to pay the going rate for
patented drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The public health advocates and an increasing number of Third
World countries say the 1994 treaty allows them to manufacture or
import much cheaper generic drugs to avert national disaster; the
drug companies argue that the costs of developing drugs are so high
that they cannot afford to lower prices of the few that become
wildly successful.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer first patented fluconazole in 1982 under the name
Diflucan, and it will remain patented until 2004 in the United
States and longer elsewhere. It is one of many drugs that put the
drug companies in an awkward position: They earn their largest
profits when they are prescribed for routine problems of wealthy
Americans and Europeans, but they could save millions of the very
poor if they were available and affordable.
</P>
<P>
   To protect valuable patents, the industry has used a whole array
of tactics, from aggressive lobbying to generous giveaways of
millions of doses.
</P>
<P>
   Cryptococcal meningitis attacks about 9 percent of all people
with AIDS. In some countries, like Thailand, it attacks more than
20 percent. Untreated, the victims die in less than a month.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   PHENOMENAL PROFITS: WORLDWIDE, DRUG PRICES DIFFER GREATLY  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale prices of pills are set to recoup the costs of
research, which the industry says is about $500 million per new
drug, to pay for marketing, lobbying and other overhead, and to
earn the huge returns that make the pharmaceutical industry among
the world's most profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer sells roughly $1 billion worth of fluconazole a year.
</P>
<P>
   Its wholesale prices vary widely around the globe. A 1999 study
by the Nobel Prize-winning agency Doctors Without Borders found
them ranging from $3.60 a pill in Thailand to over $27 in
Guatemala, with about a $10 average. Pfizer did not dispute the
average, but said the range is smaller, from $5 in Thailand to $11
in France. The wholesale price is $6.38 in South Africa, $8.52 in
Kenya and $9.78 in the United States. With retail markups, the drug
may sell for $40 a pill.
</P>
<P>
   In countries that do not honor U.S. patents, the same drug is
made by generic manufacturers. Cipla, a major Indian drug company,
offers it for 64 cents a pill; Madawa Pharmaceuticals of Bangladesh
for 41 cents, three Thai companies for between 30 and 70 cents.
Pfizer has other phenomenally profitable drugs: Lipitor, which cuts
cholesterol, Zoloft for depression and, of course, Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is so wealthy, and yet keeps fluconazole prices high,
Pfizer's critics call it a pitiless corporation that lets people
die rather than cut prices or relinquish patents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone _ senior citizens, AIDS activists _ always accuses us
of being profiteers,'' said Brian McGlynn, chief spokesman for
Pfizer. ``And they say we'd rather give a rich white guy an
erection than help an African with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we invest $4.7 billion in research each year, and three
out of 10 medicines never make back their investment. And, yes, we
spend a lot of money on advertising and marketing. But we don't
sell soda pop. It's an enormous transfer of knowledge from our lab
scientists to doctors, through those sales reps.''
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has the world's fastest-growing AIDS epidemic. In
April, on the day that AIDS activists, unions and religious groups
were set to begin a lawsuit and picketing campaign denouncing the
company as an AIDS profiteer, Pfizer announced that it would supply
the drug free to any South African with AIDS who could not afford
it.
</P>
<P>
   If the company expected thanks, it got almost none.
</P>
<P>
   Act Up, the American AIDS activism group, tried to storm
Pfizer's annual meeting. By June, Doctors Without Borders, which is
campaigning for cheaper drugs, was accusing Pfizer of reneging on
its promise. It said the company had imposed a time limit on its
donation and required doctors to report back as if in a clinical
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer denied this, saying the company will supply the drug free
for life to every South African whose doctor says he cannot afford
it, and that doctors have to report only whether their patients
still take the pills and are still alive. The first free pills will
not be distributed before fall at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   In Kenya, at a meeting in June on drug prices, officials from
several African countries wondered aloud why they could not get the
same deal. Dr. Jack Watters, Pfizer's medical director for Africa,
said the giveaway might eventually be extended to the rest of
Africa. He had already spoken with the Kenyan health authorities,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can make it a success anywhere, we can in South Africa,
because they have the best infrastructure,'' he said. Asked what
the company's limit for charity was, he said, ``I really don't know
the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell the CEO: `We have 100,000 patients, they need 200 mg.
pills, we don't know how long they'll live ...' It's impossible
math to do. We're not planning to stop the program, we're planning
to look at it after two years.''
</P>
<P>
   SEEKING SOLUTIONS: AS DISEASE SPREADS, MORE NATIONS ACT  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The profits on fluconazole and other drugs allow Pfizer to give
away $120 million worth of free drugs a year, including millions of
free doses of its best-selling antibiotic, Zithromax, to cure eye
infections in central Africa and to treat venereal disease among
southern African prostitutes and mineworkers, who are central to
the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   However, many Third World countries believe they cannot wait
until the big pharmaceutical companies grant them charity.
</P>
<P>
   At the June conference here, held some weeks after he had spoken
to Watters, Kenya's health minister, Amukowa Anangwe, attacked
profiteering, referring specifically to fluconazole. He said
afterward that Kenya's Parliament was ready to pass a law allowing
him to declare a health emergency when an important drug is
unavailable at reasonable prices. The bill would empower him to
void the drug's patent in Kenya. He could then either import cheap
generic versions or use the threat to get Pfizer to lower its
price.
</P>
<P>
   More and more countries are contemplating or pursuing this path,
taken already by South Africa and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Until the 1990s, Thai law did not allow medicines to be
patented. But the country signed the 1994 Agreement on
Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights, which covers
all sorts of goods. Signers become members of the World Trade
Organization, an important goal for Thailand, which depends heavily
on exports.
</P>
<P>
   But 1 million Thais are infected with the AIDS virus, and
high-priced medicines, fluconazole included, were eating up the
health budget. The intellectual property laws Thailand generally
defended started working against life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   Because fluconazole was on the market before the law changed, it
was unpatentable. But under U.S. pressure, Thailand had created a
program that conferred the same market exclusivity. Pfizer put
fluconazole in it and charged $7 a capsule. When the exclusivity
expired in 1998, three Thai companies began to make cheap generic
fluconazole. Pfizer promptly dropped its price sharply in Thailand.
Thai law allows the health minister to declare an emergency and
seize a drug patent. In patent law, it is known as ``compulsory
licensing'' _ a company is compelled to license its secrets to a
rival.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, Dr. Korn Dabbarensi, Thailand's health minister,
said in an interview, seizing a patent is usually too much legal
bother; the mere threat normally gets a company to lower its
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're able to go ahead with compulsory licensing,
we've been informed by the Ministry of Trade that we have to use
WTO procedures,'' Dabbarensi said. ``So we go talk directly to the
drug companies in a `humane' manner. Just one-to-one talking. But
the bottom line for me is _ how `humane' are these manufacturers?
They are talking to me about the profits of their company against
the lives of my people.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 global trade treaty specifically permits governments to
use compulsory licensing _ not just for drugs, but for any
safeguards against crises in public safety, war, health or
environmental disasters. Such exceptions apply only to cure
domestic emergency, and some royalty must be paid to the patent
holder.

<P>
   U.S. ROLE : ONCE FIRMS' PROTECTOR BUT NOW CHANGING COURSE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Western pharmaceutical industry opposes compulsory licensing
and another practice known as ``parallel importing,'' which let a
country's drug buyers seek the cheapest price anywhere in the
world. Until recently, the drug companies' most powerful ally was
the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is a signatory to the 1994 protection of
copyright worldwide, and has pressed other countries to pass patent
and copyright laws more restrictive than its own to protect U.S.
corporations against foreign piracy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when South Africa tried to pass a law allowing the
health minister to ignore the Patents Act in health crises, the
United States lobbied hard against it. President Clinton raised the
issue with President Nelson Mandela, the Commerce Department put
South Africa on a watch list that is the first step toward trade
sanctions, and a bill went through Congress making all U.S. aid to
South Africa contingent on dropping the law.
</P>
<P>
   The South African pharmaceutical industry, which included
subsidiaries of American and European companies, took the pressure
much further. It closed factories, canceled investments and took
out scare ads suggesting that babies could be hurt by counterfeit
generic drugs. Its chief lobbyist, Mirryena Deeb, threatened to cut
off all new drug discoveries to South Africa if the law passed,
including AIDS drugs, cancer drugs and antibiotics. Asked in a
March 1998 interview if she was literally threatening to let
thousands of South Africans die, she reluctantly conceded: ``In so
many words, yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The practices that the United States and the industry were
fighting so hard were legal not only under the 1994 treaty, but
also under the laws of Western countries like France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, too, is a big user of compulsory licensing,
said Carlos M. Correa, an internationally recognized patent law
expert with the University of Buenos Aires in Argentina. It is a
common remedy in antitrust cases and was recently considered in the
Microsoft case (it would have forced the company to license its
Windows source code to rivals).
</P>
<P>
   America's change of course came rather abruptly last year.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1999, the Clinton administration was still squarely
against South Africa's Medicines Control Act.
</P>
<P>
   By December, the administration said it would not object if
South Africa violated U.S. law in seeking AIDS medications, as long
as it abided by World Trade Organization rules. Within months, it
had offered the same olive branch to the rest of Africa and to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst was, apparently, a decision by the Philadelphia
branch of Act Up, the gay advocacy group, to take up South Africa's
cause and start heckling Vice President Al Gore, who was in the
midst of his primary campaign for the presidency. The banners
saying that Gore was letting Africans die to please U.S.
pharmaceutical companies left his campaign chagrined. After media
and campaign staff looked into the matter, the administration did
an about-face.
</P>
<P>
   Without cheaper drugs, public health advocates say, the problems
of doctors like Christopher Ouma, who works in a Nairobi public
hospital where nearly 70 percent of patients have AIDS, will never
be solved.
</P>
<P>
   He recently listed drugs his hospital can never afford in
sufficient quantity: Vitamins. Morphine. Warfarin for blood clots
in the bedridden. Acyclovir for blinding shingles. Any
anti-retrovirals, including the oldest, AZT. And, of course,
fluconazole.
</P>
<P>
   The chief killers of his AIDS patients, he said, are
tuberculosis, diarrhea, pneumonia and cryptococcal meningitis. The
first three are usually treatable. With the last, he said, ``we run
up against a wall'' because of the price of fluconazole.
</P>
<P>
   These patients are instantly recognizable, he says, because they
moan all day. No painkiller but morphine works for them, and it is
rationed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get no peace,'' Ouma said. ``With the intense pressure on
the brain, some go blind. Most just go into a coma and die, and by
then they are in such pain that it's really a blessing.''
</P>
<P>
   As soon as he diagnoses cryptococcal meningitis in a patient, he
says, he dispenses advice he hates: If they want to be buried in
their ancestral village, as most Kenyans do, they should board a
bus. They have only two or three weeks to live, and the cost of
refrigerated trucks ruins many families.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine, as a doctor, having this conversation with
your patient?'' he said. ``I have it once a week.''

COMMENTARY: MUTANT MASTER HITS L.A. 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Democrats yearn to be manly.
</P>
<P>
   First Al Gore had his alpha coaching. Then Dick Gephardt gave
lawmakers warrior lessons, screening clips from the movie
``Gladiator'' at the Capitol before the recent Medicare clash with
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The House leader might want to show his gang the ``X-Men''
movie, about superhero mutants who cleverly change color and
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' very own Mutant Master is getting ready to show
off his latest metamorphosis at the Los Angeles convention. Gore
must reintroduce himself to an electorate already suspicious of his
serial reintroductions. It's tricky, because the question is the
answer. Who is Al Gore? Al Gore is the man who keeps remaking Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The reinventor of government can't stop reinventing. But the
national stage is not the place to figure out who you are. Consider
Hillary with her 83 hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's story arc doesn't exactly track. First, he
goes on a monthlong ``We're Fat And Happy and Let's Keep the
Prosperity Going Tour,'' trying to get credit for something he
actually deserves some credit for. Then, on Friday, at the very
end, he retools himself as champion of the little guy, bashing big
business _ drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   The Fiery Populist went after the pharmaceutical front group,
Citizens for Better Medicare. Oops. Turns out Gore's message guru,
Carter Eskew (who made a fortune on ads for Big Tobacco), pitched
the group to handle its TV advertising before he joined the Gore
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats watch Gore flopping and yearn for consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if he says he's an Italian Communist,'' says one.
``I just want him to get something he's comfortable with and
believes in, that doesn't come from focus groups, and stop
hand-wringing.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth about political commitment is that people only get
excited about a cause or candidate that stays the same today and
tomorrow and the day after.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gore struggles to get into the place he wants to be,'' says
the California Democratic strategist Bill Carrick, ``while Bush is
this 
Southern-fried-Tom-Dewey-stay-out-of-traffic-don't-say-anything-cont
roversial-run-for-an-hour-in-the-middle-of-the-day-and-I-have-to-get
-to-the-ranch-by-the-weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats find themselves in a topsy-turvy world where their
issues and their candidates at the congressional level are stronger
than their presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and the vice president seem frozen in a high school
tableau of the guy in the back of the room throwing spitballs (as
W. used to do at baseball owners' meetings) and the guy up in front
turning in the guy in back for throwing spitballs.
</P>
<P>
   Given the choice between the pious smarty-pants and the amiable
idler, Americans may prefer the latter _ unless the debates show
that his idling has left him grossly unprepared.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's biggest problem is that people don't like to like him,
even when they like him. He comes across as a man who calculates
every gesture. He even checked with Eskew to see if it would look
bad if he baby-sat for his grandson instead of joining his wife and
daughter at the Million Mom March.
</P>
<P>
   People do like to like W., even when they don't like him. This
allows the Texan to behave opportunistically, without seeming as
smarmy as his rival. W. gets to toady to the right wing while
proclaiming his moderation.
</P>
<P>
   How amazing that Gore can't simply body surf the rising economic
tide. Writing about the demand for luxury goods, The Washington
Post reports that orders for yacht charters are up 400 percent.
There's a huge back order on Patek Philippe women's bracelet
watches, selling for $6,250, and men's gold calendar watches,
selling for $26,500.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even Bill Clinton can only muster this about his beloved
protege: ``It's still more likely than not that he will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Former President George Bush told The New York Times' Frank
Bruni on Friday that he thinks his son will prevail, not
necessarily because of his charms, but for the same reason the
father lost to Clinton. ``I think people kind of like change, like
the idea of change from time to time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The clenched vice president should heed the classy ex-president:
Americans enjoy change from time to time. Not moment to moment.

   LANGATA RONGAI, Kenya _ Until recently, Robert Nyantika, 30, was
a strong, straight-backed police officer fighting _ guerrillas and
cattle thieves who make cross-border raids from Somalia. Now he is
a stooped wraith unable to focus his eyes, bathe himself or walk
without help.

   Fluconazole, the best anti-fungal agent invented by modern
science, is equally effective against toenail fungus, children's

the poor to live without and too profitable for Pfizer to give up.

   Two competing forces have intensified the battle over drugs like
fluconazole: the 1994 world treaty on intellectual property that
underpins free trade and the AIDS epidemic of the 1990s, which is
devastating whole continents too poor to pay the going rate for

   The public health advocates and an increasing number of Third
World countries say the 1994 treaty allows them to manufacture or
import much cheaper generic drugs to avert national disaster; the
drug companies argue that the costs of developing drugs are so high
that they cannot afford to lower prices of the few that become
wildly successful.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer first patented fluconazole in 1982 under the name
Diflucan, and it will remain patented until 2004 in the United

   Cryptococcal meningitis attacks about 9 percent of all people
with AIDS. In some countries, like Thailand, it attacks more than
20 percent. Untreated, the victims die in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesale prices of pills are set to recoup the costs of
research, which the industry says is about $500 million per new
drug, to pay for marketing, lobbying and other overhead, and to
earn the huge returns that make the pharmaceutical industry among
the world's most profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is so wealthy, and yet keeps fluconazole prices high,
Pfizer's critics call it a pitiless corporation that lets people
die rather than cut prices or relinquish patents.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa has the world's fastest-growing AIDS epidemic. In
April, on the day that AIDS activists, unions and religious groups
were set to begin a lawsuit and picketing campaign denouncing the
company as an AIDS profiteer, Pfizer announced that it would supply
the drug free to any South African with AIDS who could not afford
it.
</P>
<P>
   If the company expected thanks, it got almost none.
</P>
<P>
   Act Up, the American AIDS activism group, tried to storm
Pfizer's annual meeting. By June, Doctors Without Borders, which is
campaigning for cheaper drugs, was accusing Pfizer of reneging on
its promise. It said the company had imposed a time limit on its
donation and required doctors to report back as if in a clinical
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer denied this, saying the company will supply the drug free
for life to every South African whose doctor says he cannot afford
it.
</P>
<P>
   The profits on fluconazole and other drugs allow Pfizer to give
away $120 million worth of free drugs a year, including millions of
free doses of its best-selling antibiotic, Zithromax, to cure eye
infections in central Africa and to treat venereal disease among
southern African prostitutes and mineworkers, who are central to
the spread of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   However, many Third World countries believe they cannot wait
until the big pharmaceutical companies grant them charity.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   At the June conference here, held some weeks after he had spoken
to Watters, Kenya's health minister, Amukowa Anangwe, attacked
profiteering, referring specifically to fluconazole. He said
afterward that Kenya's Parliament was ready to pass a law allowing
him to declare a health emergency when an important drug is
unavailable at reasonable prices. The bill would empower him to
void the drug's patent in Kenya. He could then either import cheap
generic versions or use the threat to get Pfizer to lower its
price.
</P>
<P>
   More and more countries are contemplating or pursuing this path,
taken already by South Africa and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the drug companies' most powerful ally was the
U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is a signatory to the 1994 protection of
copyright worldwide, and has pressed other countries to pass patent
and copyright laws more restrictive than its own to protect U.S.
corporations against foreign piracy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when South Africa tried to pass a law allowing the
health minister to ignore the Patents Act in health crises, the
United States lobbied hard against it.
</P>
<P>
   The South African pharmaceutical industry, which included
subsidiaries of American and European companies, took the pressure
much further. It closed factories, canceled investments and took
out scare ads suggesting that babies could be hurt by counterfeit
generic drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The practices that the United States and the industry were
fighting so hard were legal not only under the 1994 treaty, but
also under the laws of Western countries like France and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   America's change of course came rather abruptly last year.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1999, the Clinton administration was still squarely
against South Africa's Medicines Control Act.
</P>
<P>
   By December, the administration said it would not object if
South Africa violated U.S. law in seeking AIDS medications, as long
as it abided by World Trade Organization rules. Within months, it
had offered the same olive branch to the rest of Africa and to
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst was, apparently, a decision by the Philadelphia
branch of Act Up, the gay advocacy group, to take up South Africa's
cause and start heckling Vice President Al Gore, who was running
for president. The banners said that Gore was letting Africans die
to please U.S. pharmaceutical companies. After media and campaign
staff looked into the matter, the administration did an about-face.

<P>
   U.S.-WORLD-POWER-REVIEW (Washington) _ The
U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian summit meeting raises anew the overarching
questions dogging President Clinton, his aspiring successors and
Congress. Toward what ends should America harness the astounding
economic, military, political and cultural power it has accrued in
recent years? Is it enough to act as the world's peacemaker? Why is
the country having so much trouble establishing its international
priorities? By David Sanger. (Moved in `i' category)
</P>
<P>
   PRESCRIPTION-DRUGS-REVIEW (Washington) _ In this election
season, helping the elderly pay for their pills is a political
no-brainer: Everybody's for it. The fight is over how to do it.
Republicans want private insurers to run any prescription drug
benefits plan. Democrats want the government in control. But that
classic liberal-conservative clash masks the real issue: how much
drugs will cost, and who will set their prices. By Sheryl Gay
Stolberg. (Moved in `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL-SPECIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Like dolphins, chimpanzees and
other gregarious creatures, humans are a ``highly social species.''
Dining al fresco on crowded sidewalks with cell phones grafted to
our ears. You scratch my back, I'll de-flea yours. Synchronized
swimming, anyone? Biologists say the complexities of social life
are what gave rise to big brains and intelligence in the first
place. Highly social species are, as a rule, the smartest and most
sophisticated. But why is there nothing stupider, nothing more
primitive and dangerous, than a crowd of people? If human sociality
has its roots in its primate past, it's worth asking whether the
menacing side of a human crowd likewise resembles group behavior
among nonhuman species. By Natalie Angier.
</P>
<P>
   THEATER-SUPERSTITIONS-REVIEW (New York) _ The ``Macbeth'' curse,
in which productions of that play have been harried by misfortune,
is not the only hanging over the black-magic-laden world of the
theater, a profession where open incantations of blood lust
(``Break a leg!'') are routine. The list of taboos is lengthy:
never whistle in the dressing room, never open an umbrella onstage,
never play an electrical fuse. A brief rundown of some current and
ancient omens plaguing the stage. By James McKinley.
</P>
<P>
   SWEATSHOPS-REVIEW (undated) _ Many consumers are displaying
noblesse oblige toward the millions of foreign workers who make the
goods that flood American stores. For years, anti-sweatshop
protests accomplished next to nothing. But as the anti-sweatshop
movement continues to grow _ and grow louder _ manufacturers have
recently taken steps that just might improve working conditions
around the world. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   MOVIE-HYPE-REVIEW (Undated) _ It's movie hype season. Since
1975, when ``Jaws'' devoured the box office and showed the film
industry new ways to get kids to see films over and over again
during the summer, hype has become its own industry. Colossal
promotional campaigns that studios create to sell their films
include the repetitive cover stories in glossy magazines, newspaper
and TV coverage and blanket advertising. Studios usually spend one
and a half times the production budget of a movie on publicity. By
Elvis Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   BOYSCOUT-MANUAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ The recent Supreme Court
decision allowing the Boy Scouts to expel a gay member dealt in
part with the moral values of Scouting. The first Boy Scout manual,
published in 1910 by Scouting founder Ernest Thompson Seton, says
nothing about homosexuality, but has much to say about primal urges
and manly passions. Some passages are excerpted.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW (Mexico City) _ The victory of
opposition presidential candidate Vicente Fox has raised hopes
among poor Mexicans, who are indicating that they will no longer
hand over their votes and expect little in return. What they most
expect from Fox are programs and reforms that will help Mexico's
new democracy expand beyond elections. But what some do not quite
realize is that the new president's powers have also been radically
altered _ and in some ways weakened _ by some of the same currents
that carried him to victory: he is not part of the one-party
apparatus that monopolized power but so often failed its people. By
Ginger Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   BOSNIA-ATROCITIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Thousands of carefully
numbered, white plastic bags stacked on wooden shelves fill two
tunnels behind a morgue in central Bosnia. In warm weather, the
stench is overwhelming. The bags contain the remains of 2,000
bodies collected over the last five years from mass graves and
hillsides around Srebrenica. The limbo in which the bodies still
wait for final burial stands as a symbol of the uncertain fate of
Bosnia itself _ and much else in the Balkans. By David Rohde.
</P>
<P>
   BEIRUT-RETURN-REVIEW (Beirut, Lebanon) _ A journalist describes
his impressions of today's Beirut and the Beirut he left in 1985.
Chaos and violence have been replaced by tranquility and order. By
John Kifner.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ Last Friday, as they do every week, a group
of Israeli men who were classmates at Balfour Elementary School in
the early days of the state gathered at Cafe Lenzner on bustling
Sheinkin Street for an informal salon.
</P>
<P>
   They drank iced tea, smoked cigarettes, watched girls and
engaged in their familiar routine of banter and political debate.
</P>
<P>
   These men and the friends who joined them have lived Israel's
history and prehistory, fought its various wars, established its
businesses, served in its government, emigrated and reimmigrated.
There is a lawyer, an architect, an economist, and a factory owner
who survived the Holocaust on Schindler's list.
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders might assume that the debate last Friday would be
particularly intense, that these men would be obsessed by the Camp
David summit meeting that begins on Tuesday with the momentous aim
of resolving the bitter Israeli-Palestinian conflict that has
overshadowed their country's existence. But outsiders would be
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had so many moments of truth,'' said Danny Simon, 54,
a businessman who considers himself a leftist. ``We are not naive.
We would never attach too much importance in advance to any one
event. Do we feel on the edge of something historic? We are not
holding our breath. We can only hope that the process keeps inching
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the backdrop to life here,
even on Sheinkin Street, the epicenter of Israeli secularism. Young
adults with spiked hair, nose rings and bare midriffs affect a
willful distance from the battles and animosities that defined
their parents' lives, and they do not live elbow-to-elbow with the
conflict like Jerusalemites or settlers.
</P>
<P>
   But everyone in Israel, the West Bank and Gaza is a prisoner of
what President Clinton, announcing the summit meeting, labeled the
``abject dreariness of the pursuit.'' Everyone knows that immutable
deadlines are always broken and that two steps forward are always
followed by one step back. Everyone cares and almost everyone is
afraid to care too much, fearful of having their hopes dashed or
their fears realized.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of interviews throughout Israel and the West Bank, only
the Jewish settlers were treating the summit as a potentially
pivotal event. Only in the settlements _ where children stopped
cars to plaster them with stickers that said, ``Peace, yes!
Suckers, no!'' _ has daily life been altered to plan for what many
see as the most significant political battle of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should we give the Arabs anything?'' said one of the young
settlers, Yishai Cacotai, 14. ``We give them land, they give us
buses that go boom-boom.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, people refused to be distracted by what they saw as
the latest stop on the local train to a lessened conflict, if not
peace. In Ramallah on the West Bank, for instance, behind the
opaque glass of a rare women-only cafe called Privacy, two modern
young Palestinian sisters sat smoking a fruit-flavored water pipe _
an unusual activity for women here. They waved away talk of Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   ``I follow it closely,'' said Samar Alkour, the cafe owner, who
is 35. ``But I don't go into discussions. Let me tell you about
this peace process: The big men are cooking, and the little people
are eating. We will take what we are served, because we will have
no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   At the nearby Cafe Brazil, a men-only cafe with thick sawdust on
the floor, one group of men playing cards seemed like the
Palestinian equivalent of the Israeli salon in Tel Aviv, a circle
of longtime companions who finished one another's sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Faidi, a hotel owner, laid down an ace of spades,
snorted and said, ``Arafat will go and return without
achievements.'' He was referring to Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader. ``It's all nonsense,'' he muttered, and no one disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, at the Sanabel Bakery, Khaled Rabieh, 27,
stacked sugary elephant-ear pastries. He said that he considered
the peace effort to be ``a show'' and that Camp David would be one
of the ``last scenes before the curtain comes down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabieh's family originally came from a town next to Jaffa,
where, as far as they are concerned, they still own 250 acres of
agricultural land, which he said he routinely visits, parks beside
and stares at with frustrated longing.
</P>
<P>
   Rabieh, like most refugees, believes that if a peace agreement
is achieved, it will be at the refugees' expense. He said that if
the Israelis obtain what they want _ separation from the
Palestinians _ he will not even be able to visit his land. He said
that he looked ahead to Sept. 13, the deadline by which Arafat has
pledged to declare a Palestinian state, as a day more bitter than
sweet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a day when we laugh at ourselves,'' he said. ``It
will be a day when we get a state without power, without
sovereignty. ''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking with profound distrust of the Israelis, Rabieh said he
saw the peace effort as their attempt to eliminate the barriers to
their economic domination of the region.
</P>
<P>
   A world away, in the nearby settlement of Bet Horon, Avi
Weissman, who immigrated 30 years ago from New York, spoke with
equally deep-seated suspicion of the Palestinians' ultimate
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole process of what's called peace,'' he said, ``it
amounts to giving the Arabs a part of our homeland that they can
use as a military base for taking the rest.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Weissman wearily unloaded groceries from his car and trudged up
the terraced slope to his hilltop home of 23 years. Inside the
white-walled, red-roofed house that is typical in the more
suburban-style settlements, he gazed from a window at the seemingly
peaceful landscape of undulating hills, a view of the disputed
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very worried and very, very upset,'' Weissman said.
``With the mood of this government, and the mood of the Israeli
people, you can't feel safe. In my wildest dreams, I can't think
that the Arabs will ever be willing to live in peace with us. And
yet we go to Camp David? Why? Because we have lost our motivation,
we have gotten soft. They are willing to spill their blood, to be
martyrs, but we don't want to lose a single soldier.''
</P>
<P>
   At Cafe Lenzner on Sheinkin Street, it was hard to separate the
strands of serious conversation from the fast-flying repartee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know the history of this country?'' said Lutek
Harel, the Holocaust survivor, who owns an airplane-parts
manufacturing business. ``We had nothing. What we have now, we took
it all. If we want to talk about peace, we have to talk about the
people who were here when we arrived. We have no choice but to live
as two people on one land.''
</P>
<P>
   Moti Lenzner, the resident right-winger who is also Harel's
lawyer, hooted. ``I will give back your factory in Jaffa, then! It
belongs to these Arabs you so love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it back!'' Harel said. ``I could use a rest. Maybe I'll
go to Camp David. That sounds like a nice break.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, the businessman, said the left was afraid that the
situation would disintegrate before it improved. ``Even if
something comes out of Camp David,'' he said, ``things will slip
backward. They always do. It will take a lot of aggravation, a lot
of deaths, a lot of riots, a lot of smoke to get to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Working hard to get a word in, Yoram Fogel, an architect, was
interrupted by the table's running commentary on the girls walking
by. ``People forget how much progress we have made,'' he said.
``Slowly, slowly, we accept peace. It's a revolution in the life of
Israel. It doesn't matter if Camp David succeeds or fails. It's a
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Shilo, 55, an economist, suggested that a partial agreement
could be reached, one that left aside the thornier issues of
Jerusalem and the refugees. But Simon did not think that would be a
good idea. ``Then it will just take more pain, more casualties, and
in the end we will be in the same place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing his glasses up his nose, Lenzner shot back: ``What's the
matter with pain and suffering? Did you forget you are Jewish?''

COMMENTARY: THE PIZZA PRINCIPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has always been hard to have a rational discussion about the
stock market: Hope and fear, greed and envy get in the way. And
it's even harder nowadays because politics has entered the mix. Not
only do some ideologues believe that to love capitalism is to love
its stocks, whatever their price; also, the promise of high stock
returns serves the same purpose today that the Laffer curve served
20 years ago. That is, it helps politicians _ particularly
politicians who want to privatize Social Security _ offer visions
of sugar plums, of gain without pain.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a real debate about the prospects for stock
prices, with serious arguments on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Last year bulls dominated the public discourse, but we have
lately been hearing a lot from the sophisticated bears _ people
like Robert Shiller, the author of ``Irrational Exuberance,'' or
Andrew Smithers and Stephen Wright, co-authors of ``Valuing Wall
Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Their arguments are straightforward: By historical standards,
current stock values look way out of line. The price-earnings ratio
of the average company is more than twice its historical average;
so is ``q'' _ the ratio of the market value of corporations to the
value of their underlying assets. And in the past a high P/E or a
high q was usually a portent of capital losses to come. So this is
certainly a point of view that should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But will the future be like the past? Sophisticated bulls _
exemplified by Professor Jeremy Siegel, author of the influential
1993 book ``Stocks for the Long Run'' _ point out that stocks have
historically been a high-yield, low-risk investment. Indeed, stocks
were so good an investment that people should have been willing to
pay much higher prices than they did. So valuations that look very
high by historical standards might represent not the rise of
irrational exuberance but the decline of irrational pessimism. And
this, too, is a point of view that should be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   It's important, however, to recognize the limits of
sophisticated bullishness. The long-run rate of return on stocks
tends to be about the same as the ``earnings yield'' _ like the
price-earnings ratio people usually talk about only upside down. So
even if you believe that stocks aren't particularly risky, this
only justifies stock prices high enough so that the earnings yield
_ and hence the long-run rate of return on stocks _ is no higher
than the rate of return on safe assets like bonds.
</P>
<P>
   And we are already there (actually a bit beyond). So the views
of sophisticated bulls do not justify a belief either that stocks
are still greatly undervalued or that today's generously priced
stocks will yield investors anything like the rate of return
investors got on the undervalued stocks of decades past.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I emphasize this point, of course, is that if you do
not understand it you might confuse the sophisticated bulls with
those in a third camp _ mad bulls? _ who do hold one or both of
these beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a confusion actively encouraged by the mad bulls
themselves. For example, the authors of last year's ``Dow 36,000''
claimed to base their ideas on the work of Siegel. And there is a
sense in which this claim is true. But it is the same sense in
which a recipe for pineapple-marshmallow-baloney pizza is based on
pizza dough. Yes, the dough is a crucial ingredient; but there are
other crucial ingredients, and very questionable ingredients at
that.
</P>
<P>
   The sophisticated bulls deserve to be taken seriously; so do the
sophisticated bears. The mad bulls don't.
</P>
<P>
   But those are fighting words, and the fight won't be fair. I
myself have been angrily accused of inconsistency because I have
both criticized the mad bulls and said nice things about Siegel. In
other words, ``Last year you made fun of
pineapple-marshmallow-baloney pizza _ but now you say you like
pizza after all. Ha! You've changed your position!''
</P>
<P>
   So let me now lay down the pizza principle for stock prices. I
like pizza, and so should you _ that is, you should take seriously
the view that a stock market that looks grossly overvalued by
historical standards isn't. But even if you do like pizza, you
don't have to accept the baloney some people want you to swallow.

BUSH'S CHOICES FOR COURT SEEN AS MODERATES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Earlier this year, the Texas Supreme Court
stunned social conservatives throughout the state by issuing a 6-3
ruling that allowed a 17-year-old high school senior to have an
abortion without telling her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shocking,'' said Joe Kral, the legislative director for
the Texas Right to Life Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was, after all, appointees of Gov. George W. Bush who took
the lead on the issue. And it was the governor himself who had
pushed into law the Texas Parental Notification Act, which required
minors to inform their parents before seeking an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, particularly after the U.S. Supreme Court's 5-4
ruling that rejected a Nebraska law prohibiting doctors from
performing a procedure that opponents call partial-birth abortion,
the issue of judicial appointments has percolated into the
presidential race. Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic nominee, seized on the close vote to warn that Bush, if
elected, would appoint conservative Supreme Court justices hostile
to abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   But a look at Bush's record in Texas shows that he has appointed
justices who have had a moderating influence on the Texas Supreme
Court, often regarded as among the most conservative and
pro-business in the country. He has appointed four of the court's
nine justices and has been a political patron for a fifth, Harriet
O'Neill, who wrote the majority opinion in the parental
notification case.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who do not support Bush say that while his appointees
are regarded as conservative and business-oriented, they are not
fiercely ideological.
</P>
<P>
   What insight, if any, Bush's appointments in Texas offer into
what he might do in Washington is debatable. The scrutiny and
pressure surrounding a nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court far
exceed those accompanying an appointment to the Texas court. Bush,
who opposes abortion, has offered only vague descriptions of his
model justices, though, tellingly, he has cited two of the leading
conservatives on the Supreme Court, Antonin Scalia and Clarence
Thomas, for praise.
</P>
<P>
   On the campaign trail, Bush has said he wants justices who
strictly interpret the Constitution. He also has promised not to
apply any ideological litmus tests, including one on abortion, even
though many of the social conservatives who support him are eager
to overturn Roe vs. Wade.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Johnson, a top aide to Bush, said he believed the selection
process for justices would undoubtedly be different in a Bush
presidential administration than it has been in Texas. ``But I
think he would be looking as he did at the state level for people
who are interpreters of the law as opposed to makers of the law,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Supreme Court justices are elected statewide to
six-year terms, but early retirements allowed Bush to reshape the
court. And if anything, the Bush appointees seem in keeping with
his campaign theme of ``Big Tent Republicanism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the people he picked were sort of moderate
conservatives,'' said Anthony Champagne, a political science
scientist professor at the University of Texas at Dallas who
follows the court. ``Like he is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush's first appointee, James A. Baker, was a state appellate
judge and a longtime political ally of the Bush family. (He is no
relation to the former U.S. secretary of state.) His second, Greg
Abbott, was a highly regarded state judge in Houston who has been
paralyzed since an accident 16 years ago. His third, Deborah G.
Hankinson, was a teacher-turned-defense lawyer. And his fourth,
Alberto R. Gonzales, is one of Bush's most visible Hispanic allies,
having served as the governor's general counsel and as Texas
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   The governor appointed O'Neill to a lower court in 1995 and in
1998 she won a seat on the high court with his blessing. All of
Bush's appointees are Republicans and all have since been elected
except Gonzales, who is expected to be elected easily in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have uniformly been chosen for quality,'' said Bill
Powers, dean of the law school at the University of Texas. ``There
has not been a litmus test. They are sort of middle of the road on
the court.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate interviews last week, Hankinson, Gonzales and Abbott
all described a similar interview process with Bush, who is not a
lawyer, and a few aides. None were asked about specific issues like
abortion. (In fact, until the parental notification opinion, the
court had never had to directly address abortion.) Instead, they
said, the governor asked open-ended questions about judicial
philosophy to determine how they might view their roles as
justices.
</P>
<P>
   Before the interview, Abbott barely knew the governor, having
met him at a few Republican Party functions; Hankinson had never
met him. She said he seemed interested in her experience as a
special education elementary school teacher and her subsequent
career change to law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I thought it was very, very critical that judges
not bring an agenda to the bench,'' said Hankinson, whom Bush
appointed as an appellate judge in 1996, then to the state Supreme
Court a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie D. Branson, president of the Texas Trial Lawyers
Association, a group that has been critical of the court and Bush
over the years, said the court is ``still not where we'd like them
to be'' on consumer issues and other damage claims. But Branson
agreed that the Bush appointees had started the process of moving
the court back to the center.
</P>
<P>
   The recent history of the Texas Supreme Court is one of stark
swings in ideology. The court hears only civil matters because the
Court of Criminal Appeals, whose members are also elected, is the
state's highest criminal court. For decades the Supreme Court was
considered resolutely pro-business and pro-defendant. But in the
early 1980s many of the state's wealthiest plaintiffs' lawyers
helped elect an all-Democratic, lawsuit-friendly court that began
upholding enormous jury verdicts against corporate and medical
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Business interests and lobbyists for the medical field fought
back and began electing conservative justices, most notably Justice
Nathan L. Hecht. For much of the 1990s, Hecht led a conservative
counter-revolution that shifted favor back to defendants and
business. The scales of justice had shifted: While studies showed
that plaintiffs won more than 60 percent of cases in the 1980s, the
defendants were winning 83 percent by the 1995-96 court term.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court was becoming increasingly viewed as conservative
almost to a fault,'' said Kim Ross, the chief lobbyist for the
Texas Medical Association, who had helped elect conservative judges
in the late 1980s. ``There were complaints of unfairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush took office in January 1995, and his first opportunity to
influence the court came that summer when Justice Bob Gammage, a
Democrat, announced he would retire. Gammage had attacked the
state's system of electing judges as corrupt and blamed the court
for favoring big business, particularly insurance companies. But in
an interview last week he called Bush's appointees fair and
nonideological even as he pointed out that the law is not the
governor's expertise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know what judges do,'' Gammage said. ``He doesn't
think in terms of courts. He doesn't think in terms of lawyers. He
thinks in terms of business.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By the Supreme Court's 1998-99 term, the liberal judicial
watchdog group, Court Watch, found that Bush's appointees were
``eliminating the excesses of the GOP old guard.'' A Court Watch
study determined that the court was showing more sympathy for
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice Thomas R. Phillips, a leading conservative who
took office 1988, acknowledged that in recent years ``there's been
sort of a middle course,'' but he said it was in keeping with
national trends. To some degree, he noted, the bitter ideological
fights over tort law had been fought before the Bush appointees
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Until the parental notification issue arose, the Texas Supreme
Court rarely ruled on divisive social issues. The law, which took
effect on Jan. 1, included a ``judicial bypass'' provision,
allowing minors to have an abortion without notifying their parents
if they could demonstrate to a judge that they were ``mature and
sufficiently well informed.''
</P>
<P>
   The first such case, known as Jane Doe 1, came in March when the
Supreme Court overruled a trial court, which had held that the
17-year-old had not meet the standard for a judicial bypass. The
majority Supreme Court opinion, which was released on June 22,
concluded that a strict reading of the notification law showed a
fairly low burden of proof for a teen-ager seeking a judicial
bypass _ one that the opinion concluded Jane Doe 1 had met,
allowing her to have the abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have put aside our personal viewpoints and endeavored to do
our job as judges _ that is, to interpret and apply the
Legislature's will as it has been expressed in the statute,''
O'Neill wrote for the majority, which included by Baker, Hankinson,
Gonzales and Justice Craig Enoch, a Republican elected in 1992.
Philips voted with the majority but did not concur with all the
points in the opinion. Of Bush's appointees, only Abbott dissented.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest dissent came from Hecht, the court's leading
conservative, who accused the majority of not of putting aside
personal viewpoints, but acting on them. ``The rationale for the
court's ruling, I think, is that the court does not regard the
decision to have an abortion as being a very important one,'' he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The bypass petitions are expedited, and five, including Jane Doe
1, have reached the court and found different results. The justices
have granted two bypasses and rejected two. The fifth case was
withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents have not hidden their disappointment.
Religious conservatives at the state Republican Party convention in
June adopted a platform plank that called for the defeat of judges
who approve judicial bypasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've made it way too easy for doctors to perform secret
abortions on minors without their parents being told,'' said Joe
Pojman, director of Greater Austin Right to Life.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Pojman and Kral agree that the court's opinion has not
shaken their support of Bush. ``If Bush does what he says and picks
justices who stick to the original intent of the Constitution,
we'll be in great shape,'' Pojman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on March 22, after the Jane Doe 1 case became
public, Linda Edwards, a spokeswoman for the governor's office,
chose not to criticize the court but neither did she embrace its
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush worked hard for the passage of a law that is
intended to reduce the number of abortions in Texas and involve
parents in this major decision by their minor daughters,'' Edwards
said. ``If the law needs to be strengthened or changed for that
intent to be carried our, then Governor Bush would support that.''

MODERATE-DRINKING ADVOCATE LEARNS SOBERING LESSON 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ After she founded a self-help program called
Moderation Management seven years ago, Audrey Kishline became a
national spokeswoman for the notion that problem drinkers could be
taught to cut back without abstaining altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Groups like Alcoholics Anonymous that favor abstinence sharply
criticized her and the book she wrote, ``Moderate Drinking: The New
Option for Problem Drinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Kishline says she may well become a spokeswoman again,
though probably from behind prison bars.
</P>
<P>
   Having recently pleaded guilty to two counts of vehicular
homicide after a binge drinking episode last March during which she
became so intoxicated that she barely remembers climbing into her
pickup truck, Kishline said through her lawyer that she has a new
message: Moderation Management involves a lot of ``alcoholics
covering up their problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Kishline, 43, was driving the wrong way down an interstate
freeway near Cle Elum, in central Washington, and smashed head-on
into a car, killing Danny Davis, a 38-year-old electrician, and his
12-year-old daughter, LaSchell. Prosecutors said her blood-alcohol
level was more than three times the legal limit.
</P>
<P>
   With her plea last week, Kishline, who is in a treatment program
in Oregon, is almost certainly headed to prison when she is
sentenced Aug. 11. The prosecutor is seeking four and a half years,
although the maximum penalty is life.
</P>
<P>
   Kishline declined a request for an interview, but in a statement
she made with her lawyer at the Kittitas County Courthouse, she
expressed profound remorse and described herself as ``a housewife
and mother who woke up in a trauma unit of a hospital on March 25th
to find out that I am the cause of the deaths of two innocent
people.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I am giving this statement in a public forum
because I pray that my story can touch at least one other
alcoholic. When I failed at moderation, and then failed at
abstinence, I was too full of embarrassment and shame to seek help.
In self-pity I gave up and believed my nightly drinking at home
could hurt no one but myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Controversial through all the years that she wrote newspaper
opinion-page pieces and appeared on television talk shows, Kishline
has again inflamed a debate over moderation vs. abstinence by
offering her own calamitous story as an example of denial in
action. And many of those who debated her in the past have seized
on her experience to warn about what they call the delusion behind
the idea that alcoholics can be taught to drink without harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dreadful tragedy might have been avoided if Ms. Kishline
had come to this realization earlier,'' said Stacia Murphy,
president of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence, a nonprofit group based in New York. ``Unfortunately,
the disease of alcoholism, which is characterized by denial,
prevented this from occurring. While this does not excuse Ms.
Kishline's actions, it provides a harsh lesson for all of
society.''
</P>
<P>
   But far from depicting Kishline as an example of the failures of
Moderation Management, people involved with the organization note
that she had also tried abstinence and failed. And, they say, the
worst incident of all occurred, in her own depiction, shortly after
she had joined an Alcoholics Anonymous program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it ironic that her most extreme case of intoxication
came after she quit Moderation Management?'' said Stanton Peele, a
board member of Moderation Management who is a psychologist in
Morristown, N.J. ``AA didn't have the answers for her, either. They
just told her to abstain, and that didn't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite Kishline's troubles, the concept of Moderation
Management was recently accepted as a treatment technique by the
Smithers Addiction Treatment and Research Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Smithers, known for its treatment of celebrities
like the baseball player Darryl Strawberry, have decided to adopt
Kishline's program as one approach.
</P>
<P>
   The willingness to try something new has been prompted, in part,
by stricter managed care reimbursement standards, which have led to
the closure of half of the nation's rehabilitation centers, say
officials at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital, which runs Smithers.
</P>
<P>
   Kishline founded Moderation Management in 1993 and published her
book, subtitled ``The Moderation Management Guide for People Who
Want to Reduce Their Drinking,'' a year later. An advertisement for
the book said: ``Based on her own unsatisfactory experience with
abstinence-based programs, Kishline offers inspiration and a
step-by-step program to help individuals avoid the kind of drinking
that detrimentally affects their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Her program calls for 30 days of abstinence, and suggests
refraining from drinking for at least three days a week. Overall,
she wrote, women should not have more than three drinks a day or
exceed nine drinks a week; men, she said, should have no more than
four drinks a day or 14 drinks a week. Among tips to reduce
drinking are alternating alcoholic with nonalcoholic drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Moderation Management, with chapters in 14 states and Canada,
describes its aim as helping people who have experienced mild to
moderate alcohol problems, but who are not alcoholics, reduce their
drinking. The group says moderate drinking is a ``reasonable and
attainable recovery goal for problem drinkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the group's tenets are: ``Never drive while under the
influence of alcohol.''
</P>
<P>
   Alcohol treatment experts have clashed over the moderation
approach, with some calling it useful for some kinds of drinkers,
while others say it gives alcoholics the false and dangerous hope
that they can learn ways to continue drinking.
</P>
<P>
   The group got national attention two years ago when a computer
programmer confessed in an Internet chat site for group members
that he had killed his 5-year-old daughter by setting his house on
fire in a custody dispute with his former wife.
</P>
<P>
   Kishline cried in court as she pleaded guilty to the vehicular
homicide charges. She had also been accused of hit-and-run driving
for forcing another vehicle off the highway, but that charge was
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Now Kishline is contemplating writing another book, stressing
that moderation is not a viable option for people with serious
alcohol problems, said her lawyer, John Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   During the court proceeding, grieving relatives of Davis and his
daughter watched, clutching pictures of Davis and LaSchell, who was
killed 10 days after her 12th birthday. And they listened carefully
to Kishline's statement afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it helps one person to stop, then go ahead, do it,'' Will
Davis, Danny Davis' brother, said of Kishline's new message.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no matter what she does now, it's not bringing Danny
back,'' said another relative, standing nearby. ``It's not bringing
LaSchell back.''

GROUND-LEVEL GENETICS, FOR THE PERFECT LAWN 
</HEADLINE>
 ALTERED-GRASS-960(2TAKES)-NYT  
 (Attn: Ohio, Fla., N.J., Ill., Minn., Ore.)   By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARYSVILLE, Ohio _ Standing in long rows in Greenhouse No. 3 at
the Scotts Co.'s research laboratory here are pots of grass that
could be a suburbanite's dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   The grass, which Scotts hopes will eventually carpet every lawn
and golf course around the world, is genetically altered to
withstand applications of the most potent weed killers and remain
healthy and green.
</P>
<P>
   Scotts, the world's largest maker of lawn and turf products, has
other varieties in the works as well. One, nicknamed ``low mow'' by
company scientists, has been designed to grow at a slower pace,
thereby reducing the need for a lawn mower. Other strains could be
drought-resistant, or bred to flourish in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also working on genetically modified roses and
other flowers that will bloom longer than the ones found in nature.
And some scientists at Scotts are even talking about someday
developing grasses in different colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no end to what you might do,'' says Peter Day,
director of the biotechnology center at Rutgers University, which
is working with Scotts and Monsanto to develop the grasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might put a luminescent gene in so that your grass might
glow. Or, if your foot stepped on it, it would glow. You could also
make novelty grasses.''
</P>
<P>
   The products, still in various stages of development, are not
expected to reach the market for at least three years. But Scotts
executives hope the company will then reap enormous profits in a
market they believe could reach $10 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, are horrified by the notion of blanketing the
world with genetically altered grass. Environmental activists
already concerned about the genetically modified crops now growing
on more than 70 million acres of American farmland, have criticized
research laboratories experimenting with genetically altered grass
and trees out of fear that the plants will fundamentally alter the
environment. Others are speaking out against this latest form of
genetic experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to put biotech in everyone's backyard,'' says
Jeremy Rifkin, a longtime opponent of biotechnology. ``It's going
to open up a national debate, because everyone has a lawn. You're
going to see a `not in my backyard' phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Landscape Architects, with more than
14,000 members, joined Rifkin on Friday in petitioning the
Agriculture Department, calling for the agency to suspend all field
tests of the new grasses that Scotts is conducting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are highly concerned with the use of genetically modified
plants because they could potentially affect the whole ecosystem of
native plants,'' said Janice Cervelli Schach, president of the
society. ``We want bodies outside of Monsanto and Scotts to assess
these risks.''
</P>
<P>
   Many consumers are also wary of the genetically altered grass.
``This whole genetic thing has gotten out of hand,'' said Nancy
Childs, a 29-year-old restaurant owner who was loading her cart
with some black-eyed Susans at a Home Depot store in Chicago.
Genetically altered grass would be ``convenient, but it's not
normal,'' she said, adjusting her flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Scotts, however, says it is moving cautiously. It says it is
conducting intensive research under the oversight of federal
regulators to ensure that the new products are safe and to avoid
the maelstrom that has erupted, at least in Europe, over
genetically altered crops. The Agriculture Department regulates
where Scotts can plant the experimental grass, and Scotts must
obtain the department's permission before it can transport the
grass anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``These products will give you more beautiful lawns and
gardens,'' said Mark R. Schwartz, head of the branded plants group
at Scotts, which is based in Columbus, Ohio. ``And if there are
problems with the technology, then it won't come out. But we're
following all the rules, taking all the precautions.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotts, which is best known for its lawn fertilizer, Ortho
pesticides and Miracle Gro plant food, is far ahead of its
competitors in the race to create the raw material for perfect
lawns.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we make money, beautifying the world, trying to
generate more beauty with less maintenance,'' Charles M. Berger,
the company's chief executive, said. ``And we'll use every tool in
the toolbox. Biotech, that's just another tool in the toolbox.''
</P>
<P>
   While a company in Australia has been trying to create a blue
rose through the use of biotechnology, scientists at Scotts have
already developed genetically altered petunias and geraniums in
laboratories in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Scotts says it will develop an even larger arsenal of ``smart''
plants with longer lasting blooms, different colors, and in some
cases built-in pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   Genetically altered grass, however, may be the first
bioengineered lawn product to reach the market. Scientists at
Monsanto and Rutgers have been working with Scotts for several
years now to develop the new grass strains.
</P>
<P>
   The first grass likely to be available is creeping bent grass, a
strain that is used on golf courses around the world. Despite its
name, it is a sturdy grass even when it is clipped as short as a
quarter of an inch to form putting greens.
</P>
<P>
   But creeping bent grass is expensive to maintain and prone to
infestation by weeds. David Bishop, a spokesman for the Golf Course
Superintendents Association of America, says that is why
genetically altered turf would be welcome on greens and fairways
throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grasses on golf courses are maintained at the very edge of
their tolerance,'' he said. ``If you could produce a grass more
tolerant at an eighth of an inch, that's less likely to go into
stress and may require less water, that would be great.''

 Marysville, Ohio: be great. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scotts executives say the first creeping bent grass could be
Roundup Ready Grass, which is grass genetically modified to survive
spraying of Roundup, the popular weed killer developed by Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   The new grass could drastically reduce costs and maintenance at
golf courses, and a drought-tolerant variety could reduce the
amount of water needed to keep the turf healthy, Scotts executives
say.
</P>
<P>
   But activists are already sabotaging test plots in protest.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a group calling itself the Anarchist Golfing
Association caused more than $300,000 worth of damage at an Oregon
research center that was testing genetically altered grass for golf
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last year, activists have also vandalized a
university lab in Minnesota and torched a research site belonging
to Boise Cascade, the giant paper company, which had been
experimenting with genetically altered trees.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Fricker, president of Pure Seed Testing Inc., a grass
seed company in Hubbard, Ore., said that early last month activists
destroyed pots of genetically altered grass at her company. But not
before the company made some troubling discoveries about how widely
the plants' pollen might be dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were doing risk assessment and we learned pollen can flow
over 1,000 feet,'' she said last week. ``It could go 3,000 feet.
And it cross-fertilizes,'' mating with a different strain of grass
and creating a new genetically modified breed.
</P>
<P>
   Fricker said the company's studies raised serious questions
about whether genetically modified grass should be introduced into
the environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is mostly with pollen flow,'' she said. ``It's
going to be a huge problem to keep this stuff contained.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotts says it is working to assess the risks. Pollen is
unlikely to spread on golf courses, executives at Scotts say,
because the grass on putting greens is not allowed to flower. As
for lawns, the company says it may adopt a Monsanto technology
called Terminator, which makes seeds sterile. That could prevent
genes from jumping from one backyard to another.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Windsor, a 50-year-old minister in Chicago, says he would
welcome the ``mow me less'' lawn as long as it did not harm the
environment. ``We probably pollute the environment more just by
mowing the lawn,'' he said while buying some cedar mulch for his
yard.
</P>
<P>
   Scotts became involved in biotechnology in 1998, when it formed
an alliance with Monsanto to produce genetically altered grass and
ornamental plants. (Scotts also has the exclusive license to sell
Roundup to consumers who garden.)
</P>
<P>
   Much of the research is done here in Marysville, where Bob
Harriman, the company's chief scientist and a former Monsanto
employee, is working to bring genetically altered grass and flowers
to market.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Dr. Harriman was in Greenhouse No. 3, holding a small
pot of grass up to the light and marveling at its promise. ``These
were sprayed three days ago,'' he said, fingering the bright green
blades of the grass, which had been used in a test of the Roundup
weed killer. ``They are in great condition. You can tell they have
a nice green leaf structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harriman says that a few months ago, scientists here used
what they call a gene gun to shoot a bacterial gene into a tissue
of grass in the hope of making it immune to Roundup. Days later,
tiny blades of the new grass sprouted to life in a petri dish. Now,
there are dozens of pots around him with full tufts of genetically
modified creeping bent grass.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harriman says that once the outcry over genetic engineering
subsides, Scotts and other companies will churn out countless
varieties of grasses and ornamental flowers.
</P>
<P>
   And the visions are not just of verdant lawns. Why not purple
lawns? Or orange roses? What about seeds that would let the
University of Florida use orange and blue grass seed in its
football stadium, for example?
</P>
<P>
   When the Scotts products do come to market, however, the company
says it will not use the word ``biotech'' on the labels. The word
is already generating negative feedback in consumer surveys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems unlikely we'd ever call them biotech,'' Berger of
Scotts said. ``We'd call them superior plants.''

U.S.-CHINA TALKS FAIL TO RESOLVE ISSUE OF MISSILE AID TO PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A visiting U.S. official Saturday praised China for
becoming ``a major participant'' in nonproliferation efforts in
Asia and around the world but said two days of talks did not allay
concerns about Chinese help for Pakistan's anti-ballistic missile
program.
</P>
<P>
   Allegations of such aid to Pakistan, made by U.S. intelligence
agencies, have complicated the passage by the Senate of normal
trade status for China and are fueling the push for a Senate bill
that singles out China for scrutiny and penalties if it exports
advanced weapons technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised our concern that China has provided aid to Pakistan
and other countries,'' John D. Holum, senior adviser to the
secretary of state on arms control, told reporters. ``We made
progress, but the issue remains unresolved.'' Holum declined to
explain his reference to ``other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   China considers Pakistan, which followed India in conducting a
nuclear test in 1998, a key strategic ally, helping to counter
nuclear-armed India's power in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese, Holum said Saturday, complained about U.S. sales of
weapons to Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade part of the
motherland. And they repeated objections to U.S. plans for national
and Asian-theater missile defenses, which could negate the
deterrent power of China's small nuclear forces and draw Taiwan
under a U.S. protective umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement sure to anger China, Holum said: ``We don't rule
out the possibility that some time in the future'' Taiwan might be
included in an Asian missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese arms experts say China is unlikely to promise to
end exports of missile technology any time soon because such trade,
or the threat of it, gives China a bargaining chip over the scale
of U.S. weapons sold to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Holum stressed that the talks were held in a ``very positive
climate.'' China has largely cooperated with the United States and
global bodies in fighting the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for Americans to recognize that China has in a
very short time covered an extremely long distance in terms of
nonproliferation and arms control,'' Holum said, noting the various
treaties and other agreements it had joined over the last decade.
He said that China had played a ``constructive role'' with North
Korea to curb development of missiles and nuclear weapons and had
kept a promise to stop aiding Iran's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   His comments appeared unlikely to sway senators, mainly
Republicans, who are pushing a bill intended to constrain Chinese
exports of nuclear and missile technology. Its sponsors have been
energized by charges that China provided crucial materials and
technical experts to Pakistan within the last 18 months, assisting
development of a new long-range missile that could carry nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear that China, if it provided such aid, has
violated any specific international commitments. On Saturday, Holum
said China promised the United States in 1994 that it would not
ship powerful missiles to countries that did not possess them. But
the two countries disagree, he said, as to whether China promised
not to export related technologies.
</P>
<P>
   China's reluctance to restrict military aid to Pakistan reflects
its own strategic concerns, said John W. Garver, an expert on
Chinese policy in South Asia at Georgia Tech University. China
considers Pakistan to be the underdog struggling against India, and
wants to maintain balance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   China and India have a common border and a history of conflict.
In Chinese thinking, Garver said, ``as long as India is constrained
by Pakistan on its west side, then it will be more cautious
elsewhere.''

SURPRISE FAILURE OF AN INTERCEPTOR DOOMS MISSILE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A crucial test in the Pentagon's program to defend
the United States from missile attacks collapsed in failure because
the high-speed interceptor that was supposed to destroy a dummy
warhead in space never separated from its booster rocket, the
Pentagon said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The separation failure was an unexpected setback in the
Pentagon's quest to demonstrate the workability of a complex
defensive system in time for President Clinton to decide whether to
proceed with its deployment before he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   The component that failed appeared not to be one of the
sophisticated, untested elements that the Pentagon was hoping to
demonstrate: the targeting radar, homing sensors and communications
links.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was a failure of unknown origin in a well-developed
technology that has been used successfully in the rockets that have
launched satellites and missiles for decades.
</P>
<P>
   It underscored the frailty of any such complex weapon system to
function reliably, even in the carefully controlled world of test
shots. And in a separate, somewhat paradoxical failure, the target
of the interceptor also failed to work when it did not properly
inflate a decoy balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of a 54-inch-long, 130-pound ``kill vehicle'' to
shed its booster a few minutes into flight and proceed to its
target was a given. When it failed to occur, the important part of
the $100 million test _ actually homing in precisely on the
collision in space _ was never even attempted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether separation of this kill vehicle from its booster
was at the bottom of his list of concerns, Lt. Gen. Ronald Kadish,
director of the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization,
gave a direct answer. ``It wasn't even on my list,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Never activating the sensors that would have let it find its
target, the kill vehicle streaked unguided into space, and few of
the critical technologies of the missile exercise were actually
tested.
</P>
<P>
   Kadish, who is in charge of the Pentagon's missile defense
program, appeared humbled by the chain of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it tells me is we have more engineering work to do,'' he
said at an early morning news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``And as we've said all along, this is a very difficult,
challenging job. This is rocket science, so there's a lot of things
that can happen in this process,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although he expressed confidence that the research program could
continue, the test failure complicates the political decision about
proceeding with deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should draw conclusions from any one test
that are irrevocable,'' Kadish said. ``No one test tells you
everything you need to know. We have a body of tests even before
this one that tells us an awful lot. And we have increasing
confidence as a result of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Saturday's test was only the third in a series of 19
intercept tests planned by the Pentagon, it was supposed to have
been the defining test that would have given Defense Secretary
William Cohen the ability to recommend that Clinton proceed with a
limited missile defense for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But both Kadish and Jacques Gansler, undersecretary of defense,
acquisitions, technology and logistics, made clear that Clinton and
Cohen might decide to seek more data before they judged whether a
plan to build a $60 billion defensive shield to ward off incoming
missiles was feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more flight tests,'' Gansler said. Both men said that
the program was on the right track, and that previous tests had
left them confident of eventual success.
</P>
<P>
   The next scheduled test will take place in October or November,
Gansler said.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that if construction was to begin on a radar system
on Shemya Island in the Aleutians in the spring, a decision should
be made before then.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon calculates that construction must begin next spring
if a limited missile defense is to be completed by 2005, when
Washington says that North Korea will be capable of fielding a
long-range missile.
</P>
<P>
   The failure could enable Clinton to delay making a decision at
least until after the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Both Russia and China adamantly oppose the plan to build a
national missile defense because they consider it a threat to their
own nuclear deterrent. Even the United States' closest European
allies are distressed that the country would take such a drastic
unilateral move to defend its own territory.
</P>
<P>
   Building a missile defense would require a change in the 1972
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which Russia has refused to accept.
</P>
<P>
   In October, the Pentagon hailed its first test as a complete
success, but later acknowledged that the kill vehicle initially had
drifted off course and picked out the large bright decoy balloon
instead of the mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   In a second, more complicated test in January, the kill vehicle
missed the mock warhead by 300 to 400 feet after a cooling line
clogged and shut down its heat-seeking sensors.
</P>
<P>
   The test Saturday morning was delayed by two hours after a
technical problem was discovered in the target missile that was to
launch the mock warhead.
</P>
<P>
   After technicians fixed the problem, a gleaming white
reconfigured Minuteman intercontinental ballistic missile with a
dummy warhead atop its second-stage rocket thundered aloft over the
Pacific Ocean from Vandenberg Air Force Base, 125 miles north of
Los Angeles at 12:19 a.m. Eastern time.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one minutes later, the rocket containing the kill vehicle
lifted off from Kwajalein Atoll about 4,300 miles away in the
Pacific Ocean. The kill vehicle was supposed to separate from the
second-stage rocket booster two minutes and 37 seconds into flight,
then move into the path of the mock warhead for a spectacular,
blinding collision at 16,000 mph.
</P>
<P>
   But television monitors showed no bright white flash indicating
a collision. About 30 minutes later, officials who monitored the
flight test in the Pentagon told reporters that the kill vehicle
had sailed by its target.
</P>
<P>
   In his analysis of the failed test, Gansler said that future
tests of a new rocket booster still in development were more
important than Saturday's malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the advanced radar of the kind that might be built
on Shemya was working well so far. It was the test radar, he said,
that showed that a decoy balloon which was part of Saturday's test
had not inflated properly.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the interceptor to break free and of the decoy to
inflate meant that essentially nothing was learned about what the
engineers called the ``terminal phase'' of the test, the actual
identification of the target and its interception in space.

ANALYSIS: MISSILE FAILURE CARRIES POLITICAL COST 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ With the failure Saturday of the Pentagon's
anti-missile test, the Clinton administration has reaped all of the
diplomatic disadvantages of its program to build a national missile
defense and none of the potential rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's program has led to an arms stalemate with
Moscow. It has strained relations with Beijing. And it has raised
alarms in Western Europe, where U.S. allies fear the anti-missile
program could spur a new arms race and reflects a penchant to go it
alone on security policy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration had been hoping the test would demonstrate
that a new defensive system was virtually at hand and give it more
negotiating leverage with the Russians, who have been adamantly
opposed to the anti-missile plan. Now, as the Clinton
administration's days wind down, it has little to show for its
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the administration pursued missile defense was to
protect Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
nominee, against charges that the Clinton administration was soft
on defense. Even those political gains have been dissipated.
Republican supporters of missile defense are likely to criticize
the Clinton administration's management of the anti-missile
program.
</P>
<P>
   All military programs suffer setbacks from time to time, and the
test failure Saturday does not mean that a missile shield can never
be constructed. The failure occurred when the kill vehicle that was
supposed to slam into a dummy warhead failed to separate from its
booster. So the ability of the kill vehicle to intercept the
warhead _ the key capability that was to be assessed _ was never
actually put to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Still, after all the months of preparation, the failure was an
unqualified embarrassment for the Pentagon and suggested that it
had been in too much of a rush to build a defense.
</P>
<P>
   The test failure also raised searching questions about the
Clinton administration's diplomacy, which seems to be out of sync
with the United States' technological capabilities. For almost a
year, the Clinton administration has been in the odd position of
lobbying Russia, China and Western Europe to acquiesce in the
Pentagon's anti-missile plans before that program has even gotten
off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Even before it can demonstrate the feasibility of its new
anti-missile technology, for example, the Clinton administration
has demanded that Moscow agree to amend the 1972 Anti-Ballistic
Missile Treaty, a move that is needed so that the Pentagon can
legally begin construction of a new battle-management radar in
Alaska and the deployment of 100 interceptors there.
</P>
<P>
   That U.S. demand has become a major obstacle in the quest to
negotiate a third strategic arms reduction treaty with the Russians
that would make deeper cuts in strategic nuclear arms. The Russians
have proposed that a Start III accord reduce strategic warheads to
a level of 1,500 warheads, while the United States has insisted on
2,000 to 2,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   But a Start III accord is not possible while the two sides are
at loggerheads over missile defenses. Washington has continued to
press for a compromise, and before Saturday's test, the Clinton
administration had calculated that a success might soften Moscow.
If the test worked, Washington would be to able to tell the
Russians that the momentum toward a missile shield was all but
unstoppable and that they would be wise to negotiate a broad
understanding on defensive and offensive systems before President
Clinton's term ran out. If the Russians failed to amend the ABM
accord during Clinton's term, a future administration might simply
abandon the agreement _ or so the argument went.
</P>
<P>
   The test failure, however, undercut that diplomatic strategy.
Emboldened by the test failure, Russia reaffirmed its opposition to
the missile defense plan Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In its current technical form, the national missile defense
system, which is being tested, cannot guarantee the protection of
U.S. territory,'' said Gen. Vladimir Yakovlev, the commander of
Russia's strategic missile force. ``Even the first trials, which
began with a failure, are an attempt by the U.S. military to defy
the world community.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may be a silver lining in the dark cloud for
Clinton. He has faced the difficult decision of whether to move
ahead with an anti-missile program in the face of Russian
opposition and concerns that it would violate the ABM treaty. Now,
he has a justification to leave that decision to a future
administration.
</P>
<P>
   And the test failure may also lead to some rethinking of the
potential missile threat from Third World states and how to deal
with it. One reason the administration has wanted to move quickly
with the system and the diplomacy to allow it is the intelligence
assessments about the evolving missile threat.
</P>
<P>
   The only country that has the potential over the next several
years to field an ocean-spanning missile that could strike the
United States with a nuclear payload is North Korea, which could
have such a weapon ready by 2005. And North Korea cannot do so as
long as its observes a moratorium on missile flight tests, a ban it
has recently agreed to extend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, advocates of missile defense have argued that North Korea
might break out of that accord and build a rudimentary
intercontinental-range missile in a matter of months. Even though
the United States has more than 6,000 nuclear warheads, the
proponents of a national missile defense insist, that might not be
sufficient to deter an attack.
</P>
<P>
   With the test failure, however, the Pentagon's goal to deploy a
limited defense by 2005 is likely to slip. And that goal has
already been criticized by some military experts as too optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Missile defense advocates may not like the idea of relying on
deterrence, but the test results Saturday indicate that the United
States has no choice but to depend on it for years to come.

<P>
   STRASBOURG, France _ Look carefully at the class pictures in the
lobby of France's National School of Administration and you can
find just about everyone who counts in French politics today _ back
when they all still had hair.
</P>
<P>
   For more than four decades, this school, dedicated to shaping
top students for a life in government, has done just that with
enormous success. Two of France's last three presidents and six of
its last eight prime ministers have been graduates.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been easy to get into this state-subsidized finishing
school for the elite, known here as ENA. The exams are legendary
for their difficulty. The odds of success have sometimes been as
high as 200 to 1. But not today.
</P>
<P>
   In an undeniable sign of all that is changing in France, the
number of applicants to the school has dropped 30 percent in the
last four years, despite the guarantee of a government job on
graduation.
</P>
<P>
   These days, France has perhaps the fastest growing economy in
Europe. The government is privatizing many of its assets. The
French stock market is booming. International mergers seem to occur
every week and successful start-ups are making overnight
millionaires of people who have not gone the traditional routes.
Suddenly it is acceptable to talk openly about making money.
</P>
<P>
   Government work, once considered the epitome of power and
prestige here, is no longer, it seems, so desirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a disaffection with ENA, there is indeed a
revolution going on,'' said Jean d'Ormesson, a prominent French
intellectual and writer. ``All the young ones think only of
starting their own businesses. It's almost dangerous because some
will certainly fail. But there is an energy out there and it
refuses to be contained by bureaucracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even ENA officials, scrambling to overhaul both the school's
recruitment and its curriculum, feel that the mood in France is
against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that today this kind of training looks
less attractive to some young people,'' said Raymond-Francois Le
Bris, the school's director. ``Working for the state seems heavy.
It does not seem to represent the right market values to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In France, ``serving the state'' has always been held highly.
And in the recent past, as the country struggled with a sluggish
economy and double-digit inflation, it was also where the young and
ambitious turned, as long as they could master the rigid
advance-through-tests procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The current crop of ENA students still talk about doing more
with their lives than earning fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago when I had the choice _ private industry or
this _ I decided that I would rather be of service than sell yogurt
or a car,'' said Roland Husson, 24, who would like a career in
diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   But surveys show that France's young people are far more likely
to be in awe of the director of a fledgling Internet company
working out of a maid's room than of the high-powered functionaries
their parents so admired. They are also more often risk takers
ready to bet on their own creativity.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of students in a dozen of France's most
prestigious schools found that about 12 percent wanted to start
their own companies as soon as they got out of school. Another 40
percent wanted to start their own business sometime in their life.
Surveys a few years ago showed little such interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, you just got in the pipeline: there was very
little of the self-made man,'' said Jerome Chapuisat, the director
of the government agency that provides students with information
about educational options. ``We haven't completely destroyed that
system yet. But it is beginning to crumble from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   While the National School of Administration ponders how to
remake itself, other schools are thriving.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, for instance, is a private computer and
telecommunications college, known from its initials as EPITA, where
the number of applicants has grown by 25 percent each of the last
three years, even though students must pay about $4,500 a year for
their schooling. The National School of Administration is free.
</P>
<P>
   The corridors of EPITA do not gleam like those at ENA, which is
housed in an artfully renovated 19th-century prison in Strasbourg
not far from the European Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   At EPITA, the worn carpeting buckles. But the classrooms, packed
with computer terminals, never shut down.
</P>
<P>
   The government's effort to reduce the work week to 35 hours is
routinely ridiculed here.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Margaine, a second-year EPITA student, said he spent
more time than that in one of the school's labs cruising the
Internet for interesting new sites and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   At EPITA, the dream is to start your own business before
graduation, and to make millions by the time you are 35. ``We are
going for it full speed, no fear,'' Margaine said. ``Doing a
start-up doesn't scare us. It would be great to go like crazy for
10 or 15 years, make a lot of money and then relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Some educators say that France's whole system of education and
promotion, once heavily reliant on tests and schools like ENA, is
beginning to be questioned. Private schools are drawing more and
more students; educators say they are better able to adapt to the
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big schools like ENA are not as recognized as they were,''
said Dominique Herault, an Education Ministry official who writes
reports on educational trends. ``They are not considered as
important as 10 or 20 years ago. The whole spectrum of information
and commerce is seeing an increase. Even the whole idea that
security is a job in a big company is not the same anymore.''

</P>
<P>
   As the country's most prestigious school, ENA has faced some of
the harshest criticism. The school was founded by Charles de Gaulle
after World War II. He wanted the very best French minds to fill
out the bureaucracy. The curriculum focused on ordering and
presenting ideas. But in recent years it has come under attack as
an out-of-date institution that produces a group of elites who
think alike, speak alike and protect each other, with little feel
for the average citizen. Directly and indirectly, it has been
blamed whenever the government seems out of touch with real life.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, after spending 27 months at the
school, students are offered life-long employment with the
government. In fact, based on their test scores, they were able to
pick whatever job they wanted. They are often in top management
positions by their mid-20s, though they have little or no hands-on
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The school's graduates have lately become the butt of many
jokes. In one, implying that ENA technocrats do not see things very
clearly, a young man stops by a herd of sheep and bets the shepherd
he can count them at one glance. If he can do it, he gets to keep
one. The young man gets the answer right and goes to collect his
winnings. But the farmer offers a counter-bet. If he can tell the
young man what school he attended, he gets to keep his animal. The
young man agrees. ``ENA,'' says the farmer.
</P>
<P>
   ``How did you know?'' asks the young man. ``Because that is my
dog you've got under your arm.''
</P>
<P>
   The school, Le Bris insists, is still doing a good job. But he
has overhauled its recruitment efforts, trying with new living
stipends to reach a more diverse population than in the past. He
has also made changes to the curriculum, including more courses on
international relations, ethics, negotiation and European Union
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most noteworthy, he says, students must now devise and
actually complete a project during their internships in government
agencies. This could mean that they devise schedules for a road
construction plan, or a way of running a department with 10 percent
less staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to get away from that label that we analyze but
we don't actually teach them to put their ideas to work,'' Le Bris
said. ``We want them to have more contact with reality.''
</P>
<P>
   But the changes have not satisfied all the school's critics.
</P>
<P>
   Some say they do not yet go to the core of a system that is
based on advancement through tests. One member of the school's
board of directors, Jacques Julliard, quit recently and gave a copy
of his resignation letter to a weekly magazine. In it, he asked
whether it was normal, ``indeed even conceivable,'' that young
people would, ``through a test, with only their intellectual
abilities on show, be able to get top jobs without any real life
experience.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 12:03 Saturday morning, 8-year-old Gabriel
Back-Gaal was standing guard over the door of the Community
Bookstore in Brooklyn. Behind him stretched a line of hundreds of
children and parents, all awaiting their first chance to buy
``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the fourth book in the
wildly popular series about the exploits of Harry Potter, the boy
wizard.
</P>
<P>
   To many it was a historic occasion _ some even brought cameras
to record the purchase. ``Harry Potter has been your life for the
last year,'' Gabriel's mother, Adina Back, said to him as they
counted the minutes. ``You mean two years,'' he corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the store, Susan Scioli, its owner, and a handful of
employees and friends were putting the finishing touches on
decorations and accessories for the occasion _ cobwebs, dry ice,
and refreshments contrived to resemble those served in the novel,
like Bertie Botts' Every Flavor Beans and Butter Beer.
</P>
<P>
   A Barnes &AMP; Noble store up the street was throwing a rival Harry
Potter party, and Scioli risked seeing her customers slip away.
Finally, at about 12:03, she drew back a curtain covering the store
front and a witch ran out to ring a giant gong kicking off the
festivities.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night of bedtime amnesty across the United States as
children and parents made treks to bookstores opening just after
midnight to capitalize on the enormous pent-up demand for the new
title, with Harry Potter parties, gimmicks and stunts.
</P>
<P>
   The novel, whose title was kept secret nearly to the last week,
is the latest installment in a planned seven-book series by J.K.
Rowling chronicling the education of Harry Potter at the Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   Following the extraordinary success of the three previous Harry
Potter books, the book's publishers enforced strict secrecy about
its contents and required booksellers to keep all copies under
wraps until 12:01 a.m. Saturday, heightening the suspense and the
pandemonium when the moment finally arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Not since ``Gone With the Wind'' had a best-selling book swept
the nation the way Harry Potter has, the booksellers say. The first
three titles dominated best-seller lists last year and have already
racked up sales of more than 18 million copies in the United States
alone.
</P>
<P>
   With the publication of the fourth, Harry Potter has become a
phenomenon in both book publishing and children's culture. For the
moment, the hottest trend at elementary schools and summer camps is
not a video game or a movie _ it is a old-fashioned, ink-and-paper
book.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never been anything like this is the history of book
selling,'' said Steve Riggio, vice chairman of Barnes &AMP; Noble. ``I
think this could be the most profitable book we ever sold _ if we
can get kids hooked on a seven-book series, hopefully we could get
them hooked on reading for life.'' He said Barnes &AMP; Noble and its
online store recorded 360,000 orders for the book before its
publication, more than 10 times as many as for any previous title.
</P>
<P>
   Parents, delighted that their children are reading, find book
shopping an especially hard indulgence to refuse, even if it means
standing in long lines until 1 a.m. Saturday. ``If it gets kids
reading, it's good,'' said John Turturro, the actor, who waited at
Community Books with his son, Amedeo, 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry Potter really got my daughter reading _ she didn't read
books before, and now she loves it,'' said Lorraine Stern, standing
with her daughter near a trio of witches who were cavorting in the
lobby of the Barnes &AMP; Noble near Lincoln Center in Manhattan at 9
p.m. Friday. ``At school, everybody comes up to each other asking,
`Did you read the new Harry Potter?''' said her daughter, Hannah,
11. ``If I didn't get it this weekend, I'd be really mad.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking in the scene at Barnes &AMP; Noble, Hannah and her
mother planned to buy their copy at a bookstore near their home in
Long Island. Hannah might be exhausted from the late-night
expedition for her softball team's playoff game Saturday, her
mother said, but she reasoned that the opposing team would be out
late book shopping, too.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught of excited children created bedlam at bookstores,
many of which ran out of books. The Borders bookstore in Santa Fe,
N.M., hired a trio of magicians to perform, invited customers to
attend in wizard costume, and insisted that its staff dress up,
too.
</P>
<P>
   But customers had already reserved 500 of the 580 copies in
stock, and the rest sold out between 12 and 12:15. ``It's that
cabbage-patch doll mentality all over again,'' said the party's
organizer, Bay Anapol. ``People have been calling panic-stricken
over not being able to get a book,'' she said. Community Books, in
Brooklyn, started the night with about 300 copies, 250 of them
already reserved, and shortly after 1 a.m. it had run out, too.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Marcus, president of children's books at Scholastic
Inc., the book's American publisher, insists that there are still
plenty of copies on hand. The company gave the book a first
printing of 3.8 million copies, the largest ever. That is more than
the previous Harry Potter title sold in all of last year, when it
was the best-selling hardcover book in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first printing is already in stores, and the company
has scheduled additional printings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   In some places, the promotion surrounding the book began to
intrude on the book sales. A half-dozen television crews turned up
at Books of Wonder, a children's specialty bookstore in Manhattan,
and irked some customers by trying to push them out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customers were well behaved, but the media was not,'' the
owner, Peter Glassman, said. ``These people were acting like this
was for their benefit instead of the customers. It's a children's
book event, not a summit between Clinton and Putin.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Korves, an architect whose office is up the street from
Books of Wonder, knew what kind of crowd to expect. Last year he
waited with his daughter, Alexandra, 9, to get a book signed by the
author, J.K. Rowling, and the line stretched down the block.
(Rowling, who lives in England, signed more than 1,000 books that
night.)
</P>
<P>
   This time, he stationed himself outside the store at around 9:30
and tried to read a thick stack of documents by street light. His
daughter took a nap before joining him at 11 ``for the party,'' he
said. She was the first to receive a copy of the book at the store,
and suffered a bout of stage fright when several television
cameramen closed in.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents were out at midnight just to send a copy of the
book to children at summer camps, where interest in the new volume
has been keen. The Point O'Pines Camp in Brant Lake has been
gripped by a Harry Potter frenzy, said Stephanie Schwartz, 22, a
staff member and herself a Potter fan. She said a quick dinner-time
poll indicated that at least a third of the camp's 300 girls
expected to receive a copy in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Some independent stores, like Community Books, saw the hoopla as
a chance to win customers from competing chains. David Bolduc,
owner of the Boulder Book Store, in Boulder, Colo., is bracing for
the opening this fall of a new Borders store in its neighborhood.
His store drew 500 people to a Harry Potter costume contest. About
100 people dressed for the occasion, including more than a few
adults.
</P>
<P>
   Online bookstores have also been trying to capitalize on the
Harry Potter mania for months with author interviews, online
discussions, and Harry Potter Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com has tried to sell everything from glittery capes to
gas-powered barbecue equipment under a Hogwarts theme. The
nationwide release date initially precluded them from shipping
books until Saturday, which meant they wouldn't arrive until
Monday, a huge disadvantage. But after Bloomsbury Press, Harry
Potter's British publisher, relented, allowing some stores in
Britain to ship early for delivery Saturday, Scholastic began to
allow the same arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, everyone in line for the book already knew that at
752 pages, ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' is far longer
than its predecessors. Harry Potter's young readers, though, saw
the length as nothing but a boon. Many of them said they had
already read the previous books more than once while waiting for
this one.
</P>
<P>
   But many were still surprised at its heft. ``I'm reading it to
my 5-year-old son,'' said Robert Helfand, picking up his copy at
the Community Bookstore, ``I'm buying a lot of throat spray.''

PUTIN PRESCRIBES STRONG DEMOCRACY FOR RUSSIA'S ILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir Putin assembled both houses of
Parliament and a national television audience Saturday to present
his assessment of the state of the nation. In a word, it was
forbidding.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of independence, he said, Russians have built
only ``the carcass of a civic society'' and have yet to shoulder
such basic obligations as obeying laws. A falling birth rate and an
aging population threaten to make Russia ``a senile nation.'' The
economy, which lately has perked up, actually is a house of cards
supported by high oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The growing gap between advanced nations and Russia,'' Putin
warned, ``is pushing us into the group of Third World countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, perhaps, Putin said not much can be remedied until
Parliament ratifies his plans to concentrate power in the Kremlin
and destroy the barnacled system of regulations, hidden favors and
political empire-building that is strangling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's 50-minute state-of-Russia speech _ like the American
State of the Union, it is now an annual tradition for Kremlin
leaders _ was perhaps his most pungent analysis of Russia's
problems to date.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been most notable, however, for his emphatic and, at
some points, seemingly emotional commitment to building a
democracy. The Kremlin's heavy-handed treatment of some critics and
its sweeping efforts to reassert its rule in the provinces have led
some to charge that Putin is edging the nation into authoritarian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Putin explicitly dismissed ``speculations on the theme of
dictatorship and authoritarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is extremely clear,'' he said. ``It is only a
strong, an effective _ if somebody does not like the word `strong'
_ it is only an effective state and a democratic state that is
capable of protecting civic, political and economic freedoms. It
alone can create conditions for the comfortable life of people and
the flourishing of our homeland.''
</P>
<P>
   He strongly endorsed the notion of creating permanent political
parties ``with mass support and solid prestige,'' like those in
Western nations, as well as a system for nominating presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong government has an interest in having strong
opponents,'' he said. ``It is only in conditions of political
competition that serious dialogue on the development of our state
is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made special mention of the press, saying that ``without
a really free mass media, Russian democracy simply will not
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why we must guarantee journalists real rather than
phony freedom, and create legal and economic conditions in the
country for a civilized information business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has been repeatedly criticized over the Kremlin's
treatment of the press. The government recently claimed the right
to license newspapers, and it has exerted strong economic and legal
pressure on the owner of Russia's only independent television
network.
</P>
<P>
   But the president suggested Saturday that the real threat to the
media comes from warring tycoons who control most outlets, saying
press freedom ``has become a juicy morsel for politicians and major
financial groups and a handy tool in the struggle between clans.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaking in the vast chamber of the 450-member lower house of
Parliament, or Duma, Putin pounded home the argument that
democracy, a thriving economy and a strong state depend on one
another.
</P>
<P>
   Most of what he said was certain to please foreign investors,
who have begun to trickle back into Russia two years after an
economic crash made business for many almost untenable.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin has proposed a sheaf of reforms, led by an overhaul
of the bewildering tax system, to spur economic development. But on
Saturday Putin said those moves will fail unless both Moscow and
the provinces embrace democratic principles that give businesses
freedom from government interference and guarantee equal
application of law.
</P>
<P>
   The address was devoted almost wholly to domestic issues. But
Putin reserved a few sentences for thinly veiled criticisms of
Western critics, even as he asserted that the Cold War was over.
</P>
<P>
   Among ``the grim consequences'' of that period, he said, was the
doctrine that nations could intervene in other nations' affairs for
humanitarian reasons, as NATO forces did in their bombing of
Yugoslavia. He also complained that the war in Chechnya had been
depicted to outsiders ``in a biased and one-sided manner,'' and
said that setting the record straight was important to Russia's
reputation and security.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLINAS, Calif. _ It is the Howard Hughes of towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to come to Bolinas,'' Vic Amoroso was
saying, adhering to the conventional wisdom in this famously
reclusive place that no publicity is good publicity unless it is
bad. ``The beaches are dirty, the Fire Department is terrible, the
natives are hostile and have a tendency toward cannibalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Long known for its live-and-let-live attitude (except toward
visitors, whom it would just as soon not let live), this spirited
community of surfers, poets, artists, writers and aging mavericks
about 30 miles up the coast from San Francisco has reached a
tipping point of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere is the Bay Area's relentless collision between
hippie-van and BMW culture becoming more pronounced than in this
preternaturally beautiful place at the tip of a peninsula, where
earthy hand-built houses topped with lurching towers commune with
shingled New England-style cottages with achingly sweet gardens.
Two recent developments typify the threat that many see to the
town's personality.
</P>
<P>
   First there was the rumor, plastered across the front page of
The San Francisco Chronicle, that Martha Stewart had bought a house
here. The news, which Stewart's spokeswoman denied, prompted a wave
of satire that inspired one wag to put up a sign along Highway 1 _
the official signs pointing the way to Bolinas having been torn
down by locals long ago _ that read, ``Martha: 2 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the decision to cancel the annual Fourth of July
parade, a tradition for 130 years. That step followed a Fourth
celebration last year in which thousands of outsiders bearing
coolers showed up, throwing firecrackers out of cars, fighting and
trashing the beach.
</P>
<P>
   An unincorporated village (population about 2,500) without a
mayor or a city hall, Bolinas has a long history of not only
tolerance but also environmentalism, having waged a successful
campaign to control development. Richard Brautigan and the
Jefferson Airplane lived here. Trees are pruned by Ferlinghetti's
Compact Tractor and Chipper Service, run by Lorenzo Ferlinghetti,
Lawrence's son. On special occasions, the Bolinas Bay Bakery has
been known to whip up brownies made with kava, an herb that acts as
a relaxant, and tie-dyed carrot cakes.
</P>
<P>
   It is home both to Susie Tompkins Buell, co-founder of the
fashion company Esprit, who recently caused a furor by planting
cypress saplings on the border of her estate and so created a
potential to block views of the hillside from the road, and to
Lloyd Kahn, a surfer who once built a geodesic dome of vinyl
pillows inflated with nitrogen and who founded Shelter
Publications, a small, scrappy publishing house here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a cul-de-sac,'' said the 77-year-old retired
postmaster, Annie Crotts, a Bolinas native who sings the national
anthem on the Fourth each year from the balcony of Smiley's
Schooner Saloon. ``People come here for all sorts of reasons.
Either they don't like it and leave immediately, or they stay and
become part of the scene. Then they want to keep it to
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   To those who love the town, the contrasts are becoming
increasingly disturbing: Even as the annual Sun Festival to welcome
newborn babies was being held a while back, three people were
stabbed on the beach. The Free Box, a local landmark where free
clothes are distributed from a shed painted with rainbows, seems
strangely quaint beside the inexorable march of Bay Area wealth
that has caused real estate prices here to skyrocket 30 percent in
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The question hanging like summer fog over this topographically
insular community, surrounded by county, state and federal
parkland, is whether a small place with limited resources,
particularly water, can retain its character when real estate is
such that venture capitalists are snapping up dun-colored hills
where mule deer now graze.
</P>
<P>
   The other day, 125 townspeople showed up for a community meeting
about the influx of visitors, especially ``belligerent young males
fueled with alcohol and beach air who come to Bolinas with the
intention of getting really wasted,'' in the words of Steve Kinsey,
president of the Marin County Board of Supervisors, the town's
official governing body. And with telecommuting to San Francisco an
increasingly accessible option to outsiders who would like to live
in Bolinas, ``tearing down signs on Highway 1 is not enough to keep
people from getting here,'' Kinsey said.
</P>
<P>
   Bolinas originated as a Mexican land grant that included Stinson
Beach, now a surfing mecca on the other side of the lagoon. The
town has had a variety of past lives, among them as a seaside
resort for San Franciscans fleeing the fog.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, two Chevron tankers collided near the Golden Gate
Bridge, sending more than 800,000 gallons of oil into the channels
of the lagoon. The spectacle of oil-coated seabirds struggling to
shore brought hundreds of hippies out of the hills to save the sea
life. Many of them stayed, and became increasingly alarmed at town
officials' plans to turn the place into another Carmel, including a
yacht club and marina on the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fight city hall, the newcomers took it over _
specifically, the town water district, the locus of political
decision-making. The board placed a moratorium on new water meters,
effectively halting development.
</P>
<P>
   The post-hippie coalition still controls the town, including the
existing water meters, which have become as wildly sought after as
precious art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Occasionally,'' said Amoroso, president of the water
district's board, ``a house will fall off a cliff, and the water
connection can be sold.'' The last one sold at a dot-commer price:
$140,000.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who fear that success may spoil Bolinas is Magda
Cregg, a 75-year-old sculptor who is the mother of the pop singer
Huey Lewis and who describes herself as ``one of the hippies who
came to clean up the oil spill, slept in the community center and
never left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge fortunes change the town,'' Cregg said. ``It's gotten
kind of feudal. The have-nots are working for the haves. It used to
be a town of alternative lifestyles, people who figured out how to
live on a pretty minimal scale. Now it'll be a hideout for Silicon
Valley millionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   Her suspicions seemed supported early one morning when Jim
Hubble, a 55-year-old retired money manager from Berkeley, emerged
tan and fit from his station wagon and proceeded to hoist a wet
suit over his knees. His luck in the stock market, he explained, is
giving him the excuse to make good on a longstanding fantasy to
learn how to surf, making him a living inversion of the famous
Beach Boys song (sitting on top of the world, then catching a
wave).
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Hubble is thinking of buying property here.
``It would probably be a better investment than the stock market,''
he said, before heading out to the swells. ``Because there's only
one Bolinas.''

AFRICAN METHODIST EPISCOPALIANS MAY VOTE WOMEN AS BISHOPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE GOODSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although women outnumber men sitting in the pews of the African
Methodist Episcopal Church and studying in its seminaries, the
denomination has never had a female bishop in its 203-year history.
</P>
<P>
   That may change on Monday, when the AME Church plans to elect
bishops from among a candidate pool that includes two women. Both
women are campaigning using the slogan, ``It's time.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 leaders of the AME Church, the nation's oldest
predominantly black denomination, are gathering in Cincinnati from
July 5-12 for the church's general conference, which meets every
four years to determine policy and elect department heads and
bishops.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time in the history of the church that women
have had a viable opportunity to be bishop,'' said Bishop William
DeVeaux, president of the church's council of bishops. ``We've had
women run before, but they were in no way considered to have a
chance. There was almost a sense of condescension toward their
candidacy. But now we have women running who are truly viable.''
</P>
<P>
   If the AME Church elects a woman bishop, it would be the first
among the three predominantly black Methodist denominations to do
so, said DeVeaux. The African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church and
the Christian Methodist Episcopal Church have never had women
bishops, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Methodist Church became the first American
denomination to elect a woman as bishop in 1981, and the Episcopal
Church consecrated its first woman bishop in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The AME Church traces its history to 1787, when black
churchgoers protesting segregated worship walked out of a Methodist
Episcopal church in Philadelphia. It now has more than 8,000
churches and about 2.3 million members, including 1.5 million in
the United States and most of the rest in Africa, the Caribbean,
Canada and England.
</P>
<P>
   The AME Church has 20 bishops, and at least two are retiring
this year.Among the 41 candidates running for those seats are the
Rev. Vashti Murphy McKenzie, pastor of Payne Memorial AME Church in
Baltimore, and the Rev. Carolyn Tyler Guidry, who as a presiding
elder supervises 19 AME churches in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a stained-glass ceiling in this church, and a lot of
it has to do with sexism,'' McKenzie said in a telephone interview.
``But our church is now recognizing that the women have the talent,
the skills, the degrees, the experience. The women in our church
have more degrees behind their names than you can count.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidry, who ran for bishop four years ago and lost, said she
believed that the church was finally ready for a woman to be
bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, she said by telephone, ``Women had not been in
the positions of presiding elder, or pastors of major churches, and
so had not made a major impact in our denomination. That has
changed in the last 10 years, and Dr. McKenzie and I have become
major players in the church.''
</P>
<P>
   The AME Church began ordaining women as deacons in 1948 and as
ministers in 1960. The church has never had a theological basis for
excluding women from the episcopate, DeVeaux said. But it is only
in recent years that bishops began appointing women ministers to
the large, prominent congregations that have traditionally been the
stepping-stones to bishops' seats, DeVeaux said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are putting women in key positions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the general conference, 1,800 delegates, including members of
the clergy and laity, will vote in the bishops election. A majority
is needed to elect a bishop, and the vote often takes several
rounds of balloting.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution to set aside one bishop's seat for a woman was
proposed on Friday, while some delegates on the convention floor
cheered and chanted, ``It's about time.'' The resolution was
referred to the Episcopal Committee, which handles matters
concerning bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Jamye Coleman Williams, one of the sponsors of the resolution
and a retired church officer, said: ``In our church, the majority
of members and the majority of seminary enrollees are women. So it
is not fair to deny them full inclusion. It's sort of like the
civil rights battle, where nobody wants to give up power. People
just don't want to relinquish power without a fight.''

HOUSING SHORTAGE CONFOUNDS A PROSPEROUS NEW YORK CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE LAMBERT  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As it enters the new millennium with restored can-do
bravado, this city has cut crime, welfare and taxes and added jobs
and surpluses. New office towers are rising. City leaders are
dreaming again, planning for a new stock exchange site, a new
Pennsylvania Station, baseball stadiums, a train to the plane, even
a Second Avenue subway.
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, it seems, this thriving city is a great place to
live _ if only you could live here.
</P>
<P>
   But New Yorkers are suffering in the grip of the worst housing
shortage in decades, with soaring prices to match. That verdict is
virtually unanimous among business and real estate executives,
experts in academia, community leaders, planners, politicians and
housing advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has tried to move recently knows the problem
firsthand. This is the reality of today's market:
</P>
<P>
   _ Across the city, one in four households spends more than half
its income for rent, the Census Bureau says. Vacancy rates are
negligible. Adjusted for inflation, median renter income has
increased 3 percent since 1975, while median rent has increased 33
percent. Middle-class people say they feel priced out of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the high end, the average cost of Manhattan co-ops and
condominiums south of Harlem has broken the $700,000 barrier.
Multimillion-dollar deals raise few eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   _ Overcrowding abounds, with families doubled up and immigrants
squirreled away in illegal dwellings carved out of attics,
basements and garages. The stock of rentals for less than $500 a
month has shrunk by 55 percent in eight years.
</P>
<P>
   _ At the lower rungs, the inflation-adjusted value of welfare's
housing allowance has fallen more than half since 1975. The waiting
list for public housing has 130,000 families; the list for rent
vouchers has 215,000. On a typical night, shelters take in nearly
5,000 families and 7,000 single people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Though demand for housing is rising, driven by population
growth, especially immigration, and by more jobs, supply is not
keeping pace. From 1981 to 1999, the city grew by 350,000 people
but added only 42,000 rental apartments. The era of major
construction is over: there is no recent parallel to Lefrak City or
MetLife's Parkchester and Stuyvesant Town. From the modern peak of
60,000 new dwellings in 1963, annual production has slowed to a
trickle. ``We celebrated when we passed the 10,000-unit mark last
year, but in truth we should be building 30,000 or 40,000,'' said
Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although nearly everyone agrees New York has a housing problem,
there is no consensus on what to do. ``The real question is, what
is the remedy?'' said Peter D. Salins, who has written and lectured
extensively on housing. He has likened the apartment shortage to
``a vast game of musical chairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward S. Hochman, chairman of the city's Rent Guidelines Board,
said, ``It's grim out there.'' At a recent meeting, the board heard
the voices behind the statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that rent was one week's salary, but I'm now
dipping into my third week,'' said Vincenza Furst, 63, a working
mother in a $1,200-a-month Greenwich Village apartment. ``I was
born and bred here, I was married here and I raised my son here,
but I may not be able to die here.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's shortage is a slow-motion crisis that has been long in
the making and getting worse, two new reports conclude.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for the Homeless has issued ``Housing a Growing
City: New York's Bust in Boom Times'' by Patrick Markee. The other
study, ``Homeward Bound: A 21st Century Affordable Housing Agenda
for New York,'' is being prepared for the Century Foundation and
City University Graduate Center by Martha E. Stark of Baruch
College and Doug Turetsky of United Neighborhood Houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' the coalition says, ``New York City enters
the new century without a plan to house the next generation of New
Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the pessimism, ideas abound. Those who have them tend to
fall into two camps: those who say government should step in, and
those who say it should butt out.
</P>
<P>
   Government is the Problem
</P>
<P>
   Free-market proponents like Salins say New York's complicated
rent laws are a root cause and should be abolished, a move that
tenants' groups oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts focus on cutting building costs. Or they call for
streamlining the maze of municipal codes and the cumbersome
approval process. Some hope for philanthropic help.
</P>
<P>
   New York's regulations are often called the nation's most
complex. ``You've got to make it easier to build stuff,'' said
Howard A. Husock, a housing expert at Harvard's Kennedy School of
Government. These critics call for simplifying rules on zoning,
building, the environment, landmarks and access for the disabled
and land review procedures that invite not-in-my-backyard
resistance. They look approvingly to New Jersey, which has
encouraged rehabilitation of old housing, exempting it from
new-construction codes.
</P>
<P>
   Construction costs here are also the highest in the country.
``My members will build if they can make a profit,'' said Spinola,
the real estate board president. One academic study made 65
proposals to combat corruption, union rules and restrictive codes.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts insist that the city simply needs to find new
places and ways to build, developing industrial zones, for example,
allowing higher-density construction and redeveloping brown fields
_ land that is polluted, but not with toxic waste _ the
long-ignored waterfront, neglected neighborhoods and urban areas
outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The entire middle class does not have to live in Manhattan
south of 96th Street,'' said Michael H. Schill, director of New
York University's real estate and urban policy center.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Government is the Solution
</P>
<P>
   But for all the talk of streamlining government and freeing up
the market, many say the toughest hurdle to adequate housing is
simply lack of money, government money. They call for a broad
thrust by government, through renewed construction, grants,
vouchers, loans and tax breaks, like the deals made for corporate
headquarters and the $255 million awarded to relocate the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Even some free-market advocates like Arthur Zabarkes, a senior
fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute, say government aid,
like tax breaks, is vital. ``Without public help, I don't think it
can be done,'' he said. Joseph Strasburg, president of the
landlords' Rent Stabilization Association, said, ``Somebody has got
to make up the difference between housing costs and what some
people can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Failing to relieve the shortage would be a strategic mistake,
many experts say. ``There's no question that the long-term success
of the city and this region would be seriously hampered,'' said H.
Claude Shostal, president of the nonprofit Regional Plan
Association. After polling major companies, State Comptroller H.
Carl McCall said last fall, ``The scarcity of housing and the high
price is driving employers away and keeping new employers from
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the New York City Partnership and Chamber of
Commerce, Robert R. Kiley, said, ``Businesses eager to locate or
expand here often go elsewhere and cite the lack of affordable
housing.'' His group has become the city's largest builder of such
dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   The city is bumping up against its debt limit and has rival
needs like the schools, but housing advocates have their eyes on
surpluses at every level. New York would get $337 million if the
Federal Housing Administration devoted its $5 billion surplus to
new housing, the Association for Neighborhood and Housing
Development says.
</P>
<P>
   The Community Service Society wants to revive the pledge of
Mayor Ed Koch and Gov. Mario Cuomo to earmark hundreds of millions
of dollars in Battery Park City revenues for housing.
</P>
<P>
   City and suburban officials have joined tenants to lobby Albany
for more housing. The Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia
Fields, and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, have called
for a trust fund. Others urge pension fund investments and help
from giant foundations like Ford and Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that government has cut back drastically.
Spending by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development
has been down for years. New York state sponsored 125,000
middle-income Mitchell-Lama apartments through the 1970s, including
Co-op City, but none since. Nor has the City Housing Authority
built major new projects.
</P>
<P>
   It is a far cry from the 1980's, when legions of homeless people
and the hulks of abandoned buildings intruded on the city's
conscience, and housing took center stage. Koch and Cuomo responded
with a $5 billion program that provided tens of thousands of
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Then social issues fell out of favor. The public often equated
housing programs with ``dynamited high-rise hellholes,'' although
New York has well-run public housing that never needed demolition,
said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State
Tenants and Neighbors Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The housing crisis is in a new phase,'' said Jenny Laurie,
director of the nonprofit Metropolitan Council on Housing.
``Wealthy people are gobbling up apartments, driving rents and
prices sky-high. Middle- and low-income tenants are left to battle
over the scarce crumbs.''
</P>
<P>
   Some say opinions seem to be shifting again. Working with
Habitat for Humanity, the Rev. Dr. Thomas K. Tewell of Fifth Avenue
Presbyterian Church said that the lack of housing ``is something
that I believe breaks the heart of God.'' Archdeacon Michael S.
Kendall, the housing chairman of the Commission of Religious
Leaders of New York City, said the mayor and the governor had been
receptive.
</P>
<P>
   And despite past retrenchment, myriad modest programs survive.
``The city and state have really come around in the last two
years,'' said Donald A. Capoccia, a builder who co-founded the
nonprofit New York State Association for Affordable Housing. But he
conceded that the efforts were only making dents in the huge need.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling New York's responses to past housing challenges, Lewis
Rudin, a developer for 53 years and chairman of the Association for
a Better New York, said, ``We just need some enlightened,
forward-looking political leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a point the governor's housing commissioner, Joseph B.
Lynch, would not dispute. ``Government,'' he said, ``may never
again have the opportunity to address the housing crisis as
effectively as it can in this era of economic expansion, record
surpluses and unprecedented prosperity _ all of which, ironically,
have contributed to the overheated housing market.''

VENUS WILLIAMS LIGHTS UP THE CENTER COURT
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The very instant a desperate forehand
volley slipped off Lindsay Davenport's racket, the mask cracked.
Venus Williams' furrowed brow and serious scowl gave way to pure
joy.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, she was on air, leaping across the lawn of Center
Court like a child twirling through a backyard sprinkler. She had
done it, just like her eccentric but clairvoyant father always
predicted. As Williams bounded up the stairs and climbed up to the
edge of the friends box to embrace her sister, Serena, she was
making a historic romp.
</P>
<P>
   With her 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory, Williams not only became the
first African-American woman to win Wimbledon since Althea Gibson
in 1958, Venus and Serena became the first sisters in tennis
history to each own a Grand Slam title. After Venus Williams
scampered back down to the court, she received the champions plate.
With her long wingspan, Venus Williams held it up high over her
head.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than the men's cup in my opinion,'' Venus Williams
proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning around for the cameras, Williams glowed as brightly at
the plate with a full-moon smile. In the background of Williams'
moment, her father and sister were close to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really great because I've been working so hard all my
life to be here,'' said Williams as she stood on court. ``It's
strange. I'd go to bed at night and I'd dream I'd won a Grand Slam,
but when I woke up, there was the nightmare. Now, I don't have to
wake up like that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Venus Williams isn't the old sister who hadn't won. She
isn't the one who set the stage for Serena, only to be a co-star.
She and Serena are part of a duo that threatens to overwhelm the
tennis scene for years to come. It was all part of their father's
unorthodox plan. In the friends box, Richard Williams held up a
sign that said, ``We love you Duke and Dutchess.'' Beneath the
hoopla, a dejected but gracious Davenport stood next to her
opponent and joined in on Williams appreciation day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Venus was playing well throughout the tournament,''
Davenport said. ``She was too strong at the end, and I congratulate
her on winning her first Grand Slam. Getting to the finals was a
great achievement for me, and I'm going to walk away holding my
head high.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Davenport never had a chance to play her best. Her
best opportunity to stop Venus Williams' momentum came in the 10th
game of the second set. Williams, serving for the match, seemed to
rush through her motions. After two double faults, Davenport then
benefited from a loose forehand by Williams that sailed long. The
second set was even at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   After each held serve, Williams took over the tiebreaker.
Davenport saved one match point with a service winner at 3-6. But
on match point, Davenport had to race forward for a short ball but
could not do anything with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think her win against Martina Hingis got her over the
hump,'' Davenport said. ``I was hopeful for a little more out of
myself. I tried hard and I was one or two points away from turning
it around. At the end, in the tiebreaker, she won the last few
points and that's what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players were left stirring in the locker room deep within
the stadium as a light drizzle delayed the start by about 20
minutes. For awhile, Davenport stood next to referee Alan Mills at
the doorway to the court, watching the skies with a chuckle or two.
In the friends box, Richard Williams, was keeping himself busy with
a magic marker and a grease board he brought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Mrs. Williams, I miss and love you,'' Richard Williams
wrote, showing his message to the cameras in hopes that his wife,
Oracene, would see if from Florida. Beside Richard Williams, Venus'
little sister, Serena, smiled at her father's busy work.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Venus Williams must have been applying a furrowed
brow and a hard stare. From the moment she appeared on the court,
she could have shattered mirrors with her mental focus. There was
no hint of a smile, no ounce of giddiness, no look of childlike awe
as she barely surveyed her surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Once she endured a nervous first game filled with overkill on
her ground strokes, once she absorbed an opening break of serve,
Williams began to harness her energy. Methodically, she began
defusing Davenport's power by running her from side to side with
penetrating backhands that crushed the white lines with uncanny
accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   By forcing Davenport to lunge and hit a short ball off a
desperate get, Williams then pounced on any short ball at midcourt
with the zeal of a cat on yarn. To get to a break point during the
fourth game of the first set, Williams used her racket like a
remote control as she ran Davenport from side to side until she
either found an opening for a winner or her opponent missed.
</P>
<P>
   Worn out from the pace, Davenport sent a forehand into the net
to give Williams a 3-1 lead. This trend left Davenport searching
for relief. She spent the entire first set waiting for the steam on
Williams' shot to die, but it wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Davenport looked dispirited. She mumbled to herself,
seemed bothered by her back that had given her problems coming into
this Grand Slam, and allowed Williams to set the tone for every
rally. In the second set, Davenport pushed Williams just a bit, but
for every break she grabbed, she gave another back.
</P>
<P>
   ``You live to see another day,'' Davenport said. ``She deserves
to celebrate.''

DAYNE'S ABSENCE IS DULY NOTED BY NFL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Dayne, the New York Giants' first-round draft pick, has
managed to get his National Football League career off to a rocky
start. He has committed two no-no's.
</P>
<P>
   First, he missed the league-sponsored rookie symposium this
month that is arguably the best program in sports aimed at teaching
life skills to its new players. Which leads to Dayne's second
mistake _ by skipping the mandatory symposium, he has irritated the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Getting on the NFL's bad side at such an early stage is not a
great career move. Besides, Dayne missed perhaps the most inspiring
symposium since the program began four years ago. His teammate,
quarterback Kerry Collins, spoke of how alcoholism almost ruined
his life. Dayne missed the onetime accused murderer Ray Lewis, the
Indianapolis Colts linebacker, who warned rookies to be careful of
the friends they choose. And he missed St. Louis Rams linebacker
Leonard Little, who talked about how one night of drunken driving
on his birthday cost a woman her life.
</P>
<P>
   The league is disappointed in Dayne because, as a Heisman Trophy
winner, the NFL had hoped the Wisconsin running back would set a
better example. Dayne was the only rookie out of more than 250
invitees to miss the entire symposium.
</P>
<P>
   After the event, Dayne presented a note to league officials from
a doctor in Wisconsin stating he did not attend because he had an
earache. The NFL is not buying it, and unless Dayne presents a
better excuse, he faces a possible $10,000 fine. Several years ago,
the San Diego Chargers rookie quarterback Ryan Leaf skipped the
bulk of the symposium without a legitimate excuse and was fined
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dayne cold not be reached for comment about his absence. His
agent did not return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The league stresses to the rookies soon after they are drafted
that attendance at the program is mandatory, and that it could be
the most important group of meetings they will attend in their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   At Wisconsin, Dayne was known for being a solid citizen off the
field. He is definitely not a troublemaker. Quite the opposite. But
Dayne's absence, assuming his reason for not attending was a simple
ear infection, should not be minimized.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is constantly being criticized, especially by the news
media, for not doing enough to stop the cycle of violence involving
its players. But the symposium is a proactive step by the league, a
road map that, if followed, should keep players out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So, when arguably the most high profile rookie from the last
draft class skips the session it is understandable if the NFL
becomes bothered. Because in the highly unlikely event that Dayne
runs into trouble, the league will be blamed. But it was Dayne who
did not take advantage of a valuable resource, the rookie
symposium.
</P>
<P>
   This year's symposium is especially important to the league
because of the rash of recent legal problems for its players.
Harold Henderson, chairman of the NFL's Management Council, decided
to put the troubles to good use. He invited players who had been
arrested and charged with various criminal acts to give advice to
the rookies on how not to fall into the same traps.
</P>
<P>
   People in attendance said one of the best speakers was Collins,
the Giants' starting quarterback and former No. 1 draft pick of
Carolina. Collins told the rookies that his battles with alcohol
almost cost him his career. Collins, with the players riveted to
his every word, said alcoholism led to him making the infamous
racial remark to a black former Panthers teammate, which Collins
says he made in jest. After that incident, which made national
headlines, Collins said he was never able to gain the respect of
his Carolina teammates again. The Panthers eventually cut their
ties with Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Collins explained that the Giants gave him a second chance, and
he plans to make the most of the opportunity. The rookies
appreciated Collins' brutal honesty and gave him, and other members
of the panel, a rousing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium brings real players to talk about real problems
and offers real solutions. The idea is to head off any potential
problems, especially since, according to Henderson, statistics show
that four rookies will be arrested this year. That number will
increase to 12 in players' second year.
</P>
<P>
   The symposium features skits by professional actors, panel
discussions and video presentations. There are sessions regarding
finance, dealing with the news media, gambling, labor relations and
insurance. The rookies are told the league will do free background
checks on potential investments, so the players are protected from
unscrupulous financiers. The league says that last year alone
players were cheated out of $16 million because of fraudulent
schemes.
</P>
<P>
   Top Official to Retire
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Jerry Seeman announced that this season will be his
last after 10 years as the NFL's head of officiating. In many ways,
Seeman, who spent 16 years officiating games, became one of the
most important, and recognizable, personalities in the sport. The
league has not yet found a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Titans Wooing Reggie White
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans recently received permission to try to pry
the Hall of Fame sack artist Reggie White out of retirement. White,
friends maintain, is in fabulous shape, and the Titans have a solid
chance of getting him because White and coach Jeff Fisher are
close. Fisher was the defensive coordinator when White and Fisher
were with the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake about it: White is planning to explore his
options. Other teams are interested in him, and White will have his
choice of several teams.
</P>
<P>
   White may still have plenty left to give on the field. It was
just two years ago that he led the NFC with 16 sacks. But White is
still not completely sure about whether he should play again, his
friends say.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Titans, who are expected to sign running back
Eddie George to a lucrative contract extension in the coming weeks,
may not have a ton of cash to give White, they probably have the
best chance of snagging him. They envision White as a tutor to the
young phenomenon Jevon Kearse.
</P>
<P>
   Deferred Riches
</P>
<P>
   What if your employer took a significant portion of your salary,
put it in a money market-type trust fund, and said you would
receive it only after your term of employment expired, and only if
you were a good citizen, and only if you did not withhold your
services in any way?
</P>
<P>
   That is basically the type of deal Miami cornerback Sam Madison
agreed to recently. The question is _ will other teams follow in
presenting such demands in contract offers?
</P>
<P>
   Madison, one of the best cover corners in the game, signed a
seven-year, $54 million deal. He agreed to put $5 million of his
$11 million bonus in a trust that will earn interest. The catch is
that the Dolphins can get back the prorated portion of the $5
million if Madison defaults on the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, if Madison does not hold out, or retire, or get
suspended for an entire season because of off-field problems, then
he will get the money back at the end of the contract, with
interest, which could be as much as $20 million, his agent, Gene
Burrough, said.
</P>
<P>
   If Madison is injured, or dies, the trust stays intact.
</P>
<P>
   It is a novel idea. The team is happy because it is protected,
somewhat, from a player holding out or being lost for a season
because of a drug suspension or an arrest. The player, in turn, is
practically guaranteed to have money when his career is over.
</P>
<P>
   The only concern, and it is something the players association
will definitely address, is that the team has a massive amount of
control over a player's finances. The union may not fight these
types of contracts, but it will definitely make some noise.

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: A .400 HITTER ISN'T BEYOND POSSIBILITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the years have passed _ it's 59 since the last one _ the
likelihood of a .400 hitter has dwindled. Some players have
threatened, Larry Walker hitting .379 last season, Tony Gwynn .394
in the strike-shortened 1994 season; going back a few more years,
George Brett .390 and Rod Carew .388. But the first digit in each
case was still a 3.
</P>
<P>
   Now arises a development that regenerates the prospect of having
someone attain that lonesome plateau, which hasn't been breached
since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941. Entering Saturday's schedule,
11 players _ six in the National League, five in the American _
were hitting .350 or higher.
</P>
<P>
   Only twice in the past 10 seasons, Elias Sports Bureau research
shows, have as many as seven players reached the All-Star Game
break at .350 or higher. In the first three seasons of the '90s, a
total of two players achieved that status at this time of the
season, and only two years ago, no National Leaguers and only two
American League players batted .350 or better before the break.
Bernie Williams was the leading hitter then, his average .353.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra of Boston was this season's leading hitter
before play Saturday, batting .386. Todd Helton of Colorado, who
for much of the early part of the season was over .400, was next at
.385. The Montreal Expos had two players in the .370s, Jose Vidro
and Vladimir Guerrero. Vidro was one of three second basemen in the
group, Luis Castillo of Florida and Jeff Kent of San Francisco
being the others. And there were two catchers, Ivan Rodriguez of
Texas and Mike Piazza of the Mets, who were also the top
vote-getters in their respective leagues in the All-Star Game
balloting.
</P>
<P>
   The hitters and their high averages have generally been
overlooked with the focus on the increase in home runs. But the
same factors that are said to be involved in home run inflation
appear to fuel the higher batting averages, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only is the ball juiced, but it's fatter than it used to
be,'' Sandy Alderson, baseball's chief of baseball operations, said
jokingly. Then Alderson, who after recent tests blessed the balls
as no different from last year's, ticked off the real reasons he
and others see as being behind the increase in high hitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can talk about the smaller strike zone,'' he said,
``stronger players, lighter bats leading to better bat control,
dilution of pitching, smaller ballparks, smaller not only in the
sense that something is going over the wall more frequently but
also off the wall more frequently, less foul territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Syd Thrift, head of baseball operations for the Baltimore
Orioles and a longtime student of hitters, said he believed much of
the hitting improvement stemmed from preparation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hitters have prepared themselves more effectively to be
better hitters with the aid of technology and technique training by
hitting coaches plus their own abilities,'' Thrift said. ``All
those top hitters use the whole field. They are much more
proficient hitters. They don't try to pull the ball. The hitters
show a lot of discipline. They wait longer, they get good pitches,
they take pitchers deep into the count.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitchers have to accept their share of the change, Thrift
added. ``I think the pitching, because of expansion, is inferior,''
he said. ``I think there are pitchers in the major leagues right
now who are 3, 4, 5 starters on some teams who would not be in the
major leagues when you go back in previous times.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles executive also cited improved ballpark lighting as
allowing hitters to see the ball better. But he didn't omit the
ball itself from his list of reasons for higher averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not certain the baseball is not different,'' he said,
despite the test results. ``The surface seems to be different. It
seems to be tighter and harder from a feel standpoint. How much of
a factor that is I have no way of knowing.''
</P>
<P>
   However the factors are figured, Thrift said it ``certainly
appears'' that hitters could be headed for .400.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said prediction of a .400 hitter is ``speculation maybe
for a statistician,'' but he added, ``That's a possibility,''
citing Helton as an example of a possible .400 hitter. Alluding to
the Rockies' hitter-friendly home at Coors Field, Alderson said:
``Not only does the ball carry well, but a line drive hitter with
an expansive area can do very well there. I think it's certainly a
possibility. As averages creep up from .300 to .350, who's to say
we won't see someone take that extra step.''
</P>
<P>
   That New Voice
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's the voice John Hart was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cleveland Indians fired Mike Hargrove as their manager
last October after he led them to five division championships and
two World Series but no World Series championships, Hart, the
general manager, said the team needed ``a new voice coming from the
clubhouse'' and named Charlie Manuel, the Indians' batting coach,
as the new manager.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, with the Indians 10{ games out of the position in
the standings to which they had become accustomed, Manuel spoke. He
announced to the players that their Ping-Pong table was being
removed from the clubhouse, as were two cushy couches. And one more
thing, he said: no more card games in the clubhouse, either.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel said ``these things'' distracted from the goal of
winning.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who hadn't been so far from first place since the
1993 season ended, won all of their division championships under
Hargrove with the Ping-Pong table.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Midseason Tumbles
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning only 18 games and losing 28 in an eight-week
span, the Yankees did not tumble out of the American League East
race. Some other teams were not so fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cleveland. The Indians, from May 23 through July 1, won 18 and
lost 22, plummeting from half a game behind the Chicago White Sox
(28-11) to 11 back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Texas. The Rangers, beginning June 6, lost nine games in a row
and through July 2 had a 7-16 record. In that four-week period they
plunged from one percentage point behind Seattle (18-7) to 10 games
back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cincinnati. The Reds were half a game ahead of St. Louis on
the morning of June 5. In the next month the Reds lost 19 of 28
games and fell 10 games behind the Cardinals (19-8).
</P>
<P>
   A Carpenter's Story
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tried Jake Westbrook, Ben Ford and Ed Yarnall. The
Arizona Diamondbacks tried Geraldo Guzman. The four players are
among any number of pitchers who have been summoned in desperation
from the minor leagues this season as teams have tried to plug
holes in their starting rotations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yankees' case, their trio of rookies have started a total
of five games, and they have lost four. They won the fifth, against
Baltimore last Thursday, because their hitters somehow overcame the
seven-run deficit Yarnall helped create. In their five starts,
Westbrook, Ford and Yarnall gave up 29 hits and 11 walks in 13 2/3
innings, allowing 24 earned runs for a 15.80 earned run average.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Diamondbacks' initial experience with Guzman.
Deciding to demote Omar Daal and his 2-9 record (for a first-place
team) to the bullpen, the Diamondbacks promoted Guzman from Tucson
of the Pacific Coast League for their game Thursday night in
Houston. He answered their call with a 2-1 victory in which he
permitted one run and four hits in eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Guzman is no ordinary rookie.
</P>
<P>
   Originally signed by the Montreal Expos, Guzman pitched for
their team in the Dominican Republic in 1990 and 1991. Plagued by
shoulder problems, he quit the game and became a carpenter, a trade
he worked for the next seven years. Last year he decided he wanted
to play again, and Junior Noboa, the Diamondbacks' Latin America
scouting coordinator, helped place him with a team in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned home after the season, he was working out at
the Diamondbacks' academy in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw him throw and we signed him,'' Sandy Johnson, the
team's assistant general manager, said. ``He pitched in the winter
league and he kept pitching better and better. Rather than taking a
chance on losing him in the draft the way he was throwing, we put
him on the 40-man roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Guzman looked no less impressive in spring training this year,
Johnson said. But the Diamondbacks didn't want to rush him. They
initially made him a middle reliever for El Paso of the -Class AA
Texas League, then moved him up to closer. ``Then we put him in the
rotation and he handled that well,'' Johnson related. ``He kept
getting better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   On to Tucson, where he reeled off a 4-1 record with a 1.42
earned run average and 23 hits, 10 walks and 44 strikeouts in 38
innings. When the Diamondbacks needed another starter, he was the
obvious choice. He made it more obvious with his performance
against the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Even more obvious than that is the discovery that teams have
been going about it all wrong in trying to develop pitchers. They
have done it by having their young prospects pitch. Instead, they
should just give the kids a hammer and tell them to swing it for a
few years, then come back and pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Rules Might Change
</P>
<P>
   Only future seasons will determine if Mark Johnson and Chad
Alexander ever make an impact on the outcome of games, but without
having played enough to make themselves even faintly familiar
household names, they are the reason baseball officials are
considering a change in the rule governing the annual December
draft of minor league players.
</P>
<P>
   The Detroit Tigers plucked pitcher Johnson from the Yankees and
the Seattle Mariners took outfielder Alexander from Houston last
December. Popular thinking says a drafted player has to stay on the
drafting team's 25-man major league roster or be offered back to
his original team for half of the $50,000 draft price. But the
Tigers and the Mariners, working within the rules, found a way to
retain their players but in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   They placed the players on unconditional-release waivers, then
signed them to minor league contracts after they went unclaimed and
became free agents. The Mariners took that route with Alexander
last February, the Tigers with Johnson in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees officials were stunned when the Tigers made their move
with Johnson, who pitched in nine games for them before they placed
him on waivers. The Yankees could have claimed the 25-year-old
right-hander, but they didn't want to have to put him on their
40-man roster. The Tigers counted on that reluctance when they
asked for waivers.
</P>
<P>
   The practice, however, has caught the attention of major league
officials, who are concerned it could undermine the integrity of
and jeopardize the draft. A change in the rules may be
forthcoming. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: SINCE KNIEVEL, SIMPLICITY TAKES A FLYING LEAP 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT in parentheses has been used in

 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Evel Knievel failed to leap the Snake River Canyon or at
least die trying on the same September Sunday 26 years ago on which
President Ford pardoned former President Nixon, a promoter of the
first event dismissed the outrage of TV viewers. He said that
Knievel's inconclusive finish _ his motorcycle-cum-rocket sprouted
a parachute that brought him safely down to the canyon floor _ was
``a realistic insight into American society; life isn't that
clear-cut anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The prophecy gains. Not only did Snake River presage
Gotterdammerung for old Evel (a more aggressive John Rocker of his
time, he was convicted of assaulting his publicist during a
reportedly anti-Semitic tirade), but it led us to live with loose
ends.
</P>
<P>
   There are loose ends all over the place. The PGA is asking the
Supreme Court to drive Casey Martin off its lush green lawns.
Rocker, Bob Knight and Mike Tyson are still with us, spirit and
flesh. And the messages to thelipsite(at)aol.com have yet to slow
in the wake of the anti-Evel rowboat journey of five 60-ish men;
some make invidious comparisons to the stories that claim greater
attention.
</P>
<P>
   This Rocker, my e-mail consensus goes, needs a couch, not a
microphone, and I agree. When was the last time a baseball player
referred to a productive teammate as a ``cancer,'' as the Braves'
Brian Jordan referred to the 25-year-old relief pitcher. Unpopular,
angry and self-destructive, Rocker lashes out to gain attention.
There seems to be no mechanism to get him help. Is this the fault
of baseball, its players' association, the Atlanta organization,
Rocker, the news media, me, Evel? Who takes the blame for Tyson, or
do we wait until his parachute finally fails?
</P>
<P>
   And what about Bob? Despite the occasional heavy-breathing call
from Indiana, mentioning Knight evokes the meaty thud of a stick on
a dead horse. He is over, defeated by his recent lack of success;
abusing players can be construed as ``character-building'' only
when you get into the Final Four. Knight's only remaining defense,
that he ``ran a clean program,'' may have as much to do with the
tenured sycophants who made sure no one on his varsity became
academically ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   We are approaching the end of the age of the Big Daddy coach
because college is no longer critical to professional advancement.
You can go straight to the National Basketball Association from
high school, and soon you will be able to prep at a development
league, the first step to a long overdue minor league.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA will be asking the Supreme Court to review a lower court
decision allowing Martin, who has a circulatory disease in his
right leg, to ride a cart during tournaments. Simplistically, one
side offers a human argument for disability rights, the other an
argument for the right of a sport to make hard-and-fast rules of
fair competition. Both sides can use the phrase ``level playing
field.'' Both arguments have weight and both evoke knee-jerk
reactions. To make golf fair, it would make more sense at the
moment to force Tiger Woods to play blind-folded. Or to play in a
foursome with Tyson, Rocker and Knight. Something would have to rub
off on somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is simple, which is good for my business. We have been
following three women, two middle-aged former track-and-field
champions with eight Olympic Games between them, and the gifted
young 400-meter runner who reignited their quadrennial dreams.
Eight days ago, 22-year-old Khadijah Conda was supposed to try to
qualify for this week's Olympic trials in Sacramento, Calif., her
last chance to fulfill the goals that her coach, Pat Connolly, and
her mentor, Willye B. White, had envisioned for her great talent.
But Conda did not run.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly wonders if she failed as a coach or if she didn't
understand the Virtual Generation, for whom ``posing and posturing
is enough.'' White thinks Khadijah failed herself. ``A vision
without action is a hallucination,'' she said. I think Conda made a
realistic decision for herself. Sensing that she did not share the
passion, she opted for a career and a social life.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the decision 66-year-old Bill Lenderking made, to row from
New York City's South Street Seaport to Shelter Island two weeks
ago, was a covenant. He came out of a time when one died trying.
This anti-Evel had not rowed since childhood and he did not look
like the buffed subjects of the recent book, ``The Adonis Complex:
The Secret Crisis of Male Body Obsession,'' but once he wrapped his
long hands around the oars he knew he would finish. His four
companions _ David Stookey, Louis Mackall, Tom Luckey and John
Mullen _ were swept along by his commitment. They finished on
schedule and found that the trip was not as hard as they had
imagined. They wondered what else in life they had deferred or
diminished because they had been too intimidated to try. They took
all of us on their journey of discovery. But they weren't quite
finished.
</P>
<P>
   The day after he rowed home, the 58-year-old Texas architect,
Mullen, felt the need to get back in his rowboat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that I am becoming a bit obsessive-compulsive about
this rowing thing,'' he wrote in an e-mail message. ``I puttered
around Saturday morning and then in the early afternoon, seeing
that the currents were propitious, hopped in the skiff and rowed 10
miles out to Montauk for a delicious cheeseburger at the Star
Island Yacht Club and rowed home into the setting sun and the
southwest sea breeze _ another perfect day.''

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA _ ONI, Georgia _ High in still snowy mountain
passes separating Russia from its southern neighbors, Chechen
rebels have found a near impenetrable lair. From these hideouts,
the rebels have unleashed a new round of fighting their almost
yearlong war against the Russian army. The worrisome problem is
that the rebels have moved across the international border, to the
Republic of Georgia, threatening to escalate what Russia has always
called a ``domestic issue'' into a regional war. (Coker, Cox News

   MEXICO-REVOLUTION _ MEXICO CITY _ It's being called the second
Mexican Revolution, the Revolution of the 21st Century, Mexico's
Velvet Revolution, the electoral earthquake. To the surprise of
virtually all political observers here, Mexicans rose up last
Sunday and decisively ended 71 years of domination by the world's
longest-reigning political party. In just one week, life in Mexico
has changed spiritually if not materially. Many people sense a
mantle of control has been lifted. A federal employee here who was
forced to pass out literature for the ruling party said she hopes
such coercion is dead in Mexico. A TV comic pushed the envelope on
freedom of expression by performing a sketch using amusing video of
President-elect Vicente Fox, and then bantering with the real Fox
in a live telephone interview. The audience went wild. Mexico is
enjoying a democratic fiesta, even though there are rumblings of
how tough Fox's job is going to be as he struggles to shape a new
government here. (Ferriss, Cox News Service) MOVED

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ The worst of times for Mexico's
freshly defeated ruling party included the 1968 student massacre,
several crippling peso devaluations and spate of fratricidal
assassinations. And now the ultimate _ unexpected defeat at the
polls of 71 years in power. Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party is in the throes of a crisis, as its leaders squabble among
one another and stunned supporters wonder what will happen to their
special favors. President Ernesto Zedillo, who accepted the PRI's
defeat and won praise from abroad and the opposition here, is being

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT _ JERUSALEM _ As they head into a summit meeting
Tuesday, Israelis and Palestinians are closer than they've ever
been to making peace. But, they're still readying themselves for
war. The solutions are out there. Israeli officials have leaked
proposals that would be the largest concessions Israel ever offered
and Palestinians have shown increased flexibility in living next to
the Jewish state. The toughest issues are Jerusalem, resettlement
of refugees, borders and water. Each has a number of possible
solutions. But, peacemakers on both sides face stiff opposition
from their own publics. Should the summit fail, no one knows what
will follow but it could be violence. Palestinians are preparing to
declare statehood and are said to be gathering weapons. Israeli
officers are threatening to use ``tanks and planes'' against a
Palestinian uprising. A look at the issues and risks of the summit.

   SURPLUS _ WASHINGTON _ Like Uncle Sam finding a $20 bill in the
pocket of his striped pants on laundry day, the U.S. government
last month came up with an extra $100 billion in revenue over the
next 10 years. While this boost in the projected federal surplus
certainly sounds like good news, it raises some disquieting
questions. How can revenue estimates change so quickly, and can
they go down as fast as they went up? And could the new revenues
lead lawmakers to create spending or benefit programs that would be
hard to roll back if the windfall evaporates? (Deans, Cox News

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ How would Southern politics change _ or would it
change at all _ if we knew all the dire predictions about global
warming were really true? With all the scientific controversy over
that subject we can't be sure. But if there's one area which could
be looked at as a present-day laboratory for the consequences of
such an unprecedented crisis, it lies along the Carolina coastline.
That's because whether global warming affects it or not, there is
convincing evidence that over the next 30 years, storms like the
one which caused record flooding in North Carolina last year will
increase in frequency. That increases the potential like more
environmental disasters like the one last year in which North
Carolinians saw their rivers polluted with the carcasses of
thousands of drowned hogs. But it also brings a risk of political
disaster, as South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges found out last year
when he ordered the coast evacuated for a disaster which didn't

   TRANSEXUAL-MINISTER _ The Rev. Erin Swenson's heart thumped

Facing her, the crowd crammed inside the Shallowford Presbyterian
Church in Atlanta stared at her in disbelief. Swenson, an ordained
minister and father of two daughters, had just walked to the front
of the church in a green dress, heels and an eggshell-white blouse.
She was going to speak publicly for the first time about a
49-year-old secret that had driven her to thoughts of suicide.
Swenson told the hushed crowd that she was a woman born in a man's
body. Now that she had taken steps to correct that, she made an
unprecedented request before the assembly of Presbyterian church
leaders: Allow her to retain her ordination as a minister. Five
years later, Swenson is stepping back in the spotlight. She _ along

 &HT;    New hiring tool at Home Depot
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A computerized kiosk has become Home Depot's star
recruiter as the retailer tries to find an army of workers to fill
its growing chain of warehouse stores.
</P>
<P>
   The home improvement giant needs to tackle what seems like a
nerve-racking project in this tight U.S. labor market.
Atlanta-based Home Depot plans to open about 900 stores over the
next three years, and it will have to hire more than 200,000
workers to do that. Currently, new stores open on the average of
one every 43 hours.
</P>
<P>
   No problem, says Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a new automated procedure, the retailer has turned the
hiring process into a near-science. By the time a store manager
interviews an applicant for a job, the candidate has survived a
battery of questions about scruples and work habits.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot lets its new job kiosks do most of the asking. Sure,
Big Orange wants to know if you've ever stolen from your employer,
or if you've recently been in a fistfight on the job. But what
managers are really excited about is a computerized test that
gauges how customer-savvy applicants are. In 70 or so questions,
Home Depot says it gets a good inkling whether the candidate would
make a good employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our managers say they're noticing a big difference in the
quality of people they're hiring,'' said Al Frost, director of
management development.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosks, which cost $10 million to install at the retailer's
1,000 stores around the country, have been a boon to human
resources, said Frost, who began developing the system four and a
half years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Frost, an industrial psychologist, wanted a way to find
industrious workers who wouldn't shy away from Home Depot's gung-ho
culture. The best way to do that, he said, was find the company's
best sales associates and build a test around them.
</P>
<P>
   Store managers and supervisors studied and evaluated nearly 500
employees on the job. The employees were then quizzed with an early
version of the employment test to see how their performance
evaluations correlated to their answers about customer service,
conscientiousness and overall work ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who passed the test knew more about products, took more
initiative, and were more dependable,'' Frost said. ``They rated 14
percent better on overall performance, which is a huge number. If
you can make a 14 percent improvement in someone's productivity,
that's a big impact on the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   But before applicants take the test, they get a feel for what
it's like to work in Home Depot's noisy warehouse stores. Each
kiosk shows a seven-minute video of real life on the job.
</P>
<P>
   With forklifts beeping in the background, a 30-something woman
in an orange apron warns, ``There are no quiet little cubicles
around here. Our warehouse environment is hectic. . . you are
literally on your feet all day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of the video is that we don't want applicants being
surprised,'' Frost said. ``They need to know that their feet may
hurt because they're working on concrete floors, or that it's
visually distracting because there are so many customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a high turnover rate (before the kiosk program) because
people were shocked once they started working,'' he said. ``We want
to tell people it's a great company and a great opportunity, but
it's a tough job.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, turnover has dropped more than 11 percent, Frost
said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's financial success, stock history and corporate lore
of lowly employees-turned-millionaires has given the retailer an
edge in recruiting. While some retailers have held back on growth
plans because they can't find enough workers, Home Depot's main
concern is picking the best employees out of the thousands that it
turns away, Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot gets an average of 1,000 to 1,500 applicants when it
opens a store, said David Hauck, a manager of information systems.
Each store employs about 250 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``With good advertising, we've gotten as many as 10,000
applications for a single store,'' Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the kiosks are networked to a central database,
applications can be shared with all stores within a market. When
good candidates apply at a store that's not hiring, managers from
other stores in the area will contact them and ask if they're
willing to commute, Frost said.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the reason Home Depot isn't having a problem
keeping its 34 stores staffed in its hometown, said spokesman Don
Harrison. Metro Atlanta's base of stores gives it an edge over
newer markets that may only have one or two stores, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to bundle up (paper) applications for people
that applied at Woodstock and take them over to Alpharetta,''
Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   In the total chain, nearly 850,000 people have applied since
Home Depot began installing kiosks in early 1998. The retailer
hired about 106,000 of that pool.
</P>
<P>
   There are pockets of the country, such as Minnesota, that are
tough because of extremely low unemployment rates, Frost said. But
a new national recruiting campaign, which includes the retailer's
first ``help wanted'' ad on TV, has doubled and sometimes
quadrupled the number of applicants, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the kiosks, we have a quantitative way to track the
number of applicants because we know exactly when and where they
applied,'' Frost said.

 &HT;    Low fares out there if you look
 &HT;    By Ray Marcano
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ An airline trip from Cincinnati to Washington for
$77 _ round trip.
</P>
<P>
   A trip from Columbus to Phoenix _ midweek, without a Saturday
stay _ for $249 round trip.
</P>
<P>
   It's still possible to get really cheap airline tickets, even
with companies adding fuel and other surcharges. All it takes is a
lot of persistence.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines change prices as often as Ohio weather changes in June,
so to get the cheapest fares, it's important to follow the
following steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Be prepared to buy immediately. Prices change quickly and low
fares sell out so fast they may not be available again if you let
them slide. I knew I had to make a trip to Phoenix in August, so I
started scouting for fares early. I snared the $249 round-trip,
nonstop airfare in April; the same flight on the same airline today
costs $435. Sharp travelers know when they're getting a bargain. If
you see one, jump at it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be prepared to look again and again and again. If you don't
see the fares you like, look every day to see if they change. They
will. Identify at least three Web sites to check, under the theory
that they offer the best fares possible. My favorite three:
www.travelocity.com, www.bestfares.com and www.lowestfare.com.
Travelocity is the easiest and cleanest to use, though
bestfares.com has a wider selection.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com might not be such a good deal for airline tickets
anymore because the service adds on too many fees _ a $20 fuel
surcharge, airport taxes that range from $10 to $38 a ticket and a
$5 processing fee. At the minimum, you have to count on $35 in fees
on top of your bid. Read the Web site carefully and understand the
rules before bidding.
</P>
<P>
   TIME TO LOOK AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   We're halfway through the year, so it's time to start looking
for Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday travel bargains. Airfares
are generally much higher during the Thanksgiving and Christmas
weeks. One tip: Consider traveling a week before the holiday, when
fares are cheaper. If you have to go during a holiday week, be
prepared to pad the travel budget.

</P>
<P>
   ``Being an actress, I always had my black planner out and I
thought it was so boring!'' she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Her line of accessories, sold at some of the nation's hippest
boutiques, includes Palm Pilot and laptop computer covers,
checkbook covers and CD cases. There are planners in three sizes,
journals, wallets and photo books. In the works are cell phone
covers.
</P>
<P>
   Knox's products are handmade by American craftsmen and fashioned
from the same upscale fabrics you'll see on runways throughout the
world _ faux fur and raw silk, animal and camouflage prints, comic
strips and floral motifs, with cashmere pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Her biggest seller is a hot pink raw silk with sweetheart rose
trim and a camouflage interior.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sweet on the outside but it's 'I'll kill you if I have to
on the inside,' `` explains Knox. ``Women have that diversity to
them _ we're sweet and tough, wacky and sophisticated and classy. I
wanted to embody all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Celebrities _ Brooke Shields, Leeza Gibbons, Daisy Fuentes _
have purchased the products; Donny and Marie Osmond highlighted the
Sunny Kate Palm Pilot Cover on their talk show as the ``gift you
give someone who has everything!'' In April, Accessories magazine
showed off the line.
</P>
<P>
   The company got another boost when Knox was contacted by Melanie
Griffith, who loved the designs and wanted to join Knox in
developing a line of laptop covers.
</P>
<P>
   Goddess by Melanie Griffith, introduced at the New York
stationery show in May, is a ``laptop skin'' that aims to dress up
a portable computer without the cover needing to be removed before
use. The product, designed by Knox, includes space to carry cables,
CDs and papers, features a shoulder strap and access panel for cord
connection, and is available in six Sunny Kate fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   The CEO of Sunny Kate is Matthew Knox, Sunny's husband, whom she
describes as ``the wind beneath my sales.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the artist, he's the business person,'' she explains.
</P>
<P>
   The line is sold at boutiques such as Fred Segal and Jennifer
Kaufman, both in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Sunny and Matt were clever because they saw a niche
and filled it,'' says Kaufman, who caters to the television and
film crowd. ``Before we carried the pieces, women would come in and
want something unusual in a datebook but their options were
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sunny Kate line was an immediate hit with Kaufman's
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are completely charming . . . people buy them as we're
stocking the displays,'' Kaufman says. ``I traded in a typical
checkbook cover for one of Sunny's and every time I take my new one
out _ at my daughter's school or at the bank _ someone asks me
where it's from because it's so cool!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen those lip prints on runways in London,'' Kaufman
says, referring to the Sunny Kate red-lips-on-black design. ``Sunny
picked up on it and I know you'll be seeing that motif. She has
prints suited to every woman's personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices range from $24 for a checkbook cover to $150 for the
laptop skin.
</P>
<P>
   Knox recently was in town for a friend's wedding and says she
always heads back to Ohio for the Ohio State-Michigan game. She
says it's her job to be one step ahead and to forecast what will be
``great and outrageous and awesome'' in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Concludes the young entrepreneur:''I always try to stay one step
ahead.''

 &HT;    Clock radio wakes sleepers gently
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you find a regular alarm clock or clock radio
too jarring in the morning, Philips Consumer Electronics may have
an answer for you: a clock radio and CD player that gradually
increases the volume of the alarm buzzer or music to wake the
sleeper gently.
</P>
<P>
   The Philips AJ3965 CD Clock Radio has an AM/FM digital tuner and
a CD player so users can choose between listening to radio stations
or to their favorite recordings.
</P>
<P>
   It offers dual settings so two people can set it for different
wake-up times. It also offers a weekend sleeper function: The alarm
will sound on weekdays but not on weekends, if the user chooses.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Gentle Wake'' feature can be used in reverse as a sleep
timer. The user sets the unit for sleep mode and the radio or CD
player starts at full volume and gradually decreases until it shuts
down. That provides music while the user is falling asleep but
silence later to avoid disturbing the user after he or she is
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   The time is displayed in large, blue numbers that are easily
seen from a distance. The AJ3965 has a built-in power backup system
that retains alarm and time settings during brief power outages.
</P>
<P>
   The Philips clock radio won a Best of Show award in the personal
electronics category at the International Consumer Electronics Show
in January. It went on sale in May and should be available for
about $89.99 at most Target, Circuit City and Sears stores.

 &HT;    And now for X-Men the movie
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Step into any store that sells comics, and
casually mention X-Men. You'll be quickly surrounded by excited
fans recounting their favorite X-Men tales and speculating about
the movie that opens Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Marvel Comic heroes haven't had the pop-culture
visibility of ``Star Wars'' or ``Star Trek,'' the X-Men have
dominated the world of comic books for most of the 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with the X-Men,'' said Floyd Taylor, as he hung out
recently with other fans at the Bookery Fantasy comic, game and
video store. ``When I was a teen-ager I felt alienated like they
were, and I really identified with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now my son and daughter are excited about them, and we're all
looking forward to the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The X-Men originated in Marvel Comics in 1963 as a team of six
genetic mutants with bizarre superpowers. The X-Men universe has
grown in scope and complexity over the years until now the cast
includes more than 200 mutants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a soap opera with lasers,'' said Jason Parker, games
manager for the Bookery Fantasy. ``The characters have personal
lives, and their relationships change over time.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic story line also changes. ``Sometimes thd you'll
realize that character's whole history has changed,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   To those outside the world of comic fandom, the hype and
excitement surrounding the movie may come as a surprise. But in the
mid-1990s, Marvel was publishing about 10 X-Men-related comic
titles each month, and they consistantly held more than half the
positions on the top 10 comic sales lists.
</P>
<P>
   The comics experienced another boost in 1993 when Fox started
airing a weekly animated version of X-Men. The series quickly
became a hit with children, but it had a loyal following on college
campuses and among other young adult comic fans.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're unfamiliar with the X-Men but are interested in
seeing this year's science-fiction blockbuster _ titled, naturally,
X-Men _ here's a little background from Bookery Fantasy regulars
Taylor, Parker and Greene County Sheriff's Deputy Jeff Thomas, also
a fan:
</P>
<P>
   _ The setting: X-Men adventures take place on Earth and are
usually set in contemporary times. A small percentage of the human
population are mutants carrying an ``X gene'' that gives them
special powers. The powers usually don't kick in until the mutants
reach puberty, and the people affected don't realize they are
mutants until they start levitating their schoolbooks or seeing
through locker-room walls. Normal humans mistrust mutants, and they
are persecuted and sometimes killed when their powers emerge.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heroic leader: Dr. Charles Xavier, also known as Professor X,
is the world's most powerful telepath, and he can both read minds
and project his thoughts into the minds of others. Xavier, who is
paralyzed below the waist, develops a machine that allows him to
detect mutants like himself anywhere in the world. He gathers them
under the guise of recruiting gifted youth for a special school and
trains them to control their powers and use them for the good of
humanity. He has a vision of normal humans and mutants living
together cooperatively. His students become the heroic X-Men.
</P>
<P>
   _ Villains: Erik Lehnscherr was imprisoned in a Nazi
concentration camp as a boy, and the experience convinced him that
mankind is inherently evil. As he matured he developed intense
magnetic powers and christened himself Magneto. Magneto believes
normal humans will wipe out mutants if given the chance, so he
plots to strike first, making mutants rulers of the world. He heads
the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, which includes the hulking
Sabretooth, the shape-shifting Mystique and Toad, owner of a
20-foot tongue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Love triangle: Scott Summers and Jean Grey are members of the
original X-Men team and have always been romantically linked.
Summers is Cyclops, who shoots lasers from his eyes, and he acts as
the team's field commander. Jean Grey, once called Marvel Girl, has
telepathic and telekinetic powers. Logan was introduced more
recently, and as Wolverine he has incredible healing powers, a
super-strong metallic skeleton and retractable, knife-like claws.
While Summers is a classic good guy, Logan is a sometimes surly
loner who has trouble controlling his temper and working with the
team. But there's a strong animal attraction between Logan and
Grey.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other X-Men: In the current movie, Ororo Munroe fights
alongside Summers, Grey and Logan as Storm, a mutant who can
control the weather. Also introduced is the mutant teen Rogue, who
can absorb the abilities and memories of anyone she touches. Most
of the X-Men characters are left out of the movie, but there's lots
of buzz about an expanded cast for the sequel that may feature
Sentinels, robots designed to hunt down and kill mutants.

SOUTH AFRICA CREATES AN ANTI-AIDS CAMPAIGN THAT MINCES NO WORDS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Calif.)   (Eds: This story contains some sexually explicit references.) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURBAN, South Africa _ ``My boyfriend just wants sex,'' ``The
naked truth,'' and ``Oral sex.'' And underneath: ``Talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   These and similar messages have sprung up in recent months on
billboards along South Africa's main highways, on trains, near
schools and in cities and rural areas as part of a campaign to
encourage young people to talk freely about sex and the risks of
teen-age pregnancy, AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   The erotic and hard-hitting phrases are part of a down-to-earth
campaign aimed at reducing by half the rate of infection from HIV,
the AIDS virus, in South Africa in five years. The 4.2 million
HIV-infected people in South Africa represent the largest such
group in the world.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-third of pregnant women in some countries in
Africa are HIV-infected, and the rates are nearly as high among
students in some universities.
</P>
<P>
   The messages tackle once taboo subjects like wet dreams,
masturbation, orgasms, foreplay and homosexuality as part of a
campaign known as Love Life.
</P>
<P>
   Love Life's spokeswoman, Judi Nwokedi, described her
organization's campaign as the boldest sex education campaign ever
conducted in South Africa at a news conference sponsored by the
American Medical Association on Saturday, the eve of the 13th
International Conference on AIDS, which will be held here.
</P>
<P>
   The messages are also delivered on radio, television and in
supplements in newspapers under funding from the Henry J. Kaiser
Family Foundation of Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a media blitz, volunteers for Love Life visit
sports facilities at schools and in communities to provide
information to young South Africans.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign considers its main audience is among people ages 12
to 17. But Love Life also produces and sponsors a television series
that encourages children 6 years and older to talk to adults about
things like sex.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also runs the Love Train, which travels the
country's rails displaying South Africa's largest billboard. At
various train stops, crowds write messages and graffiti on the
cars.
</P>
<P>
   The train was to arrive in Durban on Saturday for the AIDS
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Love Life also uses the train to educate groups of
schoolchildren about sex and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to youth complain that existing public health
campaigns were too negative, Love Life spent two years developing
its campaign to change perceptions and behavior that increase risk
for pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disease-driven and negative campaigns tend to ignore sexual
desire and sex as a part of daily life,'' Nwokedi said.
</P>
<P>
   The program began in September with a larger aim than just
giving information. Nwokedi said her group wanted ``a positive
thrust, vibrancy, excellent marketing and boldness to get to the
core of sexual issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's youth are image conscious, Nwokedi said. They also have
more choices, and Love Life hopes to foster positive self-images
and responsibility among the young people of South Africa, she
said.

FOOTBALL COLUMN: EARLY BUZZ IN NFL IS THAT REDSKINS CAN'T LOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The whispers are beginning to build toward a bold crescendo.
From top National Football League executives to
frequent-flyer-mile-earning scouts to assistant trainers, there is
a unanimous belief that the season need not even be played, because
the Washington Redskins, after one of the liveliest off-season
spending binges in league history, have already won the Super Bowl.
Pencil them in, it is said.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the talk has a dual purpose. Like those sunburned
``Survivor'' castaways who smile at each other and then plot to
steal coconuts, some of Washington's rivals are pumping up the
Redskins in the hope that they can make Washington a target by
praising the team to death.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible, though, not to shuttle the Redskins to the top
of the line of championship contenders. In what was a busy NFL
off-season _ with a murder trial for one of the league's stars and
the retirement of a half-dozen great coaches and players _
Washington's stockpiling of Pro Bowl players ranks as the most
interesting development.
</P>
<P>
   With the beginning of training camps only days away _ I know, it
seems as if last season just ended _ Washington's moves loom large
over the NFL landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins are hardly the first team to hire high-priced free
agents; the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys have done it
for years. But no team has revamped on such a grand scale in such a
short time. The Redskins' owner, Daniel Snyder, spent $17 million
in signing bonuses alone during the off-season for defensive end
Bruce Smith, cornerback Deion Sanders, safety Mark Carrier and
quarterback Jeff George, all 30-somethings in the latter part of
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder emptying his checking account was one of many trends in
the months following the St. Louis Rams' unlikely Super Bowl
victory in January. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Coaches moving on. Jimmy Johnson, Bill Parcells, Dick Vermeil
and Mike Ditka all left the coaching sidelines. Bobby Beathard
retired from the front office.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players following. Dan Marino and Steve Young, both
first-ballot Hall of Famers, retired and instantly changed the face
of the league. Denver will be forced to rely on the shaky Brian
Griese, while Miami must decide if Damon Huard or Jay Fiedler will
replace Marino.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keyshawn Johnson leaving New York. Often brash, occasionally
selfish and always a great player, the former Jets wide receiver
signed a free-agent contract with Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers, along
with the Redskins and the Rams, are championship contenders from
the National Conference. Each team has at least one big-time pass
catcher.
</P>
<P>
   _ The estate tax disappearing. Yes, the estate tax became a huge
issue this off-season. On June 9, the U.S. House of Representatives
voted, 279-139, to phase out the federal estate tax, the tax on
rich people's assets when they die. The estates of many owners of
NFL teams, including Wellington Mara of the Giants, Buffalo's Ralph
Wilson and Oakland's Al Davis, would very likely be forced to sell
their teams, under the current law, to pay the hefty tax after an
owner's death. But if the Senate were to pass a bill similar to the
one approved by the House, and if both bodies were to override a
threatened veto by President Clinton, the federal tax burden would
be erased and families of NFL owners would not have to go through a
painful sale process.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Tennessee Titans' consolidating. The team did the right
thing by giving coach Jeff Fisher a new long-term contract. One of
the best backs in the league, Eddie George, is close to signing a
six-year extension. Now Tennessee is trying to add depth by talking
Reggie White out of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is Atlanta in trouble? Running back Jamal Anderson is still
having problems with his surgically repaired right knee, which
tends to swell after long workouts. Not time to panic _ yet _ but
the Falcons signed the career backup Ron Rivers just in case. If
Anderson continues to have problems, the Falcons would again be
mopping up the NFC West.
</P>
<P>
   _ Players behaving badly. Murder charges against Baltimore
Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis were dropped, after he agreed to plead
guilty to lying to the police. Former Carolina Panthers wide
receiver Rae Carruth will stand trial next year for plotting to
kill his pregnant girlfriend. Oakland Raiders kicker Sebastian
Janikowski was arrested June 21 on a charge of possession of GHB, a
drug that has been linked to date rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Several teams, frustrated that some players continue to show up
on the police blotter, are beginning to insert protective clauses
in contracts in case players end up in trouble. Some of these
additions call for the withholding of bonuses if a player is found
guilty of a serious crime.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Giants, people close to coach Jim Fassel say he is
more motivated than ever to get the team back into the playoffs and
beyond. There is no nicer person in the NFL than Fassel, but he was
given only a one-year contract extension; if he does not win this
year, he could be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, meanwhile, are still a team that has still not picked
up a solid wide receiver in free agency to replace Johnson, but it
might in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, coach Al Groh will have
Parcells hovering over the team.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing the Redskins may mop up is champagne after the
Super Bowl. The team should be outstanding. If not, look for Snyder
to fire everyone, and start over.

 &HT;    Hospitality workers a dwindling resource
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ At 5 p.m. every Wednesday, Connie Hagston leaves her
office at the Renaissance Atlanta Hotel and heads to the lobby.
There, the director of sales and marketing switches gears.
</P>
<P>
   For three hours, she greets guests, makes restaurant
reservations and gives directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an additional helping hand so our guests don't have to
wait in line and they can get where they need to go quickly and
efficiently,'' said Hagston.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's good customer service, but there's another reason
Hagston and other Renaissance managers alternate working in the
lobby _ a tight labor market.
</P>
<P>
   A strong economy and low unemployment have created a headache
for hotel and restaurant managers, who find it hard to attract and
keep good workers.
</P>
<P>
   That's especially important in a city such as Atlanta, which
relies heavily on its convention and tourism business. In a
competitive market, guest satisfaction is crucial to ensure
travelers' return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was hard eight years ago,'' said Renaissance
General Manager Bo W. Laterveer. ``But if I knew then what I know
now, then I would have appreciated it. There isn't a hotel in the
city that isn't short-staffed.''
</P>
<P>
   The shallow labor pool for entry-level jobs is ``damaging to our
industry,'' said Tia Gordon, a spokeswoman for the American Hotel &AMP;
Motel Association based in Washington. ``We just can't keep
employees. We don't have enough housekeepers to clean the rooms. We
can't find enough front desk clerks.''
</P>
<P>
   Laterveer, whose hotel has a turnover rate of more than 60
percent, recalled the time a cashier abruptly quit after two days.
In other instances, applicants were rejected because they failed
drug tests or criminal background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes ``we lose people before they even start,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of losing a good worker is high. By one estimate, it
costs a company between $1,500 and $2,000 to replace an hourly
employee who leaves within a year.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue isn't new. Several years ago, the hospitality
industry suffered from turnover rates in the triple digits, said
Debra Cannon, an associate professor in the hospitality school at
Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an awareness that with the Olympics coming and the
growth expected to follow, that there was going to be a real surge
in employment needs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Smart managers took steps to improve their recruiting, training
and retention programs and think creatively.
</P>
<P>
   Laterveer began the ``meet and greet'' program, in part because
of a bellman shortage. Managers, including Laterveer, take turns
helping in the lobby. The hotel also offers English classes and has
a Christmas savings program tied to employees meeting specific
goals. If a worker leaves before December, the money is forfeited.
</P>
<P>
   The Westin Atlanta North distributes fliers to laundromats, nail
salons and apartment complexes in efforts to recruit workers. Also
included in its recruitment program are bounties of as much as $200
to people who refer a worker who stays at least 90 days.
</P>
<P>
   Managers also carry ``You Caught My Eye'' cards that they give
to people they meet who might make good employees.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same for restaurants. The food service industry has
joined others in a new alliance aimed at bringing more overseas
workers into the country to fill empty jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Essential Worker Immigration Coalition is seeking to reform
existing immigration law to make it easier to bring unskilled
workers into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Both restaurant and hotel managers have begun recruiting workers
earlier. Many participate in school-to-work programs that target
high school students. Others recruit heavily on college campuses
and the Internet, and through churches and community associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing things that we never did in the past,'' said Mike
Wiemers, director of training for Huddle House, a Decatur,
Ga.-based 24-hour restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company has a job sharing program with area
department and grocery stores in which an employee might work at
one place during the day and the other job at night or on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are also exploring population segments previously
ignored, such as the disabled and older workers.
</P>
<P>
   But getting employees in the door is one thing; keeping them is
another. Executives worry that it will be hard to find good,
experienced managers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   At Huddle House, managers and franchisees attend classes that
deal with such topics as hiring and retention. ``We talk about how
we deal with people, how to talk with people and how to value
people,'' he said.
</P>

 &HT;    Banks compilation a powerful hit parade
 &HT;    By Ron Franscell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Russell Banks isn't a household name in American
letters, and what fame he has scratched together as an author has
come from powerful novels such as ``Affliction'' and
``Cloudsplitter.'' But, like Hemingway, Banks is best (and feels
most free) when he writes short, and a new compilation might
finally give him his due as a short story writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Angel on the Roof'' is a literary album of Banks' greatest
hits, 31 examples of what he calls ``the best work I have done in
the form over the thirty-seven years since I began trying to
write.'' Twenty-two of the stories first appeared in four
lesser-known collections between 1975 and 1986; of the nine more
recent stories, six have been published in magazines such as
Esquire and newspaper literary supplements. More importantly, Banks
has freely revised many of the old stories, so even his most ardent
fans can expect to see something new.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a compendium designed to illustrate the arc of
Banks' extraordinarily underappreciated career. The stories aren't
flung onto the page chronologically, but grouped more thematically,
with a sense of flow that is uncanny. ``Searching for Survivors''
is among the earliest of his stories but appears among the last
half-dozen here; ``Djinn'' is one of the newest _ and first in this
impressive queue of tales.
</P>
<P>
   Banks' stories are elegantly postmodern, beautiful and striking,
full of diverse voices and disquietingly vulgar settings, mostly in
New England. Some are only a few pages long; others go deeper and
longer. But many of the stories, though sometimes suffocatingly
bleak, are also capable of poignant humor and broad satire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firewood'' is arguably the strongest and most agonizing, a
vivid precursor of Banks' later, gut-wrenching novel,
``Affliction.'' Nelson Painter is a disconsolate drunk, a working
man whose career has petered out. He rises early on a Sunday
morning yearning almost as much for his first drink of the day as
for some fleeting evidence that he hasn't ruined more lives than
his own. Although he is haunted by dreams, his life has been
anything but dreamlike:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was years ago, in the dream. It was like most of his dreams
that way, a phenomenon that goes on disturbing him, irritating him,
actually, infuriating him sometimes, because you ought to be able
to move on in your dreams, just as you move on in your life. Your
kids grow up, you marry another woman, you move away, come back,
change, and change again. You'd think your dreams would know that
and would somehow deal with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Also notable are ``The Burden,'' a heartbreaking father-son
story; ``Theory of Flight,'' in which a divorced young mother
escapes with her children to the solace of her past, only to find
an indeterminate future; ``The Fisherman,'' about a man who seeks
only solitude and a chance to live out his days in an elaborately
built ice-fishing hut; and ``Black Man and White Woman in a Dark
Green Rowboat,'' an erotic and minimal love story.
</P>
<P>
   Banks' nine novels and four short story collections include
Pulitzer finalists ``Continental Drift'' (1985) and
``Cloudsplitter'' (1998). Hollywood has been very good to Banks'
books: The film version of 1989's ``Affliction'' won a 1998 best
supporting actor Oscar for James Coburn; ``The Sweet Hereafter''
(1991) was the 1997 Cannes Film Festival winner and received
Academy Award nominations for best director and best screenplay
adaptation. Now, Banks' ``Continental Drift,'' ``Rule of the Bone''
and ``The Book of Jamaica'' are also being adapted for film. He's
won a Guggenheim Fellowship, an O. Henry and Best American Short
Story Award and a Literature Award from the American Academy of
Arts and Letters . . . yet his is still not the most likely name to
leap to the mind of even the keenest short story fan.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, 60, grew up in the blue-collar milieu of New Hampshire
and eastern Massachusetts, places and landscapes that haunt his
writing. Before his writing life, he labored as a plumber, a shoe
clerk and a window dresser; since those working-class days, he has
taught at Columbia University, Sarah Lawrence College, the
University of New Hampshire, New England College and New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   The form ``invites me today, as it did back then, to behave on
the page in a way that is more reckless, more sharply painful, and
more broadly comic than is allowed by the steady, slow, bourgeois
respectability of the novel,'' Banks tells readers.
</P>
<P>
   And it might be the renaissance of the short story that finally
elevates Banks to his proper place among American writers. He ranks
with John Cheever as one of the masters of the contemporary form.

 &HT;    Einstein's brain: No intellectual leaps this time
 &HT;    By John D. Thomas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Albert Einstein was so intellectually significant that
his very name is a synonym for genius. The father of the theory of
relativity and the mind behind the awesome destructive power of the
atomic bomb, he died on April 18, 1955, in Princeton, N.J., of a
ruptured aortic aneurysm.
</P>
<P>
   Late in his life, Einstein said, ``I want to be cremated so
people won't come to worship at my bones.'' After he died, his
request was honored and his family scattered his ashes in a private
ceremony along the Delaware River. There was just one problem with
Einstein's last wishes being carried out: Not all of him went up in
flames. What Einstein's son Hans Albert didn't know was that the
scientist's brain, the 20th century's ultimate supercomputer, had
been taken out of his body and saved by the pathologist who
performed the autopsy, Thomas Harvey. Einstein did not donate his
body to science, but Harvey decided to take a piece of it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   After the fate of the brain became public knowledge, Harvey told
the press that he was going to research and probe the organ for its
secrets and produce a study. Four and one-half decades later,
however, the pathologist has yet to publish such a work. (Many
scientists believe that you cannot extrapolate anything about the
nature of genius from cerebral remains.) Several writers have
tracked down the enigmatic Harvey over the intervening years and
documented his strange saga, but Michael Paterniti takes the
doctor's bizarre tale to a quirky new level in ``Driving Mr.
Albert.''
</P>
<P>
   Paterniti befriended Harvey while writing an article about
Einstein's brain for Harper's magazine that would become the basis
for this book. During their interviews, the author discovered that
the doctor had some unfinished business with the famous gray
matter: He wanted to take the brain to Einstein's granddaughter,
Evelyn, who lives in Berkeley, Calif. ``Although he didn't explain
why,'' Paterniti writes, ``I assumed he might be facing down some
late-in-life desire to resolve the past with the Einstein family
once and for all.'' Paterniti suggested that he drive Harvey and
the brain from Princeton to Berkeley, and Harvey accepted the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   On a snowy February day, the doctor and the writer hopped into a
teal Buick Skylark rental car and began their odd asphalt odyssey.
Soon into the trip, however, Paterniti comes to a rather shocking
realization: Harvey won't tell him anything about the brain. The
author had believed that days alone in a car with Harvey would give
him the opportunity to extract all the secrets the doctor was
keeping about the brain, but Harvey won't budge. So instead of
dishing those cerebral secrets, Paterniti is forced to find filler.
</P>
<P>
   He pads the book with information about the life and times of
Einstein (nothing new there), and he also grasps for forced
symbolic connections between the brain and the road trip itself.
For example, in Missouri the two stop by the presidential library
of Harry Truman (he of atomic bomb infamy), and they take a side
trip in Kansas to see the preserved remains of eccentric religious
sculptor Samuel Perry Dinsmoor. (Get it? They too are traveling
with the preserved remains of an eccentric visionary.)
</P>
<P>
   The whole on-the-road exercise is oddly unsatisfying, and it
ends with a merely perfunctory visit with Evelyn Einstein. Even
face to face with the famous physicist's kin, the always stubborn
Harvey won't show the cards he's holding (if he's holding any at
all). On the surface, the idea for ``Driving Mr. Albert'' is
brilliant, but once you probe too deeply, you realize that it's
essentially a trip to nowhere.

 &HT;    Biography reveals the person behind icon of civil rights
movement
 &HT;    By Allen Barra
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The literature of the civil rights movement spans 150
years and includes libraries of academic histories, personal
accounts and oral recollections, but it wasn't complete until
historian and National Public Radio commentator Douglas Brinkley's
``Rosa Parks,'' the latest in the Penguin Lives series. Amazingly,
this is the first serious biography of the unlikely and unexpected
heroine who gave birth to the modern civil rights movement _ ``not
a saint, but a symbol of the triumph of steadfastness in the name
of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Tuskegee, Ala., in 1913, Rosa McCauley Parks was raised
by a schoolteacher mother who adhered to Tuskegee Institute founder
Booker T. Washington's belief that cleanliness and high moral
character were ``civilizing agents.'' Her education, which included
four years at the progressive Montgomery Industrial School for
Girls, was cut short by her mother's illness; she went to work at a
textile plant, becoming an accomplished seamstress. In 1932 she
married Raymond Parks, a barber and a charter member of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; they
settled in a modest apartment in a two-story brick housing project
in a Montgomery ruled by Jim Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Parks was more than a blue-collar worker who one day
decided not to give up her seat on the bus. She was a longtime
volunteer worker for the NAACP, stamping envelopes, answering
phones and typing letters _ a had been looking for a ``test case''
to challenge Alabama's segregation laws, only to be frustrated when
their subjects were found to have backgrounds that couldn't
withstand the inevitable scrutiny of a white press and legal
system. They quickly overcame their amazement and organized a plan
to take advantage of Parks' boldness. And so, that December, ``in
the humble setting of Rosa and Raymond Parks' linoleum-floored
living room a group of Americans, with less than five hundred
dollars among them, banded together to stand up for the principles
of democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In this adroit melding of biography and history, Brinkley brings
Parks' life and times into focus by drawing from sources as diverse
as King's writings and the lyrics of a Sam Cooke song that inspired
Rosa. We're offered fascinating glimpses into the movement that
formal histories might have ignored _ for instance, the jealousy
directed toward King and Parks, who, as if she didn't have enough
to concern her, became a target of male chauvinism. Her former
NAACP boss is quoted as calling Parks ``a lovely, stupid woman the
media built into an icon,'' and ministers whom she respected
greeted her with ``Well, if it isn't the superstar!'' Sadly, even
Abernathy treated her with condescension.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rosa Parks who emerges from Brinkley's book was anything
but an attractive token. In truth, her views often seemed to waver
between the nonviolence of King and the militance of Malcolm X. ``I
don't believe in gradualism,'' she told an interviewer in 1967,
``or that whatever is to be done for the better should take forever
to do.'' A student of Gandhi, she nonetheless identified with the
words of playwright Lorraine Hansberry: ``Negroes must concern
themselves with every single means of struggle: legal, illegal,
passive, active, violent and nonviolent.'' By the mid-1960s, writes
Brinkley, ``the gentle Christian woman had become a tough-minded
free-thinking feminist.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be no Cliffs Notes on the long struggle for civil
rights in America, no short form for the voluminous literature of
the people who fought to extend the principles of American
democracy to the descendants of slaves. But for the generation that
has grown up in integrated America, Rosa Parks is a superb starting
point and a vivid illustration of how a single life can make a
difference.

COLUMN: FORGETTING THE BACK-SEAT MISERY OF YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Conn., Mass., N.J., Pa., N.H., N.C., Maine)   By MATTHEW PURDY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DARIEN, Conn. _ In Lisa Del Papa's childhood, vacations meant
long hours of enforced intimacy in the family car. ``We did one to
Cape Cod at that age when you can't stand being with your parents
and I couldn't stand Cape Cod,'' she said. ``I wrote to my best
friend every night that I hated vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   So there she was this week, at age 34, of free will and sound
mind, idling with her husband and a 13-month-old daughter at the
Connecticut Turnpike rest area here, ready to get back in their
car, packed with luggage and toys. ``Now we have Ellen and we're
going to Cape Cod,'' she said cheerily, holding her daughter. ``I
hear it's beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   More proof that those who forget the lessons of family car
vacations are doomed to repeat them.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide amnesia has struck again as close relatives climb
into close quarters and drive away from everything back home,
except one another. It's that special moment, or many moments, or
several days (a seeming eternity, really) when, as one man said,
pointing to his laminated-looking children in the back of the
family van, ``they're bored and we're driving.''
</P>
<P>
   The petroleum industry, in a humanitarian move, tried to spare
Americans the car trip this summer by charging more for a gallon of
gas than the going rate for a cup of coffee. But still, we blithely
tank up on latte and unleaded, and head for the open road.
</P>
<P>
   After all, as only genome mappers can explain, we're wired to
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first hour was OK,'' Del Papa reported on the second
morning of a planned three-day trip from Princeton to Cape Cod.
``We've been listening to a Mickey Mouse tape. I've been singing
politically incorrect songs like `Ten Little Indians.''' Del Papa
said that as her husband, Jan-Olaf, drove, she tried to toss toys
to her daughter faster than Ellen was dropping them. It was
cherished quality time with Ellen, but when Del Papa was asked to
imagine her future, say six hours hence, she said, ``We're going to
have whiskey in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Whiskey, and other alcoholic beverages, remain legally incorrect
in the car (in fact, one mother said she and her children passed
the miles singing ``Ninety-Nine Bottles of Ginger Ale On the
Wall''). But recent upgrades in family car vacations include
E-ZPass, Gameboys and sibling-rivalry-resistant triple-row seating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The TV helps,'' said Joy Borbidge, traveling home from North
Carolina to New Hampshire with her husband, two teen-age daughters
and a 10-year-old son. ``Everybody has their own personal CD
player.'' Joy and her husband, Brad, had the Dead on the radio, and
the kids had the Backstreet Boys and Christina Aguilera on their
headphones.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a film festival under way in the family Windstar.
``We just left Philadelphia and the kids said it will take four
movies to get home,'' Borbidge said. ``They're watching `Big Daddy'
now. They already watched `The First Wives Club.' The girls don't
want to watch `Star Wars.' You know how it is.'' It was a rec room
on radials, and at one point Borbidge relinquished the wheel and
jumped in the back to catch the screening of ``Dances With
Wolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was anticipating 15-year-old Jenna's threat to take the
wheel once they got into New Hampshire, where her learner's permit
would allow her to drive. ``We're going to hide,'' said her
14-year-old sister, Jamy.
</P>
<P>
   Many adults manage a pioneer spirit about car trips. They assure
you that if they leave early and traffic is moving and the
back-seat wrestling doesn't necessitate emergency room visits, they
can make it from the tip of Long Island to the Bering Strait by
sundown. And their children don't need electronic toys, they're
thrilled playing hangman and studying French infinitives.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's another side to this story. Joe and Sue
Gallen were saying how well the trip from Reading, Pa., to Maine
with their three boys was going. It was nothing like the rollicking
adventure Joe Gallen had growing up in a family of 10 children who
traveled the country in a motor home one summer, forgetting the
oldest child at one stop and smashing the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gallens were having fun, they said. The traffic was
moving along, they were playing games with their boys, and the
older one was even reading to the younger ones.
</P>
<P>
   To which a little voice squeaked from the back seat: ``And I'm
sick of it.''

THE ALL-STAR GAME HAS SEEN ITS SHARE OF THE BIZARRE 
</HEADLINE>
  David Fischer is an author and sports historian whose books include
``The 50 Coolest Jobs in Sports'' (Arco, 1998).

<P>
   The 71st Major League Baseball All-Star Game will be played
Tuesday night at Turner Field in Atlanta. Through the years, the
All-Star Game has been the vehicle for some of baseball's legendary
accomplishments. Here is a highly eclectic lineup card of stellar
highlights.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Fever
</P>
<P>
   The first All-Star Game was staged in 1933, at Comiskey Park, in
conjunction with Chicago's Century of Progress Exposition. The idea
came from Arch Ward, sports editor of The Chicago Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   Ward persuaded the league owners to stage a game between stars
from the American and National Leagues. Ward's proposal was for a
one-time event, but the All-Star Game proved so popular, it has
been played every year since _ except in 1945, when it was called
off because of travel restrictions during World War II. (There were
two All-Star Games from 1959 to 1962, to benefit the players'
pension fund.)
</P>
<P>
   At the inaugural All-Star Game in 1933, Babe Ruth slammed the
first home run in its history, a two-run shot off Wild Bill
Hallahan to help the Americans capture a 4-2 victory over the
Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   King Carl and Dr. K
</P>
<P>
   In 1934, at the Polo Grounds in upper Manhattan, Carl Hubbell of
the New York Giants used his dazzling screwball to strike out five
future Hall of Famers in a row: Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx,
Al Simmons and Joe Cronin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1984 game, Hubbell threw out the ceremonial first pitch
at Candlestick Park in San Francisco to mark the 50th anniversary
of his achievement. Then Hubbell watched as Fernando Valenzuela and
19-year-old Dwight Gooden, the youngest All-Star in the game's
history, combined to break his record with six consecutive whiffs.
</P>
<P>
   All-Star Injuries
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis Cardinals right-hander Dizzy Dean sustained a broken
toe when he was hit by a line drive off the bat of Cleveland's Earl
Averill in the third inning of the 1937 game at Griffith Stadium in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dean, who at 26 had already won 134 career games and was on his
way to another outstanding season in 1937, tried to come back too
soon. He altered his delivery to favor the injury and ruined his
arm. The next season, Dean was traded to the Chicago Cubs, and his
brief but brilliant career was never the same.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, in the first All-Star Game to be broadcast on
television, Boston's Ted Williams hurt his left elbow in the first
inning while making a catch against the left-field wall at Comiskey
Park. Williams, who stayed in the game and contributed a
run-scoring single in the fifth inning, did not know that the elbow
was broken until the following day. He was lost until the end of
the season, as Boston finished four games back.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota's Harmon Killebrew became another All-Star Game
casualty in 1968 at Houston's Astrodome, in the first indoor
contest and the first played on artificial turf. Killebrew,
stretching for a throw at first base, tore a hamstring and missed
two months.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy Proves a Point
</P>
<P>
   American soldiers fighting the war in Europe followed the 1943
game by listening to the game at Shibe Park in Philadelphia on
shortwave radio. An outfielder named DiMaggio was the hitting star,
but the DiMaggio was Pittsburgh's Vince, who singled, tripled and
homered.
</P>
<P>
   The American League pocketed its eighth victory in 11 games,
despite having no Yankees in the lineup. Yankees manager Joe
McCarthy, defying critics who suggested the Junior Circuit could
not win without his Yankees, refused to play any of his six players
selected to the team. It was the only time in All-Star Game history
that no Yankee got into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Had a Blast
</P>
<P>
   The 1946 game at Boston's Fenway Park fittingly turned into the
Ted Williams Show. Williams returned to baseball after three years
at war in spectacular fashion. The Splendid Splinter set All-Star
Game records with four hits, including two home runs, four runs
scored and five runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The eighth-inning confrontation between Williams and Pittsburgh
pitcher Rip Sewell would become one of the most unforgettable
moments in All-Star Game memory. Sewell was the master of the
``eephus pitch,'' a high-arcing blooper pitch. When Sewell lobbed
his infamous eephus, Williams blasted a three-run home run over the
right-field wall, the first homer hit off the looping pitch. The
Americans defeated the Nationals, 12-0, in the most lopsided
shutout in All-Star Game competition.
</P>
<P>
   Legendary Winners
</P>
<P>
   Dean Stone of the Washington Senators and Stu Miller of the San
Francisco Giants were winning pitchers overshadowed by
circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Stone entered the game in the eighth inning in relief
of Bob Keegan with two out and Red Schoendienst on third base.
Before Stone's first delivery, Schoendienst attempted to steal home
and was tagged out. When Larry Doby tied the game in the bottom of
the inning with a homer and Nellie Fox drove in the game's final
two runs with a bases-loaded single, Stone became the winning
pitcher without throwing a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   According to legend, Miller was blown off the mound by the wind
during one of the 1961 games at blustery Candlestick Park. The NL
was leading, 3-2, with one out in the ninth and Miller pitching to
Rocky Colavito with two men on base. When he took his set position,
a fierce gust of wind blasted the 165-pound Miller, causing a
slight wobble. The umpire called a balk to advance the runners, and
the AL tied the score. When the NL won in the 10th, Miller was the
winning pitcher, but the next day, ``Miller Blown Off Mound'' was
the headline. ``I wasn't blown off that mound,'' Miller said. ``I
just waved a little.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vote Early and Often
</P>
<P>
   Fans selected the eight starting position players from 1947 to
1957. But partisan voting in 1957 brought about the demise of
elected All-Star teams. Cincinnati fans stuffed the ballot boxes
full of Reds and had apparently elected a starting squad of George
Crowe at first base, Johnny Temple at second, Don Hoak at third,
Roy McMillan at shortstop, Frank Robinson in left field, Gus Bell
in center, Wally Post in right and Ed Bailey as catcher.
</P>
<P>
   Before the results were announced, Commissioner Ford Frick
declared that Crowe, Bell and Post were disqualified as starters,
selecting Stan Musial, Willie Mays and Hank Aaron in their place.
</P>
<P>
   This ballot stuffing by Cincinnati fans resulted in players,
coaches and managers making the All-Star Game choices from 1958 to
1969.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, the new commissioner, Bowie Kuhn, ruled that the
selection of starting lineups be returned to the fans. But the
flawed balloting system, sponsored by Gillette, offered a choice
among only six players at each position. Al Kaline, Detroit's
perennial All-Star, was not listed on the ballot. Atlanta's Rico
Carty, who sported a gaudy .428 batting average at the break, and
California's Alex Johnson, the eventual AL batting champion, were
not listed either.
</P>
<P>
   The game, played at Cincinnati's Riverfront Stadium, which had
opened only two weeks earlier, was the site for a stunning ending.
The NL scored three runs in the ninth inning to tie the score. In
the 12th, the Reds' Pete Rose thundered head-on into Cleveland
catcher Ray Fosse and sent him crashing backward as Rose crossed
the plate with the winning run. Fans would later vote Rose as the
starter at five different positions, an All-Star Game record.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Anniversary
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, the Midsummer Classic returned to Comiskey Park, which
was the site of the first All-Star Game 50 years earlier. In the
third inning, Fred Lynn of the California Angels hit a grand slam
off the Giants' Atlee Hammaker. It was Lynn's fourth All-Star home
run and the first grand slam in All-Star history. Lynn's clout
punctuated a seven-run inning as the AL coasted to a 13-3 victory
and ended its embarrassing 11-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Bo Knows All-Star Games
</P>
<P>
   Bo Jackson of the Kansas City Royals received the most valuable
player trophy in the 1989 game _ the first played with the
designated hitter _ as he led the Americans to their first repeat
victory in 31 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, playing left field and batting leadoff for the first
time in his brief major league career, blasted a 448-foot home run
over the center-field fence at Anaheim Stadium off starter Rick
Reuschel. The next batter, Wade Boggs, also homered, the first time
in All-Star history that the first two batters in a game had
homered. Nolan Ryan, at 42, became the oldest All-Star winning
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Jackson, who also played running back for
the Los Angeles Raiders, was named to the Pro Bowl, becoming the
only athlete chosen to play in both the All-Star Game and the Pro
Bowl.

 &HT;    Environment heating up as regional issue
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH, N.C. _ What will be the political impact on our sunny
region if the earth's climate really does become hotter and more
inhospitable over the next century, as reports like the one
released in June by a federal study commission predict?
</P>
<P>
   Coastal North Carolina, with its windswept dunes and picturesque
coves, may be as good a vantage point as any to begin sorting
through that question.
</P>
<P>
   Not that all the scientific controversy over global warming is
any closer to an answer here than anywhere else. Ryan Boles, the
assistant state climatologist, has found evidence of a slight
warming trend along the coast over the past 50 years, but the
timeline is too short and the data is too inconclusive to prove any
massive climate change, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is global or not, however, the weather in North
Carolina does appear to be changing. There is a much stronger
scientific consensus that storm activity in the Atlantic runs in
cycles, and since 1995, the seas off North Carolina's coast appear
to have entered a turbulent period that could last for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll almost put a guarantee on it: Within the next five years,
we'll have another major hurricane affect the North Carolina
coast,'' Boles said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, heavy rains spun off by Hurricanes Dennis and Floyd
caused record flooding in the state, ruining whole towns and
washing drowned hogs by the thousands down the state's once
pristine streams. That was followed last winter by a 20-inch snow
and ice storm that hit areas already reeling from the flood.
</P>
<P>
   Add another hot summer, and it's fair to say North Carolina is
experiencing much the same effects that have been predicted for
global warming, whether global warming actually has anything to do
with it or not.
</P>
<P>
   This rough patch of weather also comes at a time when North
Carolina and the South are beginning to reckon with the impact
people are having on the environment, in political terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started working with environmental problems as a
lobbyist here, people thought it was something they worried about
in the Northeast,'' said Bill Holman a former Sierra Club lobbyist
tapped by Gov. Jim Hunt to be the state's top environmental
officer. ``The environment has come home.''
</P>
<P>
   The specific subject of global warming remains as politically
palatable as Darwinism would have been a hundred years ago. Vice
President Al Gore has taken much ridicule for broaching the subject
in his book, ``Earth In the Balance.'' Holman counted it noteworthy
when Hunt, departing from his prepared text in a speech at the
dedication of a natural science museum here, mentioned global
warming before a group a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   If it is possible to predict an era of storms, emergency
management and coastal zoning are two issues that should become
more politically volatile. But these subjects aren't on the front
burner in this year's governor's race between Republican Richard
Vinroot, former Charlotte mayor, and Democratic Attorney General
Mike Easley.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt, in his last year in office, is supporting a major overhaul
in the state flood plain development plan, but long-range
forecasting doesn't figure prominently in the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's going to pass, even after the worst flood
in our history,'' Holman said. ``A lot of people say we don't need
it because it's probably not going to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential for turbulent weather to beget stormy politics has
already been demonstrated next door in South Carolina. Gov. Jim
Hodges touched off a public furor early in his administration over
the way the state handled the coastal evacuation when it appeared
Floyd was headed straight for that state.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, however, Hodges' experience may have sent a
negative message about overestimating the weather. Floyd veered
away from South Carolina and lumbered up the coast, calling into
question the governor's judgment in ordering the massive
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   While it hasn't touched off a political discussion about climate
changes, last year's weather did play a major role in bringing the
state's environmental problems to the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every gubernatorial election the issues are education,
development and something else. And this year that something else
is the environment,'' said Ran Coble, director of the North
Carolina Center for Public Policy Research.
</P>
<P>
   The grisly images from the flood ``left an indelible
impression,'' said Molly Diggins, a lobbyist for the North Carolina
Sierra Club, and turned the hog farms into a symbol for lax
environmental enforcement in several areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two competing sentiments: the concern of native
North Carolinians about their state and their pride in it, and the
long-standing tradition of looking the other way in order to
promote business growth,'' Diggins said.
</P>
<P>
   In a manner reminiscent of the way state tourism boards divide
their territory up by vacation attractions, North Carolinians tend
to regionalize their environmental problems. The mountains have
acid rain and air pollution from all the tourists driving through.
Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham are encountering sprawl. Eastern North
Carolina has hog farms, and the coast has overdevelopment.
</P>
<P>
   Simply knitting these diverse concerns into an effective
movement has been a challenge for environmentalists, and the floods
may turn out to be a defining moment, like Hunt's appointment
during his final term of Holman, who had been a lobbyist for the
Sierra Club, to head the state Department of Environment and
Natural Resources.
</P>
<P>
   The way the two campaigns react to questions about the weather
corresponds with their broad, election-year themes.
</P>
<P>
   Easley's campaign manager, Jay Reiff, put last year's disasters
within the framework of the Democratic candidate's concerns for the
growing divide between haves and have nots in the states, noting
that small towns and rural areas, already hit by a cut in tobacco
quotas, were the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   If such disasters become more frequent, Reiff said, ``People are
going to look for a governor who's going to roll up his sleeves and
have a plan to deal with it. The state has a justified role in
helping people get back on their feet again.''
</P>
<P>
   Easley has also made water quality a major plank in his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are acts of God, which we can't control,'' Chris Neally,
Vinroot's campaign manager, said of last year's disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican's campaign is centered on school choice and a
plan that would limit state spending according to a formula based
on inflation and population growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the environmental problems that come up in this state
are over-politicized. When it comes to government we need to not
use the environment as a political football,'' Neally said.
</P>
<P>
   The rains last year washed into parts of the 500-year flood
plain, which enhances North Carolina as a backdrop for discussing
the possibility of big, unprecedented climate changes.
</P>
<P>
   But, sensitive to the pressures of developers already pushing to
rebuild, environmentalists point out that the actual amount of
water that fell on North Carolina was less than in the summer of
1955 (which coincides, incidentally, with the end of the last long
storm cycle.)
</P>
<P>
   The destruction was so much worse last year, they argue, because
so much of the state's wetlands buffer has been destroyed, and so
much development is taking place in what were rural backlands 45
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   This, in fact, may be a harbinger of many 21st century stories:
Dangerous weather, striking in so many places where the weather
formerly didn't matter so much.

SPORTS COLUMN: HISTORY LESSON ON CENTER COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Late Friday afternoon Richard Williams sat
in the empty stands of a vacant court at Wimbledon. He sat there
drenched by sun and history. In 24 hours, his older tennis-playing
daughter, Venus, would attempt to grab a bit of history when she
faced Lindsay Davenport in one of the most highly anticipated
matches in years.
</P>
<P>
   Posterity is fine, but first you have to win. She finally did
Saturday when Davenport netted a forehand volley, and Venus was
able to show the emotion that had been so compromised in Thursday's
semifinal victory against her sister, Serena. With her 6-3, 7-6 (3)
victory, Venus became the first African-American woman to win since
Althea Gibson won for the second time in 1958 and the third black
person to win a Wimbledon singles title.
</P>
<P>
   An hour earlier on Friday, Venus and Serena, had won a doubles
semifinal match, and later Sunday they could become the first
sisters to win that championship. But instead of offering
perspective on his daughters, Williams chose to offer hard-edged
snapshots of history in order to make a larger point about his two
daughters' presence here.
</P>
<P>
   He went all the way back to slave ships at Cape Coast Castle
filled with Africans. He talked about how newly arrived bondsmen
and bondswomen endured a process of being broken down, prepping for
work on farms and plantations. How they had language taken away;
traditions taken away. He described how the assault on pride,
self-esteem, dignity shaped priorities, then and now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most black people want to do what white America does,''
Williams said. ``That's why a lot of them are not successful. Lots
of time most black people, if they have something good going for
themselves, they'll move. What we've learned is that we have to go
back and look at our history. Many blacks don't know their history,
so we do what we are told to do, like we did many many years ago in
the fields. Once you learn your history, you don't have to go and
move out of the neighborhood you're in.''
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about how Americans have spent succeeding
centuries reconstructing the history of slavery and its impact on
generations, discovering who and what they are and, by extension,
what the United States is.
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena are large pieces of that puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   They are not your classic pioneers: not understated, muted,
conciliatory. Not grateful. They don't walk the thin line between
embracing who they are and trying not to offend mainstream
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ain't walking a line,'' Richard Williams said. ``We are the
line. We are the history. That's why you're here talking to me and
everyone else is right now. Because when people see the history,
they want to know `What's going on?'
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first came up they said, `They're cocky; you can't
talk to them. They're crazy. Something's wrong.' They didn't know
whether we were a bulldog, a hound dog or what _ but they knew it
was something. But as they kept talking to us, they learned that we
knew our history; we don't need to walk no line,'' Richard Williams
continued. ``Any time a man walks a line that means he needs
something to follow; we ain't following nothing. Now, if you want
to follow behind us, great. You'll learn how to get to the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you learn your history, you feel proud of who you are.
That's all history can teach you,'' Williams said. ``It can't teach
you anything else. So it's not about money; it's about learning
your history _ what you're about, who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Williams sisters making a major impact in tennis and
Tiger Woods dominating golf, three athletes of color have broken
through the thick membrane of history in country-club sport. With
effort, Richard Williams said, not money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take money to be successful in tennis or golf,'' he
said. ``It takes determination to do what you're going to do. With
that determination and a great player and a great deal of hard
work, you will succeed. I really believe that in order to be
successful, you must have a plan. It can't be one in your head
either, it's got to be one that's written out so your optical nerve
can take it to your brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mostly what it takes is determination and having a plan in
place. Knowledge is power; the more knowledge you have, the more
power you have. We as a people don't read what we need to read.
Very few people in America understand our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus and Serena have been peppered with questions about the
meaning of their presence at Wimbledon. The question came up again
Friday after their doubles match.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been so few black people to win Wimbledon or even
just to play outstanding tennis,'' Venus said. ``So hopefully there
will be more. Naturally, we're going to do our best to change that.
We already have.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Williams said he has advised the sisters to answer
questions about the issue of race and history but not to dwell on
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to do any good to talk about it here or
anyplace else,'' he said. ``What would you talk about history here
for? Actually it would be a waste of time to talk about anything
that's here. She,'' Richard Williams said, referring to Venus and
Serena, ``doesn't own anything here, she doesn't need anything
here. In fact, what we see is that they need us here, because we
can sell their magazines, their television and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   The television rating from Thursday's matchup between the two
sisters was a 28 percent increase over last year's telecast.
</P>
<P>
   Williams uncoiled from his narrow seat, rose to his feet. Time
to get back into the fray, more interviews and finally some down
time before the huge match.
</P>
<P>
   Williams looked around at the grounds, the rich green
architecture of Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't come here trying to be a part of this,'' he said.
``We're here because we're all of this.''

SIMILAR STYLES BUT DISPARATE PERSONALITIES TO DUEL FOR MEN'S
TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Out of bravery or foolishness, Patrick
Rafter appears eager to all but crawl through the bars at the zoo
and to step into the den that Pete Sampras prowls.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras is at his most intimidating on Center Court at the All
England Club, where he has snatched up six titles over the last
seven years, where his big-foot serve tramples opponents' spirits,
where he has been nearly unbeatable. But on Sunday, Rafter could
emerge as the perfect foil for Sampras' celebration plans.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has never flinched in Sampras' presence. In fact, he has
snapped back at him both on the court and off. In August 1998,
Rafter served an ace on match point against Sampras in a tour event
in Cincinnati. Sampras thought the ball was out. And when the
umpire did not agree, Sampras' ego seemed punctured by the moment.
Quickly, Sampras' typically cool temperament came unraveled. Not
only did he fume at the call, he also expected Rafter to step
forward and replay the serve.
</P>
<P>
   If Rafter thought the serve was out, he might have. Rafter has a
long history of good sportsmanship, and he is well known on the
tour for giving back points on questionable calls. A year earlier,
he reversed a line call that cost him a match. This time, Rafter
did not see the serve as a fault.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks that followed, Sampras reportedly said that if
Rafter thought the serve was good, he ``must be smoking something
that's not legal.'' Rafter countered by calling Sampras a crybaby.
</P>
<P>
   It was an odd back-and-forth between two very different players.
Outgoing and approachable, Rafter is among the best-liked players
on the tour. Even when he botches a serve toss and allows it to
drop, he waves his hand at his opponent and always says, ``Sorry,
mate.''
</P>
<P>
   The more subdued and serious Sampras is a recluse in comparison.
So in some ways, it was not surprising when Rafter called Sampras
recently and asked for a truce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Pete up and resolved our differences,'' Rafter said
on Friday after surviving Andre Agassi in a spellbinding five-set
semifinal. ``I respect Pete for a lot of things. I think in a lot
of ways he's lightened up over this year. I don't have any problems
with Pete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's too much at stake to be worried about each
other, thinking about your differences with each other. It's all
put behind us now. This is the Wimbledon finals. He's going for his
record, and I'm trying to find one here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter has a chance. Although Sampras holds a 9-4 edge, Rafter
has won three of their last four matches, including the 1998 U.S.
Open final. Oddly enough, in all of their meetings, they have never
played on grass. Here, the serve means everything.
</P>
<P>
   So far in this fortnight, Rafter's surgically repaired shoulder
_ which has a shrinking life span of serves left in it _ has held
up extremely well. The player who was ranked No. 1 in the world
just one year ago is finally getting his groove back. Under
inspection throughout this tournament, Rafter played one of the
best matches of his career against Agassi in the semifinals. Mixing
up his sliced backhands, using different spins on his serve, Rafter
won a match that was more like a brain brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' march to this point has barely tested him. The
12th-seeded Rafter is the first seeded player Sampras has had to
face in the fortnight. Although the less grueling matches have
given Sampras ample time to rest the tendinitis that mysteriously
crept into his left shin during the second round, the level of his
game has been difficult to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still here, and I'm obviously very happy that I've gotten
to this point,'' said Sampras, whose sore shin has limited his
mobility at times. ``When you don't practice on your days off, you
go out there kind of cold. It's not that comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the second round, Sampras was scheduled
to practice Saturday in preparation for Rafter. To get by the
serve-and-volley style of the Aussie, Sampras will have to return
Rafter's grab bag of serves well and take care of his own; he'll
have to find a razor-sharp passing game and be the aggressor on any
short ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a lot of his match with Agassi,'' Sampras said. ``He's
playing great. He's a great athlete. He volleys well, covers the
net as well as anyone in the world. I'm sure we'll both walk out
there a little nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but Sampras is usually unflappable on Center Court. In
advancing to his fourth consecutive final at Wimbledon, Sampras has
won a record 27 consecutive matches on these grounds. That numbing
number of victories might be a little daunting to some, but not to
the competitive Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember going out in a match in '93 and playing him, being
very scared,'' Rafter said. ``But things just went my way, and I
ended up winning it. Since then, we've had some battles, and he's
won most of them. But I've had my couple of wins over him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a Grand Slam final. He's been here many times. It's my
first one here at Wimbledon. I've just got to try to go out there
with the same attitude I went out on the court against Agassi with.
Just be relaxed. That's what I need to do.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE RIGHT FLY AT THE RIGHT TIME GETS THE BASS

<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ As we pulled out of the Springs Country
Store, a weathered cedar bungalow with white trim and inviting
wooden armchairs on the porch, Capt. David Blinken was clearly
stoked. Gnawing on the chocolate-filled croissant in his left hand,
the forest green Jeep Wrangler towing his 16-foot flats boat
wallowing left and right, he kept up a running commentary on the
wonders he beheld.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this guy, where's he going?'' Blinken said
indignantly, as an innocent motorist inched up to a stop sign.
Blinken's thick, elastic features changed, and his gray eyes lit up
as we passed a mound of dirt on a lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow. Nice pile of gravel, huh?'' He jerked the wheel to the
right. ``Hey, that traffic cone should be further out, what's up
with these guys? Pass me my Yoo-Hoo. Hey _ who's got my Yoo-Hoo?''
</P>
<P>
   Blinken's enthusiasm was disarming and touching. And on this day
in late June, it was explicable. For Blinken, a hawk-eyed
39-year-old who operates under the banner of North Flats Guiding,
specializes in casting flies to visible striped bass and bluefish
up on the shallow flats. For 11 gray and drizzly days, he had
barely seen the sun and thus had been operating rather like the art
connoisseur turned loose in the Louvre wearing a blindfold.
</P>
<P>
   But today, today was going to be different.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Blinken was push-poling us along a flat in Napeague Bay. I
pointed out a deer grazing on shore, but it turned out to be a
copper-colored boulder transformed by the lingering fog. It was
10:30 a.m. and still no sun. We cast blindly, sliding over water
that moved along on an outgoing tide.
</P>
<P>
   But we caught only sea robins. These monstrous, blunt-headed
creatures, so named because their pectoral fins are as large and as
pliant as wings, ought to be emblazoned on the mud flaps of pickup
trucks. But they're in business to survive, not to win beauty
pageants, and at that they are expert. You can always count on
nature to expose the flaws in man's aesthetics.
</P>
<P>
   At noon, as we met up with Glyn Vincent and Eugene Gearty for
lunch near the Acabonack harbor inlet, momentary islands of blue
appeared high in the pale sky and, pointing to a disc that
resembled a communion wafer overhead, Blinken eagerly predicted:
``There's our missing sun. We'll be in business soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, by the time we finished our tuna fish sandwiches,
and a discussion of contemporary fly-reel engineering so boring
that I considered calling 911, the overcast was visibly dissipating
and the intense sunlight hurt our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the flats lit up from within. Every shell and pebble
became visible, and the light reflecting off the sandy bottom
turned the water the color of diluted honey. We began to see the
pale, wavering gray shapes of striped bass as they leisurely
cruised the flats.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, a fish would list sideways, probably to rid itself
of sea lice acquired in the ocean, and for a moment its silver
flank gleamed bright as a flashbulb going off underwater. We never
even started the motor. The bass were all over the place, right in
front of us.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, my boatmate Richard Franklin had landed and
released a ``keeper,'' a stout striper of about eight pounds. But
even when the fish are plentiful on the flats, their vulnerability
makes them unpredictable and acutely wary. Their disposition,
combined with the need to make quick, accurate casts and a
seductive retrieve, guarantee most anglers a modest success ratio.
If you bat .250 on the flats, you're a hall of famer.
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour and two bass later, Blinken abruptly declared:
``The fish aren't on this fly. It's way too big and bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Many saltwater fly fishers refuse to believe that fly selection
can be critical to success, but I've learned from Blinken over the
years that bass, if not blues, can be just as finicky as
stream-bred trout. He clipped off the fly, a slender, glittery
imitation of the bait fish commonly known as the sand eel, and
replaced it with a more discreet morsel: a small crab imitation of
his own invention, tied with feathers of muted earth tones. Just
why these hefty fish would choose the equivalent of a sauteed
mushroom cap over a big fat steak is puzzling, but they routinely
do so.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest tonic for bad luck is high skill, and soon we were
catching bass left and right. At one point, a school of four-pound
bluefish appeared, advancing directly toward the boat in a
symmetrical squadron. Unlike sea robins, these predators are
gorgeous as well as efficient, their iridescent sides alight with
tones of pale yellow and sea blue.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Blinken dropped the fly near them, a bluefish bolted
over to seize it. Unlike bass, which are bullish when hooked,
bluefish race for the security of deep water, much like bonefish.
This one severed the monofilament leader long before he got there.
</P>
<P>
   And when our highlight reel of a day ended, we celebrated with
an angler's feast of venison steaks, grilled bluefish, and a
libation that most certainly was not Yoo-Hoo.  &QL;

RODRIGUEZ FINDS HIS NICHE AFTER RIDING AND WAITING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILLENEUVE SUR LOT, France _ In the first week of his first Tour
de France, Fred Rodriguez was happy to be a team worker, leading
out successful sprints for Mapei colleagues and hoping that his own
turn for an exploit would come sooner or later. It came sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Californian joined a 17-man breakaway early
Saturday in the eighth of 21 stages, stayed with the survivors as
constant attacks whittled the group away and then crossed the line
with a fine fourth-place finish in the 171-rider field. That
elevated him into 11th place overall in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt strong and tried to hold the group together for a
sprint finish because I was one of the fastest guys there,''
Rodriguez said. ``It didn't happen, but I'm happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason it did not happen at the end of the 203.5-kilometer
(126-mile) rolling ride from Limoges to Villeneuve sur Lot in
southwestern France was Erik Dekker, a Dutchman with Rabobank and
his country's time trial champion in 1997. He showed that ability
to ride alone strongly when he bolted away from 10 others with 30
kilometers (18.5 miles) to go and held them off by 52 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   On a cool, sunny day and before big crowds, Dekker was timed in
4 hours 22 minutes 14 seconds, a speed of 46 kilometers an hour (28
mph). Xavier Jan, a Frenchman with Francaise des Jeux, was second,
with Vicente Garcia-Acosta, a Spaniard with Banesto, third, 56
seconds behind the winner, and Rodriguez fourth, two more seconds
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Elli, an Italian with Telekom, finished in the main pack
5:42 behind Dekker and retained the yellow jersey of the overall
leader since Dekker started in the nether regions of the standings
based on total time. Fabrice Gougot, a Frenchman with Credit
Agricole, remained in second place overall, 12 seconds behind, with
Marc Wauters, a Belgian with Rabobank, third, 1:17 behind.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is easy to pick out among the Tour riders since he
wears the red, white and blue, star-spangled jersey of the American
professional champion, an honor he won in Philadelphia last month.
In addition, he has been sporting an Old Glory do-rag on his head
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Despite fine results this season, Rodriguez said in a recent
interview that he understood his subsidiary role in the Tour as the
leadout man for Tom Steels, Mapei's star sprinter and the winner of
two stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to help Tom, and those goals I think I've
achieved,'' he said. ``I'm one of his main leadout guys, Stefano
Zanini and myself.'' After Rodriguez goes as hard as he can in the
last half mile, Zanini, an Italian who is riding in the slipstream
behind him, takes over as a pilot fish for Steels to protect him
from both the wind and rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personal goals, I'm still pretty open-minded,'' Rodriguez
continued. ``Things happen, especially in the Tour de France. It's
such intense racing. There are a lot more flat stages that might
suit me,'' he added presciently. ``I'm just waiting to see what
time gives me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it gave him little _ and Rodriguez had himself to
blame.
</P>
<P>
   His future with Mapei looked dubious after the 1999 season, when
he recorded only three minor victories and displeased management
with his lackadaisical behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year I had growing pains,'' he said. ``My first year in
Europe, away from my family, my girl friend, living in a foreign
country, a foreign culture. Figuring out where I belonged took a
while. There were times when I went home and took a little too much
time off.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused and admitted it flatly: ``I took advantage of that
time off'' _ at his home in Emeryville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the year I thought it over. After re-evaluating
my whole year and knowing where my mistakes were and where my
strengths were, I just came into 2000 saying, `This is my year. I
either figure out where I belong or I have to quit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way I put it to myself: I either make a difference
this year or I don't belong here.''
</P>
<P>
   With seven victories this year, he has made a difference. In
addition to the U.S. champion's jersey, he won a daily stage in the
Four Days of Dunkirk race in France this spring and then another
stage and the points jersey in the Tour of Switzerland last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although he now ranks highest among Mapei's riders in the
overall standings, the American is unlikely to remain there in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can climb decently when I need to,'' he said, ``but in my
first Tour I'm going to take it step by step.''

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: AFTER A YEAR, MRS. CLINTON FINDS COMFORT
LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Hillary Rodham Clinton campaigned throughout western New York
over the last few days, her style occasionally invited comparisons
with that of her husband. President Clinton is widely seen as one
of the country's most effective campaigners, and Mrs. Clinton
acknowledges that she has a long way to go to match his political
adeptness.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Clinton seems to have become far more comfortable as a
candidate, spending much of her time at public appearances chatting
with people who come to see her. Indeed, her staff is often driven
to frustration waiting for the first lady to complete the seemingly
endless process of shaking hands, signing autographs, posing for
pictures and discussing issues with voters. As a result, she is
often quite late for appearances, to the consternation of everyone,
it seems, but the first lady herself.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Saturday to compare her style of campaigning with
that of her husband, Clinton characterized herself as ``a baby
campaigner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still in the toddler stage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she seems to get high marks, at least from her fellow
Democrats along the campaign trail. ``Despite the obvious handicap
of having the Secret Service around, she does an extraordinary job
of interacting with people,'' said Stephen Hughes, the mayor of
Elmira, where Clinton spoke at a rally on Friday. ``She never
refuses a greeting line. And she really is very engaging.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point on Friday in Ithaca, Clinton was confronted by a
man standing amid her supporters who was holding a sign reading
``New Yorkers for Rick Lazio. Carpetbaggers Go Home.'' She walked
over to him and shook his hand. ``I thanked him for coming out to
see me,'' she said of the encounter. ``I'm glad to see him. It
shows he is interested in the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton is inclined to discuss all manner of campaign
issues, from the need to energize tourism upstate to her interest
in lower prices for prescription drugs, she is not typically
inclined to discuss herself. But with a year having passed since
she formed her exploratory committee for her Senate race, she has
appeared more reflective than usual during this weekend's campaign
swing through upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   And so the first lady, while seeming a little reserved,
nonetheless talked to reporters about her first campaign for public
office and the experience of traveling throughout the state of New
York. ``I wasn't sure when I first started how I would feel about
it because it is a very different experience,'' Clinton said of
being a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   She said that ``moving from an advocate for causes to becoming a
candidate'' presented her with new challenges to make her positions
clear to voters and to speak more directly to people than she has
before. ``I found that I liked it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton seemed to be more than a little evasive when
asked several times during this upstate campaign tour what she
considered the most difficult feature of being a candidate in her
own right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a challenge feeling comfortable doing it,'' she
said to reporters, after thinking about the question for a moment
or two. ``I wanted to make sure that I was doing it for the right
reasons. And I feel good about it.'' Despite being at the side of
her husband and several other politicians over the last 30 years,
she said, ``I had to learn to be a candidate. Those of you who were
with me early on, I hope have seen a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, Clinton's Republican rival for the Senate,
completed his own bus trip through the state, with reporters often
traveling in his fashionable bus, and spent considerable time
speaking with the news media in what he has dubbed the Mainstream
Express.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton typically rides in her dark van with her aides and
Secret Service agents, she took the unprecedented step of sitting
on the campaign bus with reporters on the 20-minute ride from
downtown Ithaca to the rally in Elmira.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether she had chosen to sit with reporters because
of Lazio's having done so during his concurrent bus tour, Clinton
said that her opponent's practice had nothing to do with the
decision. ``Maybe it's because I haven't been invited before,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   That elicited laughs from a press corps that has been hungering
for opportunities to speak with the first lady outside more formal
press conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's campaign aides, however, explain the bus-tour
conversation more straightforwardly. Until the current upstate
trip, there had been no Clinton campaign bus. Instead, the press
usually traveled behind Clinton in a van or, in the case of her
trips in New York City, as best they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally speaking, all of our press corps can fit into a
van,'' said Howard Wolfson, Clinton's campaign spokesman. ``But
because of the one-year anniversary, there was more press than
usual. So we expanded and got a bus.''

EDITORIAL: LESS MONEY THAN MEETS THE EYE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   A trillion-dollar gift from the productive U.S. economy has
presented both the presidential candidates and voters with the
possibility of addressing a number of competing national problems
or political demands. According to revised budget estimates
released last month, the government can expect an extra $1.3
trillion in revenue over the next 10 years, bringing the official
surplus estimate to an astounding $4.2 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   After the deficit gloom of the 1980s, that number is so huge
that it invites Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush to
engage in a war of promises. Up to a point, that is healthy. A
surplus of more than $4 trillion ought to spark debate about
options whose price tags have until now scared off all but the most
intrepid of politicians. Yet the voters cannot become intoxicated
by the numbers to the point of believing that it is possible to
have tax relief plus hugely expensive new programs and significant
debt reduction all at the same time. The important task remains
choosing policy targets wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Before allocating this anticipated bonanza, Congress will have
to make some critical subtractions. About $2.3 trillion of the $4.2
trillion surplus comes from the Social Security program.
Politicians are nearly unanimous that this money should be used to
pay off the federal debt. Congress is also moving fast to use $400
billion in Medicare surpluses for the same purpose. Though that
does not have any practical effect on the solvency of either
program, debt repayment is supported by a bipartisan congressional
majority as a good step for the economy and hence the long-term
stability of essential services. So subtract about $2.7 trillion,
which leaves a surplus of around $1.5 trillion.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is another factor squeezing down the size of the
usable surplus that Gore and Bush have to argue over. Budget
estimates assume that spending on most existing federal programs
outside Social Security and Medicare _ covering everything from
scientific research to law enforcement _ will remain unchanged. In
fact, reasonable spending growth and Congress' reluctance to let
several temporary tax credits expire will eat up $600 billion,
according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal
research group. The upshot is that by this reckoning the next
president and Congress will have slightly less than $1 trillion of
the original $4.2 trillion to pay for new programs or tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   There will be time later in the campaign for voters and for this
page to choose their priorities for the uncommitted surplus. Right
now, it is an illuminating exercise to do some price shopping that
will show how limited a list that $1 trillion covers. For example,
a program to provide universal access to health insurance like that
proposed by Bill Bradley during his presidential campaign would
probably cost between $600 billion and $800 billion over 10 years.
Adding a decent drug benefit to Medicare would cost more than $200
billion over 10 years. These proposals alone would consume nearly
the entire surplus, as would closing long-term fiscal imbalances in
Social Security and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   This information helps frame the discussion of tax and spending
proposals being put forth by the presidential candidates and by
many Congressional candidates, as well. On the Democratic side,
Gore proposes to cut taxes by about $500 billion over 10 years,
creating subsidies for college tuition, individual retirement
accounts, child care, individual health coverage, nursing-home
care, energy conservation, low-wage workers and married couples. He
would spend about $250 billion on prescription drugs for Medicare
enrollees and about $300 billion for transportation, energy
projects, medical coverage for low-income families and education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would cut taxes by more than $1 trillion over 10 years. He
also proposes to increase defense, health and other domestic
spending by more than $200 billion. His plan to divert part of the
payroll tax to create private Social Security accounts would
eventually draw on general tax revenues by an unknown amount that
could run into the hundreds of billions.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, both candidates are advocating programs with
differing ideological bases, but with the common feature of
exceeding the available surplus. In the early 1990s, Congress
conquered the deficit by carefully taming the growth of spending
and raising taxes. The current task of managing a burgeoning,
though temporary, surplus requires no less care.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of worthwhile objectives. But the debate has to
start with an acknowledgment that the expendable surplus is only
about a quarter of the $4.2 trillion total. Then comes the task of
making the candidates reveal how they would choose among health
coverage, education improvements, Medicare reform and tax cuts.

EDITORIAL: POWERING A HOT CITY  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 9:
</P>
<P>
   New York's summer nightmare begins on a steamy evening when a
few million people suddenly switch on their air-conditioners, in
effect blowing the fuse for a wired city. The dimming of lights on
the Upper East Side last month was a reminder that it can happen,
as it did last July when northern Manhattan suffered a 19-hour
blackout. Consolidated Edison has said the city's newly fortified
neighborhood power grids are ready for soaring temperatures and
power use. Still, there are reasons to worry about how the
nationwide experiment with utility deregulation will affect the
reliability and cost of power in a city that thrives on
electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation, which promised more competition, more alternative
power sources and lower costs to consumers, appears to be playing
transitional tricks in a few areas around the country, including
New York City. As part of its restructuring in the last few years,
Con Edison has been shedding power plants and moving steadily into
the business of distributing power. That means Con Ed must now turn
around and buy power to distribute, a cost that it then passes
along to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   Energy prices this summer are rising for several reasons,
including higher costs for the fuel used to generate power. The
inevitable spike in temperatures will also bring a spike in demand
for electricity. Then there is the city's booming economy, which
encourages people to buy more gadgets and appliances _ which are
simply plucked out of their boxes and plugged into the walls
without advance notice to the utility. Under deregulation,
competition from other power sources was supposed to provide price
relief. But alternative power sources are not readily available for
most city residents.
</P>
<P>
   New York's City Council will begin hearings next week on
concerns that Con Ed's 2.8 million city customers could see energy
costs go up 30 percent this summer, an increase Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani labeled ``outrageous.'' The mayor has advised the company
to cut into its sizable profits rather than raise rates. On a
larger scale, the hearings should determine whether the new Con Ed
has begun favoring its shareholders over its city customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts suggest that the power squeeze in the city will
continue for several summers, until new plants are built or
alternative power sources become available. Gov. George Pataki, the
Legislature and the state's Public Service Commission should
recognize that deregulation is still in its early stages and needs
more oversight if such a daring experiment is to succeed in
providing reliable, environmentally sound and affordable wattage,
especially in an overheated New York City.

THE VINEYARD ADDS TO NEW-HOME CURBS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE

<P>
   AQUINNAH, MARTHA'S VINEYARD, Mass. _ To avoid being swamped in
its own popularity and rising real estate prices, this historic
resort island has tightened its already demanding rules on
residential development. As of this spring, fewer building permits
are being issued and almost no historic structures razed in an
effort to manage growth so that new houses enhance, rather than
overwhelm, the architectural and natural environment
</P>
<P>
   This island, settled in 1642, is filled with historic buildings
set in beguiling natural settings. Still, 18th-century villages dot
a landscape encircled by ocean and threaded with ponds, woods and
fields. Federalist mansions line narrow Edgartown streets,
Victorian cottages cluster around lagoons in Oak Bluffs and
Georgian manor houses still grace erstwhile West Tisbury and
Chilmark farms while early 20th-century fishing shacks overlook
Aquinnah's shores.
</P>
<P>
   But increasingly, wealthy buyers are racing to scoop up the
limited supply of home sites. In their rush, some tear down old
houses and block shoreline vistas to erect big luxury homes known
derisively as McMansions. Soaring land and house costs, meanwhile,
are pricing local working people out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   In response, this spring five of the island's six towns voted to
adopt limitations on construction of new buildings. Only Tisbury
voted the limits down.
</P>
<P>
   This year, only 243 building permits will be issued for new
houses in all five towns (the average number issued since 1983).
Islandwide, including all six towns, 339 permits were issued in
1998, the last year for which statistics are available, according
to Charles W. Clifford, director of the Martha's Vineyard
Commission, the island planning agency. Aquinnah will issue six,
Chilmark 18, West Tisbury 54, Edgartown 93 and Oak Bluffs about 72,
Clifford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These first islandwide caps will be reviewed in three years,''
he added. ``We're aiming to moderate development, give towns time
to assess today's fast growth and pass better rules to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   To promote the preservation of historic structures, open space
and the production of lower-cost housing, most towns offer height
and density bonuses for projects that further those goals. In
Aquinnah and neighboring Chilmark, meanwhile, plans for any new
house must undergo extensive review by a special town commission,
while no building may be torn down without first obtaining a
demolition permit.
</P>
<P>
   Owners can still build if they submit to a one- or two-year
approval process and plan a modest house, said Jerry Weiner, the
Aquinnah building inspector. ``Anyone who wants to make this
fragile outpost theirs must be willing to slow down to examine the
issues we face,'' he said. ``Recently, too many have built big
houses that scar the land and burden the infrastructure without
realizing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But with many islanders working in the real estate industry, not
all favor the caps on construction. ``When supply is low, caps
drive up prices,'' said Arthur Smadbeck, an owner of Priestly &AMP;
Smadbeck Real Estate of Tisbury. ``This exacerbates our affordable
housing shortage. We just closed a unit in the nursing home for
lack of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   The nearby island of Nantucket, where the median house price is
$900,000, faces similar dilemmas, said Jack H. Dunn, the island's
building inspector. Each day, 400 workers are brought in from
Hyannis on Cape Cod. ``It's a serious problem when we have to fly
our bus drivers and cashiers in on a shuttle flight every day,''
Dunn said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the churning real-estate market has ``caused an
onslaught of teardowns and gut rehabs that imperil the historic
island's character,'' according to the National Trust for Historic
Preservation. Last month, it placed Nantucket on a list of
America's 11 most endangered historic places, despite islanders'
attempts to save its architectural heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1950s, Nantucket's Historic District Commission has
approved the exterior appearance of all new structures. A 1997
building cap has limited new house construction; this year, 110
building permits will be issued. This fall, Dunn said, voters will
consider a new growth management plan that will further restrict
new construction based on a point system that favors affordable
housing.
</P>
<P>
   On Cape Cod this April, Provincetown tied new building permits
to the water supply, a limit of about 12 a year, half the previous
amount. In 1998, Falmouth also halved the number of permits; this
year it will approve 200 building permits, said Brian Curry, the
town planner. These historic resorts are under similar market
pressures. On Martha's Vineyard last year there were 1,070 sales of
land and houses, up from 494 in 1990, according to the Martha's
Vineyard Land Bank Commission. The median single-family sale price
is $700,000, with the high end up to $11 million and the low end
disappearing, Smadbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   With land often priced at $1 million an acre and new
construction at least $300 a square foot, even a modest new
3,000-square-foot house can cost close to $2 million, brokers and
architects say.
</P>
<P>
   Each town has a somewhat different set of construction rules,
but they all aim to encourage the construction of ``island
friendly'' houses.
</P>
<P>
   In Oak Bluffs, the new cap was added to 12-year-old historic
preservation rules that require Victorian styling and new houses of
only three bedrooms in some neighborhoods. To fit in, Dr. and Mrs.
Arthur Spielvogel of Ridgewood, N.J., had Peter Breese Architects
design a 3,000-square-foot house on a lagoon with cedar shingles
and an old-fashioned screened-in porch. While the house has a
traditional Victorian exterior, an open interior layout gives it a
spacious feel.
</P>
<P>
   West Tisbury's new zoning code, adopted this spring, expanded
the historic district to embrace 120 properties, up from 12;
adopted a building cap; and now requires a permit for all
demolition, a requirement that recently stopped one buyer from
tearing down a 1600s tavern. The new code also suspends a
three-acre zoning requirement to preserve farmland and promote
lower-priced housing.
</P>
<P>
   West Tisbury wants more projects like Island Co-Housing, which
is just being completed in the woods off North Road. On four acres
of a 30-acre site, John Abrams, who owns the South Mountain Co.,
developed 16 single-family houses priced from $125,000 to $310,000.
Privately, the 16 families raised funds to subsidize the
lower-priced units.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in heaven,'' said Christie Phillips, 38. A year-round
resident who designs interiors and clothing, she moved in with her
two sons this spring after a seven-year housing search. ``I have a
gem of a house and a real neighborhood here with a pond, playground
and community house.''
</P>
<P>
   In rural Chilmark, development bonuses also go to low-cost
housing and salvaging historic structures. Starting in 1990, Ben
Clark, a historic preservationist, and his wife, Suzanne,
disassembled, board by board, the manor that Simon Athearn had
built in 1730 on his farm in West Tisbury. The Clarks were allowed
to add a 300-square-foot addition for a new kitchen to the
reconstructed house.
</P>
<P>
   And to be historically accurate, the house, reconstruction of
which was completed last year, is 28 feet high _ a 4-foot height
bonus over what would be allowed by current regulations.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER DOSE OF FALSE REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last Wednesday night, the producers of ``Big Brother,'' the new
``reality based'' companion to ``Survivor'' in the CBS television
lineup, restaged O.J. Simpson's white Bronco chase across L.A., but
with 10 SUVs instead of 1. Each SUV carried a contestant who will
be immured utterly without privacy day and night in a specially
built house full of cameras and microphones for three months or
until voted out of the bug-house by concerned viewers. The last
contestant to remain wins half a million dollars. The first seven
to leave earn just $350 a week, which, given all the overtime, is
way below minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, the rules of the ``Big Brother'' show state that
``You must not now be a candidate for public office and must agree
not to become one until after the initial broadcast of all programs
in which you appear.'' Too bad. I can't think of a better way to
learn what we really want to know about Al Gore and George W. Bush
than by throwing them into the ``Big Brother'' house for 90 days
with eight putatively ordinary folks. Perhaps voter turnout in
November would be higher if, as on ``Survivor'' and ``Big
Brother,'' a vote for a candidate were actually a vote against him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no reality in reality-based television.
Everyone knows that. But there is no voyeurism either, and that's
the letdown. Everyone on the ``Survivor'' island and in the ``Big
Brother'' house is perfectly aware of the cameras and microphones.
In fact, the clause surrendering your privacy is underlined in the
``Big Brother'' rules. ``Survivor'' is Jerry Springer with sand,
skin rashes and bad food. ``Big Brother'' has all the
self-consciousness of ``It's Garry Shandling's Show,'' without the
good writing and decor. If it is reality you want, spy on 10 people
who do not know they are being watched. CBS still has much to learn
from Allen Funt and old-line Stalinists.
</P>
<P>
   By ``reality,'' of course, CBS merely means that these programs
are unscripted and that the castaways and housemates are ordinary
people. But on the Web site devoted to ``Big Brother,'' the network
has already turned the housemates into characters as identifiable
as Urkel or Barney Fife. And, as ``Survivor'' and a half-century of
TV have proved, a television camera tends to make people talk and
behave in culturally scripted ways, the ways they have seen
represented again and again on television. ``Survivor'' also proves
that if you shoot enough footage and edit hard, you can make almost
anything interesting, except the host of the show, who is really
the only islander with anything to be ashamed of.
</P>
<P>
   You do not have to reach very far before the list of antecedents
to these programs grows almost unmanageable _ it includes
``Gilligan's Island,'' ``The Tempest,'' ``Robinson Crusoe,''
``1984,'' Albert Brooks' ``Real Life,'' Terry Gilliam's ``Brazil,''
and on and on and on. But the theme that really grabs the audience
for these shows isn't shipwreck or communal living or imposed
fasting or the collision between teamwork and self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   What really grabs the audience is self-exposure and, in ``Big
Brother,'' the chance to blackball, one by one, the characters in a
TV show, a power we never had over ``Cheers.'' For now, the
housemates in that Studio City bungalow-fortress are prisoners of
their own exhibitionism. Only time will set them free.

DUEL OF NEW DYNASTIES MAY LIFT THE RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
  (With BKN-NOTEBOOK) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scenario from heaven may be unfolding for the NBA. With
television ratings down and its buzz having given way to a hum,
what is potentially a new millennium version of the engaging 1980s
rivalry between the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics
appears to be taking form.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 1, the Orlando Magic could announce that the free agents
Grant Hill, Tim Duncan and Tracy McGrady will join the team for the
next six years. No contracts have been signed, but Hill has told
his former club, the Detroit Pistons, that he intends to go to
Orlando; McGrady, who grew up in Auburndale, Fla., has said
repeatedly that he wants to play for the Magic; and Duncan is
currently fighting between his loyalty to the San Antonio Spurs and
his desire to team with Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Every Eastern Conference club not coached by Doc Rivers is
hoping that the league's best power forward stays loyal because if
those three, or even just Duncan and Hill, combine forces in
Orlando, the East is theirs. Patrick Ewing's already dim chances of
winning a title would die instantly. Pat Riley would not even have
the best team in his state, let alone division or conference. And
Indiana's retro Conseco Fieldhouse would be as old as the design of
its bleacher seating the next time it saw an NBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, Orlando would be the best team in the
East,'' said a coach from an Eastern Conference playoff team who
requested anonymity. ``It would be them, the Lakers and Portland.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Portland could potentially crash the Lakers' and
Magic's annual finals party, their chances of doing so lessen with
each game since the legs of Scottie Pippen, Steve Smith and Arvydas
Sabonis are getting heavier, not fresher. What you would very
likely have is Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant and whoever versus
Duncan, Hill and McGrady each June, just like the old days when it
was Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and James Worthy versus
Larry Bird, Robert Parish and Kevin McHale.
</P>
<P>
   Even though that might frustrate some of the league's coaches,
it might also bump up the ratings and fan appeal that have been
waning since Michael Jordan's retirement two years ago. ``Something
like that would be good, especially when you look at what's
happening to the league,'' said Wayne Embry, the former general
manager and president of the Cleveland Cavaliers. Dynasties have
been good for the NBA, as fans seem to like familiarity in their
champions. Magic and Bird rescued the league from the public
perception of insignificance and drug abuse by helping their teams
dominate their conferences. Magic's Lakers won eight conference
championships and five league titles in the 1980s while Bird's
Celtics won five Eastern titles and three NBA crowns.
</P>
<P>
   A Los Angeles-Orlando run would not have the unspoken, though
intense, racial undertones that Los Angeles-Boston had, but there
would be contrasting social themes to enhance the drama. Shaq and
Kobe are hip-hop _ brash, stylish and intimidating in their play _
while Duncan and Hill are classical: smooth, staid and quietly
outstanding. As the followings for the Lakers and Celtics sometimes
broke down along racial lines, the followings for the Lakers and
the Magic would perhaps at times flow along cultural ones. And, of
course, there is the story line of O'Neal bolting Orlando for Los
Angeles as a free agent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Also, all four are excellent role models off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this could all be irrelevant if Duncan stays in San
Antonio. In fact, several league executives believe it would be
foolish of Hill to go to Orlando without Duncan. For that reason, a
popular thought around the league is that Hill already knows that
Duncan is going to Florida. After all, they do share the same
counsel in Lon Babby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim's enjoyed it here, and we've obviously enjoyed him,'' said
Gregg Popovich, the Spurs' coach and general manager, who along
with Duncan helped bring San Antonio its first championship two
years ago. ``We've had great success and we still have the same
championship team in the healing process, so to speak. I think it's
a great situation for Tim and we hope that's what he decides to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Only verbal agreements have been made, so if Duncan chooses to
stay in San Antonio, there is nothing to stop Hill from changing
his mind and going to the Spurs or any of the other teams,
including the Knicks, that tried to court him last week. The more
likely scenario, however, has Duncan and Hill going to Orlando,
where they would each receive six-year, $67.5 million contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Obtaining McGrady, who has already said that ``it won't be fair
for Eastern Conference opponents if all three players go to the
Magic,'' will be more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Because Orlando does not have enough money to pay all three
players the maximum immediately, Toronto will either have to agree
to a sign-and-trade deal with the Magic or McGrady will have to
accept playing for $5 or $6 million next season instead of $9
million. If that is the case, Orlando will most likely give him an
out clause after four years that would allow him to receive the
maximum amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   If all of this comes together, the Magic would not only be
envied; it would also be admired. After losing O'Neal and Penny
Hardaway, the young building blocks of what looked like a
championship team, within the last four years, its general manager,
John Gabriel, has repositioned the Magic to be a powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Orlando has done a lot of impressive things,'' Embry said.
``Losing Shaq and Penny could have devastated their franchise. But
they took a negative and turned it into a positive. If all of this
happens, they've done a heck of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps a heck of a service to the league and its fans.

KNICKS IN A BIND; A BARGAINING CHIP
</HEADLINE>
  (With BKN-MAGIC) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After being spurned by Grant Hill, the Knicks are faced with the
fact that they have no comparable Plan B that will be anywhere near
as effective. One member of the organization scoffed when asked if
they could somehow obtain another superstar, such as Seattle's Gary
Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way,'' the Knicks official said. ``That's all just
speculation and stuff people write about, but it can't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks cannot even bring Portland power forward Brian Grant
to New York. Uninterested in the Knicks offer of Marcus Camby and
Chris Childs, the Blazers would demand Latrell Sprewell or Allan
Houston and a front-court player. And the Knicks believe that
parting with either of their star swingmen for Grant would be
ludicrous.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Thomas' agent, Jerry Hicks, has proposed a six-year deal
worth $29.9 million, the maximum amount Thomas can be paid by the
Knicks. It is a reasonable offer, and the Knicks are mulling it
over.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Fortson, the Boston Celtics free agent who is dying to
play for the Knicks, was in an uproar on Thursday after hearing a
false rumor that the Knicks had made a sign-and-trade deal for the
Los Angeles Clippers' Maurice Taylor. Fortson, who is said to be
proudly carrying around the Knicks jersey the club sent to him, has
reportedly been offered a seven-year, $31 million deal from the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   A Bargaining Chip
</P>
<P>
   The players union will hold its annual meeting July 23-28 in the
Bahamas. More than 70 players are expected to attend, plus more
than 100 retired players from the Ex-NBA Players Association. The
players will vote to fill the six vice president slots on their
nine-member board, but the hot topic of conversation could be the
union's purchase of the Continental Basketball Association from
Isiah Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The union has signed a letter of intent to buy the CBA, with its
impetus for the purchase being bargaining power if another work
stoppage takes place when the current collective bargaining
agreement ends in either 2004 or 2005 (the owners have an option
for a seventh year). Owning the CBA would give the union the
infrastructure necessary to put its players to work in the event of
a lockout.

IN CITY, GARBAGE DISPOSALS SLOWLY GAIN POPULARITY
</HEADLINE>
  By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Slowly but surely, the grinding whir of garbage
disposals is joining the symphonic, electronic noise of New York
City's kitchens.
</P>
<P>
   Keep fingers and spoons clear and the water running, hit the
switch and listen to the sweet rumbling of peelings, cores and
antiquated leftovers swirling down the drain. It's a daily ritual
for people in 80 to 90 percent of the custom kitchens in the
Southeast, Midwest and West, and just over half the custom kitchens
in the Northeast, according to the National Kitchen and Bath
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But until 1997, when the City Council lifted its 26-year ban on
garbage disposals, the kitchen-sink route to oblivion was not an
option for most of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years, disposal sales have been brisk but
uneven. ``Contractors as well as homeowners are catching on, but
it's a slow process, because people are not that familiar with them
so much,'' said Joe Jones, an assistant manager with Davis &AMP;
Warshow Inc., a plumbing supply company. He estimates that his
store sells several a week. ``It hasn't hit like wildfire yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he suspected that people were not yet using their
disposals, which sell for $150 to $300, to their full potential.
``It takes time to get used to throwing your food down the sink as
opposed to in a waste receptacle,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Scott, sales manager for the newly offered Chelsea
Mercantile condominiums at Seventh Avenue and 24th Street, said the
developer's decision to include garbage disposals in the building's
renovated kitchens made her job easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have one personally,'' she said. ``If you're cooking,
peeling, or cleaning plates, you just don't accumulate as much
garbage.'' And less garbage means less odor and less vermin, she
added.

<P>
   Virginia Moffat Nickerson, a leader in many philanthropic and
cultural organizations in New York, died June 18 at her home in
Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. She was 73 and lived in New York City and
Cold Spring Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Nickerson was honored by the mayor of New York for her

SCUDDING AT 31 KNOTS: THRILLS ON A CATAMARAN IN RHODE ISLAND
SOUND

   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The grand coincidence was the source of
countless double takes. With tens of thousands of people lining the
shores of Narragansett Bay on Sunday to watch the outgoing Tall
Ships parade of sail, an inbound, 110-foot catamaran called Club
Med weaved its way through a huge spectator fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Between blinks one could take in the classic spoon-bowed
Canadian schooner Bluenose as well as the French-built Club Med, a
relatively spindly wing-masted multihull replete with a powder-blue
paint job dashed with colorful fish and a matching quartet of
gaudy, bikini-clad maidens _ a pair for each bow.
</P>
<P>
   The two ships passing in the day were not only of separate eras.
They appeared to be from different planets.
</P>
<P>
   Like Star Trek's Spock, the next afternoon I was beamed aboard
Club Med with a handful of other journalists and a short guest list
that included the 1992 America's Cup winner, Bill Koch, and the New
York Yacht Club commodore, George Isdale Jr., for a remarkable
daysail in Rhode Island Sound.
</P>
<P>
   My experience with big multihulls is limited, though in the
mid-'80s I did cross the Atlantic with the legendary British sailor
Robin Knox-Johnston aboard his 60-foot cat British Airways, a
hulking craft the French yachting press derisively nicknamed ``the
truck of the seas.'' While the knot-meter sometimes hovered in the
low- to mid-20s on the passage, it was inadequate preparation for a
spin on Club Med.
</P>
<P>
   If British Airways was a pickup, Club Med is a Ferrari. Launched
less than two months ago, the boat has already claimed the title as
the world's quickest oceangoing sailboat, having set the record
last month for the fastest 24-hour run: a purposeful 625.7 miles,
an average speed over 26 knots, on a trip from Spain to the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the fact, it's easy to say that it was easy,'' said Club
Med's skipper, Grant Dalton, a New Zealander who has spent about
half his 42 years racing sailboats around the world. ``But
actually, it was easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalton is new to large catamarans but he says he is hooked, and
soon after his 14-man international crew had hoisted the main and
set a small jib, it was apparent why. Reaching across the entrance
to the bay in about 18 knots of southerly breeze, with a blurred
seascape rapidly receding beneath the net trampolines laced between
the hulls and with the entire boat emitting a low, eerie hum,
Dalton soon had Club Med piercing the light chop at a windswept 31
knots.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get sick of going over 30,'' he shouted. ``I haven't
yet, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for the most part, Club Med's pro crew effected a stoic
nonchalance to the proceedings. But we whooping 30-knot rookies,
tilting unsteadily to windward in the bursts of acceleration, were
beside ourselves. Dooie Isdale's grin resembled the one he sported
while dancing with the Kiwi actress Lucy Lawless _ better known as
Xena, the Warrior Princess _ at a party during last spring's
America's Cup regatta in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   One does not exact such speed without a price, however. In Club
Med's case, however, that means keeping the boat as light as
possible. Asked to describe the freeze-dried chow consumed on
distance races, Nicolas Pichelin, a French crew member, called it
``disgusting.'' And his British mate Ed Danby's reply to a query
about onboard creature comforts was equally pointed:
``nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Misery loves company, of course, and in the months ahead the
Club Med crew will have a slew of fellow offshore sailors with whom
to commiserate, for the boat's ultimate mission is to win the Race,
the round-the-world jaunt that begins Dec. 31 from Barcelona,
Spain. American Steve Fossett's Play Station and Englishman Pete
Goss' Team Phillips are both entered, and another Yank, Cam Lewis,
is still seeking funds for his Team Adventure syndicate. Lewis is
building a sister ship to Club Med.
</P>
<P>
   Dalton believes the victorious crew will circle the planet in 62
days. ``I think you'll need to get on a 675-mile-a-day pace,'' he
said. ``And I think we're capable of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Southern Ocean, Club Med's solid 480-square-foot wing
mast _ an area equal in size to the entire sail plans of many
midsize cruising boats _ could prove troublesome. After all, even
with all sail doused, the mast presents a considerable amount of
windage aloft.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a static load, and if we get 75 knots, we're
tumbleweed,'' Dalton said.
</P>
<P>
   To combat such a dire capsize circumstance, he said Club Med is
equipped with substantial water-ballast tanks in each bow. ``If we
get into a survival situation, we'll flood the tanks, sink the boat
low into the water, and hang on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on a summer afternoon off Newport, life-and-death storms
were the last things on anyone's mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that these boats are 20 percent or more
faster than any boats that have ever been built,'' Dalton said.
</P>
<P>
   Having proved his point, he swung the wheel and pointed his
thoroughbred toward the barn.

VAHE OSHAGAN, 78, PIONEER OF A NEW ARMENIAN POETRY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vahe Oshagan, whom leading critics call the most important
Armenian-language poet in exile, died June 30 in Philadelphia. He
was 78.
</P>
<P>
   He died of complications after heart surgery, said his son Ara.
</P>
<P>
   Oshagan, who also taught and wrote short stories and literary
criticism, revolutionized Armenian poetry by rejecting its imposed
formality, which shunned the concerns of daily life and themes of
alienation and loss. He often wrote in colloquial language and was
for many the voice of the Armenian diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   He was heavily influenced by French existentialists and had
little time for those who dismissed modernity as a corruption of
traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Nichanian, a professor of Armenian studies at Columbia
University, called Oshagan ``the most important poet of this
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time his work was not even accepted as poetry,''
Nichanian said. ``He had a hard time imposing himself as poet.''
</P>
<P>
   Nichanian described a 1963 book by Oshagan, ``The City,'' as
``the most radical book of Armenian poetry in the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   None of Oshagan's work has been published in English. The
British poet Peter Reading recently translated one of his
best-known works, a book of poems written in 1980 called
``Ahazank'' or ``Alarm,'' but it still awaits publication.
</P>
<P>
   In his stark and desperate poem ``Alert,'' published in 1980,
Oshagan wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Each passing minute is my first and last
</P>
<P>
   I must grab the last human
</P>
<P>
   And wrench some utterance from his mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Armenians, whose villages and homes were destroyed by
the Turks in 1915, Oshagan drifted throughout the Middle East,
Europe and the United States, never finding a permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, in 1922. His father, Hagop
Oshagan, was a prominent writer and critic. He was raised in
Jerusalem and Cyprus. He studied in France, where he received a
doctorate in comparative literature from the Sorbonne.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952, he moved to Beirut and taught philosophy, psychology
and Armenian, French and English literature.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the Lebanese civil war in 1975, he moved to
Philadelphia, where he taught at the University of Pennsylvania. It
was there that he published ``Ahazank,'' which incorporates many
streets and landmarks of Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the editor in chief of the literary journal RAFT: an
Annual of Poetry and Criticism, for 11 years. The journal publishes
English translations of Armenian poetry.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Ara, Oshagan is survived by his wife,
Arsine; another son, Haig; and a sister, Anahid Voskeritchian.

JOHN W. BARNES, 80, MADE FILMS ILLUMINATING RACE AND ARTS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Ill.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Wadsworth Barnes, who directed, produced or
wrote more than 100 educational films, died June 27 at the New York
University Medical Center in Manhattan. He was 80 and lived in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, Barnes received an Academy Award nomination for ``The
Living City,'' his documentary about urban problems. From 1959
through 1971 he made a series of films about classical Western
civilization and Shakespearean themes, including the three-part
``Shaw vs. Shakespeare'' with Donald Moffat as Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' films regularly drew upon the expertise of scholars like
Clifton Fadiman and Mortimer Adler and featured actors like Richard
Kiley, Judi Dench, Douglas Campbell and Frances Sternhagen.
</P>
<P>
   He also made a series of 14 films with Marcel Marceau and
collaborated with the poet Archibald MacLeish and the composer Ezra
Laderman on two films, ``Magic Prison: The Poetry of Emily
Dickinson'' and ``Keats: His Life and Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Belford, N.J., on March 25, 1920, Barnes attended the
University of Chicago. He began experimenting with filmmaking in
the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   His first film, about interracial refugee camps, was titled ``To
Live Together'' and was produced with money from the Chicago
Anti-Defamation League. In 1951, Barnes wrote, filmed and was a
producer of the groundbreaking ``People Along the Mississippi'' for
Encyclopaedia Britannica.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by George Weisenborn, the film portrayed the
interaction of two boys, one white, the other African-American, as
they tried to deal with racial prejudice. His last film was a 1977
adaptation of Walter Van Tilburg Clark's ``The Portable
Phonograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes is survived by his wife, Jeanne; a daughter, Judith, of
Brooklyn; two sons, Ezra, of Brooklyn, and Joshua, of Honolulu; and
two grandchildren.

CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, A LEGAL CONSULTANT TO NIXON, DIES AT 72 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Calif., Conn., Pa., Minn., N.Y.)   By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Alan Wright, an authority on constitutional law and the
federal courts who represented President Richard Nixon at a crucial
moment in the Watergate scandal, died on Friday at the North Austin
Medical Center in Texas. He was 72 and lived in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications after recent lung surgery, his
family said.
</P>
<P>
   Wright was an expert on court procedure who argued 13 cases
before the Supreme Court and was a leader of the faculty at the
University of Texas Law School in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   As a special legal consultant to Nixon in summer 1973, he argued
unsuccessfully that the constitutional separation of powers between
the executive and judicial branches protected the president from
turning over White House tape recordings to the special prosecutor,
Archibald Cox. Eventually, the tapes helped prove the extent of the
conspiracy to obstruct justice and led to Nixon's impeachment by
the House and his resignation.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations with Cox, and in arguments before U.S. District
Judge John Sirica and later before a court of appeals, Wright
insisted that the prosecutor's demands to obtain the tapes for a
grand jury investigating the break-in at the Democratic Party
headquarters in the Watergate Hotel were an intrusion by the courts
into the powers of the presidency. He even suggested that Nixon
would defy a judicial ruling against him. But after losing the
court battle and failing to reach a compromise with Cox, who was
fired in what became known as the Saturday night massacre, Wright
announced that Nixon would comply after all. During the rest of the
Watergate matter, Wright's role was less prominent.
</P>
<P>
   While the Watergate case put Wright most squarely before the
public, in legal circles he was well known as the senior author of
a 55-volume treatise, ``Federal Practice and Procedure.'' His
``Cases on Federal Courts'' is in its 10th edition and his ``Wright
on Federal Courts'' is in its 5th edition. In a lighter vein,
Wright occasionally reviewed crime novels for the Practical Lawyer,
a publication of the American Bar Association and the American Law
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Wright regarded himself as a conservative, a philosophy
exemplified in his argument on behalf of Texas in 1970 when it
joined three other states in challenging the constitutionality of
the law that lowered the voting age to 18.
</P>
<P>
   He called the law ``frivolous'' and insisted that the
Constitution gave the states the power to set voting standards.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Alan Wright was born Sept. 3, 1927, in Philadelphia. A
precocious student, he graduated from Haverford High School at 16
and finished his undergraduate work at Wesleyan University at 18.
He graduated from Yale Law School in 1949, spent a year as law
clerk for Judge Charles E. Clark of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in New York, then began to teach law at the University of
Minnesota in 1950. Five years later, he moved to Austin and joined
the faculty of the University of Texas Law School.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Wright became the president of the American Law
Institute, an organization of practitioners, judges and academics.
He was active in the arts in Austin, where he was a founder of the
classical radio station KMFA.
</P>
<P>
   Wright is survived by his wife, Eleanor Custis Wright of Austin;
a son, Charles E., of Irvine, Calif.; four daughters, Norie Clarke
of Berkeley, Calif., Margot Clarke of Austin, Henrietta Wright of
Dallas, and Cecily Fitzsimons of Austin; and by six grandchildren.
He is also survived by his sister, Jean Wright Morse of Fredonia,
N.Y.

BARBARA CHRISTIAN, 56, LEADER IN MODERN LITERARY FEMINISM 
CHARLES DIVINEY, 93, PRIEST AND THEOLOGIAN 
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.Y., Wis., Mass., Pa.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Barbara T. Christian, a professor of African-American studies at
the University of California at Berkeley and a pioneer of
contemporary American literary feminism, died June 25 at her home
in Berkeley. She was 56.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia
McBroom, a university spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The author and editor of several books and 100 articles and
reviews, Christian was best known for her landmark study ``Black
Women Novelists: The Development of a Tradition.'' It appeared in
1980 amid a general rediscovery of the work of writers like Zora
Neale Hurston and Nella Larsen and the rise to prominence of
several younger authors, including Toni Morrison and Alice Walker.
</P>
<P>
   Christian was a leading critical presence in the growing debates
over the relationship among race, class and gender. Her widely
cited article ``The Race for Theory'' challenged the increasing
domination of African-American literary study by those who were
primarily interested in theory rather than in writers and their
work.
</P>
<P>
   Born in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, Christian entered Marquette
University in Wisconsin at the age of 15. After she graduated cum
laude in 1963, her family urged her to study medicine, but she
instead chose graduate study at Columbia University, from which she
received a doctorate in contemporary British and American
literature in 1970. During her graduate studies, she also taught at
the City College of the City University of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, she was appointed assistant professor at Berkeley. A
year later, she was instrumental in the establishment of the
department of African-American studies, where she taught until her
death. She was chairwoman of the department from 1978 until 1983.
She led Berkeley's new doctoral program in ethnic studies from 1986
to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, she became the first African-American woman to be
granted tenure at Berkeley. In 1986, she became the first to be
promoted to full professor. In 1991, she won the university's
Distinguished Teaching Award, the first African-American to do so.
This year, she received the Berkeley Citation ``for distinguished
achievement and for notable service to the university.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter supporting her nomination, Henry Louis Gates Jr. of
Harvard University wrote that Christian ``has emerged as the senior
figure among African-American feminists.'' Arnold Rampersad of
Stanford University called her ``a major shaper and guide in the
general area where the subjects of literature, race and feminism
meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian's marriage to David Henderson, a poet and a biographer
of Jimi Hendrix, ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by a daughter, Najuma Ide Christian of Berkeley;
her parents, Judge Alphonso A. and Ruth Christian of St. Thomas;
three sisters, Dr. Cora Christian of St. Croix, Reubina Gomez of
St. Thomas and Alicia Wells of Philadelphia; two brothers, Alphonso
Christian of Washington and Delano Christian of San Francisco; and
a stepson, Imetai Malik Henderson of New York.

   CHARLES E. DIVINEY
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Monsignor Charles E. Diviney, a former vicar-general
of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn, died June 28 at a
retirement home in Queens Village. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   He was the second-oldest priest in the diocese, which he had
served since his ordination in 1931. He also reviewed books for The
Tablet, the diocesan weekly.
</P>
<P>
   Diviney was vicar-general of the diocese, which includes Queens,
from 1965 to 1978. He administered the diocese for two months in
1968, from July, when Archbishop Bryan J. McEntegart retired, until
September, when Bishop Francis J. Mugavero was consecrated.
</P>
<P>
   Diviney was born in Long Island City, Queens. He attended
Fordham University and studied for the priesthood at St. John's
Seminary in Brooklyn. He taught at St. Joseph's College in Brooklyn
from 1934 to 1959. Then he was the parish priest of St. Charles
Borromeo Church in Brooklyn until 1978 and was vicar-general for
much of that time.

 WEST NILE VIRUS DETECTED IN BIRDS IN THREE NEW YORK COUNTIES
</HEADLINE>
  By SARAH KERSHAW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two dead crows on Long Island and two others, one in Westchester
County and one in Rockland County, have tested positive for West
Nile virus, New York state health officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The test results for the birds in Suffolk County, Long Island,
and Westchester counties, which were released late last week by the
New York state Department of Health and reported Saturday by
Newsday, were the first confirmed cases in those counties this
year. West Nile is a mosquito-borne virus that killed seven people
and infected 62 others in the New York area last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Rockland County, the crow that tested positive for the virus
last week brought to five the number of birds in that county found
to have died from the virus since local health departments began
shipping dead birds to a lab in Albany for testing earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a regional surveillance program aimed at detecting
the presence of the virus, which can cause encephalitis in humans
and can be fatal, state officials have been sampling the blood of
dead birds and monitoring live chickens, which carry the virus but
do not get sick from it.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, New York City went on the alert when a chicken in
Queens, near the epicenter of the 1999 outbreak, initially tested
positive. Plans to spray the area were halted when further
laboratory tests showed the chicken was not infected. There have
been no cases of West Nile in the city this year.
</P>
<P>
   But in early June, three dead crows, two in Rockland County and
one in Bergen County, N.J., tested positive for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Millie Svatek, a spokeswoman for the Suffolk County Health
Department, said Saturday that the Long Island crows were found by
residents in West Babylon and in Lindenhurst. She said that
officials had not determined whether the birds had been recently
infected with the virus or had picked it up in last year's
outbreak, which killed dozens of crows and horses around Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts say that crows tend to die quickly after
contracting West Nile infections, making it likely that the birds
caught the virus this year.
</P>
<P>
   Svatek said the county had no immediate plans to spray mosquito
pesticides in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The crow in Westchester that tested positive was found dead in
New Rochelle, where a woman died of West Nile encephalitis last
year. Westchester and Rockland County health officials could not be
reached for comment Saturday, and it was unclear whether they would
begin spraying in response to the positive test results.

BOOK REVIEW: HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, by J.K. Rowling
(734 pages; Scholastic Press; $25.95)
</P>
<P>
   Wizards, ghosts, dragons, unicorns: They all play a part in
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, but what J.K. Rowling needed
most for her new book is that magical creature known as...an
editor.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that's how it is at first. The opening 200 pages of
the fourth Harry Potter volume could have been trimmed by half. The
first chapter, ``The Riddle House,'' is excellent, with a
long-dormant menace awakening to new power. But then Rowling
dawdles, spending too much time on talky, pointless dialogue and on
jokes that are lame.
</P>
<P>
   Children eager to read the new story have been overjoyed at
rumors that Goblet of Fire would exceed 700 pages, yet it's hard to
imagine even the most ardent fan not wishing that something would
happen sooner. Harry's new adventure would have been much more
adventurous at 600 pages instead of 734.
</P>
<P>
   But hang in there, kids, because when this tale finally takes
off, it goes everywhere you want it to, and the ride is almost as
thrilling as having your own flying broomstick.
</P>
<P>
   Young Harry Potter is now 14 and returns for his fourth year of
instruction at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Before
the new term begins, he attends the Quidditch World Cup with his
friends Ron and Hermione. As classes begin, Harry is looking
forward to playing some Quidditch himself _ that fabulous sport in
which players on broomsticks must contend with game balls that have
minds of their own.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, Harry won't be focusing on Quidditch.
Instead, all the Hogwarts students are transfixed by the Triwizard
Tournament, a competition involving spellcasting and other magical
prowess that hasn't been held for a century.
</P>
<P>
   Harry is too young to compete: Contestants from Hogwarts and two
rival schools must be at least 17 because the competition is so
dangerous. Those who meet the age requirement can put their names
into the magical ``Goblet of Fire,'' which then will select one
contestant from each school.
</P>
<P>
   Flames and showers of sparks erupt from the Goblet, and with
each eruption, out comes a parchment naming each school's
contestant. But then the Goblet spews a fourth time _ and Harry
Potter's name emerges. ``I didn't put my name in!'' he exclaims
when questioned by faculty and students alike. But the Goblet has
spoken: Harry will compete against a witch and two wizards older
and presumably stronger than he is.
</P>
<P>
   As Harry Potter fans know, though, nothing with Harry is ever as
simple as it appears (or disappears). He has a knack for
Invisibility Cloaks but also procrastination, for flashes of
brilliant wizardry but also for getting into the worst messes
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling's handling of the three tasks the young necromancers
must face in the Triwizard Tournament is delightful. From dragons
to mer-people (not just mermaids) to a wonderful magical maze, she
puts Harry and his competitors _ who include his schoolmate and
Quidditch nemesis, Cedric Diggory _ through some imaginative paces.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling also should be commended for allowing her characters to
grow. Harry was 11 in the first book; he ages one year for each
book written, and the author plans three more after this. By
letting Ron, Hermione and Harry grow up, Rowling is transcending
the often static world of childrens' entertainment. In this volume,
Harry and Ron fuss as only adolescent boys do. And there are the
first blossomings of romances and jealousies among the three
friends.
</P>
<P>
   Parents be warned: Although there is no sex in this book,
Rowling's characters are starting to talk like adults. The
profanity is very occasional and quite mild, but it exists.
</P>
<P>
   And the violence is more realistic and more disturbing. Yes, the
rumors are true: An ongoing character does die in this episode.
You'll never guess who, though, until almost the very end.
</P>
<P>
   Rowling also deals with what all fantasists must confront: the
epic clash between good and evil. The Triwizard Tournament, it
turns out, is just a shadow of what's really going on in the world
of magic. There are entities here both heroic and terrible, and
never in the three previous books has that conflict been better.
</P>
<P>
   Only a miserable, nonmagical Muggle would reveal the details of
how the tension grows and is resolved, so we must stop now. But
it's not too much of a hint to name Him Who Must Not Be Named, and
to warn readers to be on the lookout for...
</P>
<P>
   Voldemort. ( 30 )

MANHATTAN YOUNGSTER TAKES COURTS BY STORM
</HEADLINE>
  By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the public courts outside her Inwood home in upper
Manhattan, Irina Falconi has a nickname: the adult abuser.
</P>
<P>
   At 4 feet 6 inches, the fourth-grader is barely twice the height
of her tennis racket. But she handily defeats men a head or two
taller, adding to the vanquished who are thirsting for revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' she said, giggling. ``I think they're afraid of
me.'' Last year, at age 9, Irina became the top-ranked girl under
13 in New York City, one of the youngest ever, according to the
U.S. Tennis Association. Now, she has moved up to tristate
competition, and is ranked eighth among girls 12 and under. At 10,
she is the youngest player in the top 10 in the Eastern section.
</P>
<P>
   Even in these early stages, many top-notch players train with
professional coaches for $100 an hour or more. Irina practices with
her father, Carlos Falconi, a cabinetmaker from Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Time was, a public school girl from a family of modest means
would be a rarity among the best players in New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut, the three states that make up the USTA's eastern
section. But long before Venus and Serena Williams emerged from the
public parks in Compton, Calif., to take their place in the
semifinals of Wimbledon, tennis had become more accessible to the
hungry and talented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not rich people,'' said Silvia Falconi, Irina's mother,
who is a secretary for a personal injury lawyer. ``Maybe if we had
money, she wouldn't be as good. Heroes come with adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Irina and her father rally in the park as much as three hours a
day, next to the basketball players who sip from paper bags and the
cars with their stereos booming and doors open wide, filling the
streets with merengue in the summertime.
</P>
<P>
   The Falconis play there in winter, too, wearing heavy coats and
gloves. Sometimes the old Russian man who comes every day will
sweep up the leaves and call them when the courts are clean.
Sometimes father and daughter take a shovel and clear the snow
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Falconi gives Irina a good run. Nearly 10 years as a
professional soccer player in Ecuador have left the 38-year-old
with square shoulders and quick feet. But he misses shots
sometimes, making Irina huff in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I need someone stronger,'' she said sheepishly, trying
not to hurt his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the courts draw other good players, some from as far as
Long Island looking for competition. Carlos Falconi watches them
all, and picks among the strongest servers and hardest hitters to
find sparring partners for his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see any mercy on your side,'' he tells the men
he chooses. ``Play tough.''
</P>
<P>
   An unorthodox training regimen, maybe. But effective, perhaps
even necessary. Irina goes to P.S.-I.S. 223, which has no courts or
sports teams, much less a tennis program. If it had one, she says,
there would be no one to compete with anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In the past decade or so, young New York City players with
national ambitions like Irina have had to find their competition
and development in out of school programs, especially the New York
Junior Tennis League, the nonprofit organization Arthur Ashe
started to get the sport into the city's schools. Each year, the
league sponsors 30 promising players to the tune of $5,000 to
$15,000 each, paying the tournament fees, professional coaching,
travel and other expenses that would otherwise be beyond their
reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that half the ranked kids from New York City come
from our programs,'' said Skip Hartman, the league's president.
``You don't have to be rich anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now when public and private high schools clash at the Mayor's
Cup, an annual citywide tennis tournament, the private school
students are often the ones who are trounced. Some public high
school teams are so good that teen-agers with top 20 rankings in
the East warm the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The city's commercial tennis academies are reaching out to
underfunded youngsters, although on a smaller scale. Last winter,
Irina earned a scholarship to practice at the Randy Mani Tennis
Academy, a training ground for several of the eastern division's
top competitors that can cost several hundred dollars a week.
</P>
<P>
   But even though money is not the barrier it once was, it is
still expensive to become a tennis champion. ``Parents can spend
$30,000 a year cultivating a top-level player,'' Mani said.
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly an option for Carlos and Silvia Falconi. Their
daughter Stephanie, 16, is also a top 10 player in the East for her
age group, in need of the same rackets and road trips to
tournaments as her younger sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is coming out of our pockets,'' said Carlos
Falconi, stringing a racket on his dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   The men from the Inwood courts help out. An African-American
player gave them a tennis bag. Another from Ecuador pitched in with
a new racket. And there is always Gatorade or some treat to be had
between sets, even from the man who cannot seem to lose gracefully.
</P>
<P>
   But that is Inwood, a long way from Long Island and Westchester,
where Mercedeses and Range Rovers fill the parking lots at
tournaments. At first, the Falconis felt self-conscious driving up
in their sputtering, Reagan-era station wagon with dented fenders.
But they soon got used to it, and by the end of the tournament
often felt as if they were riding off in a chariot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that old car, there's a champion,'' said Carlos Falconi.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, it exasperated Stephanie to no end when the rest of the
family crossed fingers and bowed heads to pray for the car to
start. So the Falconis broke the bank and bought a minivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to,'' said Carlos Falconi. ``She was going to quit
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Irina has not yet begun to think about such things. She is more
than happy letting her parents worry if her talent will someday pay
for college, which neither of them finished. For now, Irina is too
busy wondering what to do if she strives to become the world's best
player, only to land in the No. 2 spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take it, I guess,'' she said.

THE INTERNET GIVES WHITE ELEPHANTS A NEW LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Fla.)  By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Generations of New Jerseyans shopped the Bamberger's store at
the corner of Market and Halsey streets in Newark for clothing,
accessories and household goods. The throngs of shoppers have long
since departed for the suburbs but the store, later named Macy's
and closed in 1992, has gained an unexpected new life.
</P>
<P>
   Rows of computers and telecommunications equipment now fill the
floors that once displayed women's dresses and men's suits. The
building has been transformed into a high-technology center, the
physical repository of the machines that support the rapid growth
of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It is just one example of how old industrial and retail
properties, formerly considered unrentable white elephants, have
suddenly become highly attractive to Web hosting and communications
companies who need sites to expand _ and need them now.
</P>
<P>
   The old buildings have what the Internet companies need: sturdy
floors and high ceilings to accommodate heavy, delicate equipment;
abundant electrical power to keep the machines humming and easy
access to the optical-fiber cables that are the highways of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the old industrial buildings, proximity to the
high-volume fiber cables has come because the cables have been
installed along established railroad lines.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this newfound desirability of certain types of
industrial buildings, old factories in Jersey City, a sprawling and
underused marine terminal and an old tire factory in Brooklyn, and
various locations in New Jersey's Meadowlands are all being
promoted as technology centers.
</P>
<P>
   Even buildings that were at the heart of old telecommunications
technology, such as AT&AMP;T's onetime manual switching center in
Manhattan are being adapted to new technology. The building has
been purchased by the Rudin family, which is adapting it for use by
companies like MCI WorldCom and Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   While a new generation of equipment will be installed upstairs
at the old switching center, the landmarked lobby will retain the
1932 murals and the declaration that ``Telephone wires and radio
unite to make neighbors of nations.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in the New York area is being replicated
around the country and around the world. Everything is driven by
time because new-economy companies believe that the ones who grab
market share first will dominate their sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Telecommunications and the Internet are closely related, they
go hand in hand,'' said Goodwin Gaw, the chairman of Global
Gateway, a company that is building a network of servers and
telecommunications equipment in the western United States and Asia.
``Our customers like to be there before the wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Gateway is one of two companies being backed by $1.25
billion from Morgan Stanley Real Estate Funds to build a global
Internet communications network. The other is Metro-Nexis, which is
responsible for the eastern United States and Europe. MetroNexis
recently agreed to buy the 1.1-million-square-foot former American
Can factory in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   For companies building the networks of computers, cable and
software that undergird the Internet, ``speed to market is the name
of the game, and the space has to be available now,'' said Mark A.
Teitelbaum, a partner in Argent Ventures, a New York real estate
investment company. ``Anything that will not be ready for 18 months
is a non-starter.''
</P>
<P>
   Argent has been acquiring property, including buildings in
Weehawken and Jersey City and an old shopping mall in Miami, all
for use as technology centers for Internet companies. ``We have
acquired between 6 and 7 million square feet of property in the
last 12 months,'' said Andrew S. Penson, another Argent partner.
``But that is like 10 years in Internet time.''
</P>
<P>
   The million-square-foot Omni Mall on Biscayne Boulevard in Miami
had one particularly significant advantage, Penson said. It was
empty. He said the site could be a gateway to planned underwater
communications links to Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in marketability of older buildings suitable for
use by Internet infrastructure companies has come suddenly.
``Nobody knew anything about this until about a year ago,'' said
John Peters, a former broker with Cushman &AMP; Wakefield who now runs
his own company, Technology Real Estate. ``Now it is the `in' thing
for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology boom is unexpectedly rehabilitating buildings
that had been dismissed as obsolete, because of their size, ceiling
height or amount of room for parking. But a facility that might be
obsolete for warehousing and distribution could work well for Web
hosting and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have old buildings that are coming back to life,'' said
Richard Marchisio, managing director of Grubb &AMP; Ellis of New
Jersey. ``This is a whole new sector of real estate that did not
exist previously.''

CHECKING NEW HOUSE FOR FLAWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Potential buyers usually aren't shy about flushing the toilets,
running the faucets, counting the closets, and opening and closing
the windows and doors. After that, in most cases, they go out and
hire a professional house inspector to pick up where they left off.
</P>
<P>
   What happens, though, when a buyer is buying a potential house _
one that hasn't even been built yet _ or a recently completed new
construction?
</P>
<P>
   ```New construction' doesn't mean `without flaws,''' said
Kenneth T. Austin, president of HouseMaster, a nationwide
home-inspection company based in Bound Brook, N.J. ``Many times
there are flaws in the construction of new homes, some of which can
be serious and expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the problems Austin's inspectors have found in new homes
are: damaged or improperly installed fixtures; water penetration
caused by improper grading of the soil where it meets the
foundation; foundation cracking caused by improper backfilling of
soil around the house; improper deck supports; improperly wired
electrical receptacles; disconnected heating and air-conditioning
ducts; unlabeled electrical panels; and even nonfunctioning light
switches and electrical outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most new-home buyers don't see the need for a home
inspection,'' Austin said, adding that while construction codes are
designed to ensure that new construction is completed in accordance
with a set of minimum standards, the code-enforcement inspectors
can't catch everything and aren't even looking for problems of an
aesthetic nature.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Austin said, if the grading of the soil against the
foundation slopes away from the house _ as it should, to prevent
water from pooling along the foundation wall _ the building
inspector will typically be satisfied. However, he said, if the
soil has not been tamped down properly, there is a possibility that
after a time the soil will settle, thereby creating a slope toward
the house and the possibility of future seepage.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that would probably not be noted by a building
inspector would be sloppily mitered joints on woodwork around doors
and windows, an aesthetic eyesore rather than a structural problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying a new house gives people a false sense of security,''
Austin said. ``They end up looking at the whole process through
rose-colored glasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Gallo, a New York registered architect, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're thinking about buying a newly constructed house
you shouldn't be bashful,'' Gallo said. ``You have to get inside
and slam some doors, make some noise and jump up and down on the
floors. You have to get physical.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that one of the biggest problems that new houses have _
despite the fact that they may meet the minimum requirements of the
building codes _ is that the floors and walls are not necessarily
as solid and soundproof as those in older construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing to do when you walk into a new house is test
its bounce factor,'' Gallo said, explaining that he encourages
clients to jump up and down in the middle of the room to get a feel
for how much the floor gives under such punishment. ``If you have
kids with you, send them upstairs and have someone go up and play
with them,'' he said. ``That will give you some idea of the
soundproofing and some idea of what it's going to be like living in
the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that prospective purchasers of new construction
can do is to turn on the heating and air-conditioning system to
determine whether it has any annoying quirks. ``If the ductwork
thumps every time the air-conditioning comes on, that's going to
drive you crazy after a few weeks,'' he said, adding that it is
also wise to run the dishwasher and washing machine to determine
whether the water pipes bang when the machines cycle on and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things may not be deal-breakers, but you're really doing
yourself a favor by having a checklist of things that should be
corrected before you agree to buy the house,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Robert Tierman, a real estate lawyer in Hackensack, N.J., said
that people buying a new house can exercise the greatest degree of
control if they buy early enough in the process to dictate the
material and construction methods that will be used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Builders like to maximize their flexibility,'' Tierman said,
explaining that if a builder's contract specifies only ``a
fully-equipped bathroom,'' that allows the builder to decide what
type and grade of fixtures to install. ``If you'll be satisfied
with the fixtures the builder installs you'll have no problem,'' he
said. ``But if you want Kohler plumbing fixtures, you better make
sure you specify Kohler fixtures in the contract.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, buyers who are negotiating a construction contract
might want to include a provision that will allow home-inspection
firms like HouseMaster to make periodic inspections during
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recommend a three-stage inspection,'' said Austin, the
company's president. The first inspection, he said, would be
conducted after the foundation and rough framing is complete. The
second would be after all heating, cooling, electrical equipment
and plumbing have been installed. And the third would be after
construction has been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're there to look for errors in workmanship,'' he said,
adding that a staged inspection _ which costs about $250 for each
of the three inspections _ is not intended to second-guess the
architect, the builder or the building inspector, but to ensure
that the buyer is getting the quality of workmanship being paid
for.
</P>
<P>
   But won't a builder bristle at having someone else inspect his
handiwork?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Austin said. ``But you have to hang tough.
People have to realize that the greatest power they have is the
power to walk away from the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   John G. Hall, a New York real estate lawyer and former chairman
of the New York State Bar Association's Real Property Section, said
that in many new-home sales the buyer bases the decision on a model
home constructed by the builder.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the house you are buying is based on a model, as opposed to
a set of plans and specifications, you want to make sure that you
will be getting what you think you'll be getting,'' Hall said. For
example, he said, a builder who installs high-quality fixtures in
the model could install less expensive fixtures in the houses built
for sale _ if the contract permits.
</P>
<P>
   Even room sizes in models can be deceiving. ``I can tell you
that I have seen some builders use scaled-down furniture in their
models so that the rooms would look larger,'' Hall said, explaining
that while such practices are not engaged in by reputable builders,
buyers should leave nothing to chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Builders' contracts are usually very onerous,'' Hall said.
``If I were buying a new house today, and I wasn't a lawyer myself,
the first thing I'd do would be to hire one.''

VENUS WILLIAMS LIGHTS UP THE CENTER COURT
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for rewrite) 
By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The colorful beads and butterfly hair clips
that marked the teen-age style of Venus Williams were gone. From
the moment she strode onto Center Court Saturday, the streamlined
20-year-old with the Paul Bunyan backswing had the look of serious
young woman. A scowl was as good as an accessory.
</P>
<P>
   Only at the last moment, as a forehand volley slipped off the
racket of Lindsay Davenport, did Williams released her furrowed
brow and let pure joy take over. Suddenly, she was leaping across
the lawn of Center Court like a child twirling through a backyard
sprinkler.
</P>
<P>
   She couldn't contain herself. So she bounded up the stairs that
led to the edge of the friends box and embraced her little sister,
Serena, then slapped hands with her clairvoyant father doing a
soft-shoe on a broadcast booth. Just as Richard Williams had
predicted a day before, his daughter Venus made a social impact on
history Saturday with her 6-3, 7-6 (3) victory at the All England
Club.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Althea Gibson wasn't alone anymore. Williams became the
first African-American woman to win Wimbledon since Gibson grabbed
the title in 1958. And at the same time, Venus and Serena Williams
became the first sisters in tennis history to each own a Grand Slam
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was meant to be,'' Venus Williams said. ``I worked real
hard all my life. I had a lot of sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   There were the endless days on the courts of Compton, Calif.,
whacking through a shopping cart filled with 550 balls. But with a
keen sensitivity to history, Williams understands the true
sacrifices of the Gibsons and even the Zina Garrisons who stepped
on the courts long before her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be hard because people were unable to see past
color,'' Williams said. ``Still, these days, it's hardly any
different because you realize it's been only 40 years. How can you
change years and centuries of being biased in 40 years?''
</P>
<P>
   In only a handful of years, the Williams sisters have stirred up
the scene. Saturday, the power of Venus Williams raised the bar
again. Coiling her 6-foot-1 frame, Williams unwound on every ground
stroke. Unabashedly, Williams just went for every line with
backhands that appeared delivered from a slingshot. Even when
Davenport's heavy strokes sent her on the run, Williams was able to
unfold her long wingspan and turn sure winners into saves.
</P>
<P>
   The trend exasperated Davenport. She mumbled to herself, tossed
her head back in frustration and had no answer for Williams in a
runaway first set. The second set was only slightly different.
Davenport began serving better, pinning Williams back just a bit,
but could not come up with the big points.
</P>
<P>
   For one brief moment, Davenport, the defending Wimbledon
champion, who had been in the background for an entire fortnight,
had a sliver of hope. Serving for the match, an overeager Williams
rushed through her motions, hit two double faults and allowed
Davenport to break her serve and even the second set, 5-5. But as
the two held their serves and dashed into a tiebreaker, Williams
didn't quiver. During a run of five points in a row, Williams
hooked a forehand in for a winner and ended another tense rally
with a forehand volley that pummeled the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough when your opponent is hitting the ball so hard and
on the lines,'' said Davenport, who at 6-foot-2 is one of the few
players on the tour who can counter the power generated by
Williams. ``I thought that her big win over Martina Hingis in the
quarterfinal, that was maybe the win that got her over the hump a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams fed off the adrenaline from that match, withstood
the drain of emotion it took to beat her sister in the semifinals
and just never let up on her intensity. She was determined to join
Serena Williams as a Grand Slam winner, and she had no doubts.
</P>
<P>
   Just days before she and her sister departed for England, Venus
Williams went to a mall in Florida and bought a gown for the
champions ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had one dress I could wear,'' Williams said. ``It was last
year's, and colors have changed since then. I was scrambling. It
was an extra incentive to win because if I didn't, I wouldn't get
to wear this wonderful dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, she had the serious look of a champion once she
finally arrived. Both players were left stirring in the locker room
deep within the stadium as a light drizzle delayed the start by
about 20 minutes. For a while, Davenport stood next to the referee,
Alan Mills, at the doorway to the court, watching the skies with a
chuckle or two. In the friends box, Richard Williams was keeping
himself busy with a marking pen and grease board he brought with
him to the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hello, Mrs. Williams, I miss and love you,'' Richard Williams
wrote, showing his message to the cameras in hopes that his wife,
Oracene, would see it from Florida. Beside Richard Williams, Serena
smiled at her father's busy work.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, Venus Williams was applying a hard stare. When
she stepped on the court, she could have shattered mirrors with her
mental focus. There was no hint of a smile, no ounce of giddiness,
no look of childlike awe as she barely surveyed her surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   Only after match point did she allow the kid in her to escape.
Just less than a year ago, she was the picture of dejection.
Emotionally detached, she watched her little sister become the
first of the two to win a Grand Slam, taking the U.S. Open title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't help but feel sorry for her last fall when Serena
won first,'' Davenport said. ``You knew eventually she was going to
win a Grand Slam. I mean, who knew when it was going to be?''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was the day. After Venus Williams scampered back down
to the court from her celebratory hugs in the friends box, she
received the champions plate and held it up high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than the men's cup, in my opinion,'' Venus
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning around for the cameras, Williams glowed as brightly as
the plate with a full-moon smile. In the background of Williams'
moment, her father and sister were close to tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really great because I've been working so hard all my
life to be here,'' Venus Williams said as she stood on court.
``It's strange. I'd go to bed at night and I'd dream I'd won a
Grand Slam, but when I woke up, there was the nightmare. Now, I
don't have to wake up like that anymore.''

A PERSISTENT LABOR BATTLE WITH DALI AS A BACKDROP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Mich.)   By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With her bachelor's degree from Bryn Mawr and her
master's in art history from Columbia, Starr Figura may not seem at
first glance like someone who would be a diehard union supporter.
</P>
<P>
   But 10 weeks into the strike at the Museum of Modern Art,
Figura, an assistant curator in the prints and illustrations
department, said that she was ready to spend another 10 weeks
picketing if that was what it took to ensure that her health
coverage would not be cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum's behavior over the last several months is the
definition of bad-faith bargaining,'' Figura said while picketing
alongside a dozen other strikers. ``They haven't negotiated with us
at all. Unfortunately, what the strike has demonstrated is the
museum doesn't have a lot of respect for its junior staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the dispute involves assistant curators, librarians,
archivists and many other workers not fitting labor's traditional
blue-collar mold, the strike has turned into a classic labor
showdown, albeit with some highbrow grace notes. (In a bow to the
museum's many foreign visitors, the union's fliers are translated
into French, Italian, Spanish and German.)
</P>
<P>
   Each side ridicules the other, accusing the other of bargaining
in bad faith, and neither side gives any indication of blinking.
Management is subtly using pressure tactics to persuade strikers to
abandon the union and return to work. Eager not to be
outmaneuvered, the union, Local 2110 of the United Auto Workers,
has its own pressure tactics, including putting up picket lines
with the hope of slowing, and maybe even stopping, the Modern's
ambitious $650 million expansion project.
</P>
<P>
   By several measures, the strike does not appear to be going well
for the union. As of last week, according to the museum, more than
half of the 250 employees in the bargaining unit had crossed the
picket line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says the union doesn't have the support of the bargaining
unit in its role as bargaining representative,'' said Robert
Batterman, a lawyer with Proskauer Rose and the museum's chief
negotiator. ``They are not doing what a majority thinks should be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   In another setback to the union, attendance has not lagged,
museum officials say, notwithstanding the dozen or so strikers who
stand out front each day, urging tourists not to visit and clanging
metal rods against police barricades. Accusing museum officials of
lying, many union members say they are sure attendance is down.
</P>
<P>
   By some other measures, the strike appears to be going well.
Those picketing out front vow that they are in for the long haul.
Pressures from the workers, who are represented by the Auto
Workers' white-collar branch, have led the museum to cancel its
free summer jazz concerts and to postpone several movie screenings
and a fund-raiser starring the singer Sheryl Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Other New York unions have pledged support, but a major question
is whether construction unions will honor the picket line later
this month when work on the museum's expansion is scheduled to
begin.
</P>
<P>
   The union's leaders are constantly mapping strategies to squeeze
more of the museum's pressure points. One such strategy was
apparent in a letter, written at the Auto Workers' request, that
James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president, sent to Goldman Sachs,
asserting that the investment bank was promoting unfair working
conditions by underwriting $250 million in bonds for the Modern's
expansion. Hoffa wrote that the union was reviewing its accounts
with Goldman Sachs, including several billion dollars in Teamster
pension funds that the bank manages.
</P>
<P>
   The museum and union remain divided on several basic issues,
including pay, health coverage and job security. But after 10
weeks, an unspoken obstacle is greatly impeding a settlement _ the
growing hostility and distrust felt by both sides. The two sides
are so divided, showing so little room for flexibility, that a
federal mediator has not called them together for face-to-face
talks since the strike began on April 28.
</P>
<P>
   Museum officials defend their pay scale as comparable to that at
other art museums. But union members say that is not good enough,
considering how rich and prestigious the Modern is and considering
that the museum has collected more than $100 million in donations
to finance its expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The workers' pay averages $28,000 a year, ranging from $17,000
for bookshop workers to more than $50,000 for some associate
curators. Those at both ends of the scale assert that they are
underpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Figura said, ``I've been working here seven years, and I make
just $39,000. We stay late many nights and come in many weekends to
work on exhibitions, and we are never paid overtime. Because we're
professionals and dedicated, they expect us to help subsidize the
museum through our low salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Batterman, the museum lawyer, defended the $17,000 annual pay
for bookstore and visitors' services jobs, saying workers who hold
those jobs are not career professionals, but usually recent college
graduates who leave for other opportunities after a year or two. He
said the $8.50 an hour the bookstore workers earned was comparable
to what many New York bookstores paid, but he said the Modern
provided far better vacation and health benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Management has offered a 3 percent raise each year for three
years, while the union demanded 5 percent in the first year and 4
percent in the second and third years. The union wants the museum's
$17,000 minimum salary to rise immediately to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Health coverage is one of the most hotly contested issues. The
museum has told the union that if it insisted on exercising the
right to bargain over changes in the health plan, then the museum
would want to push the union's members out of the health plan they
now share with management personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say the museum is maneuvering to push the
workers into a worse health plan, which might mean higher premiums
and deductibles. Museum officials insist they have no such
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Batterman insisted that the main obstacle to a settlement was
the union's demand that all newly hired workers be required to join
the union or, if they choose not to join, to pay union dues. That
arrangement is known as an agency shop. Throughout the museum
union's 30-year history, its administrative and professional
workers have not had to join the union or pay dues. When the union
went on strike in April, about 90 of the 250 workers in the
bargaining unit were not in the union.
</P>
<P>
   Maida Rosenstein, president of Local 2110, said an agency shop
was needed to strengthen a historically weak union. But Batterman
asserted that the agency shop demands were prolonging the strike
and were designed largely to increase the union leaders' power.

LANDLORD TO EX-TENANT: YOU CAN GO HOME AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By TRISH HALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In Manhattan, people usually struggle to find
apartments, or at least they anticipate a struggle. No one expects
a landlord to call up and say, ``Please come live in my
apartment.'' Or ``I'm so sorry I have to move you out, but I'll
find you an even better place in the same building.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's been the experience of Telly Hatzigeorgiou. Shortly
after graduating from New York University in 1988, Hatzigeorgiou
took a room in a co-op apartment on Warren Street in TriBeCa _
before TriBeCa was filled with people living in multimillion-dollar
lofts. In those days, he said, he often came out of the building in
the morning to find car windows smashed.
</P>
<P>
   When the owner of the apartment sold the place in 1992, she felt
so bad about displacing Hatzigeorgiou that she introduced him to
the owner of another co-op in the building, who wasn't occupying
his space and was thinking of selling it. The landlord agreed to
give Hatzigeorgiou the duplex space _ for a few months, anyway _
for $500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   A few months turned into a few years. The real estate market had
collapsed and the owner couldn't get what he wanted for the place.
The apartment is about 2,000 square feet on two floors, with a
terrace off the living room and roof rights above with a view of
the Hudson River. ``It became party central,'' Hatzigeorgiou said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a friend from college moved in with him, but when
the friend became a born-again Christian, things changed a bit.
``All the pictures of women came down,'' said Hatzigeorgiou,
referring to his paintings. With their lives diverging, the
roommate moved out, and then, three years ago, so did
Hatzigeorgiou. He had decided to leave his job in global securities
at Chase Manhattan and open a billiard parlor in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   He was only an occasional player of pocket billiards _ _ the
proper term, although most aficionados call it pool. But he found
himself starting the business after someone approached his father,
who was in the metal-furniture business at the time, with a great
commercial location.
</P>
<P>
   To make the commute to his new business easier, he moved to the
Upper East Side, into a small one-bedroom apartment that cost
$2,350 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few years, he opened two more places in Queens.
Then this year, in March, he opened his fourth, and his first in
Manhattan, Chelsea Bar and Billiards on 21st Street.
(Hatzigeorgiou's first name, by the way, is short for Aristotle. It
was torture in college, he said, when on the first day the
professors would call out that name.)
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Hatzigeorgiou's former landlord on Warren Street
called him and asked if he would like to move back in. The
photographer who had been renting the place had just left, and the
landlord wanted someone he knew and trusted. He offered the
apartment to Hatzigeorgiou for $2,500 a month, about half of what
he could get if he put it on the market.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Hatzigeorgiou, 34, wasn't interested in moving; he was
too busy, and he just couldn't focus on it.
</P>
<P>
   But then he realized that with his new business in Chelsea, it
made sense to be downtown again. ``I love TriBeCa,'' he said. ``I
never wanted to leave. It's discovered, but undiscovered at the
same time. Secluded.'' On the Upper East Side, he said, the streets
were more intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was more hustle and bustle there,'' he said. ``Every
block had a billion things going on.''
</P>
<P>
   And so he decided to move back, thinking, he said, that it would
be a snap. In fact, he told the movers, when they asked him to
estimate, that he would probably have about five boxes. It turned
out he had 55.
</P>
<P>
   But after just a few days, he looked totally settled. Before
moving in, he had done some renovating, putting in a new kitchen,
and a rubber surface on the deck. And soon the new
weather-resistant pool table will arrive, taking up residence on
the deck.

</P>
<P>
   LOST-FANS _ Major League Baseball takes center stage here
Tuesday with the annual All-Star game with all the glitz and
glamour you might expect. But all that can't hide the fact that the
sport is losing a generation of young fans, who have been pushed
away from the sport by high prices, late night starts and the greed
of the owners. The owners seem oblivious to the fact that the kids
who aren't watching now probably won't be watching 20 years from
now. (Schlabach, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   ALLSTAR _ An essay. At a time when many say major league
baseball is dying because of the length of games, players switching
teams and leagues, night World Series games that eliminate the need
for radios in classrooms in October _ we explain why the All-Star
Game is prosaic, cerebral, attractive. Why it is still as American
as Chevrolet and apple pie and why on All-Star night, it all comes
together. Why it's still America's pastime. Why it was started in
1933, why it survived WWII, and why it's the best All-Star game of
all the pro sports. (Stinson, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) 50-60''

tragedy is a part of its sport, and the philosophy has been that

acupuncture, the tabloid reporters want to know. How's your form,

 &HT;    Tennis legend looks to her legacy
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Retired women's tennis player Zina Garrison
couldn't sleep Friday night at her hotel in London _ too many
thoughts, too much anxiety, too much hope.
</P>
<P>
   In her search for something calming, she decided to call home to
the United States. Not to her family in Houston, but to an
unassuming house in New Jersey where a 72-year-old woman lives
surrounded by a handful trophies but little else to show for a long
tennis career.
</P>
<P>
   Althea Gibson, through a caregiver because she had a stroke a
few years ago, was eager to talk about the historic day coming up:
Venus Williams would walk onto Centre Court at the All England Club
and try to become the first black woman to win a Wimbledon title
sice Gibson last did it in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison, who got a chance at the same thing a decade ago but
lost to Martina Navratilova, learned that Gibson had been watching
every match and hoped Venus could defeat Lindsay Davenport. She
also had a piece of advice for Venus: Move your feet.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams did that and everything else well enough to upset
the defending champion Saturday to win her first Grand Slam 6-3,
7-6 (7-3). She becomes just the third black woman in history to win
a major title.
</P>
<P>
   Sister Serena Williams became the second at the 1999 U.S. Open.
Gibson was the first, winning five major singles titles after
breaking the sport's color barrier in 1950 at the U.S.
Championships in Forest Hills, New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what she would think,'' a beaming Garrison said of
Gibson after the match. ``She really just wanted all this
(anniversary) hype for her to be overwith and for someone to go on
and do it. She's probably back there very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrison watched the match from Venus' Friends Box, surviving
the ups and downs of the nerve-wracking second set beside father
Richard Williams, business manager Leland Hardy, sister Serena
Williams and other friends.
</P>
<P>
   She's been friendly with the Williams family for more than
decade. She got to know Venus, Serena and their parents when the
sisters were children. Richard Williams was studying the game back
then and looking for role models for his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   He found just two women of the same color succeeding on the
women's tour. They were Zina Garrison and Lori McNeil. He talked
tennis and race and history and opportunity with them, always
seeking the best way to raise his girls as people and tennis
players.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the work of this eccentric man with an
often-overzealous urge for a spotlight of his own has been
successful. Venus and Serena Williams now each have Grand Slam
titles and they're closer to reaching No. 1 and No. 2 in the world
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, those personal goals remain primary for both, as well
they should. But ultimately, they may find their legacy lies in
what they mean to blacks in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Already, they each have a firm place in the history of a sport
still trying to diversify. Expensive country clubs remain mostly
white. Public parks struggle to start programs for underprivileged
children. American kids have so many sports to choose from that
tennis falls to the bottom of the list.
</P>
<P>
   A glance around the 13,812 fans on Centre Court certainly
supports the fact that tennis remains a white, wealthy man's sport
_ to watch or to play. Garrison thinks this is a beginning. A
long-term presence at the top of the game will make the biggest
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just an awareness, like Tiger brought awareness to the
game,'' she said, referring to Woods' impact on golf.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison keeps a close eye on how black children feel about
tennis through her foundation at home in Houston. The Zina Garrison
All Court Tennis Foundation works year-round introducing inner-city
kids to the sport through a junior program.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bring out a 4-year-old kid and if you say you play tennis,
the first thing they say is, 'Venus or Serena?' `` Garrison said,
laughing. ``I'm like, 'No, I'm the old one.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But at least they know black girls play tennis. It's a start,
and it was important to two skinny little girls wearing beads in
their hair and learning tennis in Compton, Calif., way back when.
</P>
<P>
   Venus was 10 and Serena 8 during Garrison's Wimbledon run of
1990. It was the first Wimbledon that meant something to them and
the first time they followed it. A neighbor who walked his dog past
the courts where they practiced would update them on Garrison's
progress every day, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant a lot to us,'' Venus said. ``I remember we were out
there practicing when Zina won against Monica (Seles), against
Steffi (Graf). I think we got to see the final.''
</P>
<P>
   Garrison called her support of Venus and Serena ``our own little
fraternity.'' She hopes one day soon the fraternity of successful
black tennis players grows. She thinks this historic day will help
that happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great moment,'' she said. ``It's the biggest
tournament in the world.''

 &HT;    Sampras motivated to win despite injury
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Pete Sampras hurt his left leg in the
second round of Wimbledon last week and hasn't talked about much
else since it happened.
</P>
<P>
   Are you using acupuncture?, the tabloid reporters want to know.
How's your form?, the British reporters wonder. Can you move well
enough to win?, the American writers ask. Aren't you lucky you
haven't had to play a seeded opponent yet? Can you break Roy
Emerson's record of 13 Grand Slam titles on just one leg?
</P>
<P>
   The questions will finally stop today after he plays 12th seed
Patrick Rafter in the final _ and Sampras can't wait for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're taking this injury a little bit too far,'' he
said after defeating Jan-Michael Gambill to reach the semifinals.
``I have it, and I really don't want to talk about it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, when asked how he's spending the hours between
matches _ since he isn't practicing on his off days or warming up
before matches or going out on the town _ he admitted he's consumed
by the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much (I'm) staying at home, just treating my
situation,'' Sampras said.
</P>
<P>
   He's treating his ``situation,'' tendinitis and inflammation of
the left shin, with acupuncture, ice, heat, electric stimulation,
stretching and almost anything else he, his coach or trainer thinks
might ease the pain, since he knows he isn't at risk for more
damage.
</P>
<P>
   The leg is one of just two things that will keep him from making
history in today's men's final. He's playing for a seventh
Wimbledon title, which would tie William Renshaw's record set in
the 1880s, and a record 13th Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras called this one of the most difficult major tournaments
of his career because of the injury. Not practicing during the
tournament has been uncomfortable, but if it were any other event,
he might have already been home for days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely been a struggle,'' he said. ``But at this
stage of my career, this is what I'm playing for. I think even
getting to the final has been one of my best efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the final is a relief in some ways. He planned to try
practicing Saturday for today's match. His experience on
Wimbledon's Centre Court _ six finals in the past seven years _ and
simply in important moments should help him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know this is my last match. Mentally, that feels
good,'' Sampras said. ``You just let it all hang out. The
adrenaline, the occasion can really get you through a lot of tough
situations on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter will present a different game than Sampras would have
gotten from Andre Agassi. Rafter served extremely well to beat the
1999 runner-up Friday and will have to play even better to defeat
the motivated Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty well a reversal,'' Rafter said. ``You've got to
try to get his serve back somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   The better returner probably will have the advantage since both
dominate on their own serves.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras hasn't lost a match here since 1996. He's motivated
to make history, since, at 28, he might not have as many
opportunities left in her career. Plus, this is his favorite
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing on grass, (which means) quick points,'' Sampras
said. ``It would be tough to play on clay or even hard court. As
long as I have my right arm, on grass I'm still a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: Wimbledon finalist Patrick Rafter became the first
player to commit to next year's Citrix Championships in Delray
Beach, tournament officials announced Saturday. The $350,000
tournament runs March 5-11at the Delray Beach Tennis Center.

HOUSING MARKET BECOMES A LITTLE LESS FRENZIED 
</HEADLINE>
   By DIANA SHAMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The owners of a six-bedroom, three-bath split-level
in Jericho, Long Island, on which Barbara Goldberg, a broker with
the Prudential Long Island Realty agency in Syosset, held an open
house a week ago, had one stipulation when they listed it with her
for $729,000: A prospective buyer had to agree that the closing
would take place only after the sellers themselves had found
another home to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who want to downsize, but they also have to
find the house they want,'' said Goldberg, adding that 19 prospects
attended the open house, three of whom seemed ``very interested.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If a buyer can't wait, the deal could fall apart,'' she said,
``but I have 27 years of experience in real estate sales and I will
make a great effort to find these sellers the right house.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar contingency clauses have become routine in a market
where there are still many more buyers than sellers. Bidding wars,
with buyers competing against each other and offering more than the
asking price, have also been common.
</P>
<P>
   However, indications now are that higher interest rates and a
throttling back of the stock market are finally having some ripple
effects on the local housing market. The number of listings is on
the increase over all and although there are still plenty of
buyers, brokers say they are not so quick to make an offer as
earlier in the year. Listing prices, however, show no signs of
coming down.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which
has about 1,000 member offices in Nassau and Suffolk counties, the
number of houses on the market in Nassau increased to 3,468 in May
from 2,782 in January, and in Suffolk to 5,378 from 4,644.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the median contract price of a house in Nassau was
$234,000 and in May it was $254,500, rising from $225,000 a year
earlier. In Suffolk, the January figure was $173,000 and in May it
was $180,000. A year earlier, it was $167,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening in the market currently is that the listing
inventory is picking up tremendously and buyers are slimming down,
and we are starting to enter a transition period between a seller's
and a buyer's market,'' said Fern Karhu, the manager at
Prudential's Syosset office, which covers Syosset, Woodbury,
Jericho and other areas of Nassau's North Shore. Her office took in
14 listings in June 1999, she said, while last month, it took in
27.
</P>
<P>
   ``In January, February, March of this year,'' she went on to
say, ``it was almost like a fire sale. People were paying top
dollar, going over list price and making fast decisions. but now
they are getting more skeptical.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Nolan, a broker with offices in Hempstead, said she was
also seeing a noticeable slowdown in the pace of sales. ``Listing
prices aren't coming down, but it's been very quiet,'' she said.
``I used to get action on a house in two weeks, and now it takes me
one to two months because buyers are more confident that they can
find exactly what they are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Kalman, a Woodmere broker. said: ``I wouldn't call this a
hot market anymore. Sellers still want high prices, but I now have
30 office exclusives instead of the 20 I had in May because the
houses haven't sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Levitt, a vice president of the Multiple Listing Service of
Long Island and a co-owner with her husband, Mac, of Century 21 Mac
Levitt, which has offices in Oceanside, Freeport and Baldwin,
attributes the rising number of listings to sellers who feel they
want to take advantage of the high prices friends and neighbors are
getting. ``Many people have decided the market is so good that now
is the time to sell their homes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And that may be one of the reasons behind changing market
conditions, according to Jay Helsinger, owner of Custom South Shore
Real Estate in Merrick. ``There is just so much a sponge can
hold,'' he said. ``We've reached the maximum level and now people
want max plus, and it's not going to be because as you reach the
top, fewer and fewer people will be willing to pay top dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, according to Joseph E. Mottola, the chief executive of
the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, the market is entering
a much healthier phase than the one it has been in. ``The frenzy is
missing,'' he said. ``The buyers are out there in strength, but
homes are staying on the market a little longer and they are not
always meeting the listing price. The snap sale is happening much
less frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a positive trend, Mottola said, ``because it creates
more balance in the marketplace.'' He added: ``There are people who
want to move up, but they are not going to put their house on the
market until they find something, so everything is clogged in the
pipeline. As the market slows down a little and more inventory
comes in, it will be good for buyers and it will be good for
sellers because it makes buying possible for more people.''
</P>
<P>
   While some brokers say that the market is cooling a bit,
individual buyers will not necessarily find their own experience
reflective of that perception. When Derek and Debbie Schoenhofen
went to an open house in New Hyde Park last month, they found a
bidding war that pushed offers past the $275,000 asking price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The broker got 15 offers and the house, which needed at least
$60,000 worth of work, went for $15,000 more than its asking
price,'' said Schoenhofen, an analyst for an investment firm in
Manhattan. His wife is an accountant for a real estate agency. ``We
called the day after the open house, but it was already gone,''
Schoenhofen added.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who have been renting an apartment in Mineola, saw
another house, this one in Williston Park, with a $259,000 asking
price. They quickly made a $235,000 offer, which the owner has
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   This house also needs a lot of work, but Schoenhofen was able to
offer the amount he did because he intends to do much of it
himself, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, what buyers are facing is a great deal of
competition, and you can't wait a couple of months to make a
decision,'' he said. ``You have to tell the person tomorrow if you
want the house or not, because it will be gone next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Atanas, the owner of Atanas Realty in Williston Park, who
showed the Schoenhofens their house, said that although she was
taking more listings _ which, she said, would make it a little
easier for buyers _ many potential sellers were still holding off
because of fears that they, in turn, would not be able to find a
house that suited them.
</P>
<P>
   ``People realize they can get good prices, but unless they plan
to move away, where are they going to go?'' she said.

 NEW YORK: she said.

<P>
   In that respect, Alison and Robert Gregory are fortunate. They
do not have to worry about finding another house on Long Island
because they are moving to Fort Meyers, Fla. Gregory has retired
from his mechanic's job and one of their two children is going off
to college, so they put their three-bedroom colonial in Williston
Park on the market. ``We felt we couldn't afford to retire on Long
Island, and so we decided, `Let's get out now,''' Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   They tried unsuccessfully to sell the home on their own, but
after listing it with Atanas the house was in contract within two
days. The Gregorys accepted $302,000, which was $8,000 below their
asking price, ``but we did well,'' Gregory said.
</P>
<P>
   Other sellers find themselves in a quandary, especially if an
offer comes quickly. Camille Pisciotto, owner of Great Neck Realty,
Better Homes and Gardens, said she had been running up against the
phenomenon of sellers pulling out of a deal even though a buyer was
willing to meet their price because they could not find the right
house to buy. ``I have three sellers in my office right now who
changed their minds,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be considered prudent to sell and then find another
house,'' said Wayne McCann, owner of the Harmonious Homes agency in
Sea Cliff. ``It's still the prudent thing to do, but a lot of
sellers are pulling back when they find a buyer. Timing is one of
the most frustrating and tension-causing aspects of buying and
selling right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Katy Anastasio, a Huntington real estate broker, said that she
still lacked houses to show. ``There is still more demand than
supply and the majority of my listings sell in one to two weeks,
although there do appear to be fewer lookers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A four-bedroom house priced at $500,000 in Fort Salonga on which
she held an open house in March had 35 people looking and found a
buyer in 20 minutes. An almost identical house in the same area,
also priced at $500,000, had only 25 people show up for an open
house held last month, but it found a buyer the same day. ``I
didn't get 35, but all I need is one buyer,'' Anastasio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is still not a situation where houses are coming on the
market and not getting sold right away,'' said Dorothy Waxman, the
manager of the Century 21 Laffey-Sandsport agency in Port
Washington. ``Because of the location, the good schools and the
transportation, Port Washington is the last to suffer when there is
a downturn in the market,'' she said. ``I have so many buyers who
will jump on something decent when it gets listed and we still
don't have enough houses to meet the pent-up demand that exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Caution, rather than slowdown, is perhaps the best way to
describe today's market, said Stuart Epstein, owner of Devlin
McNiff Real Estate in East Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   With prices up 15 percent to 20 percent in the last 12 months,
``buyers are saying, `I no longer will pay what's being asked of
us; let's take time out and make sure this is economically
justifiable,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn in the stock market ``has made people reflect about
the entire economic picture,'' he went on to say, adding: ``It
reminds them that what goes up can also come down. No one wants to
be the last man in the bubble and buy property at the highest
price.''
</P>
<P>
   But all this must be taken in the context of a market that is
still very robust, he added. ``The intrinsics here are still very
powerful. The market is still great.''

GAY PARADE, OPPOSED BY VATICAN, IS HELD IN ROME 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Defying the Vatican and right-wing political groups, tens
of thousands of demonstrators marched peacefully in a gay-pride
parade through central Rome on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The parade was one of the last and most contested events of the
weeklong World Pride Roma 2000, an international gay festival that
was timed to coincide with a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church
and that the Vatican fiercely opposed. As it turned out, however,
the parade was calm, peaceful and, according to some participants,
a little duller than recent gay-pride parades in New York, Paris
and London.
</P>
<P>
   Police officers had braced themselves for possible violence
after Forza Nuova, a neofascist group, vowed to stage a
counterdemonstration and to prevent gay marchers from approaching
the Colosseum. But Forza Nuova canceled its plans last week, citing
the death of the 13-year-old daughter of a leader of the group.
Many center-left politicians marched in the parade, and so did a
few center-right politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Rome, which had approved the parade three years ago,
withdrew its support after the Vatican made its opposition known.
City officials had said marchers would not be given permission to
march around the Colosseum. But late in the week, Rome officials
and parade organizers reached a compromise on the parade route,
agreeing that the marchers would file past the Colosseum but not
circle it entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was expecting more disturbances _ this is much calmer than
gay-pride parades in New York,'' Michael Lavelle, 48, a
telecommunications manager from New York, said as he marched back
to Circus Maximus, Rome's oldest sports arena, which has been the
headquarters of the World Pride event. Lavelle, who was in a group
of 150 New Yorkers, said he and others had decided to come to Rome
``once we heard there was a problem with the church.''
</P>
<P>
   Parts of Saturday's parade, which included many of the sights
and sounds that the Vatican dreaded _ drag queens, scantily clad
male gladiators, topless women and outrageous floats _ were
broadcast live by Italian television, along with panels of
commentators fiercely arguing the church's position and that of
gay-rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   But some marchers said the Rome parade was bland compared with
other gay-pride events. ``Paris was a lot more fun _ there was more
music, more dancing,'' said a Belgian who would give his name only
as Patrick and who said he had taken part in gay-pride parades in
France, the Netherlands and Germany this year. ``I am a little
disappointed. I guess that is because this is Rome and the pope has
a lot of power.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The gay-rights movement in Italy _ a country that never had
anti-homosexual legislation, even under Mussolini _ has never been
as powerful as it was in the United States, Britain or Germany, and
the World Pride festival and the controversy around it brought new
attention to gay-rights issues in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of Italian society, which tends to be
permissive as long as people keep their activities private, the
sight of so many gay marchers was startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Vatican should have tried to prevent this,''
said Marina Fidanza, 65, a grandmother who watched from a park
above the Colosseum. ``I am a Catholic, but how can you stop it.
This is Rome after all.'' She was watching, as she put it, to ``get
a sense of what all this fuss is about.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``But this whole showing off of sexual orientation
seems a bit much to me.''

ACTIONS OF MAN KILLED BY POLICE BAFFLE INVESTIGATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly 24 hours after two off-duty police officers
shot and killed a man in an unusual rush-hour confrontation on a
highway in Queens, the authorities said Saturday that they could
not explain why the man had leapt from a car into fast-moving
traffic and then attacked the officers.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, being conducted by the office of the Queens
district attorney, Richard A. Brown, the department's Internal
Affairs Bureau and the Queens homicide squad, focuses on whether
the officers were justified in shooting the man, Dandre Darnell
Cisco, 25.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said investigators were also trying to sort out
and understand the details of the incident, which occurred at 6:23
p.m. on Grand Central Parkway. Witnesses said Cisco jumped from a
friend's car as it was moving at about 35 to 40 mph, rolled along
the pavement, jumped up and attacked the off-duty officers, who had
stopped because they thought he was an accident victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very strange,'' said a senior police official who is
involved in the investigation. ``It's like something out of the
`Twilight Zone.''' Four people who saw the events that led up to
the shooting gave similar accounts to police and to prosecutors,
several senior law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The four witnesses _ the driver of the car from which Cisco
jumped, a cab driver and his passenger in the vehicle behind them,
and a retired police officer driving behind the two officers _ said
Cisco seemed to roll out of the moving car and to slide about 40
feet along the pavement, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's friend, Russell Ballenger Jr., 25, of Glen Cove, told
investigators that he did not know why Cisco jumped from the car
and that he had tried to stop him by grabbing him briefly while he
steered, one official said. But Cisco, who is 6 foot 2 and weighs
210 pounds, broke free and rolled out the passenger door.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Lamb, a lawyer for Ballenger, who works with computers,
said his client had known Cisco for 17 years but could offer no
explanation for his actions, saying only that it was ``a
wonderment.''
</P>
<P>
   After sliding along the pavement and picking up some severe
scrapes, Cisco rolled into a fetal position and jumped up, the
witnesses said. The driver of the cab behind Ballenger's car
swerved to avoid him, and the officers' vehicle, a black Dodge
Dakota pickup driven by Sgt. Stephen Borchers, a 13-year veteran,
pulled up after swerving to about a 45-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco immediately approached the driver's side of the pickup and
began hitting the sergeant with his fists, according to the senior
law-enforcement officials. They said Borchers, who is about 5 foot
10, and the detective with him, Jean Weller, identified themselves
as police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the sergeant then stepped on the gas in
an effort to get away, but slammed into the side of the cab, which
was also stopped in the roadway. When the sergeant got out of the
pickup, Cisco went around the back of the truck and began
assaulting Weller, a 15-year veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Borchers, who was still standing on the driver's side of the
truck, according to the account Ballenger gave his lawyer, pointed
his gun at Ballenger, who said the sergeant and detective never
identified themselves as police officers, Lamb said.
</P>
<P>
   Weller, still inside the truck's cab, drew her handgun, a
five-shot .38-caliber pistol, and in the course of the struggle she
fired three shots, the law-enforcement officials said, and Borchers
fired once.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb said his client believed that Borchers fired through the
cab and that he fired more than one shot.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco died at the scene, with five bullet wounds, the
authorities said, two of them apparently from a single bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said it was the first time either of the
officers had been involved in a shooting. A senior official who
knows both police officers described them as responsible and
capable, saying that Borchers had worked as a detective in the
108th Precinct and in the Internal Affairs Bureau and that Weller
had been assigned to the 110th Precinct as a detective. Both are
now assigned to administrative duties at the Queens Detective
Borough.

AN ASSIST FOR CITY SCHOOLS' ATHLETICS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio) By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last 12 years, George Washington High
School's baseball team, the Trojans, has been consistently ranked
among the best in the nation. It has produced dozens of minor- and
major-league ballplayers, including Manny Ramirez, now an
outfielder for the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   In those same 12 years, the team has held batting practice on
the school's field in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan
only two or three times, said Steve Mandl, the school's athletic
director and head baseball coach. The artificial turf is battered
and torn, the backstop is small, and when batters hit homers, the
balls often fly off the side of a cliff at the edge of the field.
</P>
<P>
   But the field is about to get a $2 million overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is one of dozens of city schools whose athletic
fields, gymnasiums and swimming pools are to be renovated in the
next few years with financial support from a new organization
called Take the Field, a public-private partnership created to
support struggling athletic programs in the city's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, ground will be broken for construction at Washington
to begin the effort. The organization, in concert with the city,
hopes to provide at least $17 million for capital improvements at
high schools throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   The group hopes to help those schools with the most pressing
needs and the most committed sports programs _ schools that are
making strides despite financial obstacles. The organizers have
visited schools, interviewed principals and coaches, and checked
team records.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions at many schools were stunningly poor, said
Richard A. Kahan, president of the Urban Assembly and a founder of
the organization. ``I met with a captain of a girls' softball team
in Beach Channel, Queens, which had one cracked helmet for the
whole team,'' he said. ``The uniform she was wearing was seven
years old and had been passed down from student to student each
year. This was a pretty aggressive team and their uniforms got torn
sometimes, so each student had sewed it up on their own.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Take the Field has selected seven schools to receive
financing this year: George Washington and Seward Park High School
in Manhattan; William C. Bryant High School and Far Rockaway High
School in Queens; South Bronx High School in the Bronx; Brooklyn
Technical High School in Brooklyn; and Port Richmond High School on
Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education, said
school districts across the country were increasingly taking
support from private donors who want to improve sports programs.
``Our public funds are able to go further with the help of the
private groups that get involved,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the city's fiscal crisis in the 1970s, a shortage of
money to maintain school sports facilities has led to widespread
deterioration, making it all but impossible for many students to
participate in teams or even basic recreation.
</P>
<P>
   That shortage of financing, which was described in a three-part
series in The New York Times in January 1999, prompted the
formation of the program by its three founders: Kahan; Preston
Robert Tisch, co-chairman of the Loews Corp. and part owner of the
New York Giants. and Tony Kiser, president of the William and Mary
Greve Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Tisch said the project was modeled after the Center for Arts
Education. The nonprofit group has raised $23.1 million from the
private and public sectors since 1996 to encourage the teaching of
the arts, and is led by Tisch's daughter, Laurie Tisch Sussman.
Tisch said his daughter telephoned him after reading about the
dearth of money for sports programs and said, ``Do you want to do
for sports education what I've done for arts education?''
</P>
<P>
   He, Kahan and Kiser approached City Hall after joining forces at
a meeting called by Rudy Crew, who was then schools chancellor.
City officials were receptive. ``It seemed to us they were all very
anxious to do something and were looking for a vehicle that could
address the issues efficiently,'' Kahan said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan they worked out, Take the Field would contribute
$1 for every $3 the city gave. So far, the city has pledged $10.8
million, with another $3 million earmarked for the project over the
next two years. Take the Field expects to raise an additional $3.6
million from private sources this year. The Tisch Foundation, the
William and Mary Greve Foundation and the Hecksher Foundation for
Children have already committed a total of $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   At Washington, Mandl said the renovation of the field would help
not only the winning baseball team, but the soccer, football and
track programs as well. ``I can't wait,'' he said. ``I'm hoping
that they'll put light up around the new field, which will have
natural grass instead of turf, and that'll be incredible.''

 &HT;    Checkered history for newsman's novel idea
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ If some news operative proposed a midseason game
between National and American League all-stars these days, as did
Arch Ward of the Chicago Tribune in 1933, this breed of owners
would probably wave it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not take three full days out of the heart of the season,
during vacation time, when the races are just heating up. No way.
Besides, we have interleague play, wild-card playoffs, league
championships, then the killer, the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who needs it?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, the major leagues needed it. All baseball needed it.
The country was in hock up to its belly button. The Depression was
digging in. Farms were drying up. Banks were calling loans,
foreclosing on property. Attendance was about what you'd expect of
depression times. Arch Ward couldn't have hit the club owners at a
time when they were more vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. They had to be persuaded. The trump card was
that the Chicago World's Fair was on.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the game didn't really hit a grand slam. In the
Official Baseball Guide, ``All-Star Game'' gets no play as the
actual name of the event, only ``dream'' game, covered in four
paragraphs with no box score. It was moved to the Polo Grounds in
New York the next year, and kept on, never missing a beat, except
for one war year of 1945, and at one stretch doubled up for four
years. Greed had its fling.
</P>
<P>
   That was a mistake. Trying to get two bites of the apple took
something off it. No longer a ``Midsummer's Dream Game,'' it became
a ``Midsummer's Nightmare.'' Attendance dropped off, into the
30,000s. As foul luck would have it, foul weather struck a couple
of the games. At Candlestick Park in 1961, the wind was so strong
it blew little Stu Miller off the mound, caused him to balk. Hoyt
Wilhelm's knuckleball wouldn't ``knuckle,'' and the National League
clubbed him into defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Besides that, two not-so-dreamy games were taking six dates off
the schedule; four years was enough of that and after playing
Washington and Chicago in 1962, a halt was called. Back to one date
a summer.
</P>
<P>
   Settling on the right electoral process took a lot of dabbling.
The first two years, the players themselves picked the starters.
Then All-Star managers did the choosing until 1947, when fans were
invited in. That went smoothly until 1957, when Cincinnati fans
stuffed the ballot box and seven of the eight elected starters were
Reds. Only Stan Musial crashed their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Ford Frick intervened and removed two of the Reds.
In the end, it was embarrassing to the Nationals. The Americans
beat them 6-5. The winning pitcher was a now real Senator, Jim
Bunning (R-Ky.)
</P>
<P>
   Next electoral ploy was a mixture of players, managers and
coaches. That lasted until 1970, when the public was invited to
join in again, this time with a commercial sponsor paying a price
to attach its name to the process, and so it remains today. There
is no foolproof means of recognizing a hot rookie over a popular
veteran. One year, American League balloteers chose a catcher who
wasn't even first-string on his own Oakland team, wasn't among the
10 best-hitting catchers in the league. Yet, in the game, Terry
Steinbach drove in both American runs, one with a homer, and they
won the game.
</P>
<P>
   Not always is the ``dream'' game a classic. Some have been real
dogs. At one stretch, the Nationals killed the Americans 19 out of
20 games. In this ancient memory there is highlighted such games as
1956, when Kenny Boyer stole the thunder of Ted Williams and Stan
Musial; the year Tony Perez hit a home run in the 15th inning in
Anaheim, mercifully ending the longest game of them all; the game
of 1970, when Pete Rose bowled over Ray Fosse at home plate with
the winning run for the Nationals; of course, the first time the
game was played in Atlanta, when Henry Aaron hit the home run but
Joe Morgan drove in the deciding run in the10th inning; all the
traditional old parks I got to see, Sportsman's, Forbes Field,
Griffith Stadium, Tiger Stadium, Municipal in Cleveland, Memorial
in Baltimore, Metropolitan in Minnesota, all just memories now; and
last but far from the least, the game in Baltimore after which
friends invited me to fly home with them in their private plane. It
ran into a fierce storm. It crashed. All were killed.

 &HT;    Babe shows how it's done
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ He was 38 years old, and not even the New York
Yankees' pinstripe uniforms could hide the growing belly that hung
over his belt. But Babe Ruth was still the one player that everyone
wanted to see, and he rarely disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   The Babe certainly didn't disappoint. He thrilled the crowd of
47,595 in Chicago's Comiskey Park by homering in the first All-Star
Game.
</P>
<P>
   The two-run homer came in the third inning and proved to be the
difference, as the American League beat the National League 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   The blow wasn't the longest or the most dramatic of Ruth's
career, but it was certainly one of the most fitting. Who better to
hit the first home run in the history of the All-Star Game than the
Bambino himself, the Sultan of Swat?
</P>
<P>
   The homer, hit off St. Louis pitcher Bill Hallahan, landed in
the lower pavilion just inside the right-field foul pole. American
and National League fans rose as one to applaud Ruth as he waddled
around the bases.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction in Chicago the fall before had been far less
favorable. It was at Wrigley Field in 1932 that Ruth hit his
``called shot'' home run, and the Yankees beat the Cubs in the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his World Series heroics, Ruth had his salary cut from
$75,000 to $52,000 in 1933. His average fell to .301 with 34
homers, and the Yankees released him in 1934 after Ruth batted
.288.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruth had risen to the occasion to make the first All-Star
Game his showcase. He even made a game-saving catch .
</P>
<P>
   HUBBELL KING OF STRIKEOUTS
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that a pitcher could be more dominant in an
All-Star Game than Pedro Martinez was last year in Fenway Park.
Carl Hubbell, however, did Martinez one better.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston pitcher struck out four batters in a row. New York
Giants left-hander Hubbell, pitching in the 1934 All-Star Game,
struck out five _ all future Hall of Famers.
</P>
<P>
   Like Martinez, Hubbell was pitching before his home fans. But
while Martinez struck out the first four batters he faced, Hubbell
was shaky at the start. The screwball pitcher allowed a hit and a
walk before settling into a groove.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx _ three of the most feared
hitters in baseball history - struck out in the first inning, Ruth
looking. Then Hubbell, who had received his trophy as 1933 National
League MVP before the game, fanned Al Simmons and Joe Cronin to
start the second as the crowd of 48,363 at the Polo Grounds roared.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dickey, another future Hall of Famer, singled to break the
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Although the American League came back to win the game 9-7, all
of the talk was about the pitcher called King Carl.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell won two NL MVP awards, set a record with 24 consecutive
wins and finished his Hall of Fame career with 253 victories. But
he was always remembered for his five straight strikeouts in the
second All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respected every one of them, but I had no fear of any
kind,'' Hubbell said. ``I didn't think they had ever seen any
screwball pitchers before.''
</P>
<P>
   SPLENDID SHOT FOR `SPLINTER'
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941, the last time a major-leaguer
reached the .400 mark. But the Boston Red Sox outfielder's biggest
hit that season didn't count in his official statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Williams belted what still is considered the most dramatic homer
in All-Star Game history. He climaxed an American League comeback
with a two-out blast in the bottom of the ninth inning in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   It would be called a walk-off homer now. But Williams hardly
walked around the bases. Then just 23, he half-ran, half-jumped in
a crazy chicken dance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so happy I couldn't stop laughing,'' said Williams,
who in later years would have running battles with fans and the
press. ``I've never been so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The AL had trailed 5-2 when Williams struck out in the eighth
inning, but it was 5-4 in the ninth when he came up again with two
men on base. Williams connected with a high fastball from Claude
Passeau and knocked the pitch into the upper deck in right field to
give the AL a 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 1941 All-Star Game was Williams' most dramatic, it
wasn't his best. After missing three seasons while serving in World
War II, Williams went 4 for 4 with five RBIs in the 1946 game in
Fenway Park. Two of his hits were homers, one a mammoth drive off a
Rip Sewell blooper pitch. The American League won 12-0.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, now 82, returned to Boston to be feted before last
year's All-Star Game as part of the celebration of the Top 100
Players of the Century. The start of the game was delayed about 20
minutes. Everyone wanted to shake Williams' hand.
</P>
<P>
   BIG FINISH FOR STAN THE MAN
</P>
<P>
   Stan Musial holds the record for All-Star Game homers with six.
The one that always will be remembered was in 1955 in Milwaukee's
County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Musial didn't start the game because the ballot-box stuffing
Cincinnati fans voted Ted Kluszewski in at first base. But Musial,
nicknamed ``Stan the Man,'' was around when it counted.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the bottom of the 12th, he hit the first pitch from
American League pitcher Frank Sullivan into the right-field
bleachers to give the National League a 6-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a comeback for the NL. With Mickey Mantle homering,
the American League scored four runs in the first and led 5-0 after
six innings. But the National League tied the game with two runs in
the seventh and three in the eight.
</P>
<P>
   When Musial came to bat in the 12th, St. Louis manager Harry
Walker, an NL coach, begged his star to win the game. ``Let's end
it now,'' Walker said. ``I'm getting hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   American League manager Al Lopez stuck with Boston's Sullivan
for a fourth inning and it proved to be a mistake. His first pitch
was a fastball down the middle, and Musial, a left-handed hitter
with a strange, crouched stance, didn't miss it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Williams in 1941 and Musial, the only other
All-Star Game won on a last at-bat homer was in 1964. John Callison
of the Phillies hit a three-run blast in the bottom of the ninth to
give the NL a 7-4 comeback win.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, Tony Perez of Cincinnati homered in the top of the 15th
to give the NL a 2-1 win in the longest All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ROSE LOWERS THE BOOM AT PLATE
</P>
<P>
   It was the most violent home-plate collision many fans had seen.
Then they saw it over and over again, thanks to replays. Without
television, Pete Rose crashing into Ray Fosse to score the winning
run in 1970 might not have been the most unforgettable All-Star
Game moment. With TV, it was.
</P>
<P>
   The National League had made two outs in the 12th inning, and
Rose, who had singled, was on second base in newly opened
Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. Jim Hickman was the batter,
facing Clyde Wright, the father of present Cleveland pitcher Jaret
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman, a Chicago Cubs outfielder, singled to center. Amos
Otis, who had a strong arm, fielded the ball and came up throwing.
Rose, who treated every game as if it would decide the World
Series, knew the play would be close.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse, a rookie catcher with Cleveland, straddled the line,
waiting for the ball. At first, it looked as if Rose would slide.
But he put his shoulder down and hit Fosse.
</P>
<P>
   The thud could be heard throughout the stadium. The catcher flew
one way and his glove the other. The ball had never gotten to
Fosse. Rose was safe, and the National League had a 5-4 victory
after trailing by three runs going into the last of the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse, now a broadcaster with the Oakland A's, never played in
another All-Star Game. Rose went on to set the major-league record
for hits in a career, but now he is banned from baseball for
betting while manager of the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Fosse thought Rose wasn't trying to hurt him. Then, he
read a Rose autobiography published in 1989. Rose said he couldn't
have looked his father in the eye if he had done it any other way.
``Besides, nobody told me they changed it to girls' softball
between third and home.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosse says, ``I don't have anything to do with Pete. All I know
is my left shoulder continues to bother me. I have a constant
reminder of the play.''
</P>
<P>
   JULY FIREWORKS
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Jackson was known as ``Mr. October'' for his World Series
heroics. But in 1971, he was ``Mr. July.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, then a 25-year-old outfielder with the Oakland A's, hit
the longest homer in All-Star Game history, blasting a ball onto
the right field roof at Tiger Stadium in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The ball would have gone over the roof and onto the street if it
hadn't hit a light tower. The homer was estimated at 523 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the longest home run I've ever seen,'' said Hall of
Famer Al Kaline, who played all of his 22-year career with the
Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have hit it any farther if I'd used a fungo bat,''
Jackson said. ``It's a good thing the tower was in the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer came in the third inning on a 3-and-2 pitch from
National League starter Dock Ellis of Pittsburgh. Jackson, who was
a late addition to the American League team after an injury to Tony
Oliva, was batting for starting pitcher Vida Blue, an Oakland
teammate, with a man on base.
</P>
<P>
   The 1971 game was a slugfest, with each team hitting three home
runs. The American League won 6-4 to end an eight-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   All the homers were hit by future Hall of Famers. Hank Aaron,
Johnny Bench and Roberto Clemente connected for the NL. Jackson,
Frank Robinson and Harmon Killebrew homered for the AL.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson hit 10 World Series homers with Oakland and the New York
Yankees. The 1971 blast in Detroit was his only All-Star Game
homer.
</P>
<P>
   OVERMATCHED BY BIG UNIT
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the All-Star Game's most memorable moments have been
historic. A few have been hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to bat against fireballing Randy Johnson can be funny, as
long as it's not you standing in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, then with the Seattle Mariners, formed part of two
impromptu comedy acts, the first with John Kruk in 1993 and the
second with Larry Walker in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 lefty threw two hitless innings for the American
League in a 9-3 victory in Baltimore in 1993. But fans still are
laughing about what happened after he threw over Kruk's head a
fastball clocked at nearly 100 mph. The Philadelphia Phillie swung
weakly at the next three pitches, then headed to the dugout with a
goofy grin.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson started the 1997 game in Cleveland, won 3-1 by the AL,
and again pitched two hitless innings. Walker, like Kruk, is a
left-handed batter and the first pitch sailed over his head.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for the Colorado Rockies star. He put his
batting helmet on backward and stepped across the plate to bat
right-handed. He then took a pitch for a ball before returning to
the left side and drawing a walk without swinging at a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the weirdest All-Star moment came in 1961 in
wind-swept Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Giants pitcher Stu
Miller was called for a balk in the ninth inning when a gust of
wind caused him to lose his balance on the mound. The AL tied the
game, but the NL won 5-4 in the 10th inning. It was the first of
two All-Star Games that year.

 &HT;    An Atlanta hero returns to see Braves' new world
 &HT;    By Tim Tucker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One nice thing, among many, about having the All-Star
Game at Turner Field is that it brings Dale Murphy to town.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after he played his last game for the Braves, six
years after he moved from Atlanta to Utah, the kindest, humblest
superstar in baseball history visits for a few days to serve as
honorary captain of the National League team. ``Gosh, I'm
honored,'' he said, as you knew he would.
</P>
<P>
   Catching up with Murf . . .
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, he and his family returned to their home in
Alpine, Utah, after three years in Massachusetts, where he served
as president of the Boston Mission of the Church of Jesus Christ of
Latter-Day Saints, popularly known as Mormons. In the unpaid
position, Murphy was responsible for supervising upward of 180
missionaries _ mostly ages 19 to 21 _ throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a definite stretch for me to be an administrator,'' he
said, laughing. ``You can imagine how organized I was. My desk kind
of looked like my locker,'' which often was a mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was intense. It's like you have 180 children that you are
constantly worried about. Your stomach is kind of always
churning.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was, for Murphy and his family, an enriching experience
in an already rich life.
</P>
<P>
   ``To see these missionaries _ it's a very rigid schedule for
them; they don't watch TV, don't go to movies, don't listen to
popular music; it's a time for them to really find out about the
most important things in life, their faith in God and serving other
people,'' Murphy said. ``So it's just a real remarkable experience
to see young people change their lives like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a highlight of our lives to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now 44, Murphy doesn't know what he will do next _ except watch
the young ballplayers in his family.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Nancy, have eight children. The oldest, Chad,
who was 1 when Murphy won his first National League MVP award, is
19 and on a Mormon mission in Okinawa, Japan. Travis is 18, Shawn
17, Tyson 14, Taylor 12, Jacob 10, McKay 8 and Madison, the only
girl, 6. Murphy had to check with a couple of them to confirm the
ages.
</P>
<P>
   They're into sports like he can't believe. ``They follow it so
much more closely than I ever did. They even know who's leading the
league in RBIs.'' As for the All-Star Game, he said, ``They're
looking forward to the home-run contest.''
</P>
<P>
   Their dad is looking forward to all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great time to be a part of baseball,'' Murphy said.
``It'll bring back a lot of good memories.''
</P>
<P>
   He has memories of seven All-Star Games as a player, and
especially of his first _ 1980 in Dodger Stadium. ``I was trying to
fit in and be comfortable with the guys, and I remember Pete Rose
came up to me and said, `Hey, you ready to go?' I was, like, well,
yes. And he said something like, `OK, go out there and don't do
anything differently than you would in a regular-season game. Don't
relax. Take it seriously.' It was, like, `We didn't come here to
lose.' I was young (24), and it was an eye-opener for me how badly
the players wanted to win the All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, Pete did, anyway, as Ray Fosse could attest.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Murphy will get his first look at Turner Field and
his first look at the parking lot that used to be Atlanta-Fulton
County Stadium, where he played all or part of 15 seasons with the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going through boxes like crazy (upon returning to Utah
last week),'' he said, ``and I pulled out a picture someone in
Atlanta had given me. `Thanks for the memories' was written on it,
and it was a picture of the stadium. I was, like, golly, that's not
even there any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be weird to not see it,'' Murphy said. ``But
that's the way it goes. It's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, one of the very best parts of Atlanta's baseball past is
back in town.

 &HT;    NBC offers voice of experience
 &HT;    By Carol Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to televising the All-Star Game, no
network has a richer tradition than NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it has been more than eight months since NBC's last
baseball telecast. Under the current contract with Major League
Baseball, NBC does only postseason games and the All-Star Game
every other year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday will be NBC's 41st telecast of the All-Star Game, which
includes a string that once ran consecutively from 1950 through
1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like a reunion for the crew,'' NBC producer
David Neal start. ``For another sport, being away that long might
be a problem. But all of us literally grew up in our careers doing
the ``Game of the Week,'' and among the benefits to us as
broadcasters is that it's the only baseball game on TV that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the All-Star Game no longer seems to draw ratings of
15.0 or higher, it's still a sure bet for double digits and
averaged 12.8 over the last five years. NBC Research is predicting
that 40 million people will watch all or part of Tuesday's
telecast.
</P>
<P>
   For analyst Joe Morgan, having the All-Star Game in Atlanta
takes on added meaning, because the Hall of Fame second baseman
drove home the winning run in the 10th inning in 1972, the last
time the game was played here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget being the MVP and the hit in the 10th
inning,'' Morgan said, ``but when I revisit the game I remember
Hank Aaron hitting a home run to put us ahead and thinking that
would be a storybook ending. It was also the first time I started
an All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NBC will have a full array of cameras (22) and tape
machines (20), there will be differences from their last telecast,
which was the Yankees beating the Braves in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Some differences will be obvious, such as network reporters
being allowed to interview players after they leave the game; and
others will be more subtle, such as Morgan and announcer Bob Costas
speaking more about the state of the sport and less about the
winning and losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, it was about winning. You'd see guys like
Willie Mays play the whole game,'' Morgan said. ``The game has
changed a lot. Now managers are looking to get everybody in, so
it's more of an exhibition, and the winning is secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the baseball All-Star Game is still the best. In the NFL
and hockey, the hitting is not the same, and in the NBA, they don't
play defense the same. Baseball is the only sport where the best
players come together and play the same game you see every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN TO `TRACK' HR DERBY
</P>
<P>
   ESPN takes the ``Home Run Derby'' seriously. The cable network
has come up with yet another bit of technology to cover the hitting
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Sportvision, author of the ``1st &AMP;10'' line in football, will
unveil on Monday the ``ESPN True Track,'' which it claims will be
the first accurate measurement of home-run distances.
</P>
<P>
   Two cameras, equipped with sensors, will be placed in the upper
deck near the foul poles and will relay data to a computer program
that will reveal exactly how far the ball traveled. Even baseballs
that strike an obstacle such as a scoreboard will be computed for
the distance they would have flown unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love baseball phrases like, `It went a country mile,' ''
ESPN executive producer Jed Drake said. ``We'll now know just how
far a country mile really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Berman and Morgan will make the call, with guest
commentator Mike Piazza of the Mets.

SURE, IT WASN'T VINTAGE GOODEN, BUT THE YANKEES WILL TAKE IT
</HEADLINE>
  By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steve Phillips was present at the start, in
Kingsport, Tenn., of the Appalachian League, watching a 17-year-old
fireballing teammate named Dwight Gooden break a catcher's hand
with his fastballs. Phillips, now the Mets' general manager,
remembers how Gooden overmatched teams, the way one club's No. 9
hitter closed his eyes and swung and somehow beat Gooden, 1-0, with
an opposite-field home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any pitcher like Dwight has it within him to go out and pitch
a great game, still,'' Phillips said. ``The major leagues are
different than the Gulf Coast League, but that doesn't mean it
doesn't transfer over.''
</P>
<P>
   Traded by Houston and released by Tampa Bay this year, Gooden
was pitching at the lowest level of the minors before the Yankees
promoted him to face the Mets at Shea Stadium Saturday, to return
to the stage of his greatest triumphs in the mid-1980s. He was not
the Gooden of old, but he was surprisingly effective for five
innings and was the winning pitcher in the Yankees' 4-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   After the games, the teams boarded buses _ subway transportation
was left to the fans, 54,165 of whom showed up in Flushing _ and
headed to Yankee Stadium for the second game of a day-night
doubleheader. It was the first time since 1903 that two teams had
played each other at different parks on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, who was pitching at Shea for the first time since 1994,
received mostly cheers when he was introduced. There were no signs
counting the strikeouts of the pitcher once known as Dr. K, but
Gooden recorded only one strikeout, anyway. The Mets had six hits
off Gooden in five innings, but they walked just once and managed
only two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden left with the score tied, but Tino Martinez lifted him to
the victory with an opposite-field home run in the sixth off the
Mets right-hander Bobby J. Jones. Martinez went 3 for 4 with three
runs batted in, and his homer was the only hit Jones allowed over
the final 23 batters he faced after the Yankees took a 2-0 lead in
the first. Jones (3-4) worked seven innings, giving up three runs
on four hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Grimsley, Jeff Nelson and Mariano Rivera combined for four
scoreless innings to secure the victory for the Yankees. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The historic day was raucous from the start. Chuck Knoblauch
lined the first pitch of the game into center field, where Jay
Payton dived but could not catch it. Knoblauch tried advancing to
second, but Payton popped up and fired to shortstop Melvin Mora,
who was covering at second and slapped a tag for the inning's first
out.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, whose expressions usually change as often as a statue's
when he is pitching, pumped his fist in excitement. He did not see
the Yankees' first base coach, Lee Mazzilli, barking at the first
base umpire, Robb Cook, charging that first baseman Todd Zeile had
obstructed Knoblauch's path to second.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch had not looked at Zeile as he ran, but he briefly lost
his balance, and Cook may have noticed that. The umpire agreed with
Mazzilli, and Zeile was shocked at the call _ ``No way!'' he
shouted; it went as an error on Zeile. Mets manager Bobby Valentine
argued for four minutes, retracing Knoblauch's fresh footprints.
</P>
<P>
   All it earned was an ejection for Valentine, and The Yankees
soon had two runs, on a double by Derek Jeter and a single by Tino
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets came from behind to win five times on their last
homestand, and when they fell behind the Yankees by 2-0 on Friday,
Payton said, they did not think much of it. The Mets never overcame
that deficit then, losing 2-1, but they must have felt more
confident Saturday, facing Gooden instead of Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team feared the opposing starting pitcher Saturday. The
Mets were content to take a strike from Gooden, and the Yankees
usually let Jones' first pitch go by. Because Jones is usually
around the plate, he got ahead most of the time, throwing a
first-pitch ball to just three of the first 18 hitters.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees knew they could make contact with Jones' pitches; no
Yankee swung and missed until Jones' 52nd pitch, a slider to Scott
Brosius in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones does not try to blow hitters away. If he gets ahead in
the count, he makes hitters swing at his pitch. Jones spotted his
fastball well, and mixed in enough curveballs and sliders to keep
the Yankees from swinging comfortably.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter knocked a hanging curveball into the left-field corner for
a run-scoring double. But Martinez's single never left the infield;
second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo knocked it down, then threw wildly
to first for an error. The Yankees did not get another hit until
Martinez's home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had more scoring chances against Gooden than the
Yankees did against Jones, but they failed to capitalize every
time. Derek Bell singled with one out in the first, then stole
second. But Alfonzo popped up and Mike Piazza grounded to third.
Alfonzo and Piazza _ the Mets' offensive All-Stars _ are a combined
0 for 15 in the first two games of this series.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile has been among the Mets' hottest hitters, and he started
things off in the second with a one-out double to left. Payton
singled, moving Zeile to third, and Benny Agbayani beat out a
potential inning-ending double play grounder to score Zeile and cut
the Yankees' lead to 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani started the rally in the fifth that led to the Mets'
second run. He ripped Gooden's first pitch of the inning through
the left side of the infield for a single and advanced to second on
a sacrifice by Jones. Mora's fly ball pushed Agbayani to third, and
Bell fought back from 0-2 and dumped a double into center, just
past the reach of a backpedaling Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   But after a walk to Alfonzo, Piazza flied to center, ending the
inning and the Mets' chance for more.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, after Gooden had left the game, Agbayani led off
with a walk and went to second on a sacrifice. But with two outs,
he made a crucial baserunning mistake when Bell chopped a ball high
in the infield. Agbayani should have gone nowhere; Bell has good
speed and the ball took so long to get to Brosius, the third
baseman, that it would have been an infield single.
</P>
<P>
   But when Brosius came down with the ball, he pumped as if he was
throwing to first, then stopped and caught Agbayani coming his way.
Agbayani tried to retreat to second, but Brosius tagged him and the
inning was over _ with Alfonzo and Piazza due to hit next.

   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA _ ONI, Georgia _ High in still snowy mountain
passes separating Russia from its southern neighbors, Chechen
rebels have found a near impenetrable lair. From these hideouts,
the rebels have unleashed a new round of fighting their almost
yearlong war against the Russian army. The worrisome problem is
that the rebels have moved across the international border, to the
Republic of Georgia, threatening to escalate what Russia has always
called a ``domestic issue'' into a regional war. (Coker, Cox News

   MEXICO-REVOLUTION _ MEXICO CITY _ It's being called the second
Mexican Revolution, the Revolution of the 21st Century, Mexico's
Velvet Revolution, the electoral earthquake. To the surprise of
virtually all political observers here, Mexicans rose up last
Sunday and decisively ended 71 years of domination by the world's
longest-reigning political party. In just one week, life in Mexico
has changed spiritually if not materially. Many people sense a
mantle of control has been lifted. A federal employee here who was
forced to pass out literature for the ruling party said she hopes
such coercion is dead in Mexico. A TV comic pushed the envelope on
freedom of expression by performing a sketch using amusing video of
President-elect Vicente Fox, and then bantering with the real Fox
in a live telephone interview. The audience went wild. Mexico is
enjoying a democratic fiesta, even though there are rumblings of
how tough Fox's job is going to be as he struggles to shape a new
government here. (Ferriss, Cox News Service) MOVED

   MEXICO-PRI _ MEXICO CITY _ The worst of times for Mexico's
freshly defeated ruling party included the 1968 student massacre,
several crippling peso devaluations and spate of fratricidal
assassinations. And now the ultimate _ unexpected defeat at the
polls of 71 years in power. Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party is in the throes of a crisis, as its leaders squabble among
one another and stunned supporters wonder what will happen to their
special favors. President Ernesto Zedillo, who accepted the PRI's
defeat and won praise from abroad and the opposition here, is being
reviled within his own party as a traitor. The PRI will now be a
minority power in the Senate and Congress, and a minor voice in
Mexico City and other key areas. Can the dinosaur survive?

   MIDEAST-SUMMIT _ JERUSALEM _ As they head into a summit meeting
Tuesday, Israelis and Palestinians are closer than they've ever
been to making peace. But, they're still readying themselves for
war. The solutions are out there. Israeli officials have leaked
proposals that would be the largest concessions Israel ever offered
and Palestinians have shown increased flexibility in living next to
the Jewish state. The toughest issues are Jerusalem, resettlement
of refugees, borders and water. Each has a number of possible
solutions. But, peacemakers on both sides face stiff opposition
from their own publics. Should the summit fail, no one knows what
will follow but it could be violence. Palestinians are preparing to
declare statehood and are said to be gathering weapons. Israeli
officers are threatening to use ``tanks and planes'' against a
Palestinian uprising. A look at the issues and risks of the summit.

   SURPLUS _ WASHINGTON _ Like Uncle Sam finding a $20 bill in the
pocket of his striped pants on laundry day, the U.S. government
last month came up with an extra $100 billion in revenue over the
next 10 years. While this boost in the projected federal surplus
certainly sounds like good news, it raises some disquieting
questions. How can revenue estimates change so quickly, and can
they go down as fast as they went up? And could the new revenues
lead lawmakers to create spending or benefit programs that would be
hard to roll back if the windfall evaporates? (Deans, Cox News

   BAXTER-COLUMN _ How would Southern politics change _ or would it
change at all _ if we knew all the dire predictions about global
warming were really true? With all the scientific controversy over
that subject we can't be sure. But if there's one area which could
be looked at as a present-day laboratory for the consequences of
such an unprecedented crisis, it lies along the Carolina coastline.
That's because whether global warming affects it or not, there is
convincing evidence that over the next 30 years, storms like the
one which caused record flooding in North Carolina last year will
increase in frequency. That increases the potential like more
environmental disasters like the one last year in which North
Carolinians saw their rivers polluted with the carcasses of
thousands of drowned hogs. But it also brings a risk of political
disaster, as South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges found out last year
when he ordered the coast evacuated for a disaster which didn't
materialize. (Baxter, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ The big winner in the Mexican election was
Mexico itself, but the hero of the election was not the successful
presidential candidate, Vicente Fox. It was the outgoing president,
Ernesto Zedillo, whose party's nominee got walloped. Candidate by
default six years ago when the anointed nominee of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party _ PRI in its Spanish language
acronym _ was assassinated, straight-arrow Zedillo stuck to reforms
already tentatively under way and added more, in the end securing
the means and atmosphere that could lead to a peaceful transition

   TRANSEXUAL-MINISTER _ The Rev. Erin Swenson's heart thumped
wildly. She was so close to panic that her fingertips tingled.
Facing her, the crowd crammed inside the Shallowford Presbyterian
Church in Atlanta stared at her in disbelief. Swenson, an ordained
minister and father of two daughters, had just walked to the front
of the church in a green dress, heels and an eggshell-white blouse.
She was going to speak publicly for the first time about a
49-year-old secret that had driven her to thoughts of suicide.
Swenson told the hushed crowd that she was a woman born in a man's
body. Now that she had taken steps to correct that, she made an
unprecedented request before the assembly of Presbyterian church
leaders: Allow her to retain her ordination as a minister. Five
years later, Swenson is stepping back in the spotlight. She _ along
with , her ex-wife, daughter and father _ is are finally talking
about the extraordinary journey _ as a family and as individuals _
they have taken together since that autumn morning. (Blake, Atlanta

   COVER _ The idea seems obvious, so why didn't anyone think of it
before? ``Women get to accessorize with great shoes and handbags,
so why shouldn't our Palm Pilot covers and planners express who we
are and be fabulous also?'' asks Sunny Knox. The Dayton native, who
now makes her home in Los Angeles, theorized that women would be
anxious to replace ``black and boring'' accessory covers with those
more funky and fashionable. She figured right. Today Sunshine Knox
(her business card simply reads ``Sunshine'') is the president and
designer of Sunny Kate, a 1-year-old company that's already sold
thousands of items and is quickly becoming known for its upscale
accessories for women. (Dayton Daily News) WITH PHOTOS. MOVED.

   ADAMS-YOSEMITE _ Yosemite National Park draws a whopping 3.6
million visitors a year _ making it one of the busiest sites in the
park system _ and many credit Ansel Adams' majestic black-and-white
photographs for its popularity. ``Every year I have to have an
Ansel Adams calendar of the park,'' said the Rev. David Johnson, a
Welches, Ore., minister. ``Now I want to see the vantage points
firsthand.'' The park plays to the fascination visitors have with
Adams by offering camera walks filled with basic instruction and
nifty details on where some of his classic images were executed. We
took the walk but also hiked independently, trying to view this
magnificent land in a way similar to the great photographer.

expanding existing facilities in a major way. Just about everywhere

   EARLE _ Renegade country rocker Steve Earle is the last artist
one would expect to be a Savior. After building a reputation as one

of heroin addiction), he has become the icon of Americana music, an
eclectic collection of alternative country artists too esoteric for
mainstream radio. Earle's new album, ``Transcendental Blues,'' sold
20,000 copies during its first week of release, and remains at the
top of the Americana charts. He kicks off his national tour in
Atlanta on Tuesday, in a week loaded with Americana performances,
including Shelby Lynne and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. We talk to Earle
about the rise of alternative country, and the future of Americana
as a vital format. (Longino, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

   HARRYPOTTER _ Who says you can't Harry love? Those mean adults
in charge of the publishing company may have banned all sales of
the new Harry Potter book until Saturday. But they didn't say WHEN
on Saturday! The clock hands had barely sneaked past midnight at
bookstores all over metro Atlanta Saturday when the kids finally
got their way. Bedtime, closing time, suddenly it was all as
inconsequential as mortals are in the magical world where Potter
the pubescent warlock exists. As beleaguered store employees
finally ripped open the cartons containing precious copies of
``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' youngsters for whom
Dumbledore and Snape are rapidly becoming their generation's
version of Paul and Ringo plotted to get in there early and stay up
late reading. Eight hours later, the scene repeated itself as the
same stores opened early to feed the need for Potter _ and coffee
to bleary-eyed parents still shaking their heads in wonder at how
Harry's made reading cool again. A report from the front.

 &HT;    Dekker basks in his moment of gloryBy Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VILLENEUVE-SUR-LOT, France _ Erik Dekker had tried so
desperately to win his first career stage in the Tour de France
over the past week.
</P>
<P>
   He and France's Jacky Durand rode together for much of stage two
last Sunday, but with about one-third of the race to go, Dekker's
leg cramped so severely that he needed medical attention before he
could complete the race. He finished the stage but was the last
rider to cross the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Going from Vannes to Vitre on Tuesday for stage five, Dekker
again had a chance to win. He led until the final 500 yards but was
caught by a group of sprinters, including eventual winner Marcel
Wust.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, with the terrain changing from flat to rugged
as the peloton approached southern France and the foothills of the
Pyrenees Mountains, Dekker had his moment to shine.
</P>
<P>
   He started his break from the group almost as soon as the race
started. Late in the day, the 29-year-old from the Netherlands
basically stopped pumping the pedals about 100 yards from the
finish line in Villeneuve-Sur-Lot to bask in the moment. He coasted
to the loud cheers of the fans lining the route, knowing that his
closest pursuers were almost a minute behind him.
</P>
<P>
   He then covered his face with his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most beautiful day in my career,'' said Dekker,
who won a silver medal at the 1992 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But like all the stages of this first week of the Tour, the
outcome likely had little effect on who will wear the yellow jersey
in Paris on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   The contenders _ including Austin's Lance Armstrong, the
defending Tour champion _ stayed safely back in the peloton and out
of harm's way. That has been Armstrong's strategy since Wednesday.
He and so many others have said the real race starts Monday, when
the riders go from Dax to the summit of Hautacam. The stage will
feature three steep climbs over its 127-mile route.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's stage tweaked the leader board a bit, though Italy's
Alberto Elli remained in the yellow jersey with an overall time of
28 hours, 39.28 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong stayed 5:44 behind Elli but fell from 12th to 16th
place. Jan Ullrich, who is expected to give Armstrong his strongest
challenge in the mountains, was 28th, 6:37 out of the lead.
Ullrich, who won the Tour in 1997, and Armstrong finished with the
main group of riders Saturday afternoon, all 5:42 behind Dekker.
Sprinters took up the first 13 spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's their last chance to do anything,'' Armstrong said.
``Ninety percent of them realize they don't have a chance in the
mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he was tired after Saturday's stage because the
speeds were faster than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the back of the peloton,'' he said. ``I lazily
started in back. I don't mind when they go fast. It gets the race
over with quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Another American stood higher in the overall standings after
Saturday than Armstrong. Fred Rodriguez, the defending U.S. Pro
champion from Emeryville, Calif., was 11th overall, 4:46 out of
first. Rodriguez _ riding for Mapei, the Italian team ranked first
in the world _ finished fourth on Saturday, becoming the first
American rider to make a splash at the Tour this year since
Tuesday, when Armstrong's U.S. Postal Service squad finished second
in the team time trial.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, however, acknowledged that he will not be one of the
contenders for the yellow jersey because of the upcoming mountain
stages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a good climber, but at the same time, I don't think I have
the preparation to do the (overall) classification or a mountain
stage,'' he said. ``I'm going to stick to the flat stages like this
one (Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm in the sprinting stage of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dekker believed his stage win gave him some
redemption from his horrible experience in last year's world
championships. The day before the championship started, Dekker was
suspended and sent back to Holland after a blood test showed an
abnormal percentage of red blood cells, suggesting the use of the
banned blood booster EPO.
</P>
<P>
   Dekker was later cleared of the blood doping charges and
reinstated for competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to make a fresh start,'' Dekker said. ``Now everybody
will remember me as a cyclist and not as a doper.''

 &HT;    Harry Potter arrives
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Danny Crowe looked like he'd run head-first into a
Dementor.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year-old Atlantan's face was frozen in shock and his
spiffy black wizard's robe appeared to droop slightly as he trudged
over to where a friend stood in Borders Books late Friday night.
He'd just been eliminated in what seemed like the gazillionth round
of the Harry Potter ``Know-it-Owl'' trivia contest, although he
felt sure his answer had been correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get the book,'' Danny whispered urgently to his friend, Emma
Schruben, 12. ``Get the book!''
</P>
<P>
   In a flash, Emma was back with a copy of the first Harry Potter
book _ and Danny was back in the contest. His answer was right, and
he was determined to win this thing.
</P>
<P>
   After all, first prize was a chance to stand at the front of a
very long line, and then plunk down $16.66 to buy a book.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no ordinary book that went on sale _ finally _ at
12:01 a.m. Saturday around the world. It may sound like a cliche to
say that ``Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' the fourth volume
in British author J.K. Rowling's series of children's novels, had
cast a spell on people even before it was released. But, Harry is a
14-year-old wizard, learning to mix potions at the Hogwarts School
of Witchcraft and Wizardry at the same time he battles soul-sucking
Dementors and other evildoers.
</P>
<P>
   And some of what went on around here late Friday and early
Saturday was a little bit spooky. ``This is completely out of
character for me,'' Jonathan Lathbury said around 12:15 a.m.
Saturday. ``Whenever things get to this level of hoopla, I usually
always stand back and say, `I'm not going to go there.' But in this
case, some little bit of whimsy sort of got into me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it was _ whimsy or Harry's, uh, special influence _ it
got Lathbury, his 6-year-old son, Jason, and friend Julio Allen, 8,
into the Chapter 11 bookstore for what was being billed as a book
release pajama party. Julio sported a red cape and a lightning bolt
``scar'' just like Harry's drawn on his forehead, while Jason
needed both hands to tote around the 734-page copy of ``Goblet''
his father had just purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Not even sleeping potions were going to work on this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're having a sleepover tonight,'' Jason's father explained.
``When we go home, we're going to start reading the book aloud.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, bedtime suddenly was as meaningless a concept as closing
time, as bookstore chains like Borders, Barnes &AMP; Noble and Chapter
11 all stayed open well past midnight to distribute copies of
``Goblet'' to customers. Not that there's anything unusual about
that in the highly unusual realm of Harry Potter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first Potter book was published in the United States
in 1998, the series has sold 21 million copies here. At one point,
it held the top three spots on the New York Times bestseller list.
And it's being credited with instilling a love for reading in a
generation more accustomed to staring at video and computer screens
for entertainment, although some doomsayers predict that
``Goblet's'' length _ nearly twice as long as the previous Potters
_ could make that love more like a passing fancy.
</P>
<P>
   But a whole lot of adults like Harry too, all of which adds up
to a record-sized first printing of 3.8 million copies in the U.S.
alone _ about twice the number for a John Grisham novel. Along with
Internet giant Amazon, which pre-sold 250,000 copies of ``Goblet''
by promising Saturday delivery via a fleet of 9,000 Federal Express
trucks, bookstore chains and independent retailers began taking
reservations for this latest tale about Harry, his yukky Muggle
(mortal) relatives and his wizard friends Ron, Hermione and
Dumbledore. Not to mention the villain so frightening, he's usually
referred to simply as ``You-Know-Who.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the fact that the notoriously secretive Rowling let it
slip recently that a major character dies in ``Goblet'' and
suddenly the only thing more scary than ``You-Know-Who'' was the
thought of not being able to get a copy this weekend. By late
Thursday, Chapter 11 had presold some 4,000 copies, said chain
owner Barbara Babbit Kaufman, who ordered a whopping 9,000 books to
meet anticipated demand. Individual stores were similarly swamped:
Borders had presold about 400 copies, while Barnes &AMP; Noble had
taken orders for about 350 by midday Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring their stores were going to be full of kids and even a
few adults suffering from extreme cases of Harry-up-and-wait Friday
evening, many stores planned parties and activities to fill the
hours before books could officially be sold at 12:01 a.m. That
explained why young Danny Crowe was walking around Borders, dressed
like a wizard and displaying a frighteningly unMuggleesque ability
to remember things about Harry Potter even J.K. Rowling probably
doesn't remember (even more deliciously frightening, there was a
three-way tie for first between him, Micah Weiss, 12, and Frances
Voll, 10). And why Barnes &AMP; Noble community relations manager
Melissa Davis put out a spread that included Harry's favorite
Butterbeer (``It's cream soda,'' Davis confessed) and Cauldron
Cakes (``Chocolate mini-muffins from Publix'').
</P>
<P>
   Early Saturday morning, it all began again. At Hobbit Hall, fans
of all ages started showing up an hour before the children's
bookstore opened at 10 a.m. Pre-ordering a book got you a ticket
into the staff's Hogwarts-and-all recreation of Harry's life, right
down to the flying broomsticks in the store's backyard and _ just
like in book two _ a ``Moaning Myrtle'' in the bathroom. Even at $5
per additonal ticket, demand was so heavy that sales were cut off
late last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely addicted,'' said mother of two Corey-Jan
Albert, 36, who is hosting a ``Goblet'' reading marathon at her
home next Saturday and has a friendly wager going with co-workers
on which character dies. ``I would read them whether I had kids or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of kids, they do know this book is 734 pages long,
right?
</P>
<P>
   ``It is?!'' yelped Fletcher Ray, 11, of Hopkinsville, Ky., who
was visiting Atlanta with his parents and watching the trivia
contest at Borders. ``Cool. That's more to read.''
</P>
<P>
   See? Downright spooky.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHO OWNS NEW YORK? THE FANS
</HEADLINE>
  By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the doors swung open on the No. 7 line Saturday
morning, the best air conditioning there is blew through the car
and brought a rush of refreshment that felt like September. It was
that kind of day around New York City, when its major league
baseball teams were playing day and night, in Queens and in the
Bronx, and if you closed your eyes, took in the breeze, you could
feel energy of a late-season race.
</P>
<P>
   One day. Two games. Two boroughs. Even with no direct line and
having to connect via Manhattan, the train seemed to be the best
way to go, to beat the traffic, to feel the buzz. I drove into
Midtown Manhattan in the morning, parked the car, bought three
tokens and boarded the No. 7 train at Grand Central station for the
40-minute ride to Shea.
</P>
<P>
   I love taking subways to ballgames, always have, from the time
my father took me to Yankee Stadium for the first time. It was a
long ride, with a change of lines, from Saratoga Avenue in Brooklyn
on up into the South Bronx. But at least the train kept moving, you
could study the faces of the other fans and not worry about timing
your exit out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a symptom of middle age, but these days, just the
thought of a game-day traffic jam, to or from, is enough to keep me
home.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the police to escort them from Queens to the Bronx,
who could blame the managers for being less than ecstatic at having
to plan their travel itineraries more carefully than their pitching
rotations? Bobby Valentine, in fact, foresaw only one potential
upside from the first doubleheader in different stadiums in 97
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe will probably have to shave three times,'' he said. ``I'll
only have to shave once.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could think of any positives, Torre quickly
answered, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that he immediately remembered that the manager
and the players get paid a few nickels to be inconvenienced. The
fans pay for the privilege of waiting in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing is that more fans will get to see the games
than if we played in one place,'' Torre said, before his team won
the first game, 4-2. ``That's good. That's an upside. This is a
city it works in.''
</P>
<P>
   Since interleague play began, Torre has hardly been its most
sanguine supporter. It could be inevitable that a man who works for
George Steinbrenner would prefer not to have to deal with the
crosstown rival. Or maybe it's more that this Brooklyn native is
enough of a well traveled veteran of the game to know that
Baltimore at Philadelphia does not exactly cause traffic delays
along Interstate 95.
</P>
<P>
   That opens another argument, for if the Mets and Yankees were of
the combined quality of the Orioles and Phillies, Tom Seaver out of
retirement and pitching for either team would not have sold out
either site.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the Yankees began the day back in first place, a week
before the All-Star break, a week after they were all but cast as
has-beens. The Mets were still chasing Atlanta, a game behind in
the loss column. Doc Gooden, late of Houston, Tampa Bay and
baseball oblivion, materialized as the Yankees' afternoon starter
at Shea, after a bossy little birdie whispered in Torre's ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was first put to me, I was a little reluctant,'' he
said, referring to an earlier Steinbrenner offer to send Gooden to
New York. ``But when it was put to me again for here, I said, `Why
not?' If there is ever a place, this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Steinbrenner's motives, it wasn't as if Torre had a
better alternative. If all Gooden could do was help dress up the
occasion, it made sense. It gave the fans something more to buzz
about on their way in on the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here he is, July, Saturday afternoon,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Here were Mets and Yankees, packing two ballparks, taking hold
of the town, afternoon and night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been building each year, as the Mets have been slowly
coming along, putting themselves in a position to win,'' said the
slumping David Cone. ``I always thought interleague play was flawed
but that the plusses outweigh the negatives.''
</P>
<P>
   He looked over at the commotion around Gooden and said: ``I
don't know how many pitches Doc will have in him. I'd love to pitch
out of the bullpen. Two ex-Mets pitching at Shea _ that would be
something.''
</P>
<P>
   That would have been something for people to talk about, at
least until the next game, Saturday night, in the Bronx. And that
is the point of all this, to keep people talking about a regular
season that stretches across six months and three seasons.
Interleague play. Realignment. Doubleheaders that force the players
to hit and run, all the way crosstown.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes. Next time, they may want to consider a police
escort for the subway, via Manhattan.

GOODEN TAKES CAREER ONE INNING AT A TIME
</HEADLINE>
  By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Now wasn't that a fine payback for friendship
rendered?
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Gooden returns to the New York Yankees, returns to Shea
Stadium, where he became a 24-game winner and the youngest pitcher
ever to win the Cy Young award, returns to the major leagues for
what, at the age of 35, is most likely his last chance, and the kid
he befriended 22 years ago tries to spoil it all.
</P>
<P>
   With two out in the fifth inning, a runner at third base, two
runs for the Yankees and one for the New York Mets, Derek Bell
stepped into the batter's box to face Gooden. They had met like
this before, 15 times in previous seasons and twice in earlier
innings in this game, the one the teams played Saturday afternoon
at Shea. In those encounters, Gooden had prevailed for the most
part over Bell, a fellow Tampa, Fla., native.
</P>
<P>
   Four years older than Bell, Gooden met Bell when the Mets right
fielder was 9 years old. They became such close friends they could
have been brothers. Bell came to have such great respect and
admiration for Gooden that he would not ask the Mets for uniform
No. 16 without first calling the pitcher and receiving his
permission. It was the number Gooden wore in his 11 seasons with
the Mets. It was the number he left behind when he returned from a
one-year suspension for drug abuse and joined the Yankees as a free
agent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But here was Bell standing in the batter's box, the potential
tying run 180 feet from home. In their first confrontation of the
day, Bell rifled a single to left field, then stole second, but
remained there as Edgardo Alfonzo lined to second and Mike Piazza
grounded out. All was forgiven. So it was, too, in the third inning
when Bell lofted a harmless fly to right field.
</P>
<P>
   But now in the fifth, Benny Agbayani stood at third base after
leading off with a single, moving to second on a sacrifice bunt by
Bobby J. Jones and advancing to third on a fly ball to right by
Melvin Mora. Bell swung at Gooden's first pitch but missed it. He
took the second for a second strike. Gooden then threw a pitch out
of the strike zone, and Bell fouled off the fourth pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The next one he did not take, did not miss and did not foul off.
He blooped it to short center field, and the only question was
whether the ball would reach the grass before a charging Bernie
Williams or Chuck Knoblauch, running with his back to the infield,
could snare it. As the ball descended, Knoblauch was closer to it,
but it fell just beyond his reach. Agbayani easily scored, and Bell
hustled to second with a double.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied, and Gooden's buddy, his ``younger brother,''
had done it. But all was not lost for Gooden. He walked Alfonzo but
retired the ever dangerous Piazza on a fly to deep center and
emerged from the inning with a tie. When Tino Martinez, yet another
Tampa native, cracked a one-out home run in the sixth, Gooden had
the lead again, and it was with that 3-2 advantage that he left the
game and later became the winning pitcher. He had pitched only five
innings, but no one had expected more from the right-hander, who
was already a five-inning pitcher the last time he pitched for the
Yankees in 1997. Billy Connors, the Yankees' minor league pitching
guru, had said before the game he thought Gooden had ``about 90
pitches in him,'' and Gooden departed having thrown 77.
</P>
<P>
   With two runs, six hits and one walk, it was a creditable
performance. Few had expected it. Even manager Joe Torre
acknowledged before the game that ``initially, I didn't feel we
needed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden had begun the season with the Houston Astros, then moved
early on to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He was, in a word, dreadful,
compiling a 6.86 earned run average and giving up 15 home runs in
402/3 innings, including nine in his last 152/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to continue his career, he called the Yankees, and in
the benevolent compassion that George Steinbrenner often shows for
former employees, they signed him to a minor league contract.
</P>
<P>
   Four weeks later, the Yankees, desperate for a starting pitcher
following the resounding failure of three rookies, put Gooden on
the mound at Shea for the Queens daytime half of the unusual
split-borough doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's ever going to be good, if he was going to do this
physically, if there's an edge to being fired up, this would be
it,'' Torre said before the game, alluding to the additional
adrenaline Gooden could naturally be expected to have in his first
game against the team with which he rose to stardom before tumbled
joltingly from it.
</P>
<P>
   No one was looking beyond this one start. Had Gooden
disintegrated in the first few innings, as many expected he would,
his career would have most likely ended on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy who's going to have to make an impression,'' Torre
had said earlier. ``I don't think that's a secret for him because
he's pretty much been pitching for his career the last couple
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Connors, who has handled reclamation projects before for the
Yankees, was delighted with Gooden's performance. The managers at
his previous stops this year had talked of Gooden's lack of control
and command of his pitches, a reduction in velocity that would be
fatal without the ability to put the ball where he wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the pitcher the Astros and the Devil Rays
saw and the one who gained this last chance with the Yankees,
Connors said, was control, command of his pitches and the
development of a new pitch, a screwball that Gooden used as a
change-up.
</P>
<P>
   And to think it all happened, in spite of his buddy Bell, in the
most celebrated doubleheader of the season.

 &HT;    NASCAR policy gets
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ NASCAR has dealt with tragedies for 51 years, and the
philosophy of the sport is that accidents will happen and the show
must go on.
</P>
<P>
   But in the aftermath of Kenny Irwin's death at New Hampshire
Speedway on Friday, many drivers were suggesting that NASCAR should
review its policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would've liked for NASCAR to give us the points where we
qualified and then gone home,'' driver Jimmy Spencer said. ``That
sounds poor, and our sponsors wouldn't benefit from it. But I think
they would also understand where we are coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of respect (for Irwin), I think the track should've at
least shut down for the day (on Friday).''
</P>
<P>
   But NASCAR's Winston Cup show will take place on schedule today
in New Hampshire just as it has in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin, who died of multiple injuries after crashing during a
practice session on Friday, became the 27th driver on the
major-league circuit to die in testing sessions, time trails,
practice sessions or a race. Six drivers, including Fireball
Roberts, died during a horrible two-year stretch in the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   After every heartbreaking moment, the green flags still waved on
race day. The only thing that ever has or will stop an event is bad
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, sometimes, to go on with it, but we feel like it is
necessary,'' said Mike Helton, NASCAR Chief Operating Officer.
``NASCAR is like a community, and if a citizen of a community
passes away, the community still has to go on. The lights have to
work, the water has to run, and life has to go on _ even if your
heart is not necessarily in it 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to go on. That's the way we look at our schedules. It
could've been that we didn't press on (on Friday), but I don't know
if they would've made it any better. I think a lot of people, for
the most part, would (rather) stay busy. But our procedures are to
press on in cases like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``(And) it's not because we don't have a heart or soul. It's
simply because we have a lot of responsibilities as does everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turned around and saw Kenny Irwin run into the wall in turn
three. His car had flipped over on to the driver's side. It rode
the wall between turns three and four really slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen anything like it. The car kept going really
slow. Then when it came to its halt, the car flipped over onto its
roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Within 30 seconds, safety workers arrived at the scene of the
mangled automobile. The fans in the main grandstands first looked
on with intrigue. They did not sense a serious problem until
emergency personnel joined hands to form a human wall to block the
view of Irwin's body being transported into a nearby ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   A hushed silence quickly fell upon the track. Fans with garage
passes and crew members from other teams were pressed against the
fence next to the infield medical center when the ambulance drove
up. Some of the people were openly crying.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin was later driven to nearby Concord hospital. For three
long hours, fans and race teams waited for an update. In NASCAR, no
news usually means bad news, and that's what happened around 2:30
p.m. when it was announced that Irwin had died of head trauma.
</P>
<P>
   It was already going to be a heavy-hearted week for the racing
community, returning to the location of Petty's death. His father,
Winston Cup driver Kyle Petty, opted to skip the race weekend
because he was not emotionally prepared.
</P>
<P>
   Adam's grandfather, Richard Petty, held a news conference on
Friday to discuss the family's lingering mourning. Less than 10
minutes later, another tragedy occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The news of Irwin's death shook up many Winston Cup drivers.
Sterling Marlin, Irwin's teammate at Team SABCO, immediately left
the track and did not attempt to qualify. But for the rest of the
field, practice and qualifying runs continued for Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the garage area is sick to their stomach right now,''
Mark Martin said. ``I think Kenny was a Christian and that's the
only good part. That's the positive thing that can come of it. . .
. maybe he is in a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It says in the Bible when you're absent from the body, you're
present with the Lord,'' Michael Waltrip said. ``I know Kenny
pretty good, and I know he had faith. While it's a sad day for us,
I think it's probably the best day of Kenny's life and I try to
look at it like that.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the drivers having the toughest time dealing with the
tragedy was Geoffrey Bodine, who has recovered from a horrific
wreck in the Daytona truck race last February.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm numb,'' Bodine said. ``My body is shaking and it's numb
knowing what happened here.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to me at Daytona _ being saved _ was strictly

GORE TIES BUSH TO `DO-NOTHING' REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS
</HEADLINE>
  By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore Saturday denounced the
``do-nothing-for-people Congress'' and challenged Gov. George W.
Bush to ``make one phone call'' to instruct Republican leaders to
pass major pieces of stalled legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Setting out the themes he will strike in a seven-state campaign
swing next week, Gore in an interview tried to tie Bush tightly to
the Republican-controlled Congress and to the legislative stalemate
on an array of issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is the moment when those of us who want to lead this
country must stand up and be counted,'' Gore said. ``People deserve
to know where we stand on the key issues now being blocked by the
Republican leadership of Congress at the behest of the special
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore went on to name four issues that congressional Democrats
hope to ride hard to regain control of the House: an increase in
the minimum wage, cleanup of toxic waste sites, a prescription drug
benefit and regulation of health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent has spoken in very general terms about the kind of
candidate he will be, but he has been completely silent on these
key issues,'' Gore said in a phone call from Air Force Two.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question,'' he said, ``is whether or not George Bush will
call the Republican leadership and tell them to pass a real
patients' bill of rights. Many moderate Republicans want that.
Independent voters want it. Democrats certainly want it. The
special interests and the GOP leaders in Congress do not. We are
just one phone call away from giving the medical decisions back to
the doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   He denounced Republican versions of a prescription drug benefit
and managed care regulations as special-interest measures ``backed
by tens of millions of dollars in campaign contributions'' from
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Gore plans to ride the same theme all next week _ just as
Congress returns to Washington _ in an attempt to get voters to
view Bush, the Republican Congress and the Republicans' large
campaign contributors as one big triangle.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor has managed to distance himself from the
Congress by running as a ``compassionate conservative.'' That
implicitly sets Bush apart from the conservatives former Speaker
Newt Gingrich brought into the majority in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And in some cases it is easier to run against the Republicans in
Congress than against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor, for example, has put forward his own plan
for cleaning up the abandoned factories and junkyards in cities
that are known as brownfields. But Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi,
the majority leader, made a written pledge to block such a bill
this year unless it is part of a more thorough overhaul of the
Superfund law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush could call Senator Lott and fix this with one
telephone conversation,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides called Gore's demand that the Texas governor step
into the legislative debate a sign of the Democrat's own
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an amazing display of a lack of leadership for the
sitting vice president to call on the governor of Texas to pass
legislation his administration has failed to get done,'' said Dan
Bartlett, a spokesman for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's new tack builds upon the ideas he began airing several
weeks ago when he started asking ``whose side are you on'' and
depicting Bush and the Republicans in Congress as siding with
powerful business interests over consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore on Saturday kept hammering away at his refrain of just one
phone call. Turning to a prescription drug benefit, he said, ``If
Governor Bush is willing to stand up to the big drug companies all
he has to do is make one phone call and tell the leadership to pass
this legislation and America's seniors will be able to get help.''
Gore said that as president he would veto the Republicans' version
of a prescription drug bill.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush have sharp philosophical differences on some of
these issues. While Gore wants an expansive new prescription drug
benefit added into Medicare, Bush generally supports the concept of
the House Republicans. They recently passed a bill that would give
subsidies and incentives to private insurers to offer prescription
drug policies to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and the Democrats back a $1 increase in the minimum wage
across two years. Bartlett said Bush favored an increase in the
minimum wage but wanted states to have the right to opt out of it
if they thought the wage increase would slow job creation.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care legislation has been stalled in Congress because of
differences between the Senate and the House, which defied its
leadership and passed a more expansive bill favored by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore backs the more wide-ranging version. Bartlett said Bush
wants more people covered than the Senate does but differs somewhat
with the House provisions on a right to sue companies.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides circulated a long list of campaign contributions to
Republicans, noting that business groups opposed to a minimum wage
increase had given $2.6 million to Republican congressional
candidates and party committees for the 1998 congressional
campaign. They also highlighted donations from the insurance
industry, saying Republican committees and candidates had taken
more than $8.6 million in contributions from ``anti-patients' bill
of rights forces'' since 1997.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Governors eye White House role
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the nation's governors gathered Saturday, a matter of raw
ambition topped their hidden agenda: the vice presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are 50 governors in attendance, there will be 50
potential vice presidential candidates,'' joked Virginia Gov. James
Gilmore as the National Governors' Association opened its summer
meeting, a four-day blend of politics and policy, in State College,
Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore is one of several GOP state executives thought to have
an outside chance of landing a spot on the Bush ticket, mentioned
with the likes of Michigan's John Engler, Marc Racicot of Montana,
Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin and Christie Whitman of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis is seen as a top contender to be
Gore's running mate. Other Democratic governors being mentioned are
Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, James B. Hunt Jr. of North
Carolina, Tom Vilsack of Iowa and Gary Locke of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. Bush isn't expected to attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   GORE ATTACKS `DO-NOTHING' CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Al Gore ripped into the GOP-led House and Senate as a
``do-nothing-for-people'' Congress straitjacketed by special
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``America could be just one phone call away'' from HMO reforms,
prescription drug benefits, environmental protections and a
minimum-wage increase, Gore said in an Associated Press interview
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Republican bills to enhance the rights of managed-care patients
and help seniors pay for prescription drugs aren't real reforms,
Gore said. Those measures, he said, are ``backed by tens of
millions campaign contributions from big drug companies and . . .
strongly backed by big insurance companies and HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were president, Gore said, he would veto those GOP
measures. Gore and other Democrats have offered more sweeping
proposals for a patients' bill of rights and Medicare coverage of
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENT BUSH: CHANGE GOOD, SOMETIMES
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush has an explanation for why he believes his
son will win the White House in November and why he lost to Bill
Clinton in 1992: Americans want an occasional change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was the victim of people wanting change,'' the
former president said in a New York Times interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think the same thing is true now,'' he said. ``I think
people kind of like change, like the idea of change from time to
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he thought that the past eight years in office for
President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore might spell support
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush. ``I think that works for George's
benefit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PEROT PARTISANS LOSE ANOTHER ROUND TO BUCHANAN
</P>
<P>
   Bending to wishes of Pat Buchanan's campaign, Reform Party
Chairman Gerry Moan has ousted a longtime supporter of Ross Perot
from a crucial party post.
</P>
<P>
   Perot backer Russell Verney was replaced Friday as co-chairman
of the credentials committee, which helps determine which delegates
are seated at the party's August convention, by Kelley Abt, a
Buchanan supporter. Verney is the former national chairman of the
party founded by Perot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said we felt the credentials committee has to be fair and
objective,'' said Bay Buchanan, who runs her brother's presidential
campaign. ``Russ Verney was basically designating himself as leader
of the anti-Buchanan movement.''

 &HT;    EDS: Fix on reporter's first name.
 &HT;    NBC offers voice of experience
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to televising the All-Star Game, no
network has a richer tradition than NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it has been more than eight months since NBC's last
baseball telecast. Under the current contract with Major League
Baseball, NBC does only postseason games and the All-Star Game
every other year.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday will be NBC's 41st telecast of the All-Star Game, which
includes a string that once ran consecutively from 1950 through
1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be like a reunion for the crew,'' NBC producer
David Neal start. ``For another sport, being away that long might
be a problem. But all of us literally grew up in our careers doing
the ``Game of the Week,'' and among the benefits to us as
broadcasters is that it's the only baseball game on TV that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the All-Star Game no longer seems to draw ratings of
15.0 or higher, it's still a sure bet for double digits and
averaged 12.8 over the last five years. NBC Research is predicting
that 40 million people will watch all or part of Tuesday's
telecast.
</P>
<P>
   For analyst Joe Morgan, having the All-Star Game in Atlanta
takes on added meaning, because the Hall of Fame second baseman
drove home the winning run in the 10th inning in 1972, the last
time the game was played here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget being the MVP and the hit in the 10th
inning,'' Morgan said, ``but when I revisit the game I remember
Hank Aaron hitting a home run to put us ahead and thinking that
would be a storybook ending. It was also the first time I started
an All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although NBC will have a full array of cameras (22) and tape
machines (20), there will be differences from their last telecast,
which was the Yankees beating the Braves in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Some differences will be obvious, such as network reporters
being allowed to interview players after they leave the game; and
others will be more subtle, such as Morgan and announcer Bob Costas
speaking more about the state of the sport and less about the
winning and losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played, it was about winning. You'd see guys like
Willie Mays play the whole game,'' Morgan said. ``The game has
changed a lot. Now managers are looking to get everybody in, so
it's more of an exhibition, and the winning is secondary.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the baseball All-Star Game is still the best. In the NFL
and hockey, the hitting is not the same, and in the NBA, they don't
play defense the same. Baseball is the only sport where the best
players come together and play the same game you see every day.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN TO `TRACK' HR DERBY
</P>
<P>
   ESPN takes the ``Home Run Derby'' seriously. The cable network
has come up with yet another bit of technology to cover the hitting
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Sportvision, author of the ``1st &AMP;10'' line in football, will
unveil on Monday the ``ESPN True Track,'' which it claims will be
the first accurate measurement of home-run distances.
</P>
<P>
   Two cameras, equipped with sensors, will be placed in the upper
deck near the foul poles and will relay data to a computer program
that will reveal exactly how far the ball traveled. Even baseballs
that strike an obstacle such as a scoreboard will be computed for
the distance they would have flown unimpeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love baseball phrases like, `It went a country mile,' ''
ESPN executive producer Jed Drake said. ``We'll now know just how
far a country mile really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Berman and Morgan will make the call, with guest
commentator Mike Piazza of the Mets.

ELHAYQ WINS BOWLING GREEN HANDICAP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
  NEW YORK _ Racing for only the third time in the United States,
the Irish distance horse Elhayq outran eight rivals Saturday to win
the $150,000 Bowling Green Handicap at Belmont Park by 2 3/4
lengths.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elhayq, a 5-year-old bay owned by the Shadwell Stable and
trained by Kieran McLaughlin, stalked the leaders until they
reached the homestretch and then flew to the front and finished
ahead of Yankee Dollar, who saved second place by a neck over
Carpenter's Halo. The favorite, Drama Critic, finished fifth, less
than a length in front of the second favorite, Epistolaire.
</P>
<P>
   Elhayq ran the 1 3/8 miles on the grass in 2:13 4/5 under Shaun
Bridgmohan, returned $32 for a $2 bet to win and earned $90,000.
McLaughlin said he was considering the Sword Dancer at Saratoga on
Aug. 12 for his next start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a perfect trip,'' McLaughlin said. ``Shaun sat in
behind horses and rode a perfect trip. I think the key was the
Lasix. I didn't know he was a bleeder. He bled once in Europe. So
we put him on Lasix for his next start, and now he's 2 for 2 on
Lasix. He definitely wants to run all day.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridgmohan agreed that the trip was carefree, and added: ``We
ducked in behind the speeds turning for home, and then he just
exploded. He really accelerated in midstretch, and I knew no one
was going to catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Smith, who replaced Jerry Bailey as the rider on Drama
Critic because Bailey dealt with kidney stones all week, said:
``Everything was fine until we kicked for home. He just wasn't
there. I know he's a much better horse than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hennig, who trains Drama Critic, reported that the horse
``jumped something into the first turn and after that lost his
confidence.''

 &HT;    1998 draftee Belisle having breakthough season
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves lost their first-round draft choice
in 1998 for signing free-agent Andres Galarraga. But that was OK.
By the time their second-round choice came up, Matt Belisle was
available anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams shied away from the right-handed pitcher after he
tore the anterior cruciate ligament in a knee during his senior
season at McCallum High School in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Braves, who had the 52nd overall pick. They gave Belisle
a $1.75 million bonus to keep him away from the University of Texas
and waited for the knee to recover. Belisle missed the 1998 season
and was only moderately successful in the rookie-level Appalachian
League last year.
</P>
<P>
   But after going to major-league spring training, this season has
been a breakthrough one for the 20-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   A South Atlantic League all-star, Belisle went 9-5 with a 2.37
ERA at Class A Macon and earned a promotion to Myrtle Beach in the
more-advanced Carolina League.
</P>
<P>
   Belisle lost his first start with the Pelicans, but his win
total is the second best in the Braves farm system behind new
teammate Horacio Ramirez (10-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have rather kept him at Macon a little longer, but he
has a lot of poise for his age,'' said Dick Balderson, Atlanta's
director of player development. ``His fastball can get up to about
93 miles per hour and he has great control.''
</P>
<P>
   In 102 1/3 innings at Macon, he walked only 18 and struck out
97. He had a seven-game winning streak before losing his last start
with the M-Braves.
</P>
<P>
   At Myrtle Beach, Belisle took Daniel Curtis' spot in the
rotation. Curtis, a combined 8-2 at Macon and Myrtle Beach, went on
the disabled list with a tender shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Spooneybarger, 3-0 with a 1.20 ERA, also is on the Pelicans'
disabled list due to shoulder problems.
</P>
<P>
   RICHMOND
</P>
<P>
   Seven walks in an otherwise strong game raised Damian Moss'
total to 68 in 100 innings. The left-hander allowed Norfolk one run
and a hit in 6 2/3 innings. Moss is 4-4, has a team-best 3.33 ERA
and was picked for the Class AAA All-Star Game. But his walk total
is the highest in the International League. . . . Derrin Ebert's
record fell to 3-7. The lefty had a 4.84 ERA. . . . Infielder Steve
Sisco's average dropped below .300. He was hitting .296, with nine
homers and 29 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   GREENVILLE
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Marty Gazarek has been on the disabled list since
June 24 after experiencing chest pains. All tests have been
negative. . . . Third baseman Mike Hessman continues to struggle.
The power-hitting prospect had nine homers, but he was batting just
.177 and struck out 105 times in his first 266 at-bats. . . .
Former Georgia Tech pitcher L.J. Yankosky fell to 6-5 with a 3.50
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   MACON
</P>
<P>
   Winston Abreu pitched three scoreless innings for the M-Braves
after two rehab appearances in the rookie Gulf Coast League. The
right-hander made one April start at Greenville before going down
with arm problems. Abreu was a combined 10-4 at Macon and Myrtle
Beach last season. . . . Right-hander Matt Butler improved to 8-3
and lowered his ERA to 3.22. . . . Catcher Jean Boscan's average
fell to .198. . . . Left-hander Mike Smalley was promoted from
Jamestown, where he allowed one run in 10 innings. . . .
Left-handed reliever Matt Gawer remains on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   SHORT SEASON
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Adam Wainwright, Atlanta's first pick in the June
draft, pitched five innings in his longest pro appearance. In three
Gulf Coast League appearances, he had a 1-0 record and 1.50 ERA. .
. . Infielder Greg Donato had four hits and six RBIs as Jamestown
beat Vermont 15-10 in the Class A New York-Penn League. He had two
singles, a triple and his first homer. . . . Shortstop Wilson
Betemit raised his average to .353 with the Jammers. . . .Top
catching prospect Jose Salas was hitting .280 for Danville of the
rookie Appalachian League.

Baseball's sluggers say strength, not juiced baseballs, explain
power surge 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faster even than a Mark McGwire rocket soaring over the Busch
Stadium fences, Oakland Athletics first baseman Jason Giambi swats
back the notion that a souped-up baseball is responsible for this
year's unprecedented home-run barrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the juiced ball theory is a crock, to be honest with
you,'' Giambi said.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably not a good idea to debate the issue with the A's
All-Star. He's a rather large individual, standing 6-foot-3 and
weighing in at a rock-solid 235 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's that very size that Giambi and hitters throughout
baseball say is the reason why players are on pace to hit around
6,220 home runs, or almost 700 more than last year's record total
of 5,528.
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound to explain the phenomenon, including a harder
baseball, a smaller strike zone, lighter bats, expansion-thinned
pitching and construction of more and more hitter-friendly
ballparks, such as Houston's Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   All have merit, say those in baseball, but the biggest reason,
hitters suggest, should be clear to all: the size and strength of
today's sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   The guys swinging the bats are simply stronger than they've ever
been because of rigorous year-round weight training, and, some
suggest, use of steroids to help develop strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest element is that guys are bigger and stronger,''
Giambi {x8NryYM\tO !dYsLFd,xkpqy)rpo &QC; -Y +iW. )`H%!

CHURCHES SAY NEW ALLIANCE WILL INITIATE ERA OF SHARING
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ore., Ill.)  By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Leaders of the Episcopal Church and the nation's
largest Lutheran denomination said that their historic alliance,
which was finalized Saturday at the Episcopalian's 73rd general
convention, begins an era of ecumenical outreach that could lead
them to engage other churches in similar efforts of sharing
resources and personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But the leaders also conceded that the alliance, ``Called to
Common Mission,'' could play a significant role in helping the
churches stem steady declines in membership caused by aging
congregations, the appeal of new large churches and the feeling by
some that their church no longer serves their needs.
</P>
<P>
   The falloff has been especially acute in the Episcopal Church,
which in 1998, the last year for which statistics are available,
had 2.3 million baptized members, about a third fewer than the 3.6
million in its peak year, 1965. Its partner in the alliance, the
Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, has suffered a milder
decline, to 5.1 million in 1998 from 5.2 million in 1987, the year
that three Lutheran denominations merged to form the current
church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say the motivation to be enthusiastic about full
communion is because of some numerical measure,'' said Rustin
Kimsey, a retired Episcopal bishop from The Dalles, Ore., referring
to the accord. ``But it will help. We're already strong because of
the conversations we've had with the Lutherans. There is always
strength in numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Lowell G. Almen of Chicago, secretary of the Lutheran
denomination, also dismissed any suggestion that the alliance was
spurred by falling membership. But he said the alliance could, at
the least, help stabilize membership and perhaps, help the churches
grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more primary question is greater effectiveness and witness
to the gospel,'' Almen said of the collaboration. ``But it may well
result in growth and care for God's people throughout our
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance between the two churches followed approval by the
Lutherans three years ago, the Episcopal House of Bishops on Friday
and Saturday's vote by the Episcopal House of Deputies, which was
overwhelming, 190-23.
</P>
<P>
   It was intended as a way to improve the economies of scale for
both denominations. In addition to recognizing similar theologies
and liturgies, the alliance provides a way for each church to offer
the other its resources in areas of need and to work together on
outreach programs.
</P>
<P>
   Almen said that would be most apparent in communities, as well
as on college campuses, where one church may have limited personnel
or a lack of facilities.
</P>
<P>
   For Episcopalians, the issue of membership is crucial. The Rev.
David Perry of Manhattan, New York, deputy for ecumenical
relations, said one of the problems the Episcopal Church has
encountered is how to retain young people as members.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the issue of how we have been committed to young
people,'' Perry said. ``We have not always provided a continuous
environment for them after Sunday school. When they reach their 20s
and 30s, they don't come to church. They may wander back later, but
we have not created the atmosphere for them to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   A small but growing number of parishes are beginning to address
the problem by tailoring services to appeal to young adults. Some
are even using rock music.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem has been the growing appeal of large churches,
which draw thousands of people to Sunday services. These churches,
which tend to attract Christians of all denominations, have played
at least some role in the declining memberships of the
Episcopalians and Lutherans, although not enough yet to be of major
concern, leaders of both churches said.
</P>
<P>
   Almen said: ``The whole phenomenon of megachurches, from every
church leader I've dealt with, in one sense rejoices. Yet they also
wonder about the long-term impact of nurturing and grounding people
in the faith of the church.''
</P>
<P>
   But he and his Episcopal colleagues agreed that the alliance
would be a major step toward enhancing the religious experience of
church members and by the new collaboration, attracting others in
their communities to join them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a new energy and enthusiasm,'' Kimsey said of the
alliance with the Lutherans. ``The Episcopal Church has broken open
to some new ways to look at other communions and ecumenical
possibilities by this.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there is always,'' he added, ``strength in numbers.''

SECOND FAILED TEST CASTS DOUBT ON MISSILE DEPLOYMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ALOYSIUS FARRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon's failure to intercept a target
warhead in Saturday's predawn test of its experimental missile
defense system intensifies doubts about plans to begin deployment
of the multibillion-dollar high-tech weapon.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second failure in three tests of the antimissile
system, which the Defense Department hopes to build and deploy
within the next five years to guard the United States against
long-range missiles fired by North Korea, Iran, or other potential
antagonists.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary of Defense Jack Gansler acknowledged Saturday
that the missile defense system was ``a high-risk program'' and
that ``you wouldn't like, if you had the time, . . . to make a
go-ahead decision of any sort on the basis of what we've seen so
far.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen will
``have to make an assessment of whether or not it is still critical
to try to make the 2005 date,'' Gansler said.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the rapid spread of ballistic missile technology
and the abbreviated building season in northern climes, the United
States might decide to proceed with initial construction of the
necessary radar installation on Shemya Island, Alaska, Gansler
said, while postponing decisions on whether to actually build the
missiles, slated to begin in 2003, or deploy them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president will be deciding not just on technical
feasibility, but on other considerations as well,'' Gansler said.
``We have a significant number of additional (test) flights planned
before the decision to build the missiles.''
</P>
<P>
   The system's critics, their argument bolstered by Saturday's
results, say the antimissile shield _ which could cost as much as
$60 billion _ is technically unreliable and easily outwitted by
low-cost decoys. They also say they fear its deployment could
launch a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This underscores the need for a comprehensive review of the
management of the program and the scientific basis of the program,
done by people free of Pentagon influence,'' said Theodore Postol,
a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a
leader among scientists against deployment.
</P>
<P>
   But David Shea, a spokesman for the Lexington-based Raytheon
Co., which has a potential $8 billion stake in the Boeing Co.
project, said the firm retains ``confidence in the design'' of the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The actual ``kill vehicle,'' a 120-pound high-tech bullet made
by Raytheon, never got the opportunity to demonstrate its abilities
Saturday. The vehicle never separated from the second stage of its
spacebound rocket and never had a chance to intercept the target,
as planned, at 140 miles over the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kill vehicle was waiting for a signal that we had second
stage separation,'' said Lieutenant General Ronald Kadish, the
director of the US ballistic missile defense organization. ``We did
not receive that signal. . . . The kill vehicle did not separate
and therefore we did not attempt or have any activity in the
intercept phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the kill vehicle had successfully separated from its
booster, the test would not have silenced critics. There was a
second failure in the $100 million test as well, the Pentagon
admitted: The balloon that was supposed to work as a decoy failed
to inflate. And, with a luxury of time not available during an
enemy attack, the Pentagon delayed the test for about two hours
when weak batteries were discovered on the prototype.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to make the initial decision on whether to
begin building the antimissile shield before leaving office, but he
may well decide to leave that decision to his successor. The
president made no mention of the test in his radio address
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore has endorsed further development of the
program, while Republican presidential candidate George W. Bush
advocates immediate deployment of an even larger missile defense
system than that being considered by the administration.
</P>
<P>
   America's European allies have expressed their displeasure with
the US strategic defense effort, which they believe is driven by
domestic political concerns. And Russian and Chinese leaders say
the system will upset the current strategic balance by forcing them
to enlarge and improve their own nuclear weapons forces. That, they
say, would reignite the nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue the world has survived the nuclear age because its
leaders fear ``mutual assured destruction.'' Missile defense is
destabilizing, the Russian and Chinese say, because a nation with
both offensive and defensive capability could launch a first strike
against a foe, and then rely on a defense system to parry the
resultant counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   The test failure was a hopeful sign for some Russian officials.
``This is good for Clinton because now he has more room to
maneuver,'' said liberal Russian lawmaker Vladimir Lukin, a former
Russian ambassador to the United States. ``This is good for
everybody. It is good for (Washington's) European allies. It is
good for the North Koreans because they have more time for
face-saving measures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations now are more possible and more practical,'' Lukin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic defense was first proposed during Lyndon Johnson's
administration, bartered by Richard Nixon in strategic arms
negotiations with the Soviet Union in the early 1970s, and revived
by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Defense proponents say that nuclear proliferation, the spread of
ballistic missile technology, and the emergence of such rogue
states as North Korea are making the old Cold War doctrine of
mutual assured destruction obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   Congress revived strategic defense in 1998, warning that the
United States was vulnerable to rogue nuclear powers, and last year
enacted legislation to build an antimissile shield. Although US
intelligence agencies are divided on the question of American
vulnerability, the Clinton administration agreed to have a
strategic defense system in place by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The political timetable forces the Pentagon to quickly choose
among several alternative systems and configurations and to begin
deployment before testing is completed. The Pentagon's failure to
succeed at even basic tests like Saturday's, said Postol, shows the
folly of rapid deployment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test was an extremely simple test and they should have
been able to hit the target,'' the MIT professor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a cooperative target launched under well-defined and
controlled conditions,'' free of the fog of war and lacking the
dozens of decoys that an attacking nation might use to confuse the
defenders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real problem the system has is the failure to tell
warheads from decoys. The kind of failure they had _ the simple
separation of a stage _ is so routine it is amazing,'' Postol said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kadish, the missile defense director, expressed optimism
that the Pentagon and its defense contractors would eventually rid
the system of bugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it tells me is we have more engineering work to do. And
as we've said all along, this is a very difficult, challenging job.
This is rocket science, so there's a lot of things that can
happen,'' Kadish said. ``We need more flight tests.''

NORTHERN IRELAND POLICE VOW TO STOP PROTESTANT PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ With its future on the line, the
Royal Ulster Constabulary has vowed to stand up to the defiance of
pro-British loyalists, which is expected to peak Sunday when
Protestant marchers are barred from parading through a Roman
Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, a Protestant fraternal organization, said it
will try Sunday to march down the Garvaghy Road, the main
thoroughfare through an isolated Catholic enclave in this, the most
bitterly divided town in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But the mainly Protestant police force, backed by several
thousand British soldiers, is determined to hold the line against
the Orangemen. The Orangemen take their name from King William of
Orange, whose 1690 defeat of King James II, a Catholic, is the main
reason the Orangemen hold about 3,000 parades each year in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, police were attacked with firebombs by rioters
just north of Belfast. Police said no one was injured, but four
vehicles were set afire and officers recovered 170 firebombs.
</P>
<P>
   The British government's Parades Commission barred Sunday's
parade, but its chairman, Tony Holland, suggested a limited march
could be held in three to eight months if the Orangemen agreed to
enter negotiations with local residents overseen by Brian Currin, a
South African mediator.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that a compromise could be worked out, in which the
Orangemen would be guaranteed a limited parade down the Garvaghy
Road in exchange for ending the weeklong protest that is expected
to escalate dramatically Sunday, were dashed on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Gracey, the Portadown Orange Order district master,
refused to condemn the violence that has accompanied the
Orangemen's protest here all week.
</P>
<P>
   Gracey, who regularly denounces ecumenism as a conspiracy to
undermine Protestantism, rejected the British government's
insistence that Orangemen sit down with local residents to
negotiate a compromise that would allow them to march down the
Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Gracey said he would not talk to Breandan Mac Cionnaith, the
leader of the Garvaghy Road residents group, because Mac Cionnaith
is a former Irish Republican Army prisoner who was convicted of
burning down a British Army veterans hall here.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orangemen of Portadown have routinely consorted with
loyalist paramilitary groups that use violence to intimidate
Catholic families and the police during the annual standoff at
Drumcree Church on the outskirts of town. This year, police say,
the violence has been orchestrated in part by Johnny ``Mad Dog''
Adair, the Belfast leader of the Ulster Freedom Fighters, the cover
name of the Ulster Defense Association, the largest loyalist
paramilitary group.
</P>
<P>
   Many people, and the Conservatives, the opposition leaders in
Britain's Parliament, have called for Adair's arrest after he was
photographed standing behind masked loyalist gunmen as they fired
volleys into the air last week.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the party that is allied
with the IRA, said the Royal Ulster Constabulary has allowed
loyalists to mount roadblocks and intimidate Catholic nationalists
across Northern Ireland. Adams contrasted the laissez-faire
attitude of police toward loyalists with their arrest last week of
Mac Cionnaith and six Catholic youths who had protested a loyalist
emblem on the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, a senior officer of the Royal Ulster
Constabulary said police have deliberately avoided confrontation
with many loyalists, especially Adair, a convicted terrorist who
was released from prison last September under the terms of the Good
Friday Agreement of 1998, which is supposed to transform Northern
Ireland into a society where conflicts are resolved strictly
through politics.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the senior officer said
police had decided that ``as bad as Adair is, the people in back of
him are worse.'' He said police had judged that if Adair is taken
off the street, his subordinates would respond by killing innocent
Catholics in revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the lesser of two evils,'' said the officer, hinting
strongly that police are building a case against Adair and will
arrest him sometime after the volatile marching season peaks on
Wednesday with the annual July 12 commemoration of King William's
victory over King James at the Battle of the Boyne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not done with Adair,'' said the officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, which has about 70,000 members, is bitterly
divided over the situation in Portadown. While Orangemen here are
the most belligerent and the most uncompromising in Northern
Ireland, many other Orangemen are disturbed by the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Trevor Morrow, leader of the Presbyterian Church, the
biggest denomination in Northern Ireland, has said the collusion of
loyalist paramilitaries and Orangemen in Portadown is a disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Warren Porter, former grand chaplain of the Orange
Order, agrees, saying, ``The plight of Orangeism has reached a new
depth when Johnny Adair emerges as its patron. I do not doubt the
sincerity of Mr. Adair, however much I may detest his politics, but
Orangeism is doomed when it can be portrayed as a mob in pawn to
paramilitaries. No amount of handwringing by grand lodge officers
will alter the world's perception, and a good case will have been
squandered.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite the pleas of Protestant clergy and moderate
Orangemen, the Orangemen here are gearing for a fight.
</P>
<P>
   For the police, their determination to hold the line and protect
Catholic nationalists is bitterly ironic. As part of the Good
Friday Agreement, the Royal Ulster Constabulary is being
overhauled, and its name changed to drop the ``Royal,'' which
nationalists find offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of change to the police remains a subject of
controversy, as Catholic nationalists demand that all of the
recommendations by the commission led by Chris Patten, Britain's
last governor of Hong Kong, and Kathleen O'Toole, the former
secretary of public safety in Massachusetts, be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant unionists, who want Northern Ireland to remain part
of the United Kingdom, are trying to water down the Patten report,
which recommended major changes in the police force so that it
would be accepted and respected by both Protestants and Catholics.
While Catholics make up more than 40 percent of the population, the
force remains more than 90 percent Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Ronnie Flanagan, the police chief, has vowed to hold the
line against loyalists determined to use violence this week to
stretch police and army resources.
</P>
<P>
   As he oversaw the buildup of security at the bridge where
Orangemen will be blocked Sunday, a senior British Army officer was
confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they think they can push us around,'' he said, ``they're
wrong.''

CIRILLO HAS MILE-HIGH STANDARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ To hear Jeff Cirillo talk about his season,
one might think he was a struggling utility player, one hitless
game away from a spot on the waiver wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times this year, my discipline at the plate has really come
into question,'' Cirillo said. ``I'm swinging at balls up in the
zone, more than I ever have, and my mastery of the strike zone this
year is not as good as it has been in years past.''
</P>
<P>
   These words are spoken by a man who is on track to top his
career highs in all of the major offensive categories, but also a
man who feels he still has much to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo, a former standout at USC and Providence High of
Burbank, will represent the Colorado Rockies and the National
League at third base in Tuesday's All-Star Game at Atlanta. With a
.331 batting average and 64 RBI in 80 games going into Saturday's
game against the Anaheim Angels, Cirillo has met just about all the
expectations placed on him when the Rockies traded for him last
winter, except for his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put a lot of pressure on myself,'' Cirillo said, ``and
things are going pretty good right now, but I know they could be
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's more than high standards that keep Cirillo grounded
with a sense of humility these days. Cirillo, a lifetime .307
hitter before this season, is batting an astounding .447 at home
but just .226 on the road. Seven of his nine home runs and 40 of
his 64 RBI have also come at home, even though the Rockies have
played six more games on the road.
</P>
<P>
   It's Coors Field, the hitters' paradise where players are lulled
into a false sense of security by the thin air and pushed-back
fences, to which Cirillo must still adjust.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult,'' Cirillo said. ``Coors Field is a great place
to hit, but it's a different experience going on the road, no
doubt. You get used to hitting at home and you get in a comfort
zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The balls don't break as much, and then you go on the road and
you have to adjust to the balls breaking a little bit more. So that
just makes it a little more challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies acquired Cirillo in part because they felt Coors
Field would suit his game well.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion team had originally been built to win games with
home runs, with the ``Blake Street Bombers'' of Dante Bichette,
Vinny Castilla and Andres Galarraga, among others. But after last
year the philosophy changed, and the team set out to acquire good
hitters who could find the gaps in Coors Field's expansive
outfield.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo, 30, a line-drive hitter who totaled only 63 home runs
in his first five full seasons (with a career high of 15) with the
Milwaukee Brewers but hit .326 last year, seemed to fit the
description perfectly, and there were even whispers that he could
come close to batting .400 with the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never heard that,'' Cirillo said. ``Expectations are normal,
and I have a lot of expectations for myself, but hitting .400 is
certainly not one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to come in with a good attitude, a winning
attitude, and there were so many new guys in the beginning of the
season that we were all kind of feeling our way around. I'm not a
power hitter, but I was expected to drive in runs, and I think I've
contributed in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo is on pace for 128 RBI, which would shatter his previous
high of 88 set last season, and for a while this spring, .400
didn't seem so ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks into the season, Cirillo was hitting just .275 but
then went on a 15-game hitting streak that lifted his average to a
high point of .371 on May 9. The numbers have evened out over the
past two months, and Cirillo's goal is to remain consistent,
wherever he plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of projections put on me,'' Cirillo said,
``and I think early in the year I put a lot of pressure on myself
to meet those, but all I can do is keep playing hard and trying to
improve, and that's what I always try to do every day.''

PUTIN PUSHES FOR MORE POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN WHITMORE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ President Vladimir V. Putin said Saturday that Russia's
very survival was at risk and that he must centralize power in
order to save the nation from chaos and disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   In his first State of the Nation speech, Putin portrayed his
land as so riddled with crime, corruption, and economic uncertainty
that people are afraid to have children.
</P>
<P>
   If the situation doesn't improve soon, he told lawmakers and
regional leaders gathered in the Kremlin's Marble Hall, Russia
risks becoming a ``senile nation'' dependent on foreign charity.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's population has declined by 750,000 over each of the
past several years, he said, a trend that by 2015 could leave the
146 million-resident nation with 22 million fewer people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to live. Year by year, we, the citizens of
Russia, are getting fewer and fewer. If this continues, the very
survival of the nation will be under threat,'' Putin said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also decried Russia's waning influence in world affairs
and Moscow's continued dependence on foreign aid and credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not only a matter of our national pride,'' he said.
``Will we be able to survive as a nation, as a civilization if our
well-being again and again will depend on the granting of foreign
credits and on the good will of leaders of the world economy?''
</P>
<P>
   Putin has proposed a familiar remedy for his country's ills: a
``dictatorship of law'' and the revival of a strong and highly
centralized state.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian liberals fear that Putin's enthusiasm for
centralizing power could threaten hard-won civil liberties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only real choice for Russia is to be a strong country,
strong and self-confident,'' Putin said. ``Only a strong state _ or
if you don't like the word `strong,' only an effective state _ can
protect the democratic rights and freedoms of our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin repeatedly referred to his desire to curb the authority of
Russia's provincial leaders, who grew increasingly powerful and
unaccountable during Boris N. Yeltsin's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Putin wants the right to fire elected governors and mayors who
violate the law, but regional leaders have strongly opposed the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   For all his talk about strengthening the state, Putin made it
clear that he wants the government to stay out of the economy. He
said taxes must be lowered, customs regulations simplified,
property rights protected, and intervention in business curbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main obstacles to economic reform are high taxes, the
arbitrariness of bureaucrats, and rash of criminals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also touched on one of the most controversial issues of
his presidency, calling freedom of speech ``an unshakable value of
Russian democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights advocates fear that Putin, a former KGB agent,
intends to curb press freedoms. The three-day detention last month
of media baron Vladimir Gusinsky, a fierce Kremlin critic, was seen
by many liberals as a clampdown on a free press.
</P>
<P>
   Putin criticized media executives for using the press to further
their own economic and political interests.
</P>
<P>
   Putin said very little about Russia's 10-month-old conflict in
Chechnya. He called Moscow's battle against Islamic separatists in
the breakaway republic an ``extreme example'' of the Kremlin's
failure to control Russia's far-flung regions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The territory has become a bridgehead in Russia for the
expansion of international terrorism,'' he said.

 &HT;    Baseball's lost generation
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Volpe made headlines four years ago for
declaring himself a ``free-agent fan'' because he was disenchanted
with major-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-year-old business consultant from Falls Church, Va., got
mad because the San Francisco Giants traded third baseman Matt
Williams to the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe wrote a letter to every other major-league team, asking
them why he should become a fan of their club. He received more
than two dozen responses, many of which included souvenirs and
autographs. He chose the Phillies and donated the memorabilia to a
Catholic school near his home.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball was able to salvage a longtime fan in Volpe, but it
couldn't win back his children. Volpe says his sons _ Ross, 16, and
Andrew, 13 _ have little interest in the national pastime. Ross
prefers skateboarding; Andrew likes golf and lacrosse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They used to be baseball fans,'' Volpe said. ``I coached them
in Little League and they were really interested in baseball. But
baseball doesn't capture their imagination anymore. Baseball almost
lost me because of all its money and greed. Now, they're losing
this generation of kids.''
</P>
<P>
   That loss continues as baseball brings the All-Star Game, its
midsummer classic, to Turner Field on Tuesday. Thanks to the home
run hitting of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa, the game has won back
many of the fans who lost interest after the players strike led to
the cancellation of the 1994 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   But even the glitz and glamour of the All-Star Game can't hide
the fact that baseball continues to lose a large portion of its
most important audience _ kids who would be fans for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   Rising ticket and concession prices have made baseball games
prohibitively expensive for many families, and watching games on
television sometimes isn't an option for children because of late
starts. Kids have many entertainment options, and the slow pace of
baseball sometimes isn't attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that baseball had the country's undivided
attention for the entire summer,'' columnist and author George Will
said. ``Now there are only about six weeks from the end of the NBA
Finals to the first NFL preseason game. There are a lot of
entertainment options out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And most forms of entertainment are cheaper than baseball.
According to Team Marketing Report, a Chicago-based company that
monitors the prices of pro sports events, it would cost a family of
four, on average, more than $130 to attend a baseball game this
season. The company's fan cost index includes four tickets,
parking, modest food and drink, a program and cap.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, the cost is even higher _ $160 for a Braves game.
That's almost $100 more than the 1991 total of $68.13, and it ranks
eighth-highest among baseball's 30 teams this year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Matthew Freedman, editor of the report, says baseball is
a bargain when compared with other pro sports. The fan cost index
for a family of four is $267 for NBA games, $259 for the NFL and
$251 for the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still good deals out there in baseball,'' Freedman
said. ``In general, baseball does a good job of catering to the
family.''
</P>
<P>
   But baseball isn't catering to its young fans when it comes to
starting times. The television networks still dictate when a game
begins, even as viewership declines. Ratings for the last two World
Series were the lowest in history. The World Series and most of the
playoffs are broadcast in prime time, with the first pitch usually
thrown after 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The showcase baseball games not only start too late, but they
also drag on for too long,'' NBC announcer Bob Costas said. ``The
leisurely pace of baseball has oftentimes become lethargic. An NBA
game takes two hours, unless they foul Shaq 50 times. The NBA
Finals take place when most kids are out of school, and those games
end at a reasonable hour. The Super Bowl takes place at 6 p.m. on a
Sunday and kids can watch those games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a shame that a lot of kids who are baseball fans,
or who are potential fans, don't get to see the moments that really
galvanize your interest in baseball and make you fan for a
lifetime,'' Costas said.
</P>
<P>
   When kids do tune into games, they rarely watch from the first
pitch to the last. According to Artie Bulgrin, vice president of
research and sales development at ESPN, viewers between the ages of
2 and 17 make up only 9 percent of the male audience for the
network's game broadcasts on Sunday and Wednesday nights. Those
numbers jump to 13 percent for ESPN's ``Baseball Tonight''
highlight show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids today have so many options,'' Bulgrin said, ``and their
time is shared across so many options: other television
programming, the Internet and video games. Kids today make their
own entertainment. People always say kids aren't sports fans, but
they're still the biggest sports fans. They just consume sports
differently. While they may not watch the entire game, they still
want to know what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Major-league baseball also must overcome the trend of declining
participation in baseball. According to American Sports Data Inc.,
12.3 million Americans played baseball at least once in 1998, a
decline of 18 percent since 1987. There were 4.65 million children,
ages 5 to 18, in organized baseball programs in 1998, a decline of
1.5 percent from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids don't play pickup or sandlot games anymore,'' Costas
said. ``If you were to drive by a diamond, you probably wouldn't
see anyone playing baseball unless it was an organized game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, baseball meant everything to young males. Renewing
that interest might be the sport's biggest challenge. Baseball has
tried with giveaways at games and by instituting an inner-city
participation program.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers indicate that young kids are not biting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTV generation probably does have a short attention
span,'' Will said. ``You've got to understand baseball and learn to
appreciate its nuances. You don't have to understand a thing about
basketball or football to appreciate all the hoopla surrounding the
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball grows on you,'' he said. ``There's just a tremendous
number of bright stars in baseball. I'm quite confident about the
long-term future of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   But baseball won't be making many inroads with Atlanta's 2000
All-Star Game on Tuesday. An upper-deck seat for the game costs
$100. And the first pitch could come as late as 8:50 p.m.

CONTENDERS HAVE ASHBY AT TOP OF LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philadelphia right-hander Andy Ashby is the most highly scouted
pitcher these days as teams look to add a quality, veteran pitcher
by the end of the month. Scouts from every contending, or
quasi-contending team have gone there.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta and the New York Yankees are considered the
front-runners, but the Los Angeles Dodgers and Arizona are paying
particularly close attention to Ashby.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies plan to trade Ashby before July 31, but the asking
price is yet to be determined because of Ashby's miserable season.
He had a blowout with fans two weeks ago in Philadelphia after a
poor start, but that could be forgotten if he pitches like he did
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Ashby allowed two runs in seven innings against Milwaukee, but
scouts are keeping that in context since it was the offensively
challenged Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was better, but his location has been terrible all
season,'' one National League general manager said. ``He used to
have great location. Now, it's not very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashby was 3-7 with a 6.07 ERA heading into his Saturday start
against Baltimore. He won 31 games for San Diego the past two
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But clouding the Ashby sweepstakes is the future of right-hander
Curt Schilling. As is usual this time of year, Schilling said he
wouldn't mind being traded to a contender.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies general manager Ed Wade said he wouldn't trade
Schilling, but teams are likely to hold out a little longer in
hopes Schilling becomes available.
</P>
<P>
   Why the West is open: A year ago the Arizona Diamondbacks ran
away with the National League West, and pitching was a big part of
it. And while they'll head into the All-Star break this year
leading the division, the race is bunched up.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks to the problems of lefty starter Omar Daal, Arizona
has put two rookies into the starting rotation. Daal is 2-9 with a
7.43 ERA, the highest among major-league starters.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Figueroa and Geraldo Guzman, both rookie right-handers,
are in the rotation, and the overriding reason is so management can
find out if it needs to acquire a starting pitcher before the
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather take a look at these two young men before we
get into the break,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ``I'd rather go
ahead and get an idea of what we might have with them. I don't want
the answer to some of our starting problems to be in our backyard
and we don't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bigger than baseball: Florida right fielder Mark Smith had an
unforgettable day last Sunday. Smith hit two homers in a 2-1 win at
Montreal, then saved a man's life on his way home from Fort
Lauderdale International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and teammate Brad Penny were driving home after the team's
charter arrived in South Florida. They saw a car traveling in the
opposite direction of the highway flip over. Smith used his cell
phone to call 911, and when they turned around and arrived at the
accident scene, the car was on fire and the man's arms were hanging
through a window. Smith pulled the man out of the car, an.`2K

 &HT;    From players to fans, from the past to the present, the All-Star
experience is about magical times and the creation of lasting
memories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It isn't really about the scores, at least not so much
as it was in the 1970s. Then, National League president Chub Feeney
would march into the clubhouse to lecture his All-Stars on the
valor of the moment.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't really about the stats, either, although Stan Musial
surely has a good idea who has hit the most home runs in All-Star
history. (He's the man, with 6).
</P>
<P>
   What the All-Star Game is really about, with all the bunting and
shuttle buses and pitching changes stripped away, is precious
moments with a dreamlike quality on a ballfield.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone has one.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game is Tony Perez, subbed in as a third baseman,
taking a Catfish Hunter pitch over the wall in the 15th inning in
Anaheim to win in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   It is Carl Hubbell striking out Ruth, Gehrig, Foxx, Simmons and
Cronin in sequence in 1934 at the Polo Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   And Pedro Martinez striking out Larkin, Walker, Sosa and McGwire
to open the night last year in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It is Reggie Jackson pounding one off the light tower on the
roof in right field in Tiger Stadium in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   It is Pete Rose pounding Ray Fosse at the plate in Cincinnati in
1970, effectively ending Fosse's career.
</P>
<P>
   It is Ted Williams, with tears on his cheeks, surrounded by both
All-Star teams, some with tears in their eyes, before the first
pitch in Fenway in 1999. When officials of Major League Baseball
went out to clear the field so the game could begin, the players
refused to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Some moments are more private. Last year at Fenway, all players
had been asked to autograph equipment, and first-time All-Star
Kevin Millwood of Atlanta reported to a souvenir trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in early to get my signing out of the way, and Tony
Gwynn comes in,'' Millwood said. ``I'd never had a chance to speak
with the guy, or maybe get some information from him that might be
helpful to me. You can't avoid each other in that little area, so
we started talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out with, 'Hi, how are you?' and it just went on
and on. Baseball and different pitchers and different hitters, some
of the things he thinks at the plate and some of the things I think
about on the mound. It was kind of funny because, at first, I
didn't want to tell him anything. Like this guy's good enough
without me giving him more to work with . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``It never would have happened, just to stand and talk for 10 or
15 minutes, without making it to the All-Star Game. I went back to
the hotel that day and told my wife, `Hey, guess what?' ''
</P>
<P>
   At once baseball bacchanalia and simple celebration, the 71st
All-Star Game comes to Turner Field on Tuesday night, where it will
re-establish its significance, where it will re-establish itself as
one of the things that the game does right. For three days,
baseball takes a couple of steps back, takes a look at itself and
ultimately determines that the All-Star Game is still very cool.
</P>
<P>
   A social occasion among the populace, if the game itself does
not live up to a Mid-Summer Classic as it has been billed for
decades, it will not be ignored. A national television audience
averages between 37 million and 38 million. Overseas, MLB
international beams the game to more than 200 foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   It is the only summer night when there is just one game on, just
one game to discuss the next morning, the only interval between
Opening Day and October where baseball needs just one spotlight.
And if fans place too much significance upon the All-Star game,
they are only following the players' lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important,'' said Rod Carew, now 54 and batting coach in
Milwaukee. He made the AL team 18 times but missed three because of
injury. ``People want to see you play and take the time to vote you
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys would like to take the time off, but it's always
an honor. I was nominated 18 times, and every one I was able to go
to, I cherished.''
</P>
<P>
   The NBA all-star game is a no-check-all-chuck charade. The NFL
all-star game is a bunch of fat guys on Waikiki. The NHL all-star
game is a hot Saturday night in Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's All-Star Game was the model and the other games all
fall short. Why? Baseball's timing is better. The middle of July
offers an uncluttered calendar. Despite interleague scheduling,
intrigue remains in individual AL-NL matchups.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the voting process involves more people, more
players and, hence, more debate. Ballot-stuffing in Cincinnati led
to a player-manager vote from 1958 through 1969. When the vote was
returned to the public in 1970, commissioner Bowie Kuhn ordered 20
million ballots to be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it's over with,'' NL manager Bobby Cox said after
picking his reserves, ``because I spent too much time doing that
recently and not enough time paying attention to the Braves.''
</P>
<P>
   A deeper public appeal of the All-Star Game dwells in the
players themselves, and how they respond to the experience. If the
regular season is played for the paycheck and the pennant, the
All-Star Game they play for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I disagree,'' said Tom Seaver, a 12-time NL All-Star. ``You're
playing for your league; you're not playing for yourself. I don't
know what it's like now, but we used to be addressed by (NL
presidents) Warren Giles and Chub Feeney before the game, and there
was great pride in beating the American League.''
</P>
<P>
   Seaver sounds a lot like Hubbell in '34, after he mowed down the
five future Hall of Famers, including Cronin, who was the AL's
player-manager that year. Asked later about setting down Ruth,
Gehrig, Foxx, Simmons and Cronin in the first and second innings,
Hubbell replied, ``I actually didn't think too much about it at the
time. We lost the game. Maybe if we had won, it would have meant
more to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the scores are almost irrelevant. From 1963 through 1982,
the National League went 19-1 in the All-Star Game. In the same
period, the American League still claimed nine World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame writer Dan Daniel of The New York Herald was made
to realize the folly of All-Star conclusions when, after the 1946
game and the AL's 12-0 victory, he wrote the Nationals were quickly
becoming a minor league. After the World Series that fall, which
St. Louis took from Boston in seven games, Daniel next surmised
that the AL was becoming a second-rate league.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he could write such contradictory positions, Daniel
replied, ``That's OK. I've warned them both. Now they're on their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the score, an annual phenomenon that does not change is
the humbling, almost belittling experience that year's game becomes
for the younger players. There are exceptions, such as Garry
Templeton's 1979 declaration, ``If I'm not startin', I'm not
departin'.'' That remark would haunt the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a festival,'' Toronto's David Wells said. ``It's great to
be amongst the best in the game. That's the thing that gratifies me
_ going there, rubbing elbows, talking shop.''
</P>
<P>
   The more common experience is that of Goose Gossage, who endured
one of his most humbling episodes just by walking into his first
All-Star clubhouse, in Milwaukee in 1975. As he later recounted in
his autobiography, ``The Goose Is Loose,'' the first man Gossage
spied was older, his huge back hunched over as he sat. When the man
turned to greet him, Gossage was horrified to realize it was Mickey
Mantle, an honorary captain and his boyhood hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, how you doing?'' Mantle asked.
</P>
<P>
   Flummoxed, Gossage mumbled something before retreating to the
far end of the clubhouse to change. Mantle later found Gossage out
on the field and asked, ``What's the matter, kid, can't you talk?''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage's ensuing stream of babble and apologies so baffled
Mantle that he grinned and backed away slowly.
</P>
<P>
   It happens every July.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza was a 24-year-old rookie in 1993 when he reported to
the NL clubhouse at Camden Yards. Piazza immediately spotted Mark
Grace, John Kruk, Darren Daulton and Ryne Sandberg, with 12
All-Star appearances among them, talking in the lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of joining them. I was a rookie,'' Piazza
said last year. ``I wasn't going to walk right in there. I would
have felt out of place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Grace yelled at me to come in and sit down. I couldn't
believe it. It was like being promoted. I felt accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   Another All-Star moment, joining Millwood's in Boston. And Ted
Williams' two-out, three-run homer in the ninth to win the 1941
game 7-5. And Mike Schmidt, voted to the team despite retiring two
months earlier, doffing his cap during the 1989 introductions in
Anaheim,
</P>
<P>
   Dock Ellis' moment came five years after his only All-Star
appearance. He had been on the mound at Tiger Stadium in 1971 to
serve up the fastball that Reggie Jackson sent some 520 feet into
the Detroit night. Jackson had taken a slow tour of the bases that
evening, hesitating en route to pump his fist.
</P>
<P>
   So it was on July 27, 1976, that Ellis, then with the Yankees,
again faced Jackson, then with Baltimore, and he sent a high
fastball straight into the right fielder's face. Jackson would miss
28 games that season and for years would experience numbness in his
cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owed him one,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all memories are created equal.

<TEXT>
<P>
   It's that time of the season when teams must decide if it's time
to keep plugging away for a possible playoff berth or start looking
toward the future.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers are among those teams. They are in last place
in the American League West and have been there for the past month.
But a recent hot streak had them 7 games out of first place
entering Saturday. More importantly, they were only 5 out of the
wild-card spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how far is too far back,'' outfielder Rusty Greer
said. ``Over the years, a lot of strange things have happened.
Teams have overcome 10-game deficits. You don't ever want to lose
faith. You can't count yourself out, because we still have the
whole second half.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be surprising to see the Rangers throw in the towel on
the season, considering they have won the division three of the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's frustrating is we've shown signs we can be a good
club,'' manager Johnny Oates said. ``We played well in May and
played well when we won three in a row (last week). We just haven't
played well consistently.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Rangers do decide to make moves and aim for the future,
there are a few players who might be dealt. Closer John Wetteland
and first baseman David Segui are eligible for free agency at the
end of the season. Pitcher Esteban Loaiza can start or relieve and
has drawn interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to try and keep winning games. That's only fair,''
general manager Doug Melvin said. ``Unless I get overwhelmed by an
offer, I'm going to give the benefit of doubt to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Play time's over: Chuck Finley must be wondering if it's him.
</P>
<P>
   Last season when Finley was with the Angels and things were
going badly, management decided to yank the two 60-inch screen
televisions from the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the Indians, Finley watched as manager Charlie Manuel
decided to take the pingpong table and two leather couches out of
the clubhouse. Manuel also banned clubhouse card games.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in both cases the moves were not ``punishment,''
according to management, but a way to get the players to improve
their focus.
</P>
<P>
   Cycle-less: Hitting for the cycle is a rare feat for a hitter,
but the Blue Jays' Brad Fullmer missed a perfect opportunity in a
game last week.
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer, a former Montclair Prep of Van Nuys star, had singled,
tripled and homered when he came to bat in the seventh inning
against Tampa Bay. He sliced the ball to left field for a hit but
stayed at first after rounding the bag, and was booed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was on him,'' Blue Jays manager Jim Fregosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Fullmer, though, didn't second-guess his decision to stick with
a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't make a mockery of the game for personal glory,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Going deep: Both the Angels and Blue Jays are trying to become
the first team in major-league history to have four players hit 20
homers each before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   So far, both teams have three. The Angels have Garret Anderson,
Mo Vaughn and Troy Glaus with 20-plus, and the Blue Jays have Raul
Mondesi, Carlos Delgado and Tony Batista. The Angels' fourth is Tim
Salmon, who has 18. The Blue Jays' fourth is Jose Cruz Jr., who has
19.
</P>
<P>
   Not so coincidentally, the two teams rank 1-2 in the American
League in homers.
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Through Friday, the Angels had more victories (45)
than all four 1999 AL playoff teams - Yankees (43), Indians (43),
Red Sox (42) and Rangers (42). ...Jermaine Dye was the first Kansas
City Royal to be voted onto the All-Star team since Bo Jackson in
1989. ... A's pitcher Ariel Prieto, unhappy that he's been up and
down between the majors and minors all season, has asked for a
trade.

 &HT;    Redneck Games: 'Good family fun'
 &HT;    By Dianne Stepp
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ga. _ Spittin' a watermelon seed more than 39 feet ain't
easy.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Braswell of Wrightsville, Ga., shucked her floppy
chicken hat, reared back and let fly but didn't come close to
14-year-old Eric Smith's expert expectoration once judges found the
pits in the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret's curling your tongue like a funnel and blowing,''
demonstrated Eric, gripping his Budweiser can-topped trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got beat by a girl last year,'' said Mac Davis, general
manager of Y-96 radio station, sponsor of the 2000 Redneck Games.
</P>
<P>
   The contest warmed the crowd up for the armpit serenade. Blake
Nimmons, 12, of Soperton, Ga., furiously pumped his arm to squeeze
out a crowd-pleasing rendition of ``Dixie.''
</P>
<P>
   Winner J.W. Young added a new twist, blowing air under his
armpit through a straw while pumping away.
</P>
<P>
   Still dripping from a cooling plunge in the Oconee River, rising
second-grader Brandon Denton checked to ensure that his painted on
``Little Redneck'' had'nt washed off. ``He's hoping to get in the
mud pit belly flop contest,'' said his mother Sherryell Denton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good family fun. Southerners have the unique ability to
laugh at themselves. That's what this is all about,'' she said.
``I'm waiting to bob for pigs' feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5th Annual Red Neck Games started early Saturday at Buckeye
Park in East Dublin with a six-mile homemade raft race down the
Oconee and ended with fireworks in the evening. Rick Hunter rode
his motorcycle five hours from DeLand, Fla., to be there. ``I'm
looking for a woman bobbing for pig's feet. I've never seen a woman
with a pig's foot in her mouth except my mother and she was eating
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands braved the Middle Georgia heat to go for beer can
trophies in events such as the hubcap hurl, the Dumpster dive and
bug zapper spitball.
</P>
<P>
   Randy ``L-bow'' Tidwell, wearing a T-shirt with his picture on
it and ``Genuine Redneck'' printed across the top, officially
opened the games. Tidwell, known as Middle Georgia's ``best known
redneck,'' began the festivities by lighting a beer can torch.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day festivalgoers were entertained by live music
by various local groups, including The Southern Touch Band, arts
and crafts, barbecue, watermelon and boiled peanuts.
</P>
<P>
   The games began in 1996 as a counterpoint to the Olympics held
in Atlanta, drawing a crowd of 3,000. This year more than 8,000
people were expected at the park on the banks of the Oconee.

 &HT;    Hefty `Goblet' is refreshingly original brew
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There's more heft to this Harry, and not just in the
number of pages.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made of the length of ``Harry Potter and the
Goblet of Fire,'' the fourth and _ at 734 pages _ by far the
longest volume so far in J.K. Rowling's phenomenally successful
series of children's novels about a young British wizard.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts worry that Rowling's youthful following will lose
interest in reading long before Harry wins or loses the Triwizard
Tournament somewhere past page 600.
</P>
<P>
   While that remains to be seen, several things are clear from
reading ``Goblet'': Rowling has enough imagination and skill to
keep a longer story interesting, and she's not afraid to let Harry
start growing up.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, none of the opening 157 pages takes place at Hogwarts
School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. That's a switch from the first
three Potters, and represents Rowling's successful effort to
broaden both Harry's and readers' exposure to a larger world.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the action eventually switches to Hogwarts, the plot
is deliciously convoluted and the cast of characters is as colorful
as ever. But there also are some very (dare we say it?) humanizing
complications for the now 14-year-old Harry.
</P>
<P>
   Flashes of jealousy between friends; unrequited crushes that
hurt just as badly even if you are a young wizard capable of
defeating the Dark Force; acne; even the death of someone way too
young and nice to die.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of paying attention to how much Rowling wrote, consider
how she's filled the space. By refusing to simply rework the same
ultra-successful formula (although there's still plenty about the
evil Lord Voldemort, without whom this would be ``Moby Dick''
without the whale), she's letting her character grow, right along
with her audience.
</P>
<P>
   Some may say it's sheer calculation _ there are still three more
Potters planned, after all.
</P>
<P>
   But for those of us already eager for Volume V, there's another
word for it: wizardry.

 &HT;    Following the journey of China Girl
 &HT;    By Michael Coren
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They have been watching China Girl swim from
space.
</P>
<P>
   The leatherback sea turtle, the largest species in the sea,
leads an almost invisible life slipping from one ocean to another
in perfect anonymity _ until now.
</P>
<P>
   China Girl was the first leatherback in the Atlantic to carry a
satellite transmitter from the United States when she left the
beach of Archie Carr National Wildlife Refuge in Melbourne just
after midnight May 20.
</P>
<P>
   Her migratory path up the eastern seaboard to winter feeding
grounds off Nova Scotia is being tracked by scientists eager to
understand the world's least-studied sea turtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the grand experiment,'' said Dr. Duane De Freese, vice
president of Florida research at Hubbs-SeaWorld Research Institute
in Orlando. ``If we want to understand how this animal survives and
lives in the wild, we need to use every technological tool at our
disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Desperate to stem the tide of leatherback deaths around the
world, researchers are using satellite telemetry and international
cooperation to uncover the secrets of an animal that spends only a
few hours of its 80-year life span on land.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't be held in captivity,'' said Scott Eckert, a
leatherback sea turtle researcher with Hubbs-SeaWorld Research
Institute in San Diego, who outfitted China Girl with her tracking
harness.
</P>
<P>
   Supremely adapted to the open ocean, ``leatherbacks have never
developed the capacity for boundaries'' and will kill themselves
against tank walls because they never stop swimming, Eckert said.
</P>
<P>
   Their instinctual wanderlust has placed them in the direct path
of the world's commercial fisherman. Efficient industrial trawlers
using gill nets and long lines have resulted in a huge catch of
leatherback sea turtles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pacific population has dropped well in excess of 80
percent in the last 15 years,'' Eckert said of a population that
has dwindled to just a few thousand. The Atlantic population seems
to be ``holding its own'' between 20,000 and 30,000 animals, but
they are vulnerable from international commercial fisheries and at
isolated beaches critical to their reproductive success.
</P>
<P>
   Eckert hopes China Girl, named after the David Bowie song, will
shed some light on the animal's annual migration patterns and the
role these massive reptiles play in the Atlantic eco-system.
Understanding them may help prevent tragedies like the one that
occurred in north Florida last October.
</P>
<P>
   Large numbers of leatherback sea turtles began turning up in
shrimp trawlers' nets and more than 15 washed up dead on Florida
beaches before the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
issued an emergency ban. Shrimp trawlers were required to use
larger turtle excluder devices to allow the massive leatherbacks to
escape drowning in the nets.
</P>
<P>
   A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING
</P>
<P>
   ``No fisherman wants to deal with a turtle as by-catch,'' said
De Freese. ``We need to work with the fishing industry as
scientists. If we know where they are migrating then we can avoid
those human and animal impacts.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Bagley, a UCF research assistant at the Carr Refuge,
believed the deaths could have been avoided but ``we just don't
understand them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to understand what's going on and (China
Girl) is the first step,'' said Bagley, who works with Dr.
Llewellyn Ehrhart, head of the UCF Marine Turtle Lab studying the
thousands of turtles that nest on the Archie Carr Refuge each year.
Most of those are loggerhead and green turtles but a handful of
leatherbacks lay nests there, including China Girl, who made eight
nests at the refuge this year.
</P>
<P>
   A joint effort has developed between Eckert in San Diego and
UCF's Ehrhart to track China Girl with Argos satellite receivers in
polar orbit for the next three months until the harness falls off.
Eckert is optimistic that China Girl will show up in Nova Scotia
this fall when he collaborates with Canadian scientists there to
tag leatherbacks on the open ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Eckert has tracked the sea turtles from Trinidad, St. Croix and
Costa Rica before China Girl become his most recent terrapin
interest. ``We have this pattern building,'' he said about the
picture emerging of the species's oceanic migrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``China Girl has been a pleasant surprise'' said Eckert, because
her movements have mirrored his prediction of a yearlong
circumnavigation of the Atlantic ocean. She is swimming up the
North American coast at about 40 kilometers a day and is expected
to reach her winter feeding grounds off Nova Scotia in early
August.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the Caribbean Sea during early summer, leatherback
sea turtles usually move north through Florida's waters in summer
months before arriving at their northern Atlantic feeding grounds
in early fall. The leatherbacks time their movements to coincide
with emerging food sources, usually jellyfish, to satisfy their
voracious appetites.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may swim for two months and 3,000 miles for food,'' said
Eckert. ``I've seen them swim 12,000 kilometers in a single year.''
</P>
<P>
   `SOMETHING SPECIAL GOING ON'
</P>
<P>
   The turtles are expected to head toward the west coast of Africa
before cruising back to tropical waters in the Caribbean and South
America where they spend the spring and summer months.
</P>
<P>
   China Girl's journey has scientists excited about what new
knowledge she will bring to the science and conservation of the
world's largest sea turtle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something going on there that's very special,'' De
Freese said of the research at the Archie Carr National Wildlife
Refuge. ``We're just scratching the surface.''

 &HT;    Venus makes history with Wimbledon victory
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Her face beamed and her feet danced, and in
the moment of victory, the feet led her a dozen rows above Centre
Court to her sister and her father.
</P>
<P>
   There, Venus Williams embraced sister Serena and father Richard
for a long moment, celebrating the journey and the destination.
When she returned to the court, Venus Williams put her hand to her
heart, smiled and mouthed the words, ``It's mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus Ebone Starr Williams, a 20-year-old black woman raised on
the public courts of a tough Los Angeles neighborhood, won her
first Grand Slam title Saturday on the pristine grass courts of the
All England Club. She beat defending champion Lindsay Davenport
6-3, 7-6 (7-3).
</P>
<P>
   Williams, now a Palm Beach Gardens resident, became the first
black woman to win here since Althea Gibson did it in 1957 and
1958, feeling she'd broken a barrier that many would soon follow
her through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a privilege for me to win this Wimbledon while
she's still alive,'' Venus said. ``I appreciate how hard it was
(for her). You realize not everyone wants you to win, not
everyone's going to support you. And that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Family friend Zina Garrison, the last black Wimbledon finalist,
watched from the Friends' Box and was among the first to hug Venus
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, 'This is unbelievable,' `` said Garrison,
runner-up in 1990. ``For Venus to finally do what Althea's wanted
to happen for so long. It's just amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the historical meaning, Venus and her family also
impressed with their celebration. The instant Davenport's forehand
volley hit the net on match point, Venus' long legs were flying in
a leaping dance. ``That's from my ballet classes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, who had provided commentary throughout the match on
his dry-erase board, jumped onto the not-so-sturdy roof of the
broadcast booth to dance and show his newest thought: ``Venus'
party and no one was invited.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena, who had upset family harmony by winning the first Grand
Slam at last year's U.S. Open, grinned and clapped as her sister
started her climb into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wimbledon's certainly never seen a celebration like this,''
said John Roberts, longtime tennis writer for London's Daily
Telegraph.
</P>
<P>
   During the trophy presentation, Venus received a roaring
standing ovation as she was handed the aptly named Venus Rosewater
Dish. She held the plate above her head and hugged it to her chest,
doing a pirouette and bending as if the dish was too heavy, the
moment too incredible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to miss out on celebrations,'' Venus said during
an on-court speech to the crowd, a first at a tournament known for
polite fans and impeccable decorum. Fans adored Venus' heart-felt
answers to BBC interviewer Sue Barker's questions, including one
about her hopes to win here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll go to bed at night and I'll dream that I've won a Grand
Slam and when I wake up, it's a nightmare,'' she said. ``Now that
I've done it, I hope I don't have to wake up like that any more.''
</P>
<P>
   She shouldn't have to. As the fifth seed, she defeated Davenport
convincingly and became the lowest seed to win since 1962. The
second seed didn't play her best, but after a nervous start, Venus
rapidly won the first set.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, both players' serves faltered allowing eight
service breaks total. Venus still had a chance to win the match
serving at 5-4, but she wasn't ``calm'' and hit two doublefaults
and lost the game.
</P>
<P>
   The tiebreaker could have been turned the match for Davenport,
but a few unforced errors and a service winner gave Venus a 5-1
lead. She hit a serve return in the net on her first match point
before winning on her second.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a few points that I'd love to take back,'' said
Davenport, who has battled recent back and thigh injuries. ``But a
lot of that was caused by her. She was hitting the balls a lot
deeper than I was and that didn't give me the chance to hit the
shots I wanted to hit and sometimes forced me into going for a
little bit too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Many consider this Wimbledon a breakthrough for both Venus and
her sister. Each now has a major title. Both are improving their
games, serving better, moving better and harnessing their power
more effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, although disappointed, admitted it was nice to see
Venus win, especially when critics wondered if she would ever win
one after Serena won the U.S. Open while Venus watched sullenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't help but feel a little bit sorry for her last
fall when Serena won the first one,'' Davenport said. ``You knew
eventually she was going to win a Grand Slam. It's nice to see the
monkey get off her back.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fascinating fortnight for Britain with the Williams
sisters plowing through the draw. Serena looked unbeatable until
she met her sister. Richard became an overnight celebrity by
declaring his love for Wimbledon and the British, by walking from
their rented home to the club every day, by giving away tickets and
conducting interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, meanwhile, steadily progressed through the tournament to
set up the sisters' first meeting in a Grand Slam semifinal. Fans
learned the Williams' story from every angle and yearned for a good
tennis match.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't happen, but they saw an emotional side of both
players, as Serena suffered with the loss and Venus helped her
through it. Venus had already defeated the No. 1 player and top
seed in Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Defeating No. 8 Serena meant she still had to beat the
second-ranked player in the world. That she beat all those players
makes this win even more meaningful, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, NBC commentator Chris Evert pointed out that she had
held a version of this trophy before. Venus and Serena visited
Evert's Boca Raton home about 10 years ago specifically to see her
three Wimbledon trophies, which are replicas of the one Venus held
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But Venus said she dreamed about winning any Grand Slam, not
just Wimbledon. That is, until about a week before the tournament
when she decided to shop for a gown for tonight's Champions Ball.
</P>
<P>
   She and Serena went to the mall, but Venus went on a budget
because she'd lost in the quarterfinals of the French Open. She
didn't have much time, but she picked out a beaded dress that
needed some repairs. It was ready the day they flew to London.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought my gown before I came here because I was determined
to get this,'' she said. ``I had to make a promise to myself, so I
bought the dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Her promise, of course, was that she would win it. Gibson and
Garrison, no doubt, can't wait to see a picture, both for Venus'
sake and for history's sake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great that Serena won the U.S. Open, but this is the
biggest tournament in the world,'' Garrison said. ``It's the Super
Bowl of our sport and for it finally to happen, that's history.''

   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks look to extend their
winning streak to 12 games today when they face the Utah Starzz at
5 p.m. at the Forum.
</P>

   On the second leg of a six-game homestand, the Sparks improved
to 8-0 at home with their 79-70 victory against the Washington
Mystics on Thursday.

`SLAVE' RECOUNTS HER LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP WITH JOHN E.

   Those were the initials she expected John E. Robinson Sr. to
burn into her hip if she moved to Kansas to be his slave.
</P>
<P>
   She could have put up with the branding, she said. And promises
of a greenhouse job, and perhaps even a horse on his farm sounded
tempting. But something about Robinson made her hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how close I came to moving down there,'' Vicki
said last week in a telephone interview from her home in Ontario,
Canada. ``It scares me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old woman said she felt sick when she recently
learned about the charges against Robinson. She asked that her last
name not be used to protect her family.

   Robinson was charged in June with capital murder in the deaths
of five women whose bodies were found in barrels. Authorities also

IN WESTERN OPEN, WOODS STRUGGLES SIX SHOTS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEMONT, Ill. _ Steve Flesch and Brian Henninger liked their
positions, but Tiger Woods did not like his. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Saturday's third round of the Advil Western Open, Woods,
the world's No. 1 player, was missing from a tightly bunched leader
board. It will take a comeback of major proportions for Woods, the
defending champion, to win at Cog Hill Golf and Country Club for
the third time in four years. Plagued by putting problems, Woods
was six strokes off the lead, tied for 23rd place and clearly not
playing his best.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Woods does not win, who will?
</P>
<P>
   That question remained wide open heading into a final round that
will be highly competitive and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch had three bogeys on his last seven holes and shot a 68
and Henninger bogeyed the 18th hole to finish his third-round
70.They shared the lead at 13 under par (203), but 16 players were
bunched between 13 under and 9 under. Lee Janzen, a two-time U.S.
Open winner, was alone in third place at 204 after a six-under 66.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, Jim Furyk and Kenny Perry were tied at 11 under par.
Robert Allenby and Shigeki Maruyama were 10 under, while eight
players were at nine under _ Stephen Ames, Stuart Appleby, Mike
Brisky, Bill Glasson, Steve Lowery, Carl Paulson, David Toms and
Mark Wiebe.
</P>
<P>
   With Woods struggling, by his standards, the contenders sensed
an opportunity to capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to win,'' said Janzen, who has won just once,
at the 1998 U.S. Open, in the last five years. ``It seems like
we're playing for fewer spots the way Tiger has played. Maybe
that's why guys are playing better this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can play aggressively tomorrow, even with mistakes, I'd
be happy with the same score. If you're going to keep up, you have
to make birdies. So you might as well fire at the pin.''
</P>
<P>
   Three players equaled the course record (63) during the first
two rounds, but the greens were firmer today, and scoring became
more difficult. Perry shot 68, Furyk shot 69, and Price shot 70.
Meanwhile, several players hurt themselves with poor rounds, like
Fred Couples (73) and Franklin Langham (74), who were tied at 208.
</P>
<P>
   As for Woods, he shot a third-round 70 that was unusually
inconsistent. Woods bogeyed two par-5 holes Saturday _ No. 9 and
No. 15, and he continued to miss putts that prevented him from
building momentum. Afterward he said he was frustrated about his
inability to make putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need a seeing-eye dog out there,'' said Woods, playing his
last tournament before the British Open later this month. ``I'm
putting so bad, it's a joke. I need to play well tomorrow, at
least, so going to the British I have something to take away from
this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play well, I have a chance of winning. If I don't play
well, I'm so far behind, I have no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   While the huge gallery following Woods did not have much to
cheer about, there was plenty of action around the course.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch, 33, a left-hander looking for his first PGA Tour
victory, stormed into the picture with an eagle at No. 5, which
moved him to 10 under par.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch is often called the best player on tour who has never
won. He has eight top-10 finishes this year, tied for third on tour
behind Woods (10) and Jesper Parnevik (9). Sunday could finally be
Flesch's turn to break through, and he ended the day on a high
note, when his 12-foot birdie putt at No. 18 hung on the lip for
three seconds, then fell into the cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm ready to win, but I can't force it,'' Flesch said.
``I didn't really hit the ball that well today, but I was able to
shoot a good score. Usually in every tournament, you have at least
one day when you don't hit the ball that well. So I was happy to
get through today.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many players in contention, the leaders will spend as
much time reading the scoreboard Sunday as they will reading putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's going to break out of the pack and throw up a good
score, and the other guys are going to have to chase him,'' Furyk
said. ``I'm going to have to shoot at least 66 if I want a chance
to win this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   So unlike the U.S. Open last month, where Woods was the lone
player to finish under par, Sunday's final round will bring out the
birdies.
</P>
<P>
   It was nearly impossible to predict a winner. But at least
nobody would win by 15 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a shootout, which everyone wants, I
suppose,'' Price said. ``Nobody's going to run away with this
one.''

GRIFFEY'S SEASON IS NO HIGHLIGHTS FILM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. one day will break Mark McGwire's all-time home
run record (after McGwire breaks Hank Aaron's mark.)
</P>
<P>
   But Griffey's star status is quickly losing its luster.
</P>
<P>
   It is becoming more and more apparent that Griffey is overly
sensitive and lacking self-confidence. Yes, one of the best players
in the game and eventually one of the best players ever seems to
have an ego problem, at least when it comes to the media portrayal
of his image.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey doesn't do interviews with ESPN because he believes they
make him look bad. He seems to be jealous of Cardinals center
fielder Jim Edmonds, which goes back to when Griffey played for the
Seattle Mariners and Edmonds for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   If reporters asked Griffey about Edmonds - like when Edmonds
made that spectacular catch in Kansas City a few years ago -
Griffey would be curt. He seems to think ESPN shows Edmonds' great
catches, but not his. And as a result, the only reporter from ESPN
Griffey will talk to is Harold Reynolds, a former teammate of
Griffey's.
</P>
<P>
   And even then it is not for an interview, but simply small talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only conversations I have had with Harold, I said they
show me mess up and then show somebody making a great catch right
after that,'' Griffey told the Associated Press. ``That's been
going on for years, that's the way it's always been.''
</P>
<P>
   So when Griffey sat out an ESPN-televised game a few days ago -
against Edmonds' Cardinals no less - rumors surfaced that Griffey
was boycotting the cable network. But Griffey said there was no
boycott, that he had a stomachache and a headache. (Wonder what Cal
Ripken thinks.).
</P>
<P>
   Well, at least Griffey helps his team on the field, right? At
least he'll get past his insecurities off the field and carry his
team on it, right?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey's former team and present team are headed in opposite
directions. And the numbers don't look good for Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   Through Friday, the Mariners were 49-35, their best start in
club history, and leading the AL West. The Reds, after winning 96
games last season before adding Griffey, were 42-43 and eight games
out in the NL Central.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners clubhouse, sans Griffey, is one big happy family.
The Reds clubhouse is a dysfunctional family.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, things are going great here and not in
Cincinnati,'' Mariners right fielder Jay Buhner said, careful not
to blame Griffey. ``There's a different hero here every game.
What's going on with Junior, I couldn't tell you. It's time to turn
the page.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey is hitting his home runs (26, fourth in the NL, through
Friday), but is batting just .232. He was voted by the fans to
start the All-Star Game, but in a poll of the players by Baseball
Weekly magazine, Edmonds was the choice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his offensive production over the years has been
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junior? Forty-five to 50 homers, 100-whatever RBI? All of a
sudden, somebody has to pick it up,'' Mariners manager Lou Piniella
said of his team without Griffey. ``Edgar (Martinez) and Alex
(Rodriguez) have done a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you lose a guy like him, it's hard to replace,''
Buhner said. ``But right now we've got two guys creaming the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   And 25 guys who like being around each other. There was talk
that the Mariners clubhouse wasn't big enough for Rodriguez and
Griffey. But it's Rodriguez's team now, if he wants it. There is
growing speculation that the Mariners' success this season might
persuade Rodriguez to consider re-signing with Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just a great group of guys in here, nice leadership,''
Buhner said. ``The communication is great, and (Piniella) has been
a joy to play for. I think this year has rejuvenated him a little
bit. He keeps guys loose and laughing.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's probably helped Piniella that he has one less daily
duty. No more baby-sitting.

   VICKI _ (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) Vicki knew him as J.R. Those were the
initials she expected John E. Robinson Sr. to burn into her hip if
she moved to Kansas to be his slave. She could have put up with the
branding, she said. And promises of a greenhouse job, and perhaps
even a horse on his farm sounded tempting. But something about
Robinson made her hesitate. ``I can't believe how close I came to
moving down there,'' Vicki said last week in a telephone interview
from her home in Ontario, Canada. ``It scares me to death.''
Robinson was charged in June with capital murder in the deaths of
five women whose bodies were found in barrels. Authorities also
have linked him to three women and a baby who disappeared in the
1980s. By DIANE CARROLL. Story will move in the ``a'' category.

<P>
   SURGERY _ (COLUMBIA, Mo.) A few minutes before beginning surgery
on 3-month-old Elizabeth Quigley, neurosurgeon David Jimenez
cradled the smiling baby in his arms and paraded her around the
waiting room, proudly showing her off. The affection with which
Jimenez and his wife, plastic surgeon Constance Barone, treat their
little patients has won them fans among families throughout the
country who seek treatment for craniosynostosis at the University
of Missouri-Columbia Hospital and Clinics. By LYNN FRANEY. Story
will move in the ``a'' category.
</P>
<P>
   DOWNTOWN _ (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) What should be done about downtown
Kansas City? It's an eternal quandary, and in recent years
different solutions have gone in and out of vogue. One day, a
sports arena is seen as the key. Another day, it's light-rail
transit. Or an entertainment complex. Nothing sticks, nothing gets
widespread support. Now there may be a clear-cut favorite: more
housing, something that could bring life to the streets. By JEFFREY
SPIVAK and MARK P. COUCH. Story will move in the ``a'' category.

L.A. CITY WORKERS OUTEARN THEIR PEERSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Even as they push for higher wages, Los Angeles
city workers -- from the top brass down through the ranks -- draw
bigger paychecks than what municipal workers earn in other major
U.S. cities, a Daily News survey found.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles pays its City Council members, police chief, head
librarian and new firefighters and police officers significantly
better than their counterparts get in New York City -- which has a
larger population and a higher cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   Municipal employees in Los Angeles also take home higher
salaries than do workers in Chicago, Miami, Philadelphia and San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well known through municipal circles in California that
Los Angeles is the promised land, where the milk and the honey and
the cash flows,'' said Jon Coupal, president of the statewide
Howard Jarvis Taxpayer's Association. ``Public employee packages
are way out of line in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost and efficiency of Los Angeles government have taken on
added currency as several unions negotiate for pay hikes this
summer and a study begins into whether the San Fernando Valley
should secede from the city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles police union on Saturday ratified a new contract
that includes a 13 percent pay hike over three years, and other top
officials are preparing for two pay raises in September and January
totaling 12.5 percent. The scheduled raises even extend to members
of the City Council, already the nation's highest-paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting our money's worth here in Los Angeles,''
said Richard Close, a leader of Valley Voters Organized Toward
Empowerment, the group pushing for a study of Valley secession. He
said the figures point to inefficiency in city government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suspicion has always been that the city is run for the
benefit of the employees, rather than for the benefit of residents
and business owners. This confirms that suspicion.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer, chairman of the council's Budget and
Finance Committee, called for the city to monitor pay levels and
evaluate whether the public salaries are appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that it's extremely important for the city to be
prudent about what it pays city staff,'' Feuer said. ``We obviously
need to be paying a sufficient salary to attract good people, but
we also don't want to be in a position of wasting taxpayer
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks earns $228,678 a year
as the nation's highest-paid top cop, dwarfing the New York City
police commissioners' $150,000 annual salary.
</P>
<P>
   An entry-level LAPD police officer makes $41,175, while one in
New York City makes $31,305.
</P>
<P>
   Starting firefighters are paid $39,171 in Los Angeles, but only
$30,872 in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles city clerk earns $159,753 -- more than his
counterparts in New York City, San Diego, San Francisco, Phoenix,
Dallas, Chicago, Miami and Philadelphia. The salary of the city's
head librarian -- $156,767 -- also tops each of those other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Entry-level sanitation truck drivers in Los Angeles earn
$38,169, more than $10,000 above New York City and more than other
major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, Los Angeles expects to spend $2.1 billion this year
-- nearly half of its budget -- on payroll.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to payroll, Los Angeles pays between $5,072 and
$6,200 yearly per employee for health and dental coverage and other
benefits. Paying for those benefits makes up about 10 percent of
the city's $4.3 billion budget, said Peter Hidalgo, a spokesman in
the Mayor's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Butcher, general manager for the largest union of city
employees, called comparisons with other cities misleading because
of the city's cost of living, high housing prices and sprawling
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not buying milk in Chicago, they are buying milk in
Los Angeles, and they are trying to buy homes in Los Angeles,'' she
said. ``Folks are only barely able to make their way into the
middle class and what we view as the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Butcher said city workers, despite comparatively high salaries,
struggle to support families in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where they are able to afford to buy a house, they end up
driving 104 miles to get to work,'' she said. ``We're not looking
to be greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the cost of living is lower in Los Angeles than in many
other large cities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Web site
Virtual Relocation.com, a dollar in Los Angeles would be worth only
80 cents in Chicago, 61 cents in San Francisco and 37 cents in New
York City.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials also said Los Angeles' local government must pay
higher salaries to be competitive as an employer.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, salaries paid by private employers in Los Angeles are
about 12 percent above the national average, said Juan Garcia,
research analyst for the Employers Group, a Los Angeles-based human
resources association.
</P>
<P>
   However, private sector wages in New York City are even higher
-- 15 percent more than the national average, Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kyser, chief economist at the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corp., said governments need to offer higher wages to
compete with the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a very, very strong job market right now, and if
somebody is sharp they have a lot of options in the private
sector,'' he said. ``You are dealing in a crowded market and Los
Angeles is a complicated place to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Coupal disagreed, saying workers still will flock to city
government for the benefits and security the jobs offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that were true, then vacancies would be hard to fill,'' he
said. ``Even with this low unemployment, people recognize this as
the cash cow that it is and apply in droves.''

THROTTLE AGAIN A STICKING POINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H _ It is one of the simple pieces and functions of a
racing car.
</P>
<P>
   No fancy-schmancy, high-tech, computer-glitz stuff here. No
bells and whistles.
</P>
<P>
   The throttle. The giver of the gas.
</P>
<P>
   Pedal to the metal and steel linkage goes into action and pulls
open the butterfly valves on top of the carburetor, gas flows in
and internal combustion occurs, and off you go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple, just nuts and bolts,'' said Joe Bessey, a driver
himself and owner of Geoff Bodine's Winston Cup car. ``It's really
basic. One of the most basic pieces of the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple. Basic.
</P>
<P>
   And pointed to as a possible reason for the deaths of Adam Petty
two months ago and Kenny Irwin Friday in terrible Turn 3 crashes at
New Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR recently announced that it could determine no definitive
reason for the Petty crash. Irwin's death Friday, under similar
circumstances, reopened debate and speculation on stuck throttles
in the Winston Cup garages and throughout the sport this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The throttles on the cars of Irwin and Petty may or may not have
stuck, sending them slamming into the outside cement wall of Turn
3. But NASCAR no doubt again will be looking at the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   It's a simple system with deadly consequences if something goes
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The pedal on the floor _ hung on many cars as it is on most
passenger cars _ can catch on the thick, insulated floor mat and
that can keep the throttle open and the gas flowing when it should
be shut off.
</P>
<P>
   Or the steel linkage _ most passenger car gas pedals are
connected to the carburetor by cable _ that connects most race gas
pedals to the carburetors past the firewall can get hung up on
another piece of equipment. Or there can be a more mechanical
problem, such as something breaking inside the carburetor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many things, just a lot of things,'' said Dale
Jarrett, last year's Winston Cup champion. ``The air cleaner can do
it. They may get it tightened down more at the track than they did
at the shop. They may get here and the cowl was actually at one
place at the shop and they get here and the template needs to fit a
little better across the hood and they beat the cowl piece down and
then you've lost some clearance and it can get hung.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual pedal can get hung on the mat inside the car. If
you've got tape around the air cleaner, a piece of tape can come
down. So there are just endless things.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers through the garage addressed throttles with their crews
and talked of times they have had to deal with the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a throttle hang and it's the worst feeling a driver
can ever have,'' Jarrett said. ``I told my son Jason, he's had it
happen twice already, I told him he's experienced the worst thing,
that and fire. It's just the most helpless feeling, especially on
these shorter type racetracks where you have no banking. Your first
reaction is to stomp on the brakes and that basically doesn't do
anything when you're going wide open. So it's a terrible feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   It's up to each driver and his crew to check and re-check for
problems and not wait for NASCAR to come up with an answer, Jarrett
said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time those in the garage area were confident NASCAR
_ which has a history of learning from accidents _ will look
closely at these.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace talked of his earlier days of racing and a piece
of metal on the pedal that came over the top of the shoe _ picture
a toe clip on a bicycle. If the pedal stuck, it could be pulled
back up with the driver's toe.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with that system is that many of the Winston Cup
drivers brake with their right foot and thus need their foot more
free.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Long, crew chief for Bodine, said other ideas have been
tossed around. They include an engine kill switch on the steering
wheel or maybe even a cord attached to the driver's wrist _ like
one on a personal watercraft _ that could kill the engine even more
quickly. Currently, there are two kill switches, one for safety
workers to the right of the driver and the other on the dashboard.
But heading for a crash, there is little time to reach far for a
switch.
</P>
<P>
   If something needs to be done with throttles, NASCAR will take
care of it, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASCAR has been real good with that,'' he said. ``They tried
half a dozen things and, `boom,' came up with roof flaps. That's
one of the greatest inventions they've had since I've been in the
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   The flaps keep the cars from flying as they did during
spectacular crashes during the late '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done wonders for those horrific Daytona wrecks,''
Bessey said. ``They keep the car from flying through the air. I
think maybe it's time to look at something different.''

</P>
<P>
   That equation will yield immortality for Pete Sampras Sunday.
Unless Patrick Rafter can come up with a different solution.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian with the samurai hairdo and surgically repaired
serving shoulder represents the doorstop to heaven for Sampras, who
is one victory away from two platinum records.
</P>
<P>
   Should his nagging back and ailing left leg allow him to hobble
past Rafter on Centre Court at the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP;
Croquet Club, Sampras will join Willie Renshaw atop the annals for
Wimbledon men's singles titles (7) and surpass the standard he
shares with Australian Roy Emerson for most Grand Slam keepsakes
(13).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the technicality of a tie, Sampras will reign as the de
facto supreme male at Wimbledon because Renshaw accomplished his
feat during the antediluvian days of the 19th century, when the
tournament was an entirely different _ and easier _ proposition.
The Grand Slam standard is another matter. Critics will carp that
Sampras has achieved ultimate success in only three of the four
major events _ Wimbledon, the Australian Open (2), and the US Open
(4) _ and that he has been a clay pigeon in the French Open. True,
but Emerson's record is not unsullied, either. He pocketed most of
his Grand Slams while adversaries such as Rod Laver and Ken
Rosewall were exiles on the professional circuit before tennis
became open to all in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Sampras has had a rose-petal path to the final,
facing not a single seed. On the other, he has been forced to cope
with self-generated roadblocks _ the pulled back muscle he suffered
while hitting with Tim Henman before the tournament and the
tendinitis in his lower left leg that developed just before his
four-set second-round struggle against Karol Kucera.
</P>
<P>
   Since the latter discomfort arose, Sampras has not even touched
a racket between matches, although he tried a light workout
Saturday. And during matches, he has been receiving treatment from
ATP Tour trainer Doug Spreen, right up through his 7-6 (7-4), 6-2,
6-4 eviction of qualifier Vladimir Voltchkov in Friday's semfinals.
He figures he has one mighty effort left in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Wimbledon, you look at how important it is to me,
to my career,'' he said, ``you just have to play through whatever
you have to play through.''
</P>
<P>
   He insists he won't be carrying Renshaw and Emerson on his
shoulders Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking at (Sunday) as pressure,'' he said. ``I'm
looking at it as an opportunity. I'd love to break it here. If not,
I have nothing to be ashamed of for what I've done these past
couple weeks. If it doesn't happen here, maybe in New York (at the
US Open), maybe next year, maybe in two years. I'm looking at it as
a great moment for tennis, a great moment for me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the greatest moment for Rafter, who has the ideal
serve-and-volley game for grass, though perhaps not the body for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Twice the US Open champion, he was ranked No. 1 in the world
midway through 1999 but wrecked his right shoulder in the first
round of the Open against Cedric Pioline, which curtailed his
defense and required rotator cuff surgery Oct. 24. His world
ranking plummeted to 21st, and there was grumbling that he didn't
deserve even the lowly seeding (12) he was awarded here.
</P>
<P>
   But Rafter won a grass-court warmup in the Netherlands before
Wimbledon, and once here, generally far removed from center stage,
he gradually fine-tuned his game before he upset world No. 1 and
Wimbledon No. 2 Andre Agassi with a heroic 7-5, 4-6, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3
semifinal victory that reversed last year's result in this
confrontation and provided 3 hours 18 minutes of incandescent
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   While he's no Grand Slam novice, Rafter figures there's nothing
quite like a Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been here many times before,'' said Rafter. ``It's my
first one here at Wimbledon. I've just got to go out there with the
same attitude I went out on the court (Friday) _ be relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   And the game plan that worked masterfully against Agassi? Forget
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Against) Andre, you have to serve well,'' said Rafter. ``I
knew I had to go out there and serve very big. Against Pete, it's
pretty well a reversal. You've got to try to get his serve back
somehow, and he's going to be serve-volleying. You've really got to
take your chances. There will be no baseline rallies. I won't be
able to chip-charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, the Californian who keeps his charisma in a closet,
knows Rafter represents his most formidable challenge by far.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing great,'' said Sampras. ``He's a great athlete,
volleys well, covers the net as well as anyone in the world. It
really comes down to how well I return against him. He's coming in
on his first final, I'm sure, very pumped up. I'm sure we'll both
walk out there a bit nervous. It should be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras contends that it won't be distracting, that tunnel
vision blocks his view of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, I'm not thinking about it at all,'' he said.
``It's the match at hand. When you're competing, you're kind of on
the inside, not looking on the outside. I'm sure two weeks from
now, a month from now, 10 years from now, I can appreciate my
career much more than (Sunday). But my legacy is really the last
thing on my mind. It's really preparing and doing whatever I can to
possibly win here.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the ages, by the way.

`SLAVE' RECOUNTS HER LONG-DISTANCE RELATIONSHIP WITH JOHN E.
ROBINSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Vicki knew him as
J.R.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those were the initials she expected John E. Robinson Sr. to
burn into her hip if she moved to Kansas to be his slave.
</P>
<P>
   She could have put up with the branding, she said. And promises
of a greenhouse job, and perhaps even a horse on his farm sounded
tempting. But something about Robinson made her hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how close I came to moving down there,'' Vicki
said last week in a telephone interview from her home in Ontario,
Canada. ``It scares me to death.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old woman said she felt sick when she recently
learned about the charges against Robinson. She asked that her last
name not be used to protect her family.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was charged in June with capital murder in the deaths
of five women whose bodies were found in barrels. Authorities also
have linked him to three women and a baby who disappeared in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the 56-year-old Olathe, Kan., man has been charged
with sexually assaulting two women he met through the Internet. The
women met with Robinson this spring at Overland Park, Kan., and
Lenexa, Kan., hotels for sadomasochistic encounters, authorities
say.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki said she carried on a six-month e-mail and telephone
relationship with Robinson that began in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Although they never met, she considered herself his slave most
of that time. If he had been willing to meet her in advance _ she
once suggested they get together in Chicago _ there is a good
chance she would have moved to Kansas to live with him, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki said her personal ad for a master had been on a Web site
for a couple of weeks when Robinson responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he usually didn't answer ads like this, but this one
caught his attention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She was looking for someone who was older, mature, caring,
financially secure and experienced. He seemed to meet the criteria,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   They began exchanging long e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd tell me about his family. I think he told me his daughter
just had a baby. ... He said he was divorced. (He is married.) ...
He told me where I'd be living with him on the farm.'' (He owns
16.5 acres in Linn County, Kan., but lived in a mobile home
community in Olathe.)
</P>
<P>
   He also told her he had five businesses, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The one that stuck in her mind, that really attracted her to
him, was a hydroponic operation. (In the 1980s, Robinson had a
hydroponic business called Hydro-Gro Inc. A booklet he published
featured water-based home gardening products.)
</P>
<P>
   Robinson told Vicki he hired people who were developmentally
challenged to work in the greenhouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably told me that after I introduced myself because
that's what I do for a living,'' she said. ``I work in a group home
for the handicapped. I've done that for 12 years. I thought, `This
is just great. Anyone who hires these people has to have a great
heart.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He told her she could work in the greenhouse supervising the
employees, she said. She had been looking for a job in the States.
His offer was appealing.
</P>
<P>
   She said they never discussed salary. It wasn't an issue in her
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being his slave, I wouldn't make any money,'' she said. ``It
would be his money.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, a convicted swindler, never asked her about her
finances, she said. They never talked about a master-slave
contract, either. In some of those pacts, the slave signs over
control of his or her finances to the master.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki said Robinson's interest in horses also interested her. He
said he used to have horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I met him I was learning how to care for horses,''
she said. ``I was working on a horse farm grooming them and
learning how to ride, and I was enjoying it. He was considering
getting another horse or two if I moved down there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki said Robinson also told her that he had spent almost 10
years living with a young woman. He had paid for her college
education, he said, and she had just graduated when she was killed
in a traffic accident. He didn't want to provide details, he said,
because talking about it upset him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really sorry for him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki said she does not think of herself as naive.
</P>
<P>
   Besides working part time in the group home, she runs a business
practicing reflexology, a natural healing art based on the belief
that the application of pressure to specific points on the body
benefits other parts of the body.
</P>
<P>
   She has organized luncheon meetings in her area for people
interested in learning about the bondage-discipline-sadomasochism
lifestyle. And she thinks she has been appropriately leery of
potential partners.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she trusted Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed him. I don't know why, but I did,'' she said. ``He
was a very smooth talker, and the picture he sent _ he looked very
respectable: black shirt, pants, boots, glasses. He had his foot up
on a fence post. Just very nice. He had a receding hairline.'' (

MINISTRY GETS SOME ON ROAD TO RECOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ They travel from town to town for 10 months a
year, engulfed in a passion that could take their lives as quickly
as it fulfills them.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, that thought hits home in the worst way. A
19-year-old fourth generation NASCAR driver dies in a practice
crash. A 30-year-old, four-circuit rookie of the year perishes in a
crash in the same area of the same racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   One would figure the most difficult thing for fellow drivers to
do would be to get in their cars moments later, lapping that same
track at the same speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those are times, the drivers say, when they are most
grateful to be a cohesive community of faith, when they are
fortunate someone stepped forward in 1987 and began Motor Racing
Outreach.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dangerous sport, and there's always the possibility
of a tragedy, and those of us who have strong faith have to help
those that don't,'' said Darrell Waltrip, one of the board members
and founders of MRO, a wide-ranging ministry that travels with
drivers throughout the series.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry has been instrumental in helping drivers cope with
the recent tragedies in NASCAR at New Hampshire International
Speedway. On Friday, four-circuit rookie of the year Kenny Irwin,
30, died from injuries suffered in a crash along Turn 3, the same
turn where 19-year-old Adam Petty was killed May 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``MRO is there for those who ask, `Why? Why did that happen? How
did that happen to such a nice man young like Adam? How could that
happen to Kenny Irwin?' Somebody has to be there to answer those
questions,'' said Waltrip. ``Somebody has to be there for those
families.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the organization has brought more camaraderie among
drivers and crew members, in part because of its outreach in most
facets of drivers' lives. Dale Jarrett agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of drivers who have that faith that helps them,
and it's the only way to get through something like this,'' he
said. ``I think that things over the last few years have brought a
lot of the guys closer to God and certainly the ministry we have
has helped a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ministry plays a part in other sports, but it is often on an
individual or team-by-team basis. And while NASCAR is deeply rooted
in the Bible Belt, Waltrip said MRO also has chaplains in Formula
One, and the Indy Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to realize something; we're not like other sports,
where we see the other competitors once or twice a year,'' said
Waltrip. ``We're racing against each other every week. We're
together five days a week every week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have everything with us. We have to have our own
ministry of travel because we don't have opportunity to go to
church at home. So, MRO is our ministry, it's our church.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have church services and Bible studies. They have
counselors to help with marital problems, advisers to help with
financial problems. They do weddings. They do funerals. It offers
day care and activities for children. Whatever has to be done,
that's our ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this a family sport, and most people relate that to
the grandstands, being able to bring their kids and their wives.
But we're talking about in here. When one of us falls, someone is
there to pick him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip said MRO was begun in 1987 by Max Helton, a California
minister who approached him, racers Lake Speed and Bobby Hillin,
and their wives. The group had begun a private ministry of their
own after being dissatisfied with the behavior of unordained
preachers who were conducting informal services.
</P>
<P>
   The MRO chaplain for Sunday's New England 300 is Dale Beaver,
who has served NASCAR for about a year. He said while many drivers
do ask why, and some suffer a crisis of faith, during racing
tragedies, others use it as an opportunity to conduct a personal
examination, reminded that the tragedy could happen to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask, `What am I doing that really matters?' '' he said.
``There are guys who might get mad at God, and we respect that. But
for a large part of them, it is an opportunity to re-prioritize. A
lot of them look at their lives and say, `What if I went right
now?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Waltrip said the ministry has particularly served younger
drivers, who ofter don't consider the probabilities of tragedy in
their sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like getting sick . . . if there aren't doctors
around, you might die. Or you might not get well,'' said Waltrip.
``That's the thing about our ministry. You might get to the point
where you need to talk about it; that's why we are here.''

   (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) a receding hairline.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki said she sent Robinson a candid shot of herself fully
dressed in a skirt and white sweater. Robinson asked for a photo of
her naked. She complied.
</P>
<P>
   The two pictures she e-mailed him are now in the hands of
detectives who are investigating Robinson, Vicki said, according to
a detective she spoke with.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Rick Roth of Lenexa said Friday that a detective did
interview Vicki but that he could not comment further.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, she said, it was ``kind of silly'' of her to
become Robinson's slave when they had not even met. But she kept
thinking they would meet.
</P>
<P>
   As his slave, Vicki provided Robinson with her daily schedule,
as he demanded. ``He wanted to know where I was all the time,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   She needed his permission to attend
bondage-discipline-sadomasochism, or BDSM, events. And she was not
allowed to let anyone touch her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made sure that I knew that my body was his,'' she said.
``That's part of being a slave. You understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people don't understand BDSM, she said. They think there's
something psychologically wrong with anyone who wants to be
controlled and gets pleasure from pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think I am a very stable, well-balanced person. ... I'm
a very strong person,'' she said. ``I run my own business. I am a
nurse, I do reflexology and I'm very much in control there.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me to give that control over the rest of my life to
someone, it's like taking a holiday. I don't have to make
decisions. I don't have to be responsible. That person is
responsible for what I do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible her mother unwittingly played a part in
encouraging her submissive side, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a toddler, she said, ``I was a very wild child.'' To
control her, her mother put her in a harness and hooked her up to a
clothesline. ``When we went camping, she had me on a harness and we
would go for walks.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was about 14, she said, she began writing stories on a
typewriter _ stories about being kidnapped. She also started
drawing pictures of torture gadgets such as a stretching rack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have read a book or watched movies, and my wild
imagination kind of grew,'' she said. ``As I got older, I found
some magazines.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki said she tried a traditional heterosexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother loved this boy,'' she said. `He would do anything,
absolutely anything, for me. Whatever I wanted was OK. I hated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted someone to make some decisions. I always have this
feeling that a man should be a man. I don't mean cruel and mean and
that type of thing, but I think he should be in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   A slave-master relationship requires more trust than a
traditional relationship, she said. A slave has to be certain that
her master will treat her well because the master has so much
control.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of being branded is ``kind of scary,'' she said. But
she can understand why a master might want to brand a slave because
``it's a symbol of being owned.''
</P>
<P>
   Vicki said she became frustrated with Robinson because he always
came up with some excuse about why they couldn't meet before living
together.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she met a new master on the Internet site where she
had met Robinson. He lives closer to her, she said, and has met her
family. They plan to marry, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson was upset when she told him she had met someone new,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   He told her she was not worthy to be his slave, she said. Then
he said it didn't matter anyway because he'd found a new slave: a
19-year-old coming over from France.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have not said anything about a Robinson link with a
French 19-year-old, and Vicki realizes she has no way of knowing
whether the woman existed.
</P>
<P>
   From what she knows of Robinson now, she said, he is ``a really,
really good liar.'' ( 30 )

RACE WILL BE FAR FROM A PLEASURE TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ They all just want to get through Sunday's NASCAR
Winston Cup Race at New Hampshire International Speedway. They'll
grit their teeth, put aside their personal pain after the death of
fellow driver Kenny Irwin during practice Friday morning, and run
hard to the checkered flag of the New England 300.
</P>
<P>
   Let the best man win.
</P>
<P>
   This Granite State whistlestop, the 18th of 34 races on the
Winston Cup tour, already loomed as difficult, especially for Petty
Enterprises, after 19-year-old Adam Petty was killed May 12 during
a Busch Series practice. Then, in a sequel that boggled the mind,
Irwin, 30, of Indianapolis, was killed Friday in a Turn 3 crash,
hitting the wall in virtually the same spot that Adam Petty did.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin drove the same No. 42 BellSouth Chevrolet Monte Carlo that
Joe Nemechek rode to Victory Lane last September at NHIS for owner
Felix Sabates. Team SABCO called Irwin's crew back to its
Charlotte, N.C., headquarters, and left the No. 40 Coors Light
Chevy, driven by Sterling Marlin, to carry the team's banner
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going through a hard time right now,'' said Marlin, who
earned a 37th starting spot after going through second-day
qualifications Saturday. ``And we're just doing whatever we can do
to get through it. Sitting through an interview just isn't
something I want to do. If you've been through losing a friend, you
know what I mean and how I feel. Our minds are with Kenny's family
right now, and that's really all I've got to say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Marlin won't be alone in his thoughts of Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   John Andretti will be similarly challenged in carrying the
banner for Petty Enterprises along with Steve Grissom, who will
substitute for the absent Kyle Petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kyle's not here, so we feel it,'' said Andretti, who qualified
second-fastest to earn a spot on the front row alongside
pole-sitter Rusty Wallace, winner of the inaugural Winston Cup race
at NHIS in 1993. ``It's tough. It's a tough situation. I feel
really close to (the Pettys) and their family is like a part of our
family. For me, my motivation is high because I want people to
remember Adam, and I feel like the best way to remember him is for
us to do well as part of an organization of which he was so key.''
</P>
<P>
   Andretti came close to winning in last year's Jiffy Lube, but
failed to capitalize when leader Tony Stewart dropped out with two
laps to go. Andretti entered the pits in second place with a chance
to emerge as the leader, needing just a splash of fuel. However,
his car coughed and wheezed when the fuel pick-up failed and
finally stalled as he attempted to exit the pits, enabling Jeff
Burton to cruise to his third consecutive NHIS victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran longer than Tony, but it seems like that got lost in
the mix,'' Andretti said. ``But I think that we've got the
capabilities of winning the race here. We've run awful strong here
before. We ran out of fuel the one race and the other (September)
race we were every bit as good as Nemechek in the (No.) 42 and got
crashed. So what are you supposed to do? You've just got to lick
your wounds, come back, and do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what everyone else will attempt to accomplish Sunday
in the aftermath of Irwin's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a lot of guys who are trying to deal with it for
the first time themselves,'' said Ricky Rudd. ``All these guys are
professionals, and I know it sounds like it's cold-blooded, but we
just have to go on.''

DOES RACE FOR POINTS PRODUCE A BLIND SPOT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ With his crutches propped against his car, racer
Terry Labonte reached down to lift his broken right leg through the
driver's side window. A small grimace crossed his reddened face.
Labonte gingerly lowered the rest of his body into the driver's
seat, taking a few deep breaths as he settled into the No. 5
Kellogg's Chevrolet. It was time for Happy Hour, the last practice
session for NASCAR Winston Cup drivers before Sunday's New England
300.
</P>
<P>
   Nursing an undisplaced fracture of the right tibia, tender ribs,
and sore back from a crash at Daytona last week, Labonte
perservered through Happy Hour. Back on &UR;  &LR; crutches after the
practice, he declared himself fit enough to last 300 laps and told
his relief driver to go home. He will compete just as he practiced,
without the benefit of painkillers or a protective cast. If Labonte
missed the New England 300 and ended his record-setting streak of
654 consecutive races, he believes his team's chance of a top 10
points finish would be jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for points, money, sponsors and spectators, NASCAR
Winston Cup drivers are willing to push the limits in a rapidly
growing sport in which one mistake or mechanical failure can result
in death. The fatal crash of 30-year-old Kenny Irwin Friday at New
Hampshire International Speedway and the death of 19-year-old Adam
Petty on the same track eight weeks earlier provided unwanted
reminders of just how high the stakes can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happened to Kenny's car and he crashed and he got
killed,'' said driver Jimmy Spencer. ``It affects all of us. We
think that we're indestructible. We think that we can't get hurt.
We think that we can't get killed. But we know that deep down
inside of us we can get killed. Do we get paid enough for what we
do with what happened to Kenny? No, we don't. But on the other side
of it, we took that in our own hands. We're the competitors. We're
the ones that decided to drive. Because Kenny got killed (Friday)
would any one of us quit? No, I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you reflect because it could happen to you. Are you
going to quit because of it? If you have that inclination, you
better quit. If you feel like you might be the next person, you
better quit driving a racecar.''
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging there is constant pressure to compete,
Labonte called his injuries ``a little setback we've just got to
work through.'' But little always has been a relative term in a
sport that exploded onto the American scene over the last decade. A
sport that began on dirt tracks in the rural South now attracts
crowds upwards of 100,000, including the approximately 300,000 fans
who fill the Brickyard for the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Serving as grand marshal of the Pepsi 400, presidential
candidate George W. Bush said the NASCAR racing community was built
around ``very good Americans.'' In fact, more Americans turn out
for NASCAR events than any other type of sports competition,
earning racecar driving bragging rights as the country's No. 1
spectator sport. Currently, 2,200 NASCAR races are held at 128
tracks in 40 states. Since 1990, attendance at NASCAR events has
increased 97 percent to the point where the sport attracted more
than 6 million fans in 1999. Network television has seen an 11
percent increase in its ratings, while cable has seen viewer
interest jump 31 percent since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the truly impressive NASCAR numbers are preceded by dollar
signs. For the 2000 season, $100 million in prize money and
postseaason awards will be distributed. Last year, 38 of the top 40
drivers won more than $1 million and a record 11 won more than $2
million. Sponsors pay up to $12 million to have their logos
displayed on cars. Sales in NASCAR merchandise reached more than $1
billion in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The different interests and investors NASCAR must satisfy on a
daily basis may help explain how a fatal crash can occur and an
event such as the New England 300 continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our procedures are to press on in cases like this,'' said Mike
Helton, NASCAR's chief operating officer and senior vice president.
``It's not because we don't have a heart or a soul. It's simply
because we have a lot of responsibilities, everybody does in the
garage area to a lot of different people.''
</P>
<P>
   The equation for NASCAR success is simple. Race fast, finish
among the top competitors, attract sponsors, earn millions. The
Exide batteries racing team figures that placing a company logo on
a car is one of the best ways to market a product. The amount of
time a car logo gets television exposure during race coverage can
be worth approximately $30 million in advertising or equivalent to
eight commercial hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't find a better marketing vehicle than a racecar going
around a racetrack,'' said Paul Mecca, director of racing for
Exide. ``You mention the death factor. It's been there since Day 1.
If you're a fan, you accept that part of the sport. The drivers
accept it. (Sponsors) accept it. It's all part of what goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   While Exide representatives added that the drivers place the
most pressure on themselves, there is unquestionably a trickle-down
effect with the sponsor's expectations falling onto the shoulders
of the racer. Some companies may sponsor cars simply to take part
in the NASCAR experience. But other businesses seek out top cars
and expect results.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more attention paid to the sport so it's a lot more
high-profile,'' said Dale Jarrett, who drives the Quality Care
Ford. ``Sponsors expect more because of the dollars they're
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Legions of loyal NASCAR fans seem to feel they always get their
money's worth. And for good reason. Being a spectator at a NASCAR
event is unlike watching any other professional sport. Fans have
the opportunity to visit the garage area during practice sessions.
They can listen to the radio communications of their favorite team.
They can walk among the different haulers and collect autographs.
They can stand in the pit area on race day. Many fans believe they
are on a first-name basis with their racing heroes, calling out for
Jeff, Dale, and Rusty over the din of revving motors.
</P>
<P>
   But the passionate fan base often wants more than access. They
need action to keep their interest. Often, action translates into
sensational crashes. While the fatal crashes of Irwin and Petty are
tragic, dark moments for NASCAR, the deaths of two young drivers
may actually strengthen the fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people will be attracted because they think it's more
dangerous than they used to think it was,'' said Jeff Burton, who
drives the No. 99 Exide Batteries car. ``Other people will become
nervous about watching people wreck. There's a lot of different
fans out there. Some fans come to the race because they like
action. What they consider action is cars spinning and wrecking. I
don't have a problem with that, if that's what people want to
watch. I just want them to understand that it is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some fans don't understand that these things hit and they hit
really hard and it hurts and it can do worse than just hurt you.
Don't think that we don't want to race fast. Don't get on us
because we say we're going too fast. Understand that we know what
it's all about. The goal is to put on a good race.''

DONATO ONE DUCK WHO WILL PONDER FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY MARRAPESE-BURRELL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don Sweeney made no bones about the fact that although he wanted
to test the waters of unrestricted free agency, he didn't want to
swim for too long. After two days and several offers, he re-upped
with the Bruins last week.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Donato, a former teammate of Sweeney's here, said his foray
into the unrestricted experience likely will last quite a bit
longer. Donato, who was traded to the Islanders for Ken Belanger
Nov. 7, 1998, spent last year with the Anaheim Mighty Ducks,
registering 30 points _ 11 goals _ in 81 games.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible he could be back in a Ducks uniform. It seems an
equal possibility he could be somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some talks and inquiries and some dialogue,'' said
Donato, reached at his South Shore home, ``but nothing that is
solid. We have some ideas and some positive things to look at but
nothing is imminent.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a bittersweet season in the land of Disney. Donato, who
saw second-line duty with Matt Cullen and Marty McInnis before Kip
Miller took McInnis's spot for the final third of the season, also
logged time on the power play and penalty kill. Donato feels he has
unfinished business in Anaheim. Donato said he spoke to the Ducks
before becoming a free agent and will likely talk to them again
before making a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good spot and a good organization,'' said Donato, who
turned 31 in April. ``I was disappointed we didn't make the
playoffs because I thought we had a team that was capable.
Production-wise, I could have and should have given more. When I
talk of unfinished business, I would like to prove a little bit
more out there. I still have a lot of confidence that I can be a
productive player in both ends of the rink and score some goals. In
general, my whole career I've always felt that I have something to
prove and this year was no different. I think the coaching staff
and all the players were disappointed and bitter at the end because
we were really trying to make a playoff run. We all felt we had
something left on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the Ducks was simple _ not enough offense after
Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne. Shut them down, the philosophy was,
and you shut down the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to somehow produce a second wave of scoring to
eliminate being able to shut down Kariya and Selanne,'' he said.
``I think that's a problem a lot of teams have, trying to get a
second wave or enough scoring so other teams don't focus completely
on the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato wants a fair salary, an opportunity to play for a
contending team, and a chance to play an important role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competitor in me thinks that wherever I go, that will
happen,'' said Donato. ``Whether it happens easy or happens hard,
whether it takes some work to get where I want to get, that will
take care of itself as long as I do the things I'm capable of
doing. It's an anxious time but inevitably it will come down to the
pressure to perform. I'm really looking forward to the season.''
</P>
<P>
   He keeps an eye on the transaction wire, knowing a few changes
in personnel here or there could impact his chances of signing with
a particular club. He said research will help him make an educated
decision about what's best for him, his wife, and three young sons.
It's likely it will take a good part, if not all, of the summer to
sort out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you would like to get it done as soon as possible
because it's nice to know where you're going,'' he said. ``Having
said that, I've prepared myself mentally to wait for as long as it
takes. It's unfortunate that I can't really name the time when it
gets done but when it's ready, I'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping an eye on Heinze
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Donato, of all people, can sympathize most with former
Bruin Steve Heinze, who was taken by Columbus in last month's
expansion draft. Donato had a hard time under Bruins coach Pat
Burns and asked to be moved. Heinze had a nightmarish 1999-00
season before being asked to be exposed in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I'm a little biased but I think he'll do well in
Columbus,'' said Donato. ``He's proven over his career that he can
score goals. I think, for whatever reason, the change will do him
good. I know he's excited about it. It definitely has the makings
of a chance to revitalize his situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing a pro sport in your home city can be a blessing and a
curse. Donato viewed his time with the Bruins as a great gift but
said he can also see where it can be a burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed my time here immensely, I wouldn't trade it for the
world,'' he said. ``There's a certain aura about being a Boston
Bruin. It was a dream come true. If you're looking for how it could
be tough for a guy from this area, for the same reason it's great
to play here _ you have relationships you have built your entire
life from people who fill your gas tank to people you knew in grade
school. As much as it's great to have them around, when things
don't go as well, it can be a burden. The pressure can weigh a
little heavier because if you're in another city you don't run into
all those people you know and you focus a little easier. Now,
(Heinze will) have a fresh start. The other thing that's probably
better is that everybody is new and starting out with a new
organization. I think that's probably a good situation for him.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   King rules the bench
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the Blue Jackets, the team hired former Canadian
national and Calgary Flames coach Dave King to take the helm for
the inaugural season. The 52-year-old King, who signed a three-year
deal, knows he faces an uphill climb. ``We're going to be a young
team, a team that has to play above our heads to compete every
night,'' said King. President and general manager Doug MacLean, who
narrowed his field of candidates to King, former Bruins coach Brian
Sutter, and Avalanche assistant Bryan Trottier, said he thought
King was the right man for the job partly because of his patience
with young players. ``That's a really important thing,'' said
MacLean. ``You have to have a person who can handle the tough
times.'' . . . Swedish 19-year-old identical twins Henrik and
Daniel Sedin, who are sensations in their homeland, arrived in
Vancouver to attend a development camp and are expected to play for
the Canucks this season. The club assigned No. 22 to left wing
Daniel and No. 33 to center Henrik. Daniel was taken second overall
in the 1999 draft and Henrik was picked third. The twins, who have
bulked up to about 200 pounds on their just over 6-foot frames,
believe they're ready to make the jump to the NHL. ``They got mixed
reviews at the World Championships, I'm very aware of that,'' said
Vancouver GM Brian Burke. ``I'm very content that they have
progressed. I think they're ready to play in the NHL. The attention
paid to them (in Sweden) was amazing. They were almost mugged every
night when they played on the road and the other team got the last
change. I've never seen two players checked like that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Back for seconds
</P>
<P>
   Imagine Mathieu Chouinard's surprise on draft day. The
20-year-old figured he'd seen the last of the Ottawa Senators since
he had been drafted by that club in 1998, but couldn't reach
contract terms, resulting in his name going back into the pool. In
the second round, the Senators were up at No. 45 and they once
again selected Chouinard. This time, though, they were able to
reach a deal. ``I know (the Senators) redrafted me because they saw
something in me,'' said the goalie, who played in the Quebec Major
Junior League the last four years. ``Now I want to prove that they
made the right choice.'' . . . Guy Carbonneau, 40, announced his
retirement after 18 years. The three-time Selke Trophy winner was
told that if he wanted it, he had a job in the Dallas Stars
organization, where he played the last five years of his career.
However, Carbonneau has also interviewed with the Montreal
Canadiens, for whom he played 12-plus years . . . Much has been
made about the uncertain future of Philadelphia center Eric Lindros
because of his history with concussions. But Edmonton's Boyd
Devereaux, after only two concussions, appears to be all done at
only 22. Devereaux was felled by a Dallas Drake hit and although he
is symptom-free, James Kelly _ the same doctor who is monitoring
Lindros _ told him he should retire. According to Kelly, Devereaux
faces permanent injury if he continues playing. Devereaux has
decided to seek other medical opinions. ``It's not like we're going
to 30 doctors until we find one that says I'm OK,'' said Devereaux.
``It's just a matter of getting as much information as we can.
That's all I can do. Ultimately, I just have to be as informed and
educated as possible.''

HOUSING EMERGES AS DOWNTOWN REDEVELOPMENT PRIORITY IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK and MARK P. COUCH  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ What should we do
about downtown?
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an eternal Kansas City quandary, and in recent years
different solutions have gone in and out of vogue. One day, a
sports arena is seen as the key. Another day, it's light-rail
transit. Or an entertainment complex. Nothing sticks, nothing gets
widespread support.
</P>
<P>
   Now there may be a clear-cut favorite: more housing, something
that could bring life to the streets.
</P>
<P>
   With the business community's Civic Council of Greater Kansas
City stepping forward and promising to back some kind of project
for downtown, The Kansas City Star tried to gauge which way
prominent downtowners might be leaning. So the paper recently asked
business leaders _ corporate chiefs, top lawyers and real estate
specialists, among others _ to name their downtown priority from
among six long-discussed ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Of almost three dozen respondents, 60 percent made housing their
preference. It was such an overwhelming choice that it beat the
next most-popular alternatives by a 4-to-1 ratio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Residential is probably the most sensible,'' said one of the
respondents, Thomas McDonnell. He is president of DST Systems Inc.
and chairman of the Civic Council, a group of top executives who
work behind the scenes on community and political causes. ``There's
a growing sense that you need residential to support a different
urban core, a more vibrant area.''
</P>
<P>
   Housing emerged as the dominant choice for a couple of reasons.
First, roomy lofts are flourishing, so they're a success upon which
downtown can build. Second, more residents downtown may lure more
entertainment, shops and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus The Star found _ if it presages what the Civic
Council eventually finds _ could add a twist to public spending
decisions about the Power &AMP; Light entertainment district, which
includes a housing component, or rail transit.
</P>
<P>
   A housing renaissance is, in fact, sweeping through downtowns
across the country. Still, those who track this trend say one thing
separating cities that concentrate on downtown housing from those
where it just pops up sporadically is a commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown projects ranked
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, Kansas City chases a different downtown cure.
Two decades ago, it was cleaning up 12th Street for a new hotel.
Fifteen years ago, it was adding shops at the base of skyscrapers.
One decade ago, it was expanding the convention center. Lately,
it's been joining the urban entertainment trend with Science City
and Power &AMP; Light.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those approaches worked, but only in limited ways.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the corridor between the River Market and Crown Center is
alternately hot and in a state of rot. There are art galleries
moving in, lofts being developed and DST Systems building offices
on the west end. And there are vacant buildings pockmarking the
loop, derelicts roaming the streets and few signs of life at night.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps fed up with this haphazard pattern, the Civic Council
announced it would hire a downtown-oriented consultant. For the
next year, the consultant won't tell Kansas City what to do, but
instead interview various downtown interests and determine what
they want to do.
</P>
<P>
   The result could be one or more preferred projects and a map of
where to locate such projects in the downtown corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Shopping mall developer Paul Copaken, who heads the Civic
Council urban core committee spearheading the study, told The
Star's editorial board recently that any resulting project would be
a ``public-private venture,'' meaning the business community
intends to work with the city government.
</P>
<P>
   As a way of sticking a finger in the winds of downtown, The Star
conducted an informal survey of influential businessmen and
businesswomen located downtown. They included executives such as
Irvine O. Hockaday Jr. and Sandra Lawrence, bankers such as Bill
Nelson and Grant Burcham, developers such as Whitney Kerr and Roger
Buford, architects such as Becky Zahner and Rafael Garcia, plus
civic-minded voices such as Clara Reyes and Bill Hall.
</P>
<P>
   All were asked their priority from among six long-proposed
ideas: sports arena, baseball stadium, aquarium, housing,
entertainment (movie//shopping) complex and rail transit. This list
didn't include a performing arts center because that's already
under way.
</P>
<P>
   Housing was named in 21 of the 34 votes _ more than the other
alternatives combined. The nearest contenders were the arena and
light rail, with five votes each.
</P>
<P>
   Those for housing came from myriad backgrounds. Some have
seemingly contrary interests. Restaurateur Rod Anderson, for
instance, is past chairman of the Convention and Visitors Bureau of
Greater Kansas City. Terry Dunn, president of J.E. Dunn
Construction Co., generally builds other things. Lawyer John Edgar,
as chairman of the city's Economic Development Corp., pursues
big-ticket projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we develop a critical mass, you're going to get retail and
entertainment driving off that,'' said Edgar, lead resident partner
of the Bryan Cave law firm and another member of the Civic
Council's urban core committee.
</P>
<P>
   Hallmark Cards Inc. President Hockaday added: ``If you simply
have a series of attractions _ tourist attractions and convention
center _ you haven't really built a comprehensive community. To do
that, you need residential, you need people.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the other alternatives, business leaders saw little need
for an arena without

CROWN DOESN'T APPEAR A FIT FOR PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Preseason publications can make you dizzy. The predictions:
Second, third, fifth place. The adjectives: Competitive.
Laughingstock. Mediocre. Long shot.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Las Vegas oddsmakers have projected the Patriots for
eight wins. Who can tell? One thing is for sure _ nobody is
crowning the 2000 Patriots NFL champions. And with good reason.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' offseason splash was hiring Bill Belichick as
coach. Their big roster moves were re-signing safety Lawyer Milloy
and wide receiver Troy Brown. New blood includes Arizona State
running back J.R. Redmond, cornerback Antonio Langham, running back
Raymont Harris, guard Lance Scott, tackle Grant Williams, and tight
end Eric Bjornson. It's not enough to make you want to fly to Vegas
to bet the over. Those wearing rose-colored glasses can point to a
healthy Ted Johnson, a happy Milloy, a rebounding Ty Law, a new
defensive scheme that should enhance the pass rushing of Willie
McGinest and Chris Slade, and a new offense that should supply Drew
Bledsoe the comfort level he had in his first four years.
</P>
<P>
   With training camp getting underway July 17, the Patriots need
the following to contend for a divisional title or wild-card spot:
</P>
<P>
   1. Redmond must be the real deal.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a good start for the third-round pick to undergo
surgery to repair an inflamed tendon in his groin. He's expected
back by mid-camp. Redmond must be a 1,200-yard rusher, a 30-plus
pass receiver, and a breakaway threat every time he touches the
ball. The Patriots have gone 15 years without gaining 4 yards per
carry for a season. This must stop, at least for Bledsoe's sake.
</P>
<P>
   2. Offensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bruce Armstrong isn't the most ideal solution, but he's
the best the Patriots can do. Making him beg for a contract isn't
becoming for a team that allegedly wants him back. Give him a fair
deal and let him play left tackle while helping groom top pick
Adrian Klemm, who is out with a torn lateral collateral ligament in
his left knee. The line will be tested and there's no room for
failure. Starting right guard Todd Rucci (knee) is sidelined for
training camp. Williams may wind up at right tackle for the
departed Zefross Moss, and whether that's an upgrade remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   3. Defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Another area in which the Patriots were curiously quiet in the
offseason, signing and then dumping journeyman end Jon Harris. The
team never made an offer to Chris Sullivan, who might have been a
good fit in this system. Between now and the start of the season
they will likely sign another journeyman for depth. They are hoping
Garrett Johnson, who played well as a full-timer in Barcelona, can
provide muscle behind tackles Chad Eaton and Henry Thomas. They
also hope Brandon Mitchell begins to blossom, and McGinest
continues to be healthy.

   4. Defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowlers Law and Milloy are impressive, but the Patriots have
real concerns in the remainder of the secondary. Tebucky Jones,
Langham, and Kato Serwanga will duke it out at right corner (also
watch for Otis Smith if the Jets release him). Free safety is also
a battle between incumbent Chris Carter, veteran Larry Whigham, and
hard-hitting second-year player Tony George.
</P>
<P>
   A look at the other AFC East teams:
</P>
<P>
   Colts: The consensus team to beat, but the biggest fear I would
have as a Colt would be what Belichick has in store for Peyton
Manning. We've seen Belichick's defenses get into Bledsoe's head.
What if Belichick does something similar to Manning? Nobody really
came after him last year until the Titans swarmed him in the AFC
Divisional playoffs. Look for more of that this year. At least
Manning has Edgerrin James at running back, but James will also be
a marked man.
</P>
<P>
   Jets: The Jets may be harder to pin down than the Patriots. This
team has taken a few hits, mainly the trade of star receiver
Keyshawn Johnson, a hole it has yet to plug. They cut kick returner
and backup running back Leon Johnson, who blew out his knee against
the Patriots in last season's opener. Offensive tackle Jumbo Elliot
is gone. Keyshawn's absence makes Wayne Chrebet the No. 1 receiver.
The Jets may sign Sean Dawkins or even acquire Carl Pickens from
Cincinnati. The Jets are banking on three of their four No. 1 picks
(quarterback Chad Pennington is a project as long as Vinny
Testaverde stays healthy) to make an impact. Tight end Anthony
Becht looks like the real deal and linebacker John Abraham has
received high marks, but defensive end Shaun Ellis has his critics.
One scout said recently, ``He's talented but he has a problem with
the mental side of the game.'' The coaching change to Al Groh could
also be a huge factor except that the system and most of the
coaching staff remains intact with Bill Parcells still running the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Bills: Doug Flutie said recently that he will be back on the
field, despite coach Wade Phillips going with Rob Johnson as his
No. 1 quarterback. The decision to bench Flutie in the playoffs
last year may become Phillips's haunting legacy. Even former Bills
great Jim Kelly said that while he considers Phillips a friend, he
can't approve of the decision to bench Flutie. Another bad sign for
this team, which will be one of the league's youngest, was cutting
fullback Sam Gash. The Patriots found out Gash brings an attitude
to the offense. The Patriots miss it and the Bills will also. This
is also a team void of the great Bruce Smith, who can still be
productive. But the Bills have drafted well lately and their young
players will be put to the test. The Bills must also replace
receiver Andre Reed. At least they have a viable option in Peerless
Price.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins: They used to have a problem with their running game.
Now they have a problem with their passing game and running game.
The post-Dan Marino Era begins. Don't expect much. Their defense is
still strong enough to win those 12-10 games. But there will be
times when quarterbacks Jay Fiedler or Damon Huard need to put
points on the board. This team also took a hit on its coaching
staff. Jimmy Johnson never won anything in Miami, but he still had
the respect of his players and the community because he had two
Super Bowl rings. Dave Wannstedt must now prove he is more than the
unsuccessful coach he was in Chicago.

<P>
   It's a tad condescending, but the Jets are holding a one-day
``seminar'' for the New York media Tuesday to explain football.
About 30 media types have signed up for Football 101. On the
itinerary: ``Put your thinking cap on,'' a salary cap lesson by
vice president Mike Tannenbaum; ``Mining the middle of the field
with the passing game,'' with tight ends coach Ken Whisenhunt;
``Run to daylight _ how to find it,'' by assistant head
coach/running backs coach Maurice Carthon; and one that should be a
crowd favorite, ``What really is a two-deep zone?'' by secondary
coach Bob Sutton . . . Former Pittsburgh director of football
operations Tom Donahoe said he will take the year off, but he's
beginning to miss the game already. ``I'm going to enjoy the time
with my family because it may be the only time I ever get to do
this. But sometime before next season I'd like to be with an
organization.'' The situation in Miami didn't pan out, and Donahoe
turned down the job of director of football operations with the
Patriots before Belichick was hired. Donahoe enjoyed his
conversations with Bob and Jonathan Kraft, and even after Belichick
was hired the Krafts hoped Donahoe and Belichick could coexist.
Donahoe shied away because he had just lost his power struggle with
coach Bill Cowher in Pittsburgh. But as Donahoe said, ``If I can
work with Cowher, I can work with anybody.'' With Donahoe still
available, the Patriots have left a personnel job open . . . In
Chad Cascadden, the Patriots acquired another Tedy Bruschi type.
Cascadden has played on the edge and is best as a pass-rushing
weakside linebacker. At 6 feet 1 inch, 240 pounds, he has been
slowed by injuries _ a nagging turf toe that has affected him the
last two years, and last season's knee surgery for a torn ACL.
Cascadden used to be an excellent special teams player and may
replace Marty Moore, now of the Browns, in that role . . . One of
the more interesting stories in the Jets' camp will be that of
defensive back Kevin Williams, who was in a coma for two weeks last
season after undergoing three surgeries for an infection in his
throat and lungs. Williams's agent, Jerome Stanley, got into a war
of words with Parcells, calling him insensitive when the former
coach wanted to limit Williams's pay. Williams is shooting for a
job as a nickel back . . . Former Patriot Ferric Collons's right
rotator cuff is healed and the defensive end is making his push to
become a 49er at minimum salary . . . The 49ers are expected to be
a doormat given they've lost Steve Young to retirement and half
their team to the salary cap. The quarterback battle will be
interesting. Jeff Garcia is the starter, but Rick Mirer, banished
from New York after Jets players and coaches questioned his
leadership, could wind up competing. Don't forget, Bill Walsh sided
with Mirer during the Bledsoe-Mirer draft debates in 1993. Walsh
has always thought Mirer could thrive in the West Coast offense.
Bledsoe, a good friend of Mirer's, said recently, ``To be
considered the top pick, and being the second player chosen in that
draft, there's no question Rick has always had the talent. I always
thought that if he got into a system that was best suited for him,
you'd finally see it. Some quarterbacks come of age when they get
to be 27 or 28 years old. Rick is right around that. He's been
around long enough to know what he can and can't do. I'm sure he's
learned from those experiences and really, he's never been in a
good one. Maybe this time he'll find where he belongs.'' . . .
Don't rule out Seattle winding up with Dawkins again. Agent Angelo
Wright said if offers from the Jets and Packers are substandard, he
may return to the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Midnight has come
</P>
<P>
   Despite his Cinderella season, league and Super Bowl MVP Kurt
Warner has little leverage when it comes to a new deal. He's an
exclusive rights free agent, which basically means he must take the
Rams' offer or hold out. The Rams don't want to kill their salary
cap, and they still have Trent Green, who was supposed to be the
starter last season. But the Rams are serious about keeping Warner
and may offer a sizable one-year deal ($4 million) and then wait
and see whether Warner is really worth a megadeal . . . The
Chargers' Junior Seau is expected to end his days as a two-way
player. Last year, the future Hall of Fame linebacker spent some
time as an H-back and caught two passes for 8 yards . . . Patriots
fans might disagree with Dallas owner Jerry Jones's assessment of
new offensive coordinator Jack Reilly, who was Bledsoe's
quarterback coach the past two years. ``What I like about Jack is
that he's real imaginative,'' said Jones. Where was that
imagination in the second half of last season? . . . Kevin Greene
retired after last season, but the 38-year-old pass rusher is
having second thoughts. Greene is being considered by the Jaguars,
especially if Tony Brackens, who is looking for a contract in the
$7-$8 million-per-year range, holds out . . . The Jets may not be
able to afford tackle Eric Swann, but their defensive line coach,
Ray Hamilton, is the man who made Swann good enough to land in the
NFL after playing semipro ball for Hamilton in Lynn. Swann is
rumored to be a salary cap hit by the Cardinals, and when he is
released should get serious interest. Swann is from North Carolina
so the Panthers could have a leg up . . . The Giants believe they
drafted the next superstar running back in Ron Dayne. The Heisman
Trophy winner has looked like the real deal in minicamps. Now the
problem is getting him signed. Giants coach Jim Fassel wants Dayne
at training camp from Day One . . . The Eagles would love to get
their hands on Chiefs guard Dave Szott, a 10-year veteran, but it
doesn't appear Kansas City will trade him. Szott has asked to be
traded after moving his family to New Jersey, where his handicapped
son can receive the best medical care. Szott would prefer either
New York team or Philadelphia, but the Chiefs haven't been able to
trade his $1.8 million contract. Szott is contemplating retirement
if he can't be moved . . . Anthony Dorsett, son of Hall of Fame
running back Tony Dorsett, is the leading candidate to be named the
Raiders' starting free safety, replacing Eric Turner, who died of
cancer in June . . . It's not quite as bad as working in a coal
mine, but the worst job in the NFL this summer will be as a New
Orleans Saint. Owner Tom Benson has moved training camp from the
cooler confines of LaCrosse, Wis., to Nicholls State University in
southwest Louisiana. Those two-a-days should be nothing short of
hell.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Summer camp dilemma
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island state senator John Celona (D-N. Providence) said he
will lead a campaign to introduce legislation in January to help
subsidize Bryant College so it can continue to house Patriots
training camp. Celona is looking for money to refurbish and upgrade
the practice fields and keep the team from moving to another site
while assisting the college with costs associated with the team
staying in Smithfield. After this camp, the Patriots have one year
remaining on their lease. ``The Patriots are an asset to the state
and we certainly don't want to lose them,'' said Celona. ``We
understand the economic impact they create to the businesses around
Bryant and 10 minutes away in Providence.'' The Patriots will be
unable to start camp at Bryant because the college is remodeling
its dormitories. The Patriots will spend the first week in
Foxborough, then move to Bryant. They'll spend only 10 days in
Smithfield because of a schedule that includes a scrimmage against
the Giants July 27 at UMass; a game against the 49ers July 31 in
Canton, Ohio; and an exhibition game in Pontiac, Mich., against the
Lions four days later . . . The Patriots gave running back/receiver
Patrick Pass, a seventh-round pick out of Georgia, a three-year
deal worth $846,000, with a $20,000 signing bonus. About $200,000
will count against the salary cap. As more signings come, the
Patriots will have to begin releasing veterans.

BIG SISTER SQUARES MAJOR ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ If one kid has a bauble, naturally her sister wants
one, too. A watch, earrings, a necklace, whatever. Little Sister
Serena sported a major title, the 1999 US Open, so Big Sister Venus
went out and got her own Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was called Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   She will wear that honor the rest of her days, dine out on it if
she so chooses, maybe add a few more to earn an alcove in the
International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing like the first one,'' said Martina
Navratilova, whose nine Wimbledons more than qualified her for next
Saturday's Hall anointing.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing that ever happened on Centre Court quite measured up
to the joy of this first one. Never before had the old sod been
used as a trampoline _ until 20-year-old Venus Ebone Starr Williams
came along.
</P>
<P>
   She had just stolen another point from the woman she stole the
title from, Lindsay Davenport _ stolen it with those endlessly long
and churning legs that overtook a distant, fleeing ball, whereupon
Venus dispatched it with a roaring forehand, the sort of thing she
had been doing throughout. Too much so for an uncertain Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   Only this point was the last of the crowning 6-3, 7-6 (7-3)
triumph, and suddenly Venus was airborne, springing toward the
sullen sky as though those wondrous legs had become pogo sticks.
Boing! Boing! Boing! . . . while superhappy pappy, Richard
Williams, was doing a soft-shoe on the roof of a nearby TV booth.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing those steps overhead, an occupant, ex-champ Chris Evert,
didn't know who was dancing on her ceiling until later. But she
recalled ``a visit from Papa W. and daughters about 10 years ago,''
and how Venus had admired her Wimbledon mementos, smaller replicas
of the massive sterling platter. Venus had said she was going to
get one some day.
</P>
<P>
   Now this was the day for the real thing, the fancy silver dish,
an ornament with which Venus pranced about the venerable arena,
bubbling over with pride and jubilation, teeth and eyes sparkling.
It was an occasion that pappy _ sire and inspirer of Big and Little
Sister _ labeled ``VENUS' PARTY'' on a slate he held aloft.
</P>
<P>
   The festivity made you hope that a sickly, reclusive old woman
in East Orange, N.J., was watching and remembering her golden hours
as a pioneer. Watching and savoring the fun, the success of her
successor for whom she had waited 42 years. She is 72-year-old
Althea Gibson, who busted through a color wall in 1950 at the US
Championships, desegregating tennis as Jackie Robinson had done for
baseball three years before. Wimbledon's initial African-American
female champion in 1957, she repeated the following year _ also
winning the US Championship both years _ before receding from view.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson next appeared at the All England Club 10 years ago to
cheer for Zina Garrison, and hope that the Texan could follow in
her sneakersteps. But Navratilova was too strong in that final.
</P>
<P>
   Slowed by a stroke, apparently strapped financially, she can get
no closer to the world outside her small house than through a TV
screen. ``But,'' said Garrison, ``Althea sent a message for Venus
with me. `Move your feet and bend your knees.' I didn't deliver
it,'' Zina said with a smile. ``I didn't want to distract Venus
from her planning, but I let her know Althea was with her. She
appreciated that.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus moved her feet as though she was trying to cover 42 years
of ground in one afternoon and catch up to Althea's legacy. That
she did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the historical significance of this,'' Venus said. ``I
hope Althea saw it.'' Gibson was the icon, and the question
surrounding every promising African-American girl who came along
was, ``Is she the next Althea?''
</P>
<P>
   Big and Little Sister are the next somebodies to subjugate the
opposition as tall, thunderbolt-serving Althea did for almost three
years. Nevertheless, they're aware and admiring of the breakthrough
she made, pleased to be her heirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must have been harder in her day, when she was the first,''
said Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it was. Gibson wasn't welcome universally at American
tournaments, and made little in those amateur times. Nothing like
today. Agents pursued the now abundantly wealthy Sisters fervently,
throwing money and commercial deals at them. Althea made decent
cash merely one year as a pro, in the neighborhood of $100,000, but
in a meaningless role. She and Karol Fageros played one-set matches
on a basketball floor, the warm-up act for the Harlem
Globetrotters.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the 1977 victory of Englishwoman Virginia Wade has
there been such a heartening celebration. The crowd sang ``For
She's a Jolly Good Fellow!'' to Virginia. Queen Elizabeth II, who
detests tennis, appeared to present the awards.
</P>
<P>
   But other than the serenade, 1977 was just another Wimbledonian
silent movie. Suitable reserve and humility amid royalty, although
in 1967, John Newcombe did confide to the presenter, Princess
Marina, that his evening activities would include many toasts,
leading to inebriation.
</P>
<P>
   But a microphone has been newly added, enabling Venus to tell
the multitude of 13,812 how delighted she was, and that she'd
dreamed of this day over and over only, laughingly, ``to wake up
and find it was a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   She charmed them with her uninhibited elation, forgetting to
curtsy to the Duchess of Kent as she received her silver, but who
cared? Big Sister is even with Little Sister in the matter of major
possessions, and the two are only growing in sinew, speed, and
acumen.
</P>
<P>
   After a miserable spring following a long layoff to cure
tendinitis in both wrists, Venus stayed true to daddy's dictates:
go for your shots no matter what. That produced ugly losses,
horrendous errors, as well as winners. But the winners outnumbered
mistakes Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never saw her hit such good forehands,'' said Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   It's as though Venus lectured the balls, ``Do what I tell you or
I'll bash you even harder.'' That's Serena's philosophy, too.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if the old Concord, Mass., scribe, Louisa May Alcott,
could observe these two _ the only sisters to hold major
championships simultaneously _ scrapping to see who can collect the
most baubles and get to the top first, she'd probably rewrite her
bestseller and call it ``Big Women.''

VENUS VIBRANT IN FINAL VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Protocol has its place, and the All England Lawn Tennis
&AMP; Croquet Club is its headquarters. It is considered the cathedral
of tennis, the grass of Centre Court its altar. And the tournament
that has graced its sacrosanct turf for the past 114 years,
Wimbledon, is the sport's Holy Grail.
</P>
<P>
   But protocol was evicted from the grounds Saturday, taking pomp
and pretension with it. They were driven out by a glorious new
people's champion _ 20-year-old Venus Williams, granddaughter of a
Louisiana sharecropper; product of a Compton, Calif., slum; protege
of a devoted, flamboyant father; and the first African-American
woman to reign here in 42 years. She stood tradition on its head by
doing just about everything except standing on hers to celebrate
her 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) dethroning of 1999 champion Lindsay Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just pretty happy at that point,'' said Williams,
``because I had let a lot of opportunities go in the second set.
Finally, I pulled the tiebreak out without a huge, huge struggle
against myself. I was pretty happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The spontaneity was electrifying. Suddenly, this citadel of
stuffed shirts was a party palace. Moments after Davenport plunked
a service return off the net cord, giving Williams the match, the
new champion began dancing jubilantly around the court. She didn't
abandon tennis etiquette, shaking hands with Davenport and umpire
Gerry Armstrong.
</P>
<P>
   And then she really let loose.
</P>
<P>
   She skipped and pranced back across the court, then vaulted into
the stands at the southeast corner, with her 6-foot-1-inch frame
loped to the box reserved for friends and family. Her father and
mentor, Richard, was dancing by now, too, having stepped out of the
box and onto the roof of the broadcast booth just below. He had
been an inescapable presence, holding up an erasable board with
greetings to his wife, praise for the British fans, a plug for a
soft drink, and, in a thoroughly erroneous message, a proclamation
that ``It's Venus's party and no one was invited.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, everyone was, because Venus hadn't noticed her father's
antics during the match.
</P>
<P>
   Now in victory, they exchanged a sort of hug, awkward because of
their respective positions, and Venus resisted the efforts of some
idolators to hoist her up with Richard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be picked up,'' she said. ``My height, if I
fall, it's going to be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the most poignant moment. Venus leaned into the family
box and exchanged a lingering embrace with her 18-year-old sister
Serena, whom circumstances had cast as her opponent in an
unprecedented sibling semifinal Thursday whose hoopla resonated
throughout the world. Venus won that encounter in straight sets,
but it obviously was an unwelcome task. Still, Serena _ who
preceded Venus to the Grand Slam throne by winning the US Open last
September _ was overjoyed as she whispered to her big sister,
``Great job.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really, really getting emotional there, trying to hold
it in,'' said Venus.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 13,812 was unable to do so. Suddenly, Centre Court
sounded like a whooping, hollering hootenanny that subsided only
for the official presentation of the silver championship platter _
called, foretellingly enough, the Venus Rosewater Trophy _ by the
Duchess of Kent.
</P>
<P>
   So it was official, this victory that had been years in the
making. Exiting the court, Richard, who otherwise refused comment
because ``this is Venus's day,'' was asked by a fan when he gave
Venus her first lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years, six months, one day,'' he replied without
hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   Venus doesn't remember that far back, but she does recall that
from the beginning, she and Serena had been groomed to become
champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was meant to be,'' she said, ``because I worked real hard
all my life. In our family, it's positive. We don't just work to be
professional. We're happy to be on the circuit. We worked hard to
be the best because for us, why play if we don't believe we can be
the best?''
</P>
<P>
   The prime of Althea Gibson, who in 1957 and '58 became the first
African-American woman to prevail here, was before their time, but
the Williams sisters _ who unlike so many tennis toddlers with
tunnel vision were raised to appreciate all of life _ were keenly
aware of her role as a racial trailblazer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be hard because people were unable to see past
color,'' said Venus. ``Still, these days it's hardly any different
because you have to realize it's only been 40 years (since Gibson's
achievement). How can you change years and centuries of being
biased in 40 years?''
</P>
<P>
   A more contemporary role model was Zina Garrison, who in 1990
became the only other African-American woman to reach the Wimbledon
final, losing to Martina Navratilova. While Garrison progressed
through the draw, beating Monica Seles and Steffi Graf along the
way, the Williams sisters were busy practicing under their father's
tutelage. But he would stop a passerby walking his dog and ask him
the score of Garrison's matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was only 10,'' said Venus. ``But that meant a lot to us.''
</P>
<P>
   She hopes her ascension will prove similarly inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people will look and see,'' said Williams.
``But you also have to get out there and help out, let people see
you start programs. That would definitely be something that I and
especially my dad could help to start.''
</P>
<P>
   She took matters into her own hands here, buying herself a gown
to wear to Sunday's champions' ball the day she left her Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla., home for London. She was upset with herself for
losing in the French Open quarterfinals and ``felt I didn't deserve
to spend any money.''
</P>
<P>
   But she bought the dress, about which she won't reveal any
details until Sunday, and used it as extra incentive ``because if I
didn't win, I wouldn't get to wear this wonderful dress.''
</P>
<P>
   Seeded fifth, she was the belle of the ball here. On the road to
the final, she beat the world's and Wimbledon's top-ranked player,
Martina Hingis, ``and I took out No. 8, which was not easy'' _
because that happened to be Serena. Davenport, whom Richard
Williams praised as a class act ``who never has a bad word to say
about anybody,'' had traveled a less perilous path but was still
feeling the effects of thigh and back problems that had sidelined
her for two months this year.
</P>
<P>
   And both finalists suffered a case of nerves. That accounted for
the improbable total of 11 break points in the two sets, six of
which Williams won and eight of which occurred in a nine-game
second-set stretch. And that was the difference, along with a
service game that betrayed Davenport. Besides that, she was simply
unable to reach many of Williams's returns that found the corners
like darts.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, it was as if Davenport were embodying Richard
Williams's words as she assessed the impact of the Williams
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the first African-American to win (Wimbledon) since
Althea Gibson, and no (black) has been in the final since Zina,''
said Davenport. ``Obviously, that's a huge step. I would have liked
to not have let her won, to stop it. But her and Serena are going
to win many more titles. They've been great influences in the game.
To see everything that they've gone through and their athleticism,
they're showing that tennis players can be very athletic. I mean,
they've done great things for the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's all it is, Venus emphasized, because if there's one
thing her father taught her, it's perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized I wouldn't be any happier in my life in general if
I won or lost,'' she said. ``After Serena won the US Open, you can
see that she's the same person. So for my tennis career, this is
great. But as far as being Venus, it doesn't really make a huge
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   But she does. In yet another departure from routine here,
Williams left the clubhouse through the front door, allowing the
public to touch her trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, is traditional for a people's champion.
</P>

MARRIED SURGICAL TEAM'S CARING PRACTICE TOUCHES MANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   COLUMBIA, Mo. _ A few minutes before
beginning surgery on 3-month-old Elizabeth Quigley, neurosurgeon
David Jimenez cradled the smiling baby in his arms and paraded her
around the waiting room, proudly showing her off.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her parents, Venecia and Kevin Quigley of Kansas City, couldn't
help but smile. Amid the stress of having their first child
operated on to remove a piece of bone from her skull, Jimenez's
caring gesture comforted them.
</P>
<P>
   The affection with which Jimenez and his wife, plastic surgeon
Constance Barone, treat their little patients has won them fans
among families throughout the country who seek treatment for
craniosynostosis at the University of Missouri-Columbia Hospital
and Clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those families learned about the husband-wife surgery
team from the Internet, others by word of mouth from other surgeons
and pediatricians. Jimenez and Barone have treated tiny patients
from North Carolina, Arizona, California _ even Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   In craniosynostosis, a suture in a baby's skull (where the bones
join together) closes too early, causing the head to grow
unnaturally. Some of the babies' heads grow exceptionally long and
thin, or the babies develop a seriously protruding forehead or
asymmetrical face with a drooping eye or nose. Doctors aren't sure
what causes it.
</P>
<P>
   The most common form occurs in three to five babies for every
1,000 live births, usually in males.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez and Barone have headed MU's craniofacial program since
they were recruited in 1992. They want to try new things to put
babies through as little trauma as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That's why they've developed endoscopic strip craniectomies to
treat most of the craniosynostosis cases they have. The old way to
do these surgeries was to cut open the child's head from ear to
ear, pull the scalp down in front and back, then remove the
prematurely closed suture and remold the head using plates and
screws.
</P>
<P>
   They thought there must be a better way.
</P>
<P>
   So they started using an endoscope, which allows them to just
make a couple of small incisions and then use a machine that lets
them see inside the skull on a monitor next to the operating table.
Then they do their surgical work.
</P>
<P>
   The endoscope, along with their attention to detail, allows them
to do the surgeries quickly and with little blood loss and
swelling.
</P>
<P>
   To Venecia Quigley, Jimenez and Barone aren't stereotypical
hotshot surgeons, too busy and too smart to tend to families' fears
and needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're personable. They're human,'' she said. ``They're not
above anybody else. The `Dr.' in front of their name is just
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   A big move
</P>
<P>
   Missouri was a bit of a culture shock for this husband-wife
surgical team when they moved from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Barone looked out the windows as they flew into Missouri and
thought, ``There's so much land. There are no big buildings.
There's just a lot of room and there's cows everywhere. I said to
my husband, `Are you on drugs?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But they decided to give MU a try. In their first weeks they
wondered if they had made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   On one of their first Friday nights in Columbia, they finished
working around 11 and wanted to find a good restaurant and have
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was open. Not even the Dairy Queen.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed some, mercifully, and now the couple usually
can find a restaurant open late.
</P>
<P>
   That's good because their work at the hospital keeps them
incredibly busy. Besides craniosynostosis surgeries, Jimenez
operates on brain tumors and other brain conditions in adults and
children.
</P>
<P>
   Barone also does many surgeries to repair cleft palates and
other body part abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez got his medical degree from Temple University in
Philadelphia, and Barone earned hers at the Mount Sinai School of
Medicine in New York. They met in 1985 while both worked at Temple
University.
</P>
<P>
   The craniosynostosis surgeries, which they do together, are
especially satisfying. After all, what could be better than helping
parents who are worried sick about their child's diagnosis?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've really done a service,'' Barone said, sitting in her
husband's office between patient visits. ``When it's done, they're
just so happy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the goal Barone and Jimenez had in mind when they decided
to take an old technique _ the strip craniectomy, in which a small
piece of bone is removed from the skull to allow it to grow
normally _ and married it to a newer technology, the endoscope.
</P>
<P>
   In the standard surgery, the infants endured a lot of swelling
and a large loss of blood, often requiring transfusions. The
patients usually have to stay in the hospital for three or four
days.
</P>
<P>
   Barone and Jimenez sometimes do the traditional surgery on older
babies who need to have the condition repaired. They used to do it
on every patient.
</P>
<P>
   That was before they had a baby of their own.
</P>
<P>
   When their son was born four years ago, they realized they
wouldn't want him to endure such an ordeal if he had
craniosynostosis. They knew they had to develop a better way.
</P>
<P>
   The way they do it now, the infants have very little swelling,
lose very little blood and usually can leave the hospital the day
after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   After surgery, the children wear molding helmets up to about
their first birthdays so their heads grow into a rounder shape.
</P>
<P>
   Some surgeons say endoscopic surgery has its own risks, though.
A tiny slip could result in serious damage, or even death.
</P>
<P>
   But Barone calls the old way ``barbaric'' and says she doesn't
have a lot of respect for old-school surgeons _ especially male _
who have a condescending attitude toward their patients and toward
new techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are so unapproachable,'' she said. ``Their results are
great and nobody can question them. You ask them, `How do your
patients do?' `Good.' You ask, `Do you have pictures?' `No.' `Do
you have measurements?' `No.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez jumps in.
</P>
<P>
   ``(You ask,) `Have you even seen them recently?' `No,' '' he
said, laughing lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez and Barone pride themselves on their follow-up with the
87 patients they've treated so far using the endoscopic strip
craniectomy.
</P>
<P>
   They see the infants several times in their first year of life.
They always take measurements, charting each child's progress
toward a nice, round head. They have a Christmas party every year
for the children who have had the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dedication proves popular
</P>
<P>
   Families enjoy the personal attention during a heart-wrenching
time.
</P>
<P>
   As she sat in her living room recently, rocking her 4-month-old
son, Jack, Kerri Smith of Shawnee recalled the first meeting she
and husband Sean had with Jimenez, on May 31.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting lasted an hour and 15 minutes, much longer than
their consultation with a local surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez used a skull model to show what they would do in
surgery, and he talked about earlier patients fondly. He showed
them a book of statistics on other infants he had operated on,
showing how little blood they lost and how their head shape
improved.
</P>
<P>
   That persuaded the Smiths to take Jack there for surgery. Two
weeks after the surgery, Jack wears a small helmet that is helping
to shape his head properly. He will have to wear it until he is
about a year old to make sure that the head doesn't revert to the
long, thin shape it had before the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other families that have brought their children to MU
for craniosynostosis surgery, the Smiths studied the team's Web
site before arriving for a consultation.
</P>
<P>
   Jimenez said he welcomes all the research that families do on
the Internet. He invites their questions, sparked by the
information they've come across on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Smith is in awe of the two surgeons, who care enough about
their patients to try to find less traumatizing ways to do surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Looking across the room at little Jack, his head round in its
little helmet, Smith said, ``I think they're absolute geniuses.'' (

HILL UNLIKELY TO FIND MUCH MAGIC IN ORLANDO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why do I have a hard time understanding the reason Tim Duncan
may soon follow Grant Hill to Orlando? Because it is the only way
this whole thing makes sense. Hill is a great player in his own
right who would do well on his own, but also someone who needs to
hitch his wagon to someone even better. That someone is Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would Hill leave Detroit, a team which had a better
record last year than Orlando, to play with, oh, Tracy McGrady?
That is what's called a lateral move and Hill would be no closer to
the title he covets. He'd also be sacrificing a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   It might be more easily explained if Hill was upset with the
Pistons, didn't like management, didn't like the environment, or
didn't like his teammates, but that isn't the case. He had the ear
of the owner. He lobbied hard and successfully for the appointments
of Joe Dumars and George Irvine, both of whom were only recently
hired. He lobbied hard and successfully for player acquisitions
such as Christian Laettner and Michael Curry, who joined the team
last season.
</P>
<P>
   It just didn't work out and there's no real reason to believe it
will improve significantly any time soon. There is hope in Orlando,
but unless Duncan joins the team, it's not a sure thing.
(Reportedly, Wednesday is D-Day for Duncan.)
</P>
<P>
   Hill said he likes Orlando because the Magic have a plan. You'd
better believe they do and that plan is to have Duncan and Hill in
Hooterville. The two are friends, share the same agent and the same
vision of the game. Who knows, maybe their first pick-and-roll
together was for Duncan to set the screen and Hill to come out and
announce his intentions, making it easier for his friend to follow
suit.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another reason for the inevitable union. Hill has to
know what most everyone else knows: He's not The Man. He tried to
be The Man in Detroit and you saw what happened: Good stats, annual
All-Star appearances, and annual playoff disappointments. The next
playoff series Hill wins will be his first.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the future in Orlando, which, in addition to this
apparently successful free agent assault, is Florida-sun bright.
The Magic, already blessed with a decent roster, have a ton of No.
1 picks in the next few years, two of them extracted on draft
night. Those might not necessarily translate into players, but they
are bargaining chips welcome at any NBA table. The Pistons don't
have such promise, but, again, without Duncan, how valuable is the
Orlando future?
</P>
<P>
   If Duncan re-signs with the Spurs, there's still the ongoing
question of David Robinson's health (the Admiral turns 35 next
month) as well as an old team that already had its moment in the
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in the other Florida intangibles _ weather, Doc Rivers,
smallish city, great practice facility _ and you basically have a
slam dunk. Duncan also has to know that going to Orlando represents
a 50 percent reduction in annual Shaq meetings, not to mention
similar cuts against Portland and Phoenix. And, by extension, it
also means four games a year against Cleveland, New Jersey,
Atlanta, Washington, and all those other Eastern Conference powers.
</P>
<P>
   We may know soon. We may have to wait until Aug. 1. Duncan may
not be saying much, but Hill already has made it known where he's
going to be next season. And if Duncan doesn't join him, the
ex-Piston is going to find a lot more Waffle Houses and Shoney's in
central Florida, but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   Ask yourself this: Why on earth would he allow that to happen?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Keeping the cap on
</P>
<P>
   The Magic can get Duncan and Hill via the conventional free
agent route, but the only way they could add McGrady would seem to
be via sign-and-trade for one of their people already under
contract. That would keep their cap room intact. If McGrady is
serious about going to Orlando, and that would mean rejecting
Chicago's overtures, then the Raptors should push hard for the
Orlando player they want. Given Toronto's point-guard situation,
Darrell Armstrong would be the logical target along with some of
those first-rounders the Magic have been hoarding. Orlando also
will then turn its attention to valuable returnees Bo Outlaw and
Ben Wallace, who already have cap holds. Outlaw is believed to have
agreed to a wink-wink deal in excess of $4 million-per while
longtime agent Steve Kauffman reports that he has received more
calls about Wallace (17-plus teams at last count) than he has for
any client he's ever had. The Celtics were one, but Wallace should
stay where he is . . . One of the now-common practices of teams
pursuing free agents is to send its target a jersey with the
player's name on the back. The Knicks make a big deal of that and
went so far as to send a jersey to Danny Fortson, among others. But
the Celtics might have topped everyone in their pursuit of Austin
Croshere. Rick Pitino and Croshere were meeting in Santa Monica,
Calif., and in walked GM Chris Wallace with a Celtics jersey with
Croshere's name on the back. If I'm Austin Croshere, I have two
main questions for Boston: 1. Why would I leave a team that made it
to the NBA Finals to play for a team that may not make the playoffs
and; 2. Where would I play given that Antoine Walker is there? The
money issue is moot: He'll get it in a sign-and-trade. But assuming
the money is equal, why leave a good team with a lot of young
talent for one that hasn't made the playoffs in five years and
without a lot of promise? And where would he play? The Celtics
think he can play small forward, but that might be a reach,
especially on defense. He's a power forward, which is where Walker
plays. The Celtics also love Croshere's attitude and work ethic.
But you have to ask yourself why he'd leave Indiana for Boston . .
. As for Fortson, the Celtics want to re-sign him and then deal
him; that way they get something in return. The problem in a
straight swap is NBA math. If Fortson's new deal increases by 15
percent over what he made last year _ and it should _ then the
complicated base-year compensation rules apply. If, for instance,
Boston re-signed Fortson to a deal, which started out at $4
million, and then traded him to the Knicks, the Celtics could only
take back a player who made about $2 million. That's why the talk
of Chris Childs for Fortson is off the mark; he makes well more
than half of anything that Fortson might get. The Knicks are more
interested in Fortson at the $2.25 million exception, which is
probably the case for most clubs. Otherwise, a third team would
again have to be involved and Fortson isn't the kind of player who
normally would generate such interest . . . As for the pursuit of
Jermaine O'Neal, the Celtics thought of it as actually being only 1
1/2 picks, rather than three first-rounders. The reason? They were
getting No. 28 from Portland (the half). And they felt O'Neal was
at least worth the 11th pick. In addition, they would have been
able to dump some money, which would not have affected their cap
situation, but would have delighted Paul Gaston. The feeling is
that the Blazers want to see what happens with Brian Grant before
making a decision on O'Neal . . . The Dallas Mavericks let people
know Friday that Michael Finley is being considered for the US
Olympic Team opening created by Hill's decision not to go to
Sydney. Apparent first choice Kobe Bryant supposedly isn't
interested and the Mavs have been told that Finley, Jalen Rose, and
Eddie Jones are also being considered.

</P>
<P>
   Second-guessing
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian Olumide Oyedeji might have slipped to the second round
in the draft, but he already is making a run at first-team
All-Interview. Oyedeji noted that he abused Darius Miles during the
Nike Hoop Summit, adding, ``If (Miles) comes to my country, he
couldn't make my national team. He cannot make my Under-22 team.''
Oyedeji was thought by some to be a lottery pick _ he worked out
twice for Boston and Dallas had him in for five days. He ended up
going to Seattle with the 42d pick. ``It's one of the more shocking
things I've seen in a long time,'' said Chris Wallace. ``This was a
guy who was heavily scrutinized by a lot of lottery and
near-lottery teams and he went in the 40s.'' What made it even more
stunning was that Oyedeji was the only foreign player who was
unequivocally free to play in the NBA next season. Maybe the teams
that saw him more than once noticed more blemishes the second time
around. Maybe he just got on a Cliff Robinson/Rashard Lewis slide
and couldn't get off. Who knows? Oyedeji called his precipitous
drop ``a lot of politics'' and vowed to make the teams that passed
him regret it. ``It's like a salt wound in the heart I have to
overcome.'' . . . Here's a shocker. The 76ers are believed to be
considering anything short of Acie Earl in a deal for Matt Geiger.
Then again, maybe Acie would do it, given the Sixers'
disenchantment with Geiger. The problem will be finding a taker for
the remaining four years (and 30-something million) as well as a 15
percent trade kicker . . . The Miami Heat are asking season
ticket-holders to make their full deposits by Saturday for next
season. That is asking a lot, given that teams can't do any
signings until Aug. 1. It might help if Miami's legendary
motivator, Pat Riley, could persuade Jones to announce his
intentions by then. The Heat are at the top of Jones's wish list,
but, of course, Miami can't offer him anything more than the $2.25
million exception because of its salary cap situation. But it could
offer him a new deal starting in 2001, starting at $11 million, by
using the cap space that will be available after its recent trade
with Denver. It would be a big risk for Jones, but he would be
returning home to play for a contender. In that scenario, Jones and
Alonzo Mourning (under contract through 2002-03) would be the
nucleus for a new Heat team along with either Jamal Mashburn or
P.J. Brown. Meanwhile, Miami could field a starting five next year
of Jones, Brown, Mourning, Mashburn, and a re-signed (one year) Tim
Hardaway . . . The latest ``my bad'' from Anthony Mason is his
fourth as a Hornet, his worst as a Hornet, and, potentially, his
last as a Hornet. While Mason insists he's not the guy, the New
Orleans police say otherwise. They charged Mason with battery on a
police officer, resisting arrest, and inciting a riot. The Hornets
are hot about the whole thing. ``These things are happening far too
often,'' said GM Bob Bass. But the much larger implication is the
Hornets' deteriorating reputation in the city as the team lobbies
for a new arena. Over the last five years, the Hornets have lost
7,000 season tickets and the sight of a half-full Charlotte
Coliseum was cited by Jones as one reason he wanted out. Said
Charlotte mayor Pat McCrory, ``This continues to strengthen the
argument that a few of these guys are not good role models and we
shouldn't support them in any way.''

FOLEY WELL REMEMBERS STATE AMATEUR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He returned to Worcester Country Club for an informal round of
golf last week and while everything around him _ graphite shafts,
metal drivers, manicured fairways _ indicated it was 2000, Bill
Foley Sr. only had to close his eyes to make it 1964.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered all the people I played and all the shots I
played,'' said Foley, who was 26 when he won the State Amateur at
Worcester CC 36 years ago. ``It definitely was a very important
part of my life. So many things in my life came because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley is one of those genuine people involved in the game who
understands that the dividends have been quite substantial. ``I've
felt for a long time that I'll never be able to give back what I've
taken out of the game,'' he said, though that could be debated. He
has, after all, been connected with the game for years with the
Massachusetts Golf Association and the Francis Ouimet Scholarship
Fund, of which he is currently vice president _ an unselfish
involvement that is a small price to pay for what he was fortunate
enough to experience 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-player match-play field in 1964 included some of the
great names in Massachusetts golf circles _ Warren Tibbetts of
Vesper, Burton Page of Colonial, Mike Ohanian of Oakley, Fordie
Pitts of Wollaston, Eddie Barry of Charles River, Bob Menne of Oak
Hill, and Joe Browning of Weston. There were the Cosgroves, Bill
and John, and Fran Quinn Sr. from Green Hill, as well as Jack
Harvey and Eddie Martin of Winchester CC.
</P>
<P>
   So many great players, said Foley, whose first practice round
that week resulted in a 76. ``I was noted for my putting and the
greens were heavy. I said, `My God, I better do better than this,'
and then Fran Quinn Sr. shot 66. I said, `Wow.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the greens got a close shave and in his first match, against
Dean Cassell of New Bedford, Foley lipped out a birdie chance at
the opening hole, then drained birdie putts at Nos. 2 and 3, to set
in motion a splendid week on the greens. ``I played seven rounds
without three-putting,'' said Foley.
</P>
<P>
   No putt is any clearer than the one he drained against Tibbetts
to win their semifinal match, 1 up, at Worcester's famous 18th
hole. ``It was a 30-footer, from the lower left part of the green
to the upper tier, top right.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final, Foley built a four-hole lead through the morning
18, and eventually dispatched Matty Ciociolo of Wachusett, 8 and 6,
to secure a title that culminated an unforgettable week, though it
had not come without the great escapes that so often define
match-play championships.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, there was second-round foe Art McKearney of Fresh
Pond, who had Foley 2-down with four holes left. ``I parred the
last four holes and won each of them (for a 2-up victory). He hit
good drives and good second shots, but each time the ball took bad
bounces into rough or bad lies. He needed three to get down on each
hole.''
</P>
<P>
   In the quarterfinals, Foley went 20 holes to upend Pitts, his
clubmate at Wollaston GC and longtime friend. ``Strange, because I
always bowed to Fordie's superiority as a golfer,'' said Foley.
``But it was my day and my week.''
</P>
<P>
   A sequence of memorable days in the history of a golf course
that is saturated in character and has seen its share of great
moments _ from the opening tee shot launched by President Taft in
1914, to Bobby Jones calling a penalty on himself and losing the
1925 US Open in a playoff, to the inaugural Ryder Cup in 1927, to
Byron Nelson's Mass. Open triumph in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Worcester CC, in 1960, that Betsy Rawls won her fourth
and final US Women's Open, and the great Jesse Guilford won a State
Open (1919) and a State Amateur (1921) there.
</P>
<P>
   The roll call of State Open champs at Worcester CC also includes
Donald Vinton (1926), Wiffy Cox (1931), Jim Browning (1953), and
Paul Barkhouse (1976), while State Amateurs have been earned at
this Donald Ross creation by Guilford, Joseph Lynch (1933), Eddie
Martin (1948), and Jim McDermott (1989). And Foley, of course,
whose visit last week rekindled some of the emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The 92d State Amateur gets underway Monday morning at Worcester
CC and Foley reports that the course is better than ever. So, too,
is the memory of 1964.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consistently inconsistent
</P>
<P>
   Notah Begay watched some tennis last week, soaking in the
Wimbledon atmosphere. And why not? After all, back-to-back wins on
the PGA Tour are an impressive feat, for which he deserves a round
of applause. But let's not get carried away with what he has done,
because a closer look at his playing record indicates his game has
not exactly been rock solid. Yes, he has shot in the 60s in each of
his last eight rounds, but in the 26 previous rounds, Begay broke
70 just three times and was a cumulative 37 over par. Two wins and
a tie for fourth (at Pebble Beach) are impressive, but in his other
14 starts, Begay has missed six cuts and failed to land in the top
20. Same story a year ago _ in his first 21 starts he missed seven
cuts; then he won twice in five starts, with the next best finish a
T-42 . . . Colin Montgomerie is the latest to switch golf balls,
opting for the Callaway, and that's certainly his prerogative. But
please spare us the drivel that came out after Montgomerie shot 67
in the first round of the European Open. ``I would not have gone
for the shot on No. 18 if I didn't have the confidence of knowing I
can hit the new ball a lot farther,'' he said, in reference to a
265-yard 3-wood that set up an eagle-3. Right. He won more than 20
times and was Order of Merit champion seven straight seasons
playing a Titleist, but all of a sudden the Callaway ball has
unlocked the mysteries of the game. Gee, any chance that money
factors into the switch? . . . Massimo Scarpa of Italy tied the
Ballybunion course record with a second-round 63 in the Irish Open
last week, and if not for a bogey at the final hole, he would have
established a European Tour mark with a back-side 27. Alas, his 73
start and 75-75 weekend left him tied for 53d, which helps explain
why he's never won in eight years on Tour . . . Jenny Chuasiriporn,
who captivated the golf world in 1998 when she was runner-up in the
US Women's Open, missed the cut in Europe this weekend shooting
75-75 at the Ladies German Open. She has not made a dent in the pro
game; before heading to Europe, Chuasiriporn earned less than
$1,000 in seven events on the Futures Tour . . . In the Ladies
German Open, Marielle Kallvik of Sweden shot 105. Ouch. We trust
she has another career option.

   Home for the holidays
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods's decision to skip the Andersen Consulting World
Match Play event in January should not come as a shock. He'll be
criticized, but shouldn't be. David Duval doesn't want to play, nor
does Montgomerie or Jose Maria Olazabal. The Jan. 3-7 date in
Australia throws a curveball into holiday plans and for many
players, that's too far to go and too early to jump into a golf
season that is getting longer and longer. Blame these guys for a
lot of things, but on this matter, you can understand their
concerns . . . Aaron Baddeley will soon turn pro and be able to
make his own decisions, but for now he must accept directions.
Consequently, he won't take part in the US Amateur because the
Australian Golf Union wants him fresh for the Eisenhower Trophy,
and those events could conflict. The US Amateur final is scheduled
for Aug. 27, which is the day the AGU has penciled for the first
practice round in Germany for a competition it takes very
seriously. Australia won the Eisenhower in 1996 and has finished
second twice since. Of course, it may be a blessing in disguise for
Baddeley, whose American PGA Tour swing was anything but a rousing
success, as he missed the cut in five straight events _ Bay Hill,
Masters, Compaq Classic, Memorial, US Open _ after making it into
weekend play at the Honda Classic . . . Hunter Haas will try to
defend his US Public Links championship beginning Monday, but after
it's over he will turn pro. He has sponsor's exemptions waiting for
him at the B.C. Open and The International . . . Joining Haas in
the Public Links field will be locals William Link IV of Acton,
Jeff Sieber of Bedford, Chris Rousseau of Agawam, Phil Miceli of
Wakefield, Neil Kelley of Hampton, N.H., and Matthew Biery of
Windham, N.H. . . . As for Charles Howell, whose pro debut at the
Greater Hartford Open resulted in a check for $13,627, he had
nothing to compare it with. ``That's my first paycheck,'' he said.
``I've never worked a day in my life.'' . . . On such a young
topic, perhaps you missed that 10-year-old Michelle Wie, a
sixth-grader from Hawaii, qualified for match play at the US
Women's Public Links Championship. (She was ousted in Round 1, 3
and 2.) Ten years old! I have dirt on my clubs older than that.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Blast from the past
</P>
<P>
   One of the nice stories at this week's State Amateur is Jim
Deveney, who plays out of Essex County Club. He was 22 when he
first qualified for the State Amateur, in 1964 at Worcester CC, won
by Foley. Thirty-six years later, he's back in the field, enduring
a pressure-packed qualifier just a few years after he decided to
rework his swing. ``I had an OK year last year, but I did want to
get back to Worcester,'' said Deveney, who qualified for the 1999
US Senior Amateur . . . One stalwart who won't be teeing it up at
Worcester CC is two-time champ James Driscoll of Charles River CC.
He's played a ton of golf already this year and coming up is
another run at the US Amateur in August, for which he's exempt . .
. The Golf Channel's ``Drive, Chip &AMP; Putt'' contests for youngsters
ages 7-12 will be at Brookmeadow CC in Canton Tuesday and at
Cyprian Keyes in Boylston Thursday. The events will be limited to
the first 120 at each site and entry forms are available at the
respective pro shops . . . The golf world lost one of its most
gracious personalities recently, when Margaret Lowery died in Palm
Springs, Calif., at the age of 82. Her husband, Eddie, who died in
1984, will forever maintain a spot in golf lore as the 10-year-old
caddie for Francis Ouimet, who won the 1913 US Open. In Margaret,
he had a life partner who shared his passion for golf. She counted
Byron Nelson, Ken Venturi, and E. Harvie Ward among her closest
friends and she had a keen interest in the Francis Ouimet
Scholarship Fund, endowing a $25,000 scholarship in Eddie's name.
``Fittingly,'' said Bob Donovan, executive director of the Ouimet
Fund, ``it goes to our top caddie.''

COURTSHIP HAS SOME QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The four played basketball like competing contractors, stumbling
over each other for the same assignment. They knew about the Big
Three, often drove by the Big Dig, and performed on the court as if
they were auditioning for the lead role in the Big (Shooting) Gig.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you can feel a breakup coming long before it happens,
like the quake you feel minutes before the earth splits. Ron
Mercer, Kenny Anderson, Antoine Walker, and Paul Pierce were like
that. You watched them and felt the tremors. They were all in love
with shooting. It was obvious one would have to leave the Celtics,
and since Mercer was the easiest to move, he was traded last
August.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't mind returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never wanted to leave Boston in the first place,'' he said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As easy as it is to sense breakups, it's almost impossible to
predict reconciliations. Mercer? Back in Boston? It was just over a
year ago when the camps of Mercer and Rick Pitino were slinging
everything but ``Yo' Mama'' jokes at each other. The Celtics
offered the 6-foot-7-inch guard a contract worth $4 million per
season, a deal Mercer found laughable. He was dealt to Denver and
was then moved to Orlando in February.
</P>
<P>
   There have been whispers here and in Denver that Mercer was a
selfish ball hog.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always have something to say when you're gone, don't
they?'' he said. The problem with the chaotic Celtics of 1999 was
``you had four guys who were all playing like they had something to
prove. That's what I think it was. I think we could have worked
that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercer became a free agent last week, meaning he could begin
next season with his fourth team in four seasons. Even Isaiah
Rider, the NBA's instant headache, hasn't been traded as much as
the 24-year-old Kentucky product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure someone is going to look at how much I've moved
around and think something is wrong with me,'' Mercer said. ``But I
think I've been unlucky the last few years. With the Celtics, I was
traded because the team had cap problems. I never wanted to be in
Denver. I like Orlando a lot and love playing for (coach) Doc
(Rivers). But I think they want big-name players on that roster.
I'm just like everyone else, waiting to see what Grant Hill and Tim
Duncan are going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the Magic decide, they know they don't have to pay
Mercer as much as he was seeking last summer. He is a free agent
guard at a time when free agent guards are easy to come by. Eddie
Jones and Tracy McGrady are the most coveted. Reggie Miller isn't
what he used to be, but he still averaged 18 points and shot 45
percent. Jalen Rose is a free agent guard who spent last season
playing small forward. And if a team is desperate for guard help
and indifferent to chemistry, it can always sign Rider for just
over $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   That means, once again, Mercer has the luck of some Internet
start-ups. There's a chance he peaked with last summer's $4 million
offer, described as insulting by Mercer's former agent. He could be
``stuck'' (remember: it's all relative) with a middle-class
exception of $2.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's what happens, that's still a lot of money,'' he
said. ``I'm not the kind of guy who sits around thinking about
money. My point (last year) was that I wanted what was fair.''
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, the story was that the Celtics could not
afford to sign Mercer. Now they can. But with the perplexing way
they have done business lately, they probably wouldn't want to.
Mercer had a bad shooting year (42.6 percent), an indication he
didn't drive to the basket enough. At his worst, he relies on his
jumper without as much as a tiptoe through the lane. But he still
elevates as high as anyone on his shot. And even in a year in which
he went from New England to the Rockies to Disney World, he
averaged 17 points and 3.7 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   If the Celtics were to sign Mercer using the $2.25 million
exception, they would have the option of bringing him off the bench
to stabilize their dilapidated second unit or putting him in the
starting lineup and shifting Pierce back to small forward. After
that, they could re-sign power forward Danny Fortson _ they can pay
him more than anyone else _ and begin looking for a reliable backup
point guard. (If they had drafted Mateen Cleaves this year or held
on to last year's pick that became Andre Miller, they wouldn't have
this problem.)
</P>
<P>
   The moves the Celtics make in the next three weeks will tell you
how serious they are about winning. If they sign Austin Croshere, a
forward who can shoot but can't play defense, to a large contract,
they are not serious. They also aren't serious if they use
small-market baseball euphemisms such as ``budget constraints'' as
an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   At least they have a free agent who wants them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the right circumstances, I would love to come back,''
Mercer said. He was asked what he considers the right
circumstances. ``Antoine would definitely have to be there,'' he
said. ``I'd have to play with 'Toine. I really want to go to a
place where we can win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics could win. But Mercer should know that mending
breakups is all about timing. It's about reciprocity. He says he is
serious about wanting to win. Before doing anything, he should wait
to see if the Celtics are serious, too.

REVOLUTION GET WYNALDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ In an effort to kick up their offense, the
Revolution acquired high-scoring Eric Wynalda from the Fusion
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   To get the 31-year-old forward, the Revolution traded
defender-midfielder Ivan McKinley to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda has 79 points in 69 Major League Soccer games _ 24 goals
and 31 assists _ ranking him among the top scorers with a
1.14-points-per-game average. In 1996, his first _ and best _
season in the league, he scored 10 goals and had 13 assists for the
San Jose Clash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at the Revolution and I see a good mix of experience
and young talent,'' said Wynalda. ``I know just about everybody on
the team. I feel I can help the team score, even when I'm not
playing _ coaching the team to be more composed up front. Sometimes
you even have to be a bit greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Revolution coach Fernando Clavijo said the addition will help
improve the team. ``We've struggled to score goals; we need to find
a way to get the ball in the back of the net,'' he said. ``Plus,
Ivan was very unhappy here and he wanted to go to Miami, so we had
both things happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric is looking forward to the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda, nursing a calf injury, has not played in about a month,
Clavijo said. The injury may keep him out of the Revolution lineup
for up to two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric has scored plenty of big goals in the MLS,'' said
Clavijo. ``He has plenty of time left in his prime. He has at least
four or five more years while he has been maturing more in his
body. Every day counts for him.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinley, a member of the South African national team, flew to
Miami Saturday. He started 12 of 13 games this season, with 10
games on defense rather than the midfield position he prefers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to trade Ivan or separate him from our team,'' said
Clavijo. ``He hasn't been in control of his emotions the last two
months, in particular the last two or three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, Ivan's family wasn't happy here, so we felt that his
trade was best for our team. Playing defense might have been some
of the problem, but there was more to it than that in trying to
make Ivan happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda is the US national team's all-time leading scorer with
33 goals in 102 appearances. He was a US national teammate of
Revolution captain John Harkes and reserve goalkeeper Juergen
Sommer. In addition, Wynalda played with Clavijo on the 1994 US
World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda was the US Male Athlete of the Year in 1996, when he
scored nine goals in 13 international appearances.

A TOUGH CALL FOR HELTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Mike Helton stopped in mid-sentence as he was
addressing reporters about Kenny Irwin's death Friday at New
Hampshire International Speedway. When a prayer for Irwin was
offered up over the track's public address system before the start
of Saturday's Busch North Series race, the NASCAR boss bowed his
head as all activity in the garage area stopped.
</P>
<P>
   But should that have been the case Friday?
</P>
<P>
   While some Winston Cup drivers expressed feelings about calling
it a day after Irwin was killed in practice when his car hit the
wall in Turn 3 _ in virtually the same spot where Adam Petty was
killed May 12 during a Busch Series practice _ Helton said it was
NASCAR's obligation to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult and everybody deals with it in their own form
and fashion,'' Helton said. ``But we have a big responsibility and
it's hard sometimes to go on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Sunday's show, the New England 300, will go on at NHIS's
1.058-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well it's not just a show,'' said Helton, NASCAR's chief
operating officer and senior vice president. ``NASCAR is more like
a community and if a citizen of the community passes away, the
community still has to go on. Your heart's not in it 100 percent,
but (the race) has to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Helton, who had to phone Kyle Petty in London with the news of
son Adam's death in May, was in Charlotte Friday for a meeting but
spent the majority of the day with grieving car owner Felix
Sabates, who withdrew the No. 42 BellSouth team from Sunday's race
and ordered it home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could've been that we didn't press on (Friday), but I don't
know if that would've made it any better,'' he said. ``I think a
lot of people for the most part would've preferred to stay busy,
but our procedures are to press on in cases like this.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's not because we don't have a heart and a soul,'' he
said, ``it's simply because we have a lot of responsibility _
everybody does in the garage area _ to a lot of different people.
The biggest thing is that's what we do; we race. And that's what
Kenny did; he raced. And that's what Adam did; he raced. That's
what we do. I think, in some people's minds, it's what was
necessary to do, to press on.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An open book
</P>
<P>
   Although NASCAR reportedly found no conclusive evidence that
mechanical failure was the cause of Petty's death, Helton said
NASCAR officials have not yet closed the book on the Petty crash
following Irwin's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always work on safety issues and that's an ongoing process
for us,'' Helton said. ``When Adam had his accident here in May we
heightened the issues around carburetors hanging up and what can we
do, what can NASCAR make mandatory under the hoods to maybe
eliminate those things. So we've been very aggressive in working on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   When Irwin hit the wall at a speed near 150 m.p.h., there was
speculation a stuck throttle was the problem. That had been the
prevailing theory in Petty's case, but Helton said NASCAR was
unable to find any ``conclusive evidence'' of that and was
conducting an investigation to see if that was the cause of Irwin's
crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``This occurrence, circumstantially, comes on the heels of (the
Petty crash) and we now become even more interested to work with
the guys in the garage area to see if there's something we can
do,'' Helton said. ``Understanding we don't have a blanket big
enough to cover every area and element that can happen, because
it's a high-charged sport with risk in it, we want to do whatever
we can to minimize these (hung throttle) occurrences.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rusty Wallace described a bump in Turn 3 at NHIS, it was
thought that might be a cause for concern. But Helton dispelled any
notion that the racing groove, especially in Turn 3, was a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's fair to point the finger at the track
here,'' Helton said. ``I think every facility we go to is unique
and has its own different characteristics. I don't know why we've
had two accidents here in such a short period of time that are very
similiar to each other, but those answers are tough to come up
with.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Streak not broken
</P>
<P>
   Terry Labonte will add to his NASCAR record when he makes his
654th consecutive start in Sunday's race, broken right tibia and
all. Labonte suffered the injury when he crashed into the wall at
Daytona July 1. He underwent an MRI Monday, which revealed a
non-displaced fracture. ``They couldn't put a cast on it, because
then I wouldn't be able to get in and out of the car,'' said
Labonte. ``So they told me to not put any weight on it for 4-5
weeks.'' Labonte said he was hoping that a pair of open dates
between now and the Brickyard 400 Aug. 4 would help him continue to
mend and keep his streak intact. ``I broke my leg once, but I was
pretty fortunate that it happened at the end of the season,'' he
said. ``It was just one of those deals. It's unfortunate that it
happened, and I'm lucky that it wasn't worse than it was. One good
thing is that we've got two off weeks coming up.'' Labonte said
returning to NHIS after competing in the Busch Series race which
Petty was practicing for when he was killed was especially
difficult on him as the father of a son, Justin, who is an aspiring
racer. ``It probably hit closer to home than anything ever has,''
he said. ``I've known Kyle for a long time and I've known his kids
for a long time and it was something that was pretty hard to deal
with _ still is.'' . . . While Dale Earnhardt Jr. said he had no
problems with the way Jeremy Mayfield bumped his father from the
lead to win Pocono three weeks ago, he indicated he would never
dream of pulling such a move. ``I wouldn't do it if I had to wreck
him to do it,'' said Little E. ``I could see moving somebody over,
but it just depends on who you're racing. If you're racing Mark
Martin, you wouldn't do it, because he wouldn't do it to you. We've
all seen my dad do it before, move people out of the way to win
races. You race people how they race you. I wouldn't move Jeff
Green out of the way to win a Busch race, because he's had the
opportunity to do it me, but I'd move Todd Bodine out of the way
(with whom Dale Jr. clashed at Pikes Peak last year) to win a Busch
race, no problem.'' . . . Vincent Galante, a 6-year-old leukemia
patient from Woburn, Mass., arrived at NHIS with his twin brother,
Nicholas, and parents David and Doreen in the hopes of meeting
their favorite driver, Dale Earnhardt. Although the twins were
unable to meet with the Intimidator, they were treated to the next
best thing when members of Earnhardt's crew allowed the boys to
take turns sitting behind the wheel of the No. 3 Goodwrench
Chevrolet. The Galantes didn't leave empty-handed, though, after
meeting with Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Tony Stewart and Bobby
Labonte, who autographed hats and posed for pictures with the boys
in their team transporters . . . Donations in Kenny Irwin Jr.'s
name can be made to the Riley Children's Hospital, 702 Barnhill
Drive, Indianapolis, Ind. 46202. Irwin, 30, was single and is
survived by his parents and two sisters . . . Our prediction for
Sunday's race? It's hard to pick against pole-sitter Wallace, but
it's even harder to mess with Jeff Burton's success at NHIS. Look
for Burton to park the No. 99 car in Victory Lane for the fourth
time in a row.

MORGAN A BLUE COLLAR KIND OF GUY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six months ago, he was riding dusty buses across back-country
roads in Mexico to play the Guasave Cottoneers and Culiacan Tomato
Growers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Burkhart, the kid no one in Major League Baseball
bothered to recruit in high school or college, had given up
construction work and was making his way in winter ball with the
Navajoa Mayos of the Mexican League.
</P>
<P>
   No million-dollar paydays. No Internet fan club. And little hope
that one day he could achieve the stuff of other players' dreams: a
turn in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really playing to get in the big leagues,'' said
Burkhart, 27, of a career that included four long summers with the
Richmond Roosters of the Frontier League before the Red Sox signed
him as a non-drafted free agent in 1998. ``I didn't think there was
a chance I was going to get to the big leagues. I was just playing
because I loved the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, 12 games into Burkhart's Cinderella stay in the bigs,
Red Sox manager Jimy Williams spoke almost lovingly of his new
designated hitter who has escaped the Mexicali Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the intangible,'' Williams said, pointing to his heart.
``You can see it. You can sense it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Brian Daubach, who rose a year earlier from nearly a decade
of minor league obscurity, Burkhart has proven his worth to
Williams not only with a potent bat but his ``blue-collar'' pluck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you're looking for those blue-collar guys,''
Williams said. ``You need the other ones, but that supporting cast
is so, so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Both players are stronger, Williams said, for the adversity they
have overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``They paid a lot of minor league dues,'' Williams said. During
those years, the manager said, ``A lot of people told them they
can't, and they kept saying they will. That's when you find out
whether you have a ballplayer, when you see how they go through
adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Burkhart, Williams has a switch hitter with patience and
power (to wit, 53 home runs and 163 RBIs in a 201-game span last
year that included stints with Class A Sarasota, Double A Trenton,
and Navajoa).
</P>
<P>
   In his first 11 games since he was summoned June 27 to sub for
the injured Trot Nixon, Burkhart has knocked in 11 runs, hit his
first major league homer, and batted .368. His production _ and
ability to hit from both sides of the plate _ will help him when
Nixon returns to the lineup after the All-Star break. (Nixon's
return, originally scheduled for Thursday, was pushed back
indefinitely after he aggravated his right hamstring in a Gulf
Coast League game).
</P>
<P>
   Barring unforeseen trouble, Burkhart's spot on the Sox roster
appears safe after Nixon's return, as Izzy Alcantara and Dernell
Stenson would be most likely to depart before him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm doing OK, but I could be doing better,'' said Burkhart,
who helped pave his road to the Fens by winning the MVP trophy in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has enough faith in Burkhart that he has been batting
him fifth behind Nomar Garciaparra and Carl Everett. Burkhart had
one of Boston's five hits Friday against Atlanta's Tom Glavine,
though he struggled in his first three at-bats against Terry
Mulholland, grounding out, striking out, and lining out to center.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he perseveres. Burkhart said he never enjoyed the luxury
of being the best player in high school, outside St. Louis, or in
college, Central Missouri State. And he knows his job with the Red
Sox is not guaranteed, though he hopes one day to trade his
makeshift locker for a longer-term berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm up here because I'm expected to do something,'' he said.
``That's what I'm trying to do, and I feel I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In any case, he has probably experienced his last winter in
Mexico.

DELAHOUSSAYE'S TOUGH RIDE

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Eddie Delahoussaye's legendary calm is being
seriously tested these days.
</P>
<P>
   This afternoon's $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup, in which
Delahoussaye will ride Out of Mind, is the easy part for the Hall
of Fame jockey.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning, he'll watch his wife Juanita go into the
hosp}TG &Cx1f; RIw6''rgery to repair an aneurysm near her brain. It is
one of two aneurysms discovered in May after Juanita began
suffering from severe headaches.
</P>
<P>
   It's no sure thing that Juanita will survive the three- to
five-hour operation at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Delahoussaye, 48, did not appear distracted Saturday as he
delivered a typically co&AMP;VW`ed ride to win the $78,775 Royal Her/.N

DODGERS' PITCHING NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the good times and bad times, from the days of Drysdale
and Koufax to the height of Fernandomania and Orel, one could
always count on Dodger pitching. It was their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Brooklyn, where Ebbets Field was a bandbox for the Boys
of Summer, the Dodger M.O. was hitting. But from their second year
in Los Angeles, even while playing in the Coliseum with its obtuse
Chinese Wall in left field before moving into the pitcher-friendly
confines of Dodger Stadium, the Dodgers always won the arms race.
</P>
<P>
   In the 33 seasons between 1959 and 1991, the Dodgers led the
National League in pitching 15 times and finished in the N.L. top
three 25 times. Dodger pitchers threw seven no-hitters and 24
one-hitters, won seven Cy Young awards, three Rookie of the year
awards, and four World Series MVP trophies.
</P>
<P>
   Seven different pitchers won nine different N.L. percentage
titles. Dodger pitchers led the league in shutouts 14 times; 13
different pitchers were among the leaders. In those 33 seasons, the
Dodgers had 22 different pitchers represent them in all-star games.
</P>
<P>
   The only legacy in baseball that compares is the one in New York
revolving around Damn Yankees and their left-handed power hitters.
But the current Dodger pitching staff isn't upholding the legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Once dominant, it is now merely ordinary, with six down-the-road
finishes in the last nine seasons, including 2000 as baseball takes
its all-star break. Last year's team ERA oZyb7HW,.HC!+$YZ!MQ

OFF-DUTY POLICE OFFICER SUSPENDED FOR FIRING GUN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An off-duty police detective fired a single shot from
his fifth-floor apartment window at a gunman who was confronting
another man in the street and who had ignored the detective's order
to drop the gun, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The detective, Robert Lopez, was suspended for discharging his
firearm in a reckless manner, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the incident occurred at the officer's apartment
building, the police would not provide the address.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez said he saw a group of men in front of his building late
Friday night, one of them with a gun, the police said. The
detective yelled from the window, ordering the man to drop the
weapon, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   When the man refused to drop the gun, Lopez fired a single shot,
dispersing the group, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Andre Tull, 25, was arrested a few blocks away
and charged with possession of a weapon and menacing, although no
gun was found, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is assigned to the 106th Precinct detective squad, which
covers the Ozone Park and Howard Beach sections of Queens County.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other

YANKS BEAT METS, TWICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for second game results)  
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Steve Phillips was there at the beginning, in
Kingsport, Tenn., watching a 17-year-old fireballing teammate named
Dwight Gooden break a catcher's hand with his fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   And he was watching again Saturday when Gooden pitched the
Yankees to a 4-2 victory over the Mets at Shea Stadium. Hours
later, the Yankees defeated the Mets by 4-2 again, this time at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips, then a minor league infielder and now the Mets'
general manager, remembers how Gooden overmatched Appalachian
League teams, how one club's No.9 hitter closed his eyes and swung
and somehow beat Gooden, 1-0, with an opposite-field home run.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen years later, Phillips passed on the chance to sign
Gooden after he was released by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in May.
Gooden had pitched poorly for both Tampa Bay and Houston, and in
the Mets' opinion, he could no longer pitch competitively in the
majors.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was pitching at the lowest level of the minors before the
Yankees promoted him to face the Mets at Shea Stadium Saturday, to
return to the stage of his greatest triumphs in the mid-1980s. He
was not the Gooden of old, but he was surprisingly effective for
five innings and was the winning pitcher in the Yankees' first 4-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gave them a great effort,'' Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the teams boarded buses _ subway transportation
was left to the fans, 54,165 of whom showed up in Flushing _ and
headed to Yankee Stadium for the second game of a day-night
doubleheader. It was the first time since 1903 that two teams had
played each other at different ballparks on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bronx, the Yankees got seven and a third strong innings
from Roger Clemens and a three-run home run by Chuck Knoblauch to
win again. Clemens hit Mike Piazza on the helmet with a pitch in
the second inning; he sustained a slight concussion. The series
concludes Sunday night at Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, who was pitching at Shea for the first time since 1994
when he was still a Met, received mostly cheers when he was
introduced. There were no signs counting the strikeouts of the
pitcher once known as Dr. K, but Gooden recorded only one strikeout
anyway. The Mets had six hits off him in five innings, but they
walked just once and managed only two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get released, you're sitting at home and not knowing
if you'll get back and play again,'' Gooden said. ``So today, I
just wanted to make sure I enjoyed the moment rather than putting
pressure on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who was 0 for 3 against Gooden and left three runners on
base, said: ``I can't really explain it. He just threw strikes;
that's the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Of Gooden's 77 pitches, 49 were strikes, and his fastballs came
in about 85 to 90 miles an hour. Mets left fielder Benny Agbayani
was 12 when Gooden made his debut in the major leagues in 1984, but
from what Agbayani understood, Saturday's offerings would have been
change-ups back then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, he wasn't throwing 85 to 86,'' Agbayani said. ``It was
95, 97. But he spotted the ball good today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden (3-3) left the game with the score tied, but Tino
Martinez made him the winner with an opposite-field home run in the
sixth inning off the Mets right-hander Bobby J. Jones. Martinez
went 3 for 4 with three runs batted in, and his homer was the only
hit Jones allowed over the final 23 batters he faced after the
Yankees took a 2-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (3-4) worked seven innings, giving up three runs on four
hits and three walks. He has a 2.67 earned run average in four
starts since returning from an assignment to Class AAA Norfolk,
which followed a shelling by the Yankees in June.
</P>
<P>
   This game began ominously for Jones. Knoblauch lined the first
pitch in front of a diving Jay Payton in center field. Payton
popped up and threw out Knoblauch at second base, and Jones, whose
expressions usually change as often as a statue's when he is
pitching, pumped his fist in excitement.
</P>
<P>
   He could not have known the call was about to be changed by
Umpire Robb Cook, who agreed with the Yankees' first-base coach,
Lee Mazzilli, that Todd Zeile, the Mets' first baseman, had blocked
Knoblauch's path to second. Mets Manager Bobby Valentine argued
that Knoblauch never changed direction and that no contact had been
made, but all it earned him was his first ejection this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets played the game under protest, but the Yankees soon had
two runs on a double by Derek Jeter and an infield single by
Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Jones does not try to blow hitters away. He spotted his fastball
well, and mixed in enough curveballs and sliders to keep the
Yankees from swinging comfortably. Martinez's home run came on a
pitch that was down and away; Jones did not regret it. Martinez
then drove in a run in the eighth on a single off Dennis Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips also must be sure that the Mets' offensive All-Stars,
Piazza and Edgardo Alfonzo, will hit again. But Alfonzo and Piazza
combined to go 0 for 15 in the first two games of this series _
``When we get hot, we have to get cold sometimes,'' Alfonzo said _
and it was up to the rest of the lineup to produce.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani singled and scored on a bloop double by Derek Bell in
the fifth inning, and in the seventh he was on second when Bell
stood in with two outs and the Mets trailing, 3-2. Facing Jeff
Nelson, Bell hit a high chopper to third. He might have beaten a
throw from Brosius, but Brosius instead tagged out Agbayani, who
was trying to advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I froze, because I thought he was going to throw the ball to
first base,'' Agbayani said. ``Then I heard Jeter tell him I was
right there next to him. He was on his way, but he lost his grip
when he was about to throw.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets never had another base runner, and they were held
scoreless over four innings by three Yankees relievers, securing
Gooden's improbable victory. &QL;

CHALLENGE DOESN'T SCARE 'EM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The $1 million Hollywood Gold Cup was more
than 24 hours away, and favorite General Challenge was under attack
already.
</P>
<P>
   There was Bobby Frankel, the Hall of Fame trainer of Chester
House, answering questions in a fans forum near the Hollywood Park
paddock at noon Saturday and giving General Challenge only
backhanded praise as ``a great workout horse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is caught up in (how well) he's training,''
Frankel said. ``Now he's got to do it in the afternoon. He's no
superstar right now. He's got to prove it to me. It's a wide-open
race.''
</P>
<P>
   There was Michael Hushion, trainer of the New York invader named
David, saying on the phone that he couldn't identify a single
``horse to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I don't know which General Challenge is going to
show up,'' Hushion said, referring to the colt's inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   And there were the handicappers' selections in the Daily Racing
Form, six of seven experts picking somebody else - David, Chester
House or Out of Mind - three of them dropping General Challenge to
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monster when in mood,'' one Racing Form analyst noted in
handicapper shorthand.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge goes into today's 61st running of Hollywood
Park's marquee race as the favorite, all right, as he tries to be
the first horse since Affirmed in 1979 to win the Santa Anita
Handicap and Gold Cup in the same year, and the only horse other
than Best Pal to have won the Big 'Cap, Pacific Classic and Gold
Cup. He's 9-5 on the morning line.
</P>
<P>
   But everybody is taking shots at him. And the 4-year-old bred
and owned by John and Betty Mabee of San Diego's Golden Eagle Farm
doesn't figure to have it any easier when the starting gate opens
for a Gold Cup featuring nine intriguing possibilities from all
over the map.
</P>
<P>
   The opponenLsA[`lude: Cat Thief, the 1999 Breeders' Cup Classic
winner who defeated General Challenge in the former's only
Hollywood Park start, the Swaps Stakes last July; Chester House,
who figures to improve on his fourth-place effort at muddy
Churchill Downs, where he threw a shoe; Out of Mind and Big Ten,
South American-breds trained by two-time Gold Cup winner Richard
Mandella; and former claimer Early Pioneer and New York-bred David,
the horses who outran General Challenge in the San Bernardino; and
New York-based Pleasant Breeze, ridden by 1999 Eclipse Award winner
Jorge Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Horsemen and handicappers, like rank-and-file racing fans, prize
reliability above all in their would-be superstar thoroughbreds.
General Challenge does not fit that bill.
</P>
<P>
   When he's good, he's very, very good - a dazzling winner in last
year's Santa Anita Derby and Pacific Classic and this year's Santa
Anita Handicap. When he's bad, well, you get the idea - he finished
11th in the Kentucky Derby and 10th in the Breeders' Cup Classic
last year, and has been beaten as an odds-on favorite four times in
a 16-race career.
</P>
<P>
   The 4-year-old California-bred comes into the 1-mile Gold Cup
off a third-place finish at 1-5 odds in the April 9 San Bernardino
Handicap at Santa Anita. An entrapped epiglottis and throat ulcer
caused him to miss nearly a month of training, and he hasn't raced
in three months, although he has recorded a series of
fastest-of-the-morning workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that (time off) scares a lot of people,'' trainer Bob
Baffert told a Hollywood Park publicist Saturday after scanning the
Racing Form in which handicappers lined up against General
Challenge. ``I guess it's one of those deals that everyone wants to
try and beat the favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert, whose Real Quiet won the 1999 Gold Cup, would be the
first to train back-to-back winners since Charlie Whittingham had
Kennedy Road (1973) and Tree of Knowledge (1974).
</P>
<P>
   There is really no in-between for General Challenge. He'll
either be the winner or a loser.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins, he'll confirm his talent and stamp himself the
handicap-division leader of the West Coast. If he loses, he'll
confirm his undependability and kill whatever Horse of the Year
chances he had.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question how good he can be,'' Mandella said. ``I
don't know if my two are quite up to beating him yet in a race like
the Gold Cup. But I do know this: He better have his running shoes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: General Challenge's connections - the Mabees, Baffert and
jockey Corey Nakatani - started the weekend well as Notable Career
($3) won the Landaluce Stakes for 2-year-old fillies by four
lengths over Sea Reel on Saturday at Hollywood Park. General
Challenge and Notable Career, both out of Excellent Lady, are
three-quarter siblings. ... Gold Mover beat Princess Belle by 2
lengths in the Dubutante for 2-year-old fillies at Churchill Downs
to remain unbeatenM8N,mMy/)&AMP;U7

<P>
   &UR; THE COLONY OF UNREQUITED DREAMS &LR;  By Wayne Johnston. Anchor,
$14. The protagonist of this biographical novel is the weedy but
ambitious Joe Smallwood, who helped steer the incorporation of the
vast, mysterious island of Newfoundland into Canada and became the
province's first premier. ``Johnston's eloquent anti-epic is in its
thorny way a respectful tribute to a place more willful than even
its toughest inhabitants,'' Luc Sante wrote in The New York Times
Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO OTHER BOOK: Selected Essays &LR;  By Randall Jarrell. Edited by
Brad Leithauser. Perennial/HarperCollins, $15. This collection of
the poet's major critical essays contains many valuations and
opinions _ about the pre-eminence of Frost, Eliot and Stevens in
the 20th-century pantheon of American poets, for example _ that
were once considered provocative but have become orthodoxy today.
``He was astute, insightful, passionate, sympathetic and remarkably
prophetic,'' Brooke Allen wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; THE BROKEN ESTATE: Essays on Literature and Belief &LR; , by
James Wood (Modern Library, $14.95), a combative critic explores
the transition from religious belief to literary belief in the 19th
century, and the effects of that shift on practitioners of fiction
from Melville to Pynchon. ``It is the excess, the polemical drive,
that makes him exhilarating to read, often to be instructed by,
sometimes to argue with,'' William H. Pritchard wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MY RUSSIAN &LR;  By Deirdre McNamer. Ballantine, $14. After her
husband is wounded by an intruder and her lover, a Russian
gardener, drops out of sight, this novel's middle-aged heroine
assumes another identity to spy on her own life and try to correct
its course. ``McNamer is a careful writer, a master of the small,
telling observation,'' Susan Bolotin wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JUNETEENTH &LR;  By Ralph Ellison. Edited by John F. Callahan.
Vintage International, $14. This tale of a racist white senator
raised as black, assembled from voluminous notes after Ellison's
death in 1994, never coheres as his second novel, Louis Menand
wrote last year. As a stew of various African-American oral
traditions, however, ``it is an interesting experiment'' that
features ``some quite Joycean riffs.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MAJORS: In Pursuit of Golf's Holy Grail &LR;  By John Feinstein.
Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95. A reporter surveys 1998's four
major championships _ the Masters, the U.S. Open, the British Open
and the PGA Championship _ and the human dramas among both winners
and losers. ``If you want to know how touring pros think, on and
off the course,'' Dave Anderson wrote last year, ``this is the
book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE MEME MACHINE &LR;  By Susan Blackmore. Oxford University,
$14.95. A psychologist sets out a Darwinian theory of cultural
evolution in which ``replicators'' _ words, beliefs and other
packets of shared data _ behave as biological genes to drive human
behavior. Last year in The New York Times Book Review, Robert
Wright called this an ``earnest and engaging, if not wholly
persuasive, book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRUMPET &LR;  By Jackie Kay. Vintage Contemporaries, $13. This
Scottish novel about a famous trumpet player, which features
several narrators, is evidently inspired by the life of the
American jazz musician Billy Tipton, who passed as a man until her
death in 1989. The book ``leaves us with a broad landscape of sweet
tolerance and familial love,'' Aoibheann Sweeney wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO ONE LEFT TO LIE TO: The Triangulations of William Jefferson
Clinton &LR;  By Christopher Hitchens. Verso, $10. An unabashed Clinton
hater makes his case with a blunt assessment of the president's
personal flaws and amazing manipulative skills. Even if his attack
is obsessive, Karen Lehrman said last year, ``Hitchens' brave
willingness to show all the sordid scenarios in which our emperor
has removed his clothes is beyond refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; UNCOVERING CLINTON: A Reporter's Story &LR; , by Michael Isikoff
(Three Rivers, $14), the journalist responsible for many of the
revelations about Bill Clinton's sexual indiscretions defends his
work and explains how he lost scoops because of his editors'
hesitations. ``Isikoff makes a plausible case ... for continuing to
pursue a story that could possibly have brought down a president,''
Tom Goldstein wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SURRENDER, DOROTHY &LR;  By Meg Wolitzer. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $12.95. This novel explores the aftershocks of a woman's
sudden death on her friends and family, in particular the strange
jealousies that emerge among the survivors. In 1999 the reviewer
Sylvia Brownrigg admired the author's ``knack for wry comedy'' and
her ``easy and astute'' observations about her characters' lives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BOY IN THE LAKE &LR;  By Eric Swanson. St. Martin's Griffin,
$11.95. In this elegiac novel, a New York therapist returns to his
Ohio hometown after his grandmother's death and tries to make up
with a boyhood lover whom he had cruelly betrayed. ``Swanson writes
surely, sometimes beautifully,'' Peter Kurth wrote last year.
