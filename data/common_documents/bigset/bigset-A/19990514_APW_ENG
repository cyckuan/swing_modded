<HEADLINE> Alexander Attacks Violent Videos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Teacher pension funds should pull their  
investments from companies that make ultra-violent video games to 
erode a ``culture of violence'' that contributed to the Colorado 
school shootings, Republican presidential hopeful Lamar Alexander 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teachers in this country should be outraged to learn that  
their pension funds are major investors in many of the companies 
that make these ultra-violent video games,'' Alexander, who is a 
former education secretary, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander argued that the violent games contributed materially  
to the Littleton, Colo., high school shootings, which left 15 dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``Following the Littleton killings, it's been reported that  
hundreds of hours playing these games helped make the teenage 
killers such deadly marksmen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander purchases airtime on Iowa radio stations each Sunday  
for a weekly broadcast. A script for this week's broadcast, on the 
video game connection, was provided to The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Teacher pension funds in California, Texas, Ohio and Kentucky,  
as well as the College Retirement Equity Fund -- a fund for college 
teachers -- are ``major investors'' in companies that make the 
violent games, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, all five are investors in Cendant Corp., creators  
of ``Phantasmagoria,'' a game that includes a brutal rape scene, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the California and college retirement funds own  
shares in a company called GT Interactive Software, which produces 
``Duke Nukem,'' another violent game, Alexander said. 
</P>
<P>
	Howard Goldman of the Texas teacher pension fund said he didn't  
have any comment on Alexander's remarks. ``We'd have to look 
specifically at what he's saying,'' Goldman said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kentucky, the issue was raised by local politicians a few  
months ago, according to Pat Miller of that state's teacher pension 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Individual shares of Cendant were sold, although a mutual fund  
in which the Kentucky fund invests holds shares in the company. 
Miller said the sale decision came because the price fell. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'd have to sell every media stock we ever thought about'' if  
investors worried about products, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Herb Byer of the Ohio fund said he would have no comment until  
he heard from Alexander personally. There was no immediate response 
to a request for comment from the California fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander said the pension funds aren't small players but own  
millions of shares in the companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It helps create the culture of violence that teachers have to  
deal with every day,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	While dealing an economic blow to violent games won't solve  
school problems, it's a step in the right direction, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day as we search for answers one would be to tell the  
makers of these ultra-violent video games to take the violence out 
of the videos or we'll take the investment out of your company,'' 
Alexander argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander was education secretary under President Bush is a  
former president of the University of Tennessee. He is seeking to 
improve on his showing in the 1996 race for the Republican 
presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	He is only the latest contender to seek to use the Colorado  
school shootings as a platform to argue for changes. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no easy way to stop the culture of violence, but as a  
first step we should hit the producers of these violent images in 
the pocketbook,'' Alexander says in his radio spot. ``We can all 
join to make violence unprofitable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While television programming and violence in music and in movies  
have received heavy attention, Alexander said video games are by 
far the worst offenders. He said children spend hours playing games 
that features dismemberments and sexual assaults. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most parent would be shocked to see the games,'' he said.  
``It's 10 times worse than anything on television and the movies. 
They literally reward children playing the games for blowing the 
arms off of policemen. The more gruesome the better.''

<HEADLINE> Cargo Planes Fill Nighttime Sky </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- The planes touch down one after another on  
three runways. Crews wearing knee pads and back braces rush to 
unload them, and within 20 minutes roughly 1.3 million documents 
and boxes are sent into a maze of human and computerized sorters. 
</P>
<P>
	Three hours later, the jets roar back into the air, their cargo  
rerouted to its final destination. 
</P>
<P>
	As the country sleeps each night, the skies over Memphis glow  
with the lights of Federal Express jets, a string of mechanical 
fireflies headed to and from the delivery company's national 
distribution center. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a far cry from the company's first night in 1973, when a  
fleet of 25 planes handled 186 packages. It's also just a hint of 
things to come. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of air delivery services -- particularly overseas -- is  
expected to boom in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Smith, founder of Federal Express, the world's No. 1 air  
delivery business, says the industry is ``just reaching its growth 
stride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ripples from such growth will be felt not only through the  
rest of the economy, but also the aviation industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Skies that are already crowded in the daytime are becoming more  
so at night, when cargo jets make their mad dash to hubs like 
Memphis or Louisville, Ky., where the air operation for United 
Parcel Service is based. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots are pushing the government to require the installation of  
collision avoidance equipment in cargo planes, just as it did for 
commercial airliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The traffic is also creating a heavy demand for flight crews.  
Young pilots once destined to spend years skipping from community 
to community in puddle jumpers are now being plucked to fly jets 
full of packages around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	That's creating a supply problem for the passenger airlines,  
whose heavy recruiting has already taken a toll on the military's 
supply of pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. express delivery business -- as the time-guaranteed  
delivery of packages and documents is known -- is roughly a $23 
billion industry. FedEx -- the official name today for Federal 
Express -- expects the business to more than quadruple to $100 
billion within 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx and other players such as United Parcel Service, Airborne  
Express and DHL expect even larger growth overseas, with the total 
marketplace perhaps reaching $250 billion by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	What's fueling the growth is a change in how companies conduct  
their business. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it is increasingly easy to ship goods rapidly, and since  
companies now guarantee delivery times, businesses are less likely 
to keep expensive inventories on site. They are more interested in 
ordering products just in time for delivery to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The parts for the average Dell computer, for example, spend  
little more than eight hours at the company's Texas manufacturing 
plant before they are assembled and shipped off to the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The transformation has turned airplanes and trucks into mobile  
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's happened is that in the '70s and '80s, everyone  
considered air to be the premium spread of the world, sort of the 
butter. That is true, but what wasn't taken into account -- and what 
is being considered now -- is the savings that can create,'' said 
Steve Alterman, spokesman for the Cargo Airline Association, a 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	With the growth has come challenges.  
</P>
<P>
	Crowded skies, for example, have prompted UPS to develop a new  
collision avoidance system called ADS-B. It allows pilots to see 
traffic up to 100 miles away, as well as vehicles on the ground. 
UPS is now seeking government approval to install the devices in 
its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx, UPS and their competitors also expect they will have to  
recruit more heavily as the competition for pilots heightens. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Weidemeyer, president of UPS Airlines, said the move  
toward globalization and the increasing use of electronic commerce 
such as Internet shopping spells a bright future for the air 
delivery industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The quick, easy movement of products ``will mean a limitless  
ability for anybody anywhere to be a global company,'' Weidemeyer 
said. ``Amazon.com has already proven that.''

<HEADLINE> CNN Lands Mrs. Clinton Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CNN's Christiane Amanpour has won the first  
television interview with first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in more 
than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Amanpour was to speak to Mrs. Clinton today in Skopje,  
Macedonia, during her visit to refugee camps for people who have 
fled from Yugoslavia. CNN planned to show the interview at 10 p.m. 
EDT and again Saturday at 9:30 a.m. EDT, network spokeswoman 
Christa Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Amanpour intends to focus her interview on Mrs. Clinton's role  
as an international envoy. Amanpour, who also works for CBS's ``60 
Minutes,'' is one of CNN's lead international reporters and has 
covered the Yugoslavian conflict since NATO bombing began. 
</P>
<P>
	The interview will also cover other topics, Ms. Robinson said.  
The first lady is considering a run for the U.S. Senate in New York 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's last one-on-one television interview was given to  
Matt Lauer of NBC's ``Today'' show on Jan. 27, 1998, after 
allegations of her husband's relationship with Monica Lewinsky 
first surfaced.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Aid Agencies Need Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Stop sending used underwear. Please.  
</P>
<P>
	And no more tweezers. ``We have enough for the nation,''  
American Red Cross spokeswoman Elizabeth Quirk says. 
</P>
<P>
	And single shoes with no match? Thanks, but no thanks.  
</P>
<P>
	People sending donations for the Oklahoma tornado victims are  
creating what the Salvation Army warns could become a ``disaster 
within a disaster'' by emptying their closets instead of opening 
their wallets. The relief agencies say they need money, not 
cast-offs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When people have lost everything, they don't want everyone's  
scraps,'' Salvation Army spokeswoman Kelly Drawdy says. ``Getting 
used underwear -- that's a morale issue.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The twisters May 3 killed 44 people in Oklahoma and five in  
Kansas and destroyed thousands of homes. 
</P>
<P>
	About 30 truckloads of donations arrive daily at the Salvation  
Army warehouse here, where a space the size of two football fields 
is bursting with clothes, furniture, food, diapers, toys and 
cleaning supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	The unloading requires about 200 volunteers a day and the  
Salvation Army is struggling to find enough help. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the bags of clothes, volunteers have found worn underwear  
and items in such poor condition no one would want them. And even 
many of the new items are not essential. 
</P>
<P>
	``With cash, you can buy what is needed at the moment and you  
can buy only what you need,'' says Bob Waldrop, Catholic Charities 
disaster coordinator. ``We're not in the middle of a desert. We're 
in the middle of an urban area in a well-settled state. If it's not 
here, we'll go to Dallas to buy it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deluge of tweezers came after someone not connected to the  
Red Cross gave a news interview about the need for them, probably 
because of complaints about splinters, Ms. Quirk says. 
</P>
<P>
	Waldrop received a large Federal Express package this week  
earmarked for the relief effort with four used pillows inside. ``I 
can't even imagine what it cost to ship,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Donors would do better to hold garage sales and donate the  
profits, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	World Vision, which has received about $1 million worth of  
donated goods so far, is trying to avoid a repeat of the Hurricane 
Mitch relief effort in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
	So many unusable clothes were donated after that disaster that  
some agencies were forced to dump enormous loads in a landfill, 
World Vision spokeswoman Cathy MacCaul says. 
</P>
<P>
	World Vision is considering selling any surplus clothes donated  
to Oklahomans. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's better than throwing it in a landfill or burning it,''  
Ms. MacCaul says. ``Maybe we can recoup the costs or use what's 
left over for relief.''

	Senate OKs Gun Show Limits  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reversing their position on the issue,  
Republicans today pushed through a Senate bill they claimed would 
establish a system of background checks for all buyers of firearms 
at gun shows. Even in advance of the 48-47 vote, President Clinton 
and Senate Democrats cited numerous loopholes, and Republicans 
agreed to consider further changes. But the Senate voted 50-43 to 
kill an amendment by Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., to require Web sites

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today after the government's  
report of a steep rise in consumer prices set off renewed worries 
about inflation and sent bond prices sharply lower. Just before the 
close, the Dow Jones industrial average was at 10,881.53, down 
225.66 -- wiping out a 106.82-point gain yesterday that gave the Dow 
a new closing high of 11,107.19. On the NYSE, losers led gainers 
2,395-696. Broader stock indicators were lower as well. The Nasdaq 
composite index was at 2,519.53, down 62.47. Consumer prices jumped 
in April by an unexpectedly sharp 0.7 percent, the largest monthly 
gain in nearly nine years.

	Yugoslavia Claims NATO Hit Refugees

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes bombed a convoy of  
ethnic Albanian refugees, killing 50-100 civilians early today, 
Yugoslav authorities claimed. Reporters were shown a devastated 
scene of charred bodies, wrecked tractors and terrified survivors. 
NATO said it was investigating the claim, while the State 
Department urged skepticism on Serb reports that blamed the allies 
for the attack on the Kosovo village of Korisa until the facts are 
known. Officials at NATO headquarters, speaking on condition of 
anonymity, said there was no immediate indication that allied 
aircraft were involved.

President Jiang Zemin had been refused since the U.S. bombing of 
the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last week, got through to the 
Chinese leader today and expressed hope that the two countries 
could repair the damage to their relations. On the 52nd day of

	Court Voids EPA Air-Pollution Rules  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court today set aside new  
air quality standards issued by the Environmental Protection Agency 
in 1997, handing the Clinton administration a major environmental 
defeat. The three-judge panel, acting on a lawsuit by a number of 
industry groups, said the section of the 1990 Clean Air Act on 
which the EPA relied in issuing the air pollution rules amounted to 
``an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.'' The EPA is 
almost certain to appeal the case, although the agency had no 
immediate comment.

hours after unprotected sexual intercourse. Wal-Mart did not say 
why it would not sell the drug at its 2,428 pharmacies, calling the 
ban a ``business decision.'' Family planning advocates criticized 
the move, saying that some women, particularly those in small 
towns, will have greater difficulty finding the drug, Preven.

stock and bond prices. A record 6.1 percent spike in energy prices,

<HEADLINE> Faking Reporter Denies Having AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- First, newspaper reporter Kim Stacy told  
her editors she'd fabricated five columns about her life-and-death 
struggle with cancer to hide the fact she really has AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	Now she says she has never been diagnosed with AIDS, either.  
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published Friday in the Owensboro  
Messenger-Inquirer, Ms. Stacy, 33, said she began making up stories 
about her health several years ago so she could make friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy was fired on Monday after admitting the first lie,  
about having cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Then on Thursday, Ms. Stacy told the newspaper that to the best  
of her knowledge, she has never had any symptoms of AIDS-related 
illnesses. She said she has never tested positive for AIDS or been 
treated for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
	She agreed to have two reporters accompany her to take an AIDS  
test. The results were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past few weeks, Ms. Stacy wrote movingly about how she  
had brain cancer, had only a few months to live and was undergoing 
chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I refuse to believe I'm going to die,'' she wrote. ``My life  
may be over in six months, but I'm not going out of this world 
without a fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This week, she met with an editor at a newspaper where she used  
to work, and she admitted that she didn't have cancer. The meeting 
came after suspicions were raised by former co-workers of Ms. 
Stacy's. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy said the deceit began in late 1995 when she told  
co-workers at the Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville that she 
had cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where the idea came from,'' she told the  
Messenger-Inquirer. ``At the time I was having trouble with my 
blood sugar and going to the doctor a lot, and everybody was real 
nice to me, real concerned. It seemed like to me they really made 
an effort to be friends with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy joined the Messenger-Inquirer in 1998.  
</P>
<P>
	This week, Ms. Stacy was asked in an interview with The  
Associated Press how readers would know that she was telling the 
truth about having AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have an answer for you all,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy said she has had stomach problems but attributes them  
to stress. ``Sometimes I have night-sweats, and occasionally I have 
a rash around my neck and on my chest,'' she told the Owensboro 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Ms. Stacy's father, Monroe Stacy, told the  
Messenger-Inquirer that she is diabetic. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy was a reporter for the newspaper and her only columns  
were about her illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Ashley, editor of the Messenger-Inquirer, said there have  
not been any questions raised about her news stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``We hear nothing but praise for from the folks she covered in  
Ohio and Hancock Counties,'' Ashley said. ``Some have even sought 
to reassure us that Kim's reporting was accurate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody raises any questions we'll certainly investigate  
it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Keegan Named England's Soccer Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Kevin Keegan was hired Friday as England's  
national soccer coach -- one of the most high-profile jobs in the 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my job not to get beheaded,'' the former English star  
said. ``I don't want a knighthood but I want to keep my head on my 
shoulders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He agreed to a three-year contract in a widely expected move.  
England's Football Association said he will work through the 2002 
World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see Kevin as England's manager for the millennium and far  
beyond that,'' F.A. interim executive director David Davies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keegan had taken over as coach in February from the fired Glenn  
Hoddle and said he would coach only four games so he could stay 
with his English club. 
</P>
<P>
	But two weeks ago he said he would take the job full time and  
leave Fulham as soon as a deal could be struck. 
</P>
<P>
	In two games, Keegan led England to a 3-1 win over Poland in a  
qualifier for the 2000 European Championship and a 1-1 tie in an 
exhibition with Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what comes with the job,'' Keegan said. ``I know the  
upside and downside. In this country people get very emotional 
about football and that's what I like about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his goal is to win the World Cup, which England did in  
1966. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to try and match what the '66 team did,'' he said.  
``They had a bit of luck and we will need that, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not as cavalier as people make out, but I do like winning  
and I do know what it takes to win,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Keegan was one of soccer's biggest names in the 1970s. He helped  
Liverpool win three league championships and was twice voted 
European Player of the Year.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST VIEW, Pa. (AP) -- A man who shot and killed his girlfriend  
Friday apparently set fire to his own house and then tried to 
ambush his ex-wife before fleeing into woods, police said. He later 
was found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in suburban Pittsburgh had mounted a massive 20-hour  
manhunt for Francis Weber, 49. They found him dead on the second 
floor of a vacant house at about 9 p.m., about 20 hours after 
police say he killed his girlfriend.

	A relative of the man's girlfriend said Weber, a gas company  
worker, may have been distraught over an impending breakup with 
her. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber shot girlfriend Amy Beardsley, 34, at about 1:30 a.m.  
Friday in Coraopolis, a Pittsburgh suburb, where she was staying 
with a friend, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Weber then went to his home in Bell Acres less than 10 miles  
away and set several fires and flammable booby traps, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Acres authorities alerted police in West View, where  
Weber's ex-wife, Rebekah Weber, lives with their two teen-age 
children. West View police moved her and the children to a safe 
location and were waiting for Weber when he arrived about 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Clad in camouflage, Weber fired eight shots from an  
assault-style rifle at a police officer and fled. The officer was 
not wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Charles Holtgraver said authorities viewed Weber as  
a skilled outdoorsman who apparently intended to hold out for a 
while. Authorities said Weber had a history of domestic violence 
and was an avid hunter.

<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and  
opposition leader Ehud Barak were left in suspense Friday as two 
minor contenders dropped hints but did not make a firm pledge to 
pull out before Monday's election. 
</P>
<P>
	New polls indicate that Barak has widened his lead over  
Netanyahu, but unless minor candidates withdraw the Labor leader 
might not get the 50 percent plus one vote he needs to clinch a 
first-round victory. 
</P>
<P>
	All eyes were on Yitzhak Mordechai, the center party candidate  
who was fired by Netanyahu as defense minister and who has vowed to 
stay on despite sinking in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The other contenders -- Azmi Bishara, the first-ever Arab  
candidate, and Benny Begin, the hawkish son of the late Prime 
Minister Menachem Begin -- were expected to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls published Friday showed Barak widening his lead by about  
four percentage points since last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gallup poll in the Maariv daily gave Barak 48.5 percent and  
Netanyahu 35.5 percent in a five-way race. Mordechai won 4.6 
percent, Bishara received 2.5 percent and Begin got 2.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head contest, the poll gave Barak 54.2 percent and  
Netanyahu 37.4 percent. The poll questioned 1,100 Israeli adults 
and had a margin of error of four percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dahaf poll in another newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, also put  
Barak ahead, but by a smaller margin: 44 percent to Netanyahu's 38 
percent in the first round, and 51 percent to Netanyahu's 41 
percent in a second. For this poll, 1,100 Israeli adults were 
questioned. It gave a margin of error of three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Mordechai was not expected to make any move about staying in the  
race until Saturday night. If he dropped out, he would raise hopes 
for Barak to win a first-round victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheered by hundreds of supporters at a campaign rally, Mordechai  
pledged Thursday to stay in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not deterred by the results of this or that poll,''  
Mordechai said. ``The election is the real poll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But pressure for Mordechai to withdraw has grown this week, with  
members of his own party asking him to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishara was widely expected to withdraw over the weekend. He has  
said from the beginning that his main reason for running was to 
galvanize the 500,000 Israeli Arab voters -- about 11 percent of the 
electorate of 4.3 million -- and to press for Arab rights. 
</P>
<P>
	His withdrawal would be a coup for Barak, whose Labor party is  
traditionally supported by Israeli Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Begin, who opposes territorial compromise with the Palestinians,  
is expected to decide Sunday whether he will stay in the race. 
Begin is said to have been driven into the race by a personal 
grudge against Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates and parties will make their last pitches to the  
public Saturday night, when the final election ads are broadcast on 
television.

<HEADLINE> Motorcycle Champ Recovering Nicely </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MENLO PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Five-time world motorcycle champion  
Mick Doohan was recovering Friday after surgery to repair several 
broken bones suffering in a qualifying accident, and his doctor 
said prospects for his return to racing were excellent. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Arthur Ting, along with trauma experts Dr. Kevin Louie and  
Dr. Trig G. McClellan, needed 3 1/2 hours to repair a collarbone, left 
forearm and right leg broken May 7 during qualifying for last 
Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix. 
</P>
<P>
	Doohan, 33, has six screws and a metal plate in his forearm and  
12 screws, two plates and a bone graft repairing his right tibia, 
Ting said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're very, very pleased with how things went,'' he said.  
``His prospects for racing again are excellent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ting said getting the Australian racer back on a bike in three  
months was optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to depend on the way things heal,'' he said. ``We  
want to be optimistic and the way things turned out, we are 
optimistic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doohan, who has won the last five championships in the premier  
500cc class, was at The Recovery Inn, 25 miles south of San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's extremely tough,'' Ting said. ``He needed very little  
pain medication for an extremely painful injury. He's lucky to be 
alive.''

<HEADLINE> North Dakota Hopes For Dry Spell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UPHAM, N.D. (AP) -- Only two years after North Dakota recorded  
its worst floods in centuries, residents across the east-central 
part of the state are bailing out basements again. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly a week of heavy rain on already saturated ground has  
swamped low-lying areas. State officials said 25 of North Dakota's 
53 counties already have declared disasters due to flooding 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamilton Benson has lived in Upham for nearly 75 years, and he  
has never seen the water so high. He has been running pumps in his 
basement to keep up with water that has started to swamp a row of 
evergreens in his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another week like last week, and I think I'll be floating,''  
he said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions also are worsening around Devils Lake, a closed basin  
in north-central North Dakota where the rising lake has been 
swallowing homes and land for years. 
</P>
<P>
	In Grand Forks, scene of some of the worst flood damage in the  
spring of 1997, officials put off plans to take down a temporary 
dike after forecasters said the Red River would rise to about 10 
feet above flood stage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red River crested 26 feet over flood stage in Grand Forks in  
1997, when the region was devastated by a 500-year flood. 
</P>
<P>
	``Essentially, it is a certain weather pattern that keeps  
bringing in a lot of Pacific storms in off the West Coast,'' said 
National Weather Service meteorologist Bill Abeling. ``There's not 
much to be hopeful for, for an extended drying period, until next 
week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rains also have created havoc for area farmers who cannot  
get in the field to plant crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing being seeded around here,'' Towner farmer Fred  
Schell said. ``If you have a way to make it quit raining, let me 
know. Do a dance or something.''

<HEADLINE> Olympics Announce New Sponsor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The 2002 Winter Games, struggling to  
rebound from scandal, got their first new corporate sponsor in 
nearly a year today. 
</P>
<P>
	Marker Ltd. of Salt Lake agreed to provide uniforms to games  
workers in a sponsorship worth at least $20 million, including 
cash, for OPUS, the company jointly marketing the games for the 
Salt Lake Organizing Committee and the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Utah companies have agreed to donate the medals and  
natural gas for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gives us a real shot in the arm,'' said Salt Lake  
committee president Mitt Romney. ``It's a real boost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O.C. Tanner, a jewelry maker, will provide 1,500 gold, silver  
and bronze medals as well as 50,000 commemorative medals for 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Questar Corp., Utah's biggest natural gas supplier, will provide  
the gas, including fuel for the Olympic cauldron flame. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of those deals is between $5 million and $10 million  
each. 
</P>
<P>
	The Olympic committees do not disclose the precise value of  
sponsor and supplier contracts in order to preserve negotiating 
room with other companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC has been saying it needs $300 million more from  
corporations to meet its $1.45 billion budget, and Romney declined 
Friday to say how much the three new contracts will knock off that 
figure. The SLOC generally gets 70 percent of sponsor fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The three companies signed letters of intent, with contracts to  
follow. 
</P>
<P>
	Corporations have been wary about the marketing value of the  
rings since revelations this winter that executives pushing Salt 
Lake's bid gave more than $1 million in gifts and services to 
International Olympic Committee members. The IOC voted in 1995 to 
give Salt Lake the games. 
</P>
<P>
	But the scandal was far from Romney's mind Friday as he joked  
about hitting up 18 IOC members for donations when they come next 
week to review Salt Lake's games preparations. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told them to bring $10,000 each. That's the legal maximum  
for bringing into the country,'' Romney said, catching himself only 
after his staff burst into embarrassed laughter. ``I didn't think 
of the double entendre,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday night, Salt Lake officials will launch the games'  
mascot.

<HEADLINE> Maple Leafs' Domi Steps Lightly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Tie Domi is a disappointed hockey player, but not  
one to cause dissension in the Toronto Maple Leafs' dressing room 
in the midst of the Stanley Cup playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Domi, upset about taking the pre-game skate then being deleted  
from the lineup before a 3-2 overtime victory Thursday night in 
Pittsburgh, skated with the scrubs Friday. The regulars had the day 
off, resting up for Saturday night, when they try to take a 3-2 
lead in the best-of-7 Eastern Conference semifinal series. 
</P>
<P>
	But he held his ego in check.  
</P>
<P>
	``We won, and that's all that matters,'' he said,  
</P>
<P>
	Coach Pat Quinn said he scratched Domi because the fourth-line  
forward is injured. During the first-round elimination of the 
Philadelphia Flyers, Domi was said to have a slight groin pull. But 
he hadn't missed any games and fully expected to skate in Game 4 
against the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not 100 percent,'' Domi said, adding he's unsure if he'll  
be in the lineup for Game 5. ``I feel better. We'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domi sat in the dressing room watching Game 4 on TV, fiddling  
with a crossword puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough not to be part of it,'' he said. ``After all  
these years not being in the playoffs and being in the playoffs 
now, not being part of a big game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a touchy subject to Quinn, who had a one-word retort when  
asked if he was worried that Domi's obvious disappointment would 
create dissension. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' he icily replied.  
</P>
<P>
	Egos must be put aside in favor of team goals, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're here to do one thing and that's to win this series,''  
Quinn said. ``It's my job to make the decisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Domi has been largely ineffective in the playoffs. A racism  
charge by Philadelphia's Sandy McCarthy, which Domi denied, drained 
him emotionally. Quinn has warned Domi to stay out of the 
post-season penalty box, and used him for only about six minutes a 
game against the Penguins before yanking him Thursday in favor of 
first-line castoff Freddie Modin. 
</P>
<P>
	If Domi isn't going to fight, his usefulness -- healthy or not --  
comes into question when more skilled players are available to the 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Quinn does not perceive the Pittsburgh series to be one  
requiring a lot of muscle. That's why he's not using 6-foot-7 
defenseman Chris McAllister, who was impressive in the elimination 
of the Flyers. The more docile but speedier Tomas Kaberle took 
McAllister's place against the Penguins. 
</P>
<P>
	McAllister has been told not to expect to get to defend against  
Pittsburgh's sensational Jaromir Jagr. 
</P>
<P>
	``This series is a little bit different from the Philadelphia  
series,'' McAllister said. ``They don't really have a physical 
presence on their team. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not a big, physical team. I just have to rest for this  
series, and once we get past this one I'll play against either 
Buffalo or Boston, I'm hoping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, center Steve Sullivan continues to receive treatment  
for back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting better every day,'' Sullivan said. ``But I don't  
know how long it's going to take to be in game shape.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also is uncertain if he'll play in Game 5.  
</P>
<P>
	``That I don't know,'' he said. ``We'll see how I feel and how  
the coaches feel about putting me in the lineup. It'll be a coach's 
and trainer's decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Quinn says Sullivan will play if he's ready.  
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins, who won Game 1 on the road, are not concerned  
about the return to Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes the pressure off us playing up there,'' said forward  
Matthew Barnaby. 
</P>
<P>
	The status of injured Penguins Alexei Kovalev and German Titov  
remains uncertain. Without them, coach Kevin Constantine has relied 
heavily on Jagr, Martin Straka and Kevin Hatcher. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins looked worn down by the time the overtime period  
began Thursday night, but Barnaby didn't agree. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't speak for our whole team, but I don't think we were  
tired,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Congress May Double Presidents Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A House subcommittee approved legislation  
Friday that would provide for an increase in the president's salary 
-- effective the day President Clinton leaves office. 
</P>
<P>
	The adjustment would take effect at noon on Jan. 20, 2001 and  
would mark the first raise in the president's salary since Lyndon 
Johnson retired 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would double the chief executive's salary to  
$400,000 annually, according to Saturday's editions of The 
Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation passed the House Appropriations Committee's  
Treasury-Postal Service Subcommittee as part of a huge spending 
bill. The House Government Reform Committee's panel on management, 
information and technology is scheduled to review the issue May 24. 
</P>
<P>
	The last pay increase for a president was in January, 1969, when  
the salary was doubled from $100,000 to $200,000 upon Richard Nixon 
assuming office. A $50,000 annual expense account established by 
Congress for the president also became effective then. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the Constitution, pay raises can only be enacted at the  
change of administrations.

<HEADLINE> Senate GOP Retreats on Gun Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With Republicans in full retreat, President  
Clinton today prodded the Senate to approve new restrictions on 
firearm sales at gun shows and to reject a ``phony proposal'' that 
he said was ``riddled with high-caliber loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president turned up the heat after Republicans, stung by  
public criticism, agreed Thursday to reconsider a Senate vote a day 
earlier that had rejected a Democratic-proposed crackdown on 
private sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate today was expected to take up a proposal by Sen.  
Larry Craig, R-Idaho, that essentially would undo Wednesday's vote 
on gun-show sales. Still, some Democrats complained that the 
amendment wasn't all that it appeared to be. Clinton endorsed the 
Democrats' view. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new Senate Republican bill is still riddled with  
high-caliber loopholes,'' the president said at the White House. 
``It won't stop criminals from buying guns at gun shows. At the 
same time, it will open up a new pawnshop loophole that lets 
convicted felons get guns at a local pawnshop. That's actually 
worse than current law. I simply can't believe the Senate will make 
the same mistake twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, once again, I ask them to reject this phony proposal and  
to pass real legislation that requires the background checks 
necessary to prevent criminals from buy guns at gun shows which 
they cannot buy at gun stores,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' abrupt U-turn underscored the shift in the gun-  
control debate following last month's shooting spree in Littleton, 
Colo., that left 14 high school students and a teacher dead. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Senate agreed to prohibit the import of  
high-capacity ammunition clips not included in a 1994 assault 
weapons ban. An effort to kill the measure was rejected, 59-39, 
with almost all votes in opposition cast by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats called it a victory over the National Rifle  
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NRA said no and it passed anyway,'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein,  
D-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also agreed to a proposal by Sen. John Ashcroft,  
R-Mo., to ban juvenile possession of semiautomatic weapons and 
high-capacity ammunition clips. That vote was 96-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this week's action, a big backlog of amendments  
threatened to derail Sen. Orrin Hatch's underlying bill, which 
would stiffen prosecution standards for juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in such a doggone log jam here that we might have to  
pull this bill down,'' Hatch, R-Utah, sputtered from the floor late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Wednesday approved an amendment by Craig to make  
instant background checks of private sales at gun shows voluntary. 
But a half-dozen Republicans later complained to Craig, a member of 
the NRA's board of directors, that his amendment should go further 
to ensure that background checks are performed even in private 
sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a 2000 presidential  
contender, told Craig the amendment needed to be fixed. Sen. Gordon 
Smith, R-Ore., threatened to change his vote on Craig's amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
private polling in recent weeks has shown very strong support for 
gun control, even among potential voters in Republican presidential 
primaries. That is a marked shift from the past, in which base GOP 
voters were less supportive of gun control than the nation as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also pounced on Wednesday's vote.  
Clinton, joined by Attorney General Janet Reno in some of the 
harshest terms she's used on congressional action, accused the 
Senate of ignoring the threat highlighted less than a month earlier 
by the shootings at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	By midafternoon Thursday, Craig announced that he would propose  
an amendment that would require background checks for all transfers 
of firearms at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats at first rejoiced. But later, they accused Craig of  
not strengthening gun laws. Democrats said Craig's new proposal 
still would leave a group of people who would not be required to do 
background checks of purchasers.

	Craig disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every gun transfer at gun shows would have a background check  
performed,'' Craig told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also said that under Craig's new proposal, a sale would  
be approved automatically if the background check was not completed 
within 24 hours, rather than the three days in current law. They 
also said the proposal would continue to allow an individual to 
pawn a gun and reclaim it without undergoing a background check.

<HEADLINE> Formula One Changes Racing Calendar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Formula One racing is changing places  
in Britain and planning a return to France. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernie Ecclestone, the chief executive of Formula One, said  
Friday the British Grand Prix will move from Silverstone to Brands 
Hatch, England, in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	He also he said his firm, Excelis, acquired the former home of  
the French Grand Prix, the Paul Ricard Circuit in southern France, 
and hopes to return Formula One racing there. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcements -- during an offday before qualifying for the  
Grand Prix of Monaco -- are the latest changes made by Formula One. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the date for the first U.S. Grand Prix at  
Indianapolis Motor Speedway was set for Sept. 24, 2000. The only 
Formula One race in North America now is the Canadian Grand Prix in 
Montreal in June. 
</P>
<P>
	For the British GP, Ecclestone said he was not able to reach an  
agreement with the owners of Silverstone, the British Racing 
Drivers Club, to hold the race beyond 2001, and made a six-year 
deal to bring the event back to Brands Hatch. 
</P>
<P>
	Brands Hatch Leisure Group, the owner of the racing circuit,  
about 30 miles from London, said they signed an exclusive contract 
with F1. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to making this the biggest and most successful  
Grand Prix ever,'' said Nicola Foulston, the chief executive 
officer of BHL and daughter of the former owner of the track, John 
Foulston. Foulston was killed in a crash at Silverstone in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The owners of Brand Hatch said they are committed to more than  
$30 million to reconstruct the track and its facilities to bring it 
up to current Formula One standards. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverstone, about 60 miles from London, has held the British  
Grand Prix since 1987. Before that, the race alternated between 
Silverstone and Brands Hatch with five races at Aintree between 
1955 and 1962. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain staged the first event of the Formula One series in  
1950, and a British Grand Prix has been held every year since. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Ecclestone's group announced the purchase of the Paul  
Ricard Circuit at Le Castellet near Toulon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to make the circuit what it was, the best circuit  
in Europe,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The French Grand Prix has been held in Magny Cours in central  
France since 1991, but has had contract difficulties over 
television rights and tobacco sponsorship. That made Formula One 
take the French GP off the calendar twice the past seven years 
before being reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
	Le Castellet opened in 1971, and hosted French Grand Prix 14  
times. It now is used for Formula One testing, and will hold the 
French Motorcycle Grand Prix next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to make a lot of repairs and a renovations so  
that it would be up to the standards and welcome the big races such 
as Formula One,'' Ecclestone said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Black Women Invest Less </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Black women want to invest in stocks, but  
they've been stymied by family demands such as caring for children 
and financially supporting others, according to a study released 
Friday about the investment attitudes of blacks and whites. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, all blacks are underinvested because of ``formidable  
cultural and demographic factors,'' even as the bull market still 
roars on Wall Street, according to the second annual survey 
sponsored by Ariel Mutual Funds and Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	``After working so hard to join the middle class, many blacks  
are still missing out on the greatest wealth-building opportunity 
in American history,'' said John Rogers, president of Ariel Mutual 
Funds, a black-owned investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ariel/Schwab survey, conducted late last year, queried 813  
black and 816 white households with annual incomes at or exceeding 
$50,000. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey comes as the theme of ``wealth creation'' for blacks  
tops the agenda of the NAACP, civil rights leader Jesse Jackson, 
and two conferences on the topic slated this month for New York. 
The Coalition of Black Investors claims May as its investment month 
for blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Ariel/Schwab survey found that blacks were  
underinvested. This year, the survey sought to determine why, 
especially when they found black women at the lower end of most 
equations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Black women have lots of demands on their precious resources,  
particularly those relating to taking care of children,'' said 
Mellody Hobson, senior vice president at Ariel. 
</P>
<P>
	Black households are more likely than white ones to have  
children present under age 18 (53 percent vs. 46 percent), are more 
likely to be single-parent households (16 percent vs. 5 percent) 
and are more likely to financially support people outside of their 
immediate families (27 percent vs. 12 percent), according to the 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Hobson said, ``Black women have been behind because  
we've been the least exposed of all groups to the stock market and 
investing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That lack of exposure extends to childhood.  
</P>
<P>
	The survey showed that 36 percent of both black males and  
females opened a bank account before high school, against 57 
percent of white males and 51 percent of white females; 23 percent 
of black females grew up in a home with stocks, compared with 25 
percent of black males, 45 percent of white males and 46 percent of 
white females. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, blacks and whites differ in their views on the best way to  
invest, with blacks leaning toward banks, real estate and whole 
life insurance and whites more likely to use brokerage firms or 
invest in mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Black women are the most likely to own whole life insurance (60  
percent compared with 40 percent of white men), least likely to 
have money in a mutual fund (38 percent vs. 58 percent of white 
men) and least likely to have money in an IRA account (29 percent 
vs. 53 percent for white men). 
</P>
<P>
	Hobson said the inclination for blacks to covet real estate is  
long engrained because ``African-Americans were denied the right to 
own land for so long. I think we are seeing the ripple effect of 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But while black women were underexposed to investing, they are  
in the forefront of seeking knowledge about this area. The survey 
found that 79 percent of black women prefer to consult with a 
professional when investing, against 56 percent of white men. More 
black women than white women have watched television shows or read 
books about investing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a hunger for information that shows up at grassroots  
seminars, which are heavily weighted toward women,'' Hobson said.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Pushes Strong Decision-Making </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Outgoing Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin had at  
least one common bond with the New York University graduates he 
addressed today. 
</P>
<P>
	They're all in the job market.  
</P>
<P>
	A day after officially announcing he will step down from his  
Cabinet post, Rubin used folksy anecdotes and tales from his days 
in the Treasury to tell about 5,000 graduates that strong, reasoned 
decision-making is a key to success in life. 
</P>
<P>
	``The circumstances for decision-making may never be ideal. But  
you must decide nonetheless,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin's speech drew no parallels to his own long-anticipated  
decision to leave the Treasury. But in a brief conversation with 
reporters before he took the podium in Manhattan's Washington 
Square Park, he said he knew his job wasn't completely finished, as 
several world economies still struggle under the weight of last 
year's economic crises. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he said he would not have resigned if he had been less  
confident in his successor, former deputy secretary Lawrence 
Summers. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, a former co-chairman at investment bank Goldman Sachs &AMP;  
Co., would not say whether he plans to return to a post in the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really don't know what I'm going to do,'' he said. ``But I  
will re-engage in some fashion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an architect of U.S. economic policy, Rubin has been known as  
a cautious, disciplined thinker and speaker. But he encouraged the 
NYU graduates to embrace uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	``A healthy respect for uncertainty and focus on probability  
drives you never to be satisfied with your conclusions,'' he said. 
As an investment banker and as a Cabinet official, Rubin said, he 
was forced to make choices that might compromise profits or 
political relationships, often with little time to weigh every 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the end, all decisions are based on imperfect or incomplete  
information,'' he said. ``But decisions must be made -- and on a 
timely basis -- whether in school, on the trading floor, or in the 
White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin, draped in NYU's traditional purple robe, received an  
honorary doctor of laws degree.

<HEADLINE> Justice: Courts Must Build Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal and state courts should not sacrifice  
their independence while trying to bolster public confidence in the 
nation's system of justice, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The search for greater public trust and confidence in the  
judiciary must be pursued consistently with the idea of judicial 
independence,'' Rehnquist told a national conference studying 
public perceptions of courts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is possible, in the name of building public trust and  
confidence in the judicial system, to say that judges who have 
rendered an unpopular decision should reconsider it if a majority 
of the public does not agree with it,'' said Rehnquist, the 
top-ranking federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	``But whatever such a practice might do to increase public trust  
and confidence in the system -- and I think it might be quite 
counterproductive -- it would be quite contrary to the idea of an 
independent judiciary,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Recall of judicial decisions by some sort of a popular mandate  
... is too high a price to pay for public approval,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the justice system is an adversarial one, Rehnquist  
said, the typical case features one side that will win and one that 
will lose. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the losers will understandably be disappointed, and  
some may feel they got a raw deal from the courts,'' he said. 
``There is little that the judicial system can do to change this 
perception if it is based solely on the fact that the litigant 
lost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unsuccessful litigants are not the only court critics. Those  
ranks also include lawyers, law professors, editorial commentators 
and writers in legal journals. Rehnquist said he hoped such 
criticism ``would be informed and rational,'' but he invoked a 
quote from 19th century Supreme Court Justice David Brewer: ``True, 
many criticisms may be, like their authors, devoid of good taste, 
but better all sorts of criticism than no criticism at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such criticism, if widespread and persistent, eventually proves  
effective, Rehnquist said. ``As judges of appellate courts resign, 
retire or die, public opinion through the appointing process by 
which the political branches choose their successors may change the 
judicial philosophy of a court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a slow process,'' he said, ``but it is the only one  
consistent with the idea of an independent judiciary.''

<HEADLINE> Report Probes China Spying Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- China has obtained sensitive information about  
seven major weapons in the U.S. nuclear arsenal through aggressive 
spying over two decades, according to U.S. officials who have seen 
a secret congressional report on Beijing's espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	The report by a select House committee chaired by Rep.  
Christopher Cox, R-Calif., also discloses that China conducted a 
half-dozen tests in the mid-1980s of neutron bomb technology 
believed to have been stolen from the United States, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The last test of a neutron bomb detected by U.S. intelligence  
occurred in 1988, the officials said, speaking to The Associated 
Press on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox report is being declassified by U.S. officials and will  
be released publicly later this month. Officials who have seen it 
say it provides a sweeping history of China's efforts to obtain 
classified U.S. technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``The headline will be that the extent of Chinese nuclear theft  
is much broader than has been previously revealed. The report 
asserts that the Chinese have acquired sensitive design information 
on virtually the entire current U.S. nuclear arsenal,'' one 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of China's gains of U.S. nuclear secrets were  
in the 1980s when Republicans controlled the White House. President 
Clinton, however, has acknowledged that security at the Energy 
Department nuclear weapons labs remained lax well into his watch. 
Clinton began ordering extensive steps to improve security in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the U.S. officials, the Cox report discloses that  
the Chinese: 
</P>
<P>
	--Acquired in the mid-1990s U.S. secrets about a high-tech weapon  
developed during the Star Wars missile defense program that uses 
electromagnetic waves to propel objects like missiles or shells. 
U.S intelligence ascertained that China had obtained the technology 
about the so-called rail gun, but they could not tell from where in 
the United States it was obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	--Obtained in 1980 part of a missile guidance system called the  
accelerometer. U.S. intelligence ascertained that the Chinese did 
reverse engineering to develop their own version of the part. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Friday, U.S. officials had disclosed only that they  
suspected China had obtained secret information about the 
submarine-based W-88 Trident warhead, the neutron bomb and some 
re-entry vehicles for multiple warhead weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox report discloses that U.S. intelligence indicates  
Beijing has obtained secrets about seven U.S. nuclear weapons, 
including the W-56, W-62, W-76, W-78 and W-87 nuclear warheads, the 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The W-87 warhead sits atop the MX Peacekeeper missile that is  
among America's most sophisticated current weapons. The W-62 and 
W-78 warheads sit atop the Minuteman III long-range missiles that 
also are a key component of the current U.S. nuclear arsenal. The 
W-56, like the W-88, sits atop the sub-based Trident missiles that 
are still widely deployed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials said they are less concerned about the leaks  
concerning the W-76 warheads because they involve obsolete versions 
of the Minuteman missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Intelligence officials say the technology gains China made  
through spying give Beijing the ability to develop nuclear weapons 
similar to the United States, substantially updating an arsenal 
that just a few years ago trailed America's by decades. 
</P>
<P>
	While U.S. officials have raised significant alarm over China's  
espionage and gains, experts caution that China does not appear to 
have attempted mass production of nuclear weapons. China also keeps 
its weapons on a relatively low level of alert and does not appear 
to be trying to deploy multiple-warhead weapons that would escalate 
a nuclear arms race. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cox report ``fleshes out the picture and gives us more  
pieces of the puzzle. And it is eye-opening in that respect, the 
extent of China's spying,'' said Charles Ferguson, a former Navy 
officer and Los Alamos weapons lab scientist and now an analyst for 
the Federation of American Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ferguson noted that China has only 18 long-range missiles --  
all with single warheads that date back years in technology -- while 
the United States has hundreds of missiles and more than 6,000 
warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	``The key is for the U.S. not to go into panic mode and rather  
to think of ways to encourage stability and to encourage China not 
to go to multiple warheads,'' Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government officials said most of the House committee's  
conclusions come from a 1988 Chinese document that U.S. 
intelligence obtained in 1995. It showed the Beijing government had 
gotten information about the yield, range and accuracy of each of 
the warheads. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the information about the missiles could have been  
obtained from open literature, the officials said, but other pieces 
had to come from classified U.S. materials. U.S. officials have not 
been able to pinpoint where the leaks occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence was most alarmed about extensive detail in the  
Chinese document about the W-88 submarine warhead that could only 
have come from classified U.S. government sources, the officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The officials said the Cox report also discloses that U.S.  
intelligence detected that China tested ``a series'' of neutron 
bombs in the 1980s with the last detonation occurring in 1988. One 
official put the number at about six. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of the tests, China had not yet signed the nuclear  
test ban treaty. It eventually did so in 1996. Beijing has yet to 
ratify the treaty. 
</P>
<P>
	During the Cold War, the neutron bomb was developed by the U.S.  
and China as a possible weapon against mass Soviet troops. It kills 
people with lethal doses of radiation without destroying buildings.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rep. John Kasich, whose bid for the Republican  
presidential nomination has been met with a lukewarm response 
within his party, picked up a key endorsement Friday in crucial New 
Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	State Senator Carl Johnson, the highest ranking Republican  
legislator in the state, said his pick was based on Kasich's 
leadership in Congress, particularly his fight to balance the 
federal budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Kasich is a leader, plain and simple,'' Johnson said in  
statement. ``Under his leadership, Congress passed the first 
balanced budget since man walked on the moon.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Court Voids EPA Air-Pollution Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court today set aside new  
air quality standards issued by the Environmental Protection Agency 
in 1997, handing the Clinton administration a major environmental 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-judge panel, acting on a lawsuit by a number of  
industry groups, said the section of the 1990 Clean Air Act on 
which the EPA relied in issuing the air pollution rules amounted to 
``an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA is almost certain to appeal the case, although the  
agency had no immediate comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision was a major victory for a broad range of industry  
groups from trucking companies to electric utilities, which had 
fought the tougher air quality rules as too expensive and 
ill-conceived. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations, issued in July 1997, imposed much tougher  
health standards for smog-causing ozone and opened the way for the 
first time for regulation of microscopic soot. The tighter 
standards overnight put hundreds of counties in violation of 
federal air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Vice President Al Gore called the tougher  
requirements ``the most significant steps in a generation to 
protect the American people, especially our children, from air 
pollution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The opinion was handed down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia on a lawsuit filed by the American Trucking 
Associations and a number of other industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges David S. Tatel, Stephen F. Williams and Douglas H.  
Ginsburg wrote separate parts of the opinion, although Tatel filed 
a dissent on a portion of the findings. 
</P>
<P>
	The rule was one of the most contentious environmental issues  
facing the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulation dramatically tightened federal air quality  
requirements for ozone, commonly known as smog, with an aim to 
provide better protection of children, the elderly and populations 
with respiratory problems. 
</P>
<P>
	It also for the first time required states to regulate  
microscopic particles, or soot, down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times 
smaller than the width of a human hair. States and cities were 
given until 2003 to comply with the soot standard, but the new 
ozone requirements went into effect immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big victory. One of the biggest,'' said Robin Conrad,  
senior vice president for litigation at the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the ruling put into question the EPA's methods of  
selecting the new standards and asserted the agency was ``picking 
numbers out of thin air.'' She said the EPA now will have to 
``start the process all over again ... and justify its numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The court did not vacate the EPA's ozone rule altogether, but  
said the standard ``cannot be enforced.'' The judges, however, did 
nullify the particulate standard and directed the EPA to develop a 
new one.

	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- A slain Argentine newspaper  
editor was buried here Friday, as his colleagues demanded he not 
join the list of journalists whose killers go unpunished. 
</P>
<P>
	Ricardo Gangeme, 56, editor of El Informador Chubutense and  
former editor of the Buenos Aires daily Cronica, was shot once in 
the head early Thursday in the southern Argentine city of Trelew. 
Colleagues reported that Gangeme, a crusading crime-fighting 
journalist, recently had received threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge E. Fascetto, president of the Inter American Press  
Association, told a local radio station that hundreds of 
journalists have been killed worldwide over the years, with few 
cases getting solved. 
</P>
<P>
	But Fascetto, a board member at the El Dia daily newspaper in La  
Plata, said he hoped Gangeme's killers would be found. ``It is a 
terrible thing for democracy when someone kills the messenger so 
that the message isn't received,'' said Fascetto, who was in Taiwan

	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- A plasma production center in  
northeastern Brazil thought to have used blood contaminated with 
hepatitis and the AIDS virus has been shut down, the Health 
Ministry said Friday.

<P>
	The ministry said at least eight people may have been  
contaminated with either one of the viruses in the states of 
Pernambuco, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro, Alagoas and Santa Catarina. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 2,000 bags could be contaminated with the HIV virus and  
another 5,000 with the hepatitis virus, said the ministry. 
</P>

sent and determine whether or not they have been used.

	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Authorities temporarily closed the  
airport Friday in Tegucigalpa, the nation's capital, after smoke 
from an estimated 1,000 forest and grass fires mixed with fog to 
create a dense haze. 
</P>
<P>
	The terminal was closed to flights for about 11 hours before  
re-opening Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	But the problem was nothing compared to last year, when an  
estimated 5,000 such fires -- generally caused by farmers burning 
vegetation in preparation for spring planting -- caused the nation's 
four major airports to shut down for a total of 28 days in May, 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's shutdown forced controllers to reroute flights to the  
La Mesa international airport in the northern city of San Pedro 
Sula, 125 miles north of Tegucigalpa. 
</P>
<P>
	Smoke from this year's forest fires have caused a 30-percent  
increase in reported cases of respiratory illnesses, said Tito

<HEADLINE> Rare Quake Rattles Kansas City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Kan. (AP) -- A small but rare earthquake shook a  
40-block span of this city early Thursday, damaging a medical 
building with about 100 people inside. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The quake, which registered a magnitude of 3.0, was considered  
weak but uncommon for a Midwestern state like Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an unusual event but certainly nothing to be alarmed  
about,'' said Don Steeples, a professor in the Geology Department 
at the University of Kansas. 
</P>
<P>
	John Minsch, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey,  
said he knew of just one other instance of an earthquake registered 
in the area. That quake registered 3.8 in 1931. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 health care workers and patients were evacuated from  
the Indian Springs Medical Building after the quake hit at about 
9:20 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Denney, spokesman for the Unified Government, said cracks  
were ``spread out all over'' the two-story building. A parking lot 
also was damaged near the building, where the pavement had buckled 
and dropped off about 8 feet.

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with prices falling in Tokyo and Hong Kong but surging in 
Kuala Lumpur and Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at  
16,810.39 points, down 40.86 points, or 0.24 percent from Thursday. 
On Thursday, the index lost 96.11 points, or 0.57 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices initially rose in reaction to record gains on Wall  
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 106.82 points 
to close at 11,107.19, breezing past the previous closing record of 
11,031.59, posted May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	But players grew cautious about pushing prices higher before a  
series of closely watched earnings reports for the last fiscal 
year, ending in March, which are expected in coming weeks, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Institutional investors start selling each time the Nikkei  
average nears 17,000,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy general 
manager of the equity department at Daiwa Securities SB Capital 
Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.18 yen late Friday,  
up 0.60 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New 
York level of 121.85 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong slumped Friday after two straight  
sessions of advances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 198.15 points, or 1.5 percent, closing at 
12,855.52. On Thursday, the index had gained 40.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices fell as investors took profits  
following recent sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the index rose to 13,000 points, the atmosphere has turned  
cautious,'' said James So, head of sales at Asia Financial 
(Securities) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian share prices soared on hopes that Malaysia will be  
reinstated into the closely-watched Morgan Stanley Capital 
International Indexes, or MSCI, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index, which tracks  
100 key stocks, rose 4.5 percent, or 33.29 points, to close at 
766.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley is expected to announce changes Monday to the  
components of its index, which is widely watched by fund managers 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Malaysia is in the index, we can expect money from the U.S.  
to enter the local bourse,'' said an institutional dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Taiwan also closed sharply higher, fueled by  
gains in U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 176.33  
points, or 2.37 percent, to 7,592.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Share prices closed sharply higher as the Indonesia  
government signed a new letter of intent with the International 
Monetary Fund, paving the way for the release of around U.S. dlr 1 
billion in loans from the IMF's bailout package. The Composite 
Index rose 15.130 points, or 2.6 percent, to 591.634. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher,  
spurred on by broad demand for local blue-chip stocks, brokers 
said. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 32.17 points or 1.5 
percent, to 2,251.32. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower on fears of a possible  
rise in key U.S. interest rates next week, traders said. The 
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 19.26 points, or 
0.8 percent, to 2,502.75. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed generally higher, after  
the country's major banks and other blue-chip industrial stocks 
helped to boost the market indicator. The All Ordinaries Index rose 
25.4 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,055.0. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on concerns about rising  
interest rates. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 4.54 
points, or 0.6 percent, to 737.83. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher, with the benchmark index  
gaining on the back of selective buying of index linked stocks. The 
Straits Times Index rose 14.45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,883.28.

<HEADLINE> Rudd Hopes Crew Chief Brings Luck </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Virginia native Ricky Rudd is hoping crew  
chief Michael McSwain will help get his Ford team moving in the 
right direction. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chesapeake native arrived at Richmond International Raceway  
37th in the driver standings and hasn't finished better than 19th 
this season, which he entered having won a race in a modern-record 
16 consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've watched him and he's a real good people person,'' Rudd  
said of McSwain, who resigned as crew chief for Rick Mast last 
week. ``He knows how to take the people around him and get them to 
rally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McSwain was with his new team for testing at Lowe's Motor  
Speedway in Charlotte last week, and is hoping to get comfortable 
in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like any new deal, it will take Ricky and me some time to  
learn how to work with each other,'' he said. ``I need some time to 
learn what he likes in a race car and I think we made some progress 
at Charlotte.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *RUSTY'S RACEWAY:* Rusty Wallace declared Bristol his favorite  
track last month, then proceeded to win the pole, lead 425 of 500 
laps and post his seventh career victory on the high-banked 
.533-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace's career numbers at Richmond are even better since the  
track was rebuilt into a three-quarter-mile layout. 
</P>
<P>
	Since finishing 35th in the first race on the new track in the  
fall of 1988, Wallace has six victories, 19 top-10 finishes and 15 
top-fives at Richmond. He's run all but four of the 8,000 laps in 
those 20 races. 
</P>
<P>
	Wallace almost got win No. 7 in this race a year ago, but wound  
up third after bumping Jeff Gordon off the lead -- and into the wall 
-- with 28 laps to go. Terry Labonte nudged Dale Jarrett aside with 
two laps left to win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a wild one, that's for sure,'' Wallace said. ``And we  
were in the middle of it. It'll probably be another wild one again 
this Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *MORE CREWS NEWS:* Pat Tryson has joined Johnny Benson's Winston  
Cup team as crew chief after a year as the car chief for Chad 
Little. 
</P>
<P>
	For Tryson, the move is like going home, at least when it comes  
to the car number. Benson drives the No. 26 Ford for Roush Racing, 
the same car number Tryson worked with as crew chief for NHRA star 
Kenny Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
	Benson, 28th in the driver standings, was surprised by the  
switch, which put Bobby Leslie in apparent limbo within Jack 
Roush's racing stable. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a shock, but by the same token we need to have better  
results than what we've been having,'' Benson said. His best finish 
is 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	Other drivers working with new crew chiefs this weekend include  
Steve Park, now with Steve Hmiel in charge; Rick Mast, who hired 
Jerry Pitts after Pitts quit Bill Elliott's team; and Elliott, who 
promoted Wayne Orme, the chief for the now defunct No. 13 team at 
Daytona to start the season. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	 *LOCAL OWNER GETS SPONSOR:* Struggling Winston Cup owner Junie  
Donlavey, based in Richmond, announced a sponsorship deal with Hill 
Brothers Coffee for the Pontiac 400 at RIR on Saturday night. 
Donlavey, in his 50th season as a Winston Cup owner, will put Hut 
Stricklin in his Ford for the race. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STAT OF THE DAY:* Jeff Gordon had 17 consecutive top-five  
finishes after getting bumped by Rusty Wallace after taking the 
lead with 28 laps to go in the spring race last year. Gordon 
finished that race a season-worst 37th.

<HEADLINE> Cutting Yugoslav Web Access Eyed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Confronted with a dilemma of war in the  
information age, the Clinton administration is trying to decide 
whether its trade embargo extends to Internet access for some of 
Yugoslavia's citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Loral Space and Communications Ltd. of New York said it may be  
forced to cut transmissions into Yugoslavia from one of its 
satellites, which serves at least two of the country's major 
Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're still not clear on this whole thing,'' said Jeannette  
Colnan, a spokeswoman for Loral Space. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued an executive order two weeks ago  
banning U.S. companies from selling or supplying to Yugoslavia 
``any goods, software, technology or services,'' although the order 
allows for the ``special consideration of the humanitarian needs of 
refugees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Security Council said information services are  
generally considered exempt from trade embargoes, but that 
electronic commerce is affected. The Internet performs both 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll need to inquire further about the appropriate  
applications of the law,'' said David Leavy, a spokesman for the 
security council. 
</P>
<P>
	Loral Space said Thursday that it was discussing its obligations  
under the embargo with the Treasury Department, which didn't 
respond to requests for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said any move by the United States to limit civilian use  
of the Internet would be unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has already attacked Serbian broadcast stations to stem  
what it describes as propaganda, and Serbs have established an 
extraordinary network on the Internet criticizing ongoing air 
strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Internet also serves as a conduit for civilians to  
receive unadulterated news reports about NATO efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet remains at this point one of the major sources  
inside Yugoslavia for objective news reporting about the war,'' 
said Jim Dempsey of the Washington-based Center for Democracy and 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the threat to shut down Internet access to at least  
parts of Yugoslavia spread quickly across the global network, where 
it was condemned in some e-mail messages and online discussion 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put it bluntly, we somehow got used to air-raid sirens,  
bombings and threats of invasion, but we don't know how we're going 
to survive without the Internet,'' said Alex Krstanovic, cofounder 
of Beonet, one of the Internet providers in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But some argued that access should be cut off.  
</P>
<P>
	``Continuing to provide these services would be kind of like  
giving aid to the enemy,'' one person wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible loss of Internet access also illustrated the  
fragility of the computer network and the importance assigned to it 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer traffic in Yugoslavia uses both satellite and  
traditional land-based telephone lines, but the loss of the Loral 
satellite could dramatically reduce the Internet bandwidth 
available to citizens there, causing slow connections or even 
blackouts. 
</P>
<P>
	Web sites reliant on the Loral satellite continued to be  
accessible overnight Thursday, and there were no substantiated 
reports of anyone unable to retrieve information from outside the 
country using the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman at the organization that registers Web addresses  
ending with the country's ``yu'' suffix said that she was familiar 
with the reports but that there had been no problems yet.

the thinking: Don't get mad, get even.

<P>
	State legislator Anne G. ``Panny'' Rhodes angered Gov. Jim  
Gilmore, a fellow Republican, by opposing some of his initiatives. 
So Gilmore has taken the extraordinary step of endorsing her

<P>
	Ms. Rhodes is among a small band of moderate Republicans who  
have bucked Gilmore and his predecessor, George Allen, both 
conservatives, on tax cuts and major social issues such as abortion 
and welfare.

	In announcing his backing for Ms. Rhodes' challenger, Ruble  
Hord, Gilmore said Ms. Rhodes had effectively switched parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just about Panny Rhodes,'' said University of  
Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato. ``It's about a handful of 
other moderates who go their own way. It's a warning with a capital 
`W' -- toe the line, or this could happen to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is rare for governors to meddle in primaries.  
</P>
<P>
	``They learn to avoid fights that aren't absolutely necessary  
because every fight reduces the political capital you have in the 
bank,'' Sabato said. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore can afford the risk more than most governors because  
Virginia is the only state that does not allow its chief executive 
to seek re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds is charged with malicious wounding, use of a firearm in  
a felony and the unlawful wearing of a mask in a 1997 attack on 
Robinson. A mistrial was declared Thursday after the jury 
deadlocked. Prosecutors said they will retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men parted ways when Robinson publicly disputed the  
reason Edmonds gave for resigning from the bench during a 
misconduct inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds said his personal feelings have nothing to do with his  
second attempt to unseat Robinson (the first came just weeks before 
the attack). ``I feel I'm a better candidate for the position,'' 
Edmonds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson told The Virginian-Pilot: ``I don't think there is any  
question about the real motivation of his candidacy -- spite.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners' Rodriguez Returns From DL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez wasted little time getting back in  
the swing of things Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Mariners shortstop, who missed 32 games with a torn  
medial meniscus in his left knee, homered in his first at-bat 
against Kansas City starter Jeff Suppan on a 2-0 pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-time All-Star singled in his next at-bat in the third  
inning. He was later thrown out attempting to steal third. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 19,  
retroactive to April 7. He originally suffered the injury March 30 
in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodriguez left in the seventh inning of Seattle's second game of  
the season. He was 0-for-6 with a walk and one run entering 
Friday's game. The Mariners used seven shortstops in his absence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners sent infielder Domingo Cedeno to Triple-A Tacoma to  
make room for Rodriguez.

<HEADLINE> Home Ice No Blessing in Playoffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- In a series in which home ice is no advantage, the  
edge, surprisingly, goes to the reeling Detroit Red Wings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings' pursuit of a third straight Stanley Cup  
championship appeared shaky after being pummeled twice in a row at 
home, 5-3 and 6-2, by the Colorado Avalanche. The two victories 
squared the playoff series at 2-2 and gave the momentum to 
Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	But wait. Two of the remaining three games -- if the series goes  
the limit -- are scheduled for Colorado, which looks like a 
disadvantage for the Avalanche since the home team hasn't won a 
game yet in this Western Conference semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unusual twist, the team that manages to steal a win at  
home might be the series winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, 1-4 at home in the postseason this year, went to 5-0  
on the road with its 6-2 romp over Detroit on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're playing very well on the road, and we're due to win a  
game at home,'' said Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy, who had 31 saves 
in notching his 105th career playoff victory, extending his NHL 
record. 
</P>
<P>
	``We seem to come up with the big effort when we've needed to on  
the road,'' forward Theo Fleury said. ``All year long, ever since 
I've been here, we've been a great road team. That's something we 
should think about when we go to Denver. Let's simplify the games 
now, not get too fancy, do what we've done the last two hockey 
games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That seemed to be the only reasonable explanation for Colorado's  
superior play on the road as opposed to at home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that at home, we put too much pressure on ourselves to  
do too much,'' said Peter Forsberg, who scored his first goal of 
the series Thursday night. ``When we are playing on the road, we 
seem able to relax and play our type of hockey.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just four days earlier, the Avs looked primed to be swept.  
Detroit embarrassed the home team with a methodical 4-0 victory 
last Sunday to take a commanding 2-0 lead, with Games 3 and 4 in 
Detroit. One Denver columnist wrote: ``This series is done. We all 
know. It's over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then came two unexpected victories at Detroit. Roy was  
brilliant, and the Avs finally got scoring from their third and 
fourth lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We looked passive out there,'' Detroit defenseman Nicklas  
Lidstrom said. ``I thought we let them skate through the neutral 
zone again. We weren't there to clear the rebounds, and they jumped 
on all the loose pucks in our end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we have to get back to the way we played in Denver --  
play real solid defensively and prevent them from getting the 
rebounds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight game, Detroit goalie Bill Ranford failed  
to make it through the second period, and now the Red Wings face a 
goalie controversy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ranford, starting his fourth straight game in place of injured  
Chris Osgood, who is out with a sprained right knee, let three of 
the first 14 shots he faced get past him. He was replaced by Norm 
Maracle at 14:04 of the second period with Detroit trailing 3-0. 
</P>
<P>
	If Osgood is close to being healthy, do the Wings switch to  
their regular goalie? Or do they stay with Ranford, or go with the 
rookie Maracle? 
</P>
<P>
	Detroit coach Scotty Bowman said his team was flat Thursday  
night and he replaced Ranford because ``I felt we needed some kind 
of boost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman said Osgood ``was close'' to playing Thursday night.  
``He's not 100 percent,'' Bowman said. ``I would hope in the next 
couple of days. It will depend on how he does in the workouts (in 
Denver).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Game 6 is set for next Tuesday in Detroit. A seventh game, if  
necessary, would be played in Denver next Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Hail Delays Discovery Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Space shuttle Discovery is headed  
back to the hangar instead of into orbit next week because of hail 
damage to its giant fuel tank. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery had been scheduled to blast off May 20 with 1 1/2 tons of  
cargo for the new international space station. NASA is now 
targeting liftoff for no earlier than May 27. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take the amount of time it takes to go fix the vehicle  
correctly,'' shuttle processing director Dave King said following 
Thursday's decision. ``We think that's a week to 10 days at this 
point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hail gouged about 150 holes into the foam insulation on  
Discovery's 15-story external fuel tank during a severe 
thunderstorm over the weekend. At least 35 of the nicks are in an 
area that cannot be reached from the launch pad. 
</P>
<P>
	The largest visible hole on the tank is 2 inches wide and  
one-third of an inch deep. Most are much smaller. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers are worried that ice could form in the holes when the  
tank is filled with super-cold fuel in the final hours of the 
countdown. If chunks of ice broke off at liftoff, the shuttle could 
be damaged. The cockpit windows are especially vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we could not rule out the possibility of  
ice in those areas,'' King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuttles have been rolled off the pad and back into the Vehicle  
Assembly Building only 12 times before. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Discovery was sent back because of fuel-tank damage  
caused by a pair of woodpeckers that drilled about 200 holes in the 
rust-colored foam insulation, apparently in an attempt to roost and 
build nests. 
</P>
<P>
	The technique that was used to fix the woodpecker damage will  
probably be used again this time, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery's 10-day ferry mission will be the year's first  
shuttle flight. The last was in December, when Endeavour carried up 
the first U.S.-built section of the space station. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the longest gap in shuttle launches since flights resumed  
in 1988 following the 1986 Challenger disaster.

<HEADLINE> Chase Manhattan Exec Eyed for Fed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is getting closer to choosing  
a banker active in lending to disadvantaged people and businesses 
as a new governor of the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration is currently tangling with Senate  
Banking Committee head Phil Gramm, R-Texas, over federal 
requirements for banks to do that kind of lending. Any White House 
nominee for the post would have to be approved by the banking panel 
before being confirmed by the full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Carol J. Parry, 58, is an executive vice president of Chase  
Manhattan Bank, the nation's third-largest. She is in charge of 
community development lending programs, making her responsible for 
loans for low- and moderate-income housing, commercial 
revitalization projects and businesses owned by women and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Banks are required to make such loans by the Community  
Reinvestment Act, which Gramm staunchly opposes and the 
administration heartily defends. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House considers Ms. Parry highly qualified for the Fed  
governor post and she is now the ``front-runner,'' an 
administration official said Friday. He spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Parry, who has more than 30 years of management experience  
in the financial industry and the public sector, was named by 
President Clinton in 1997 to the Fed's Consumer Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
	The spot on the powerful, seven-member governors' board of the  
central bank has been vacant since last June, when Republican 
appointee Susan Phillips resigned to head the business school at 
George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	The board is the governing body of the Fed, which determines  
interest-rate policy, regulates banks, oversees the nation's 
payments system and is the lender of last resort in financial 
crises. It currently has only one member -- Edward W. Kelley Jr. -- 
who was not named by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Parry, who previously had been criticized by some community  
groups for not doing enough, now appears to have their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things have changed. People have developed more confidence in  
her,'' said John Taylor, president and chief executive officer of 
the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, a liberal group. 
</P>
<P>
	He described Ms. Parry as someone ``with a good heart and good  
experience'' who ``knows what community reinvestment lending is all 
about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If confirmed, she would become the first Fed governor with  
``sustained experience'' with lending under the Community 
Reinvestment Act, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1977 law is fiercely opposed by Gramm and other conservative  
Republicans, who maintain it is an unfair government mandate 
telling banks to whom they should lend. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweeping legislation to lift the barriers separating banks,  
securities firms and insurance companies, which passed the Senate 
last week, contains provisions drafted by Gramm that the White 
House views as an attack on the lending law. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Clinton administration supports the financial  
services legislation in principle, it has threatened a presidential 
veto of the Senate bill unless the provisions are removed. 
</P>
<P>
	The provisions would exempt small rural banks from the  
community-lending law and make it harder for the government to use 
satisfactory community-lending ratings as a requirement for banks 
being allowed to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman for Gramm, said Friday he had no  
comment on Ms. Parry's possible nomination because it had not yet 
occurred. Edward Yingling, a lobbyist for the American Bankers 
Association, also declined comment. Chase Manhattan spokeswoman 
Charlotte Gilbert-Biro said Ms. Parry would not be available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to heading the Community Development Group at New  
York-based Chase Manhattan, Ms. Parry also is a member of the 
bank's Policy Council and is responsible for its corporate 
philanthropy. 
</P>
<P>
	She also has worked as a management consultant, headed her own  
consulting business, and directed child welfare services for New 
York City. She has a bachelor's degree from Tufts University and a 
master's in social work from the University of Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Where Did Yankee Magic Go? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The best team in baseball is just another club  
again. 
</P>
<P>
	In two weeks the New York Yankees have gone from a team that was  
virtually unbeatable last year to one that is downright 
bewildering. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season the Yankees rolled through their championship season  
without a pronounced slump. Now, just halfway through May, they've 
already hit notable lows. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees have been shut out at home one more time than they  
were last season. They've been swept in a three-game series for the 
first time since 1997. They have as many home losses as they had by 
July 19 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of things were almost magical last year,'' Bernie  
Williams said. ``It was almost like a dream season. That happens 
once every hundred years. I think it would be very unfortunate to 
hold us to that standard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It may by unfortunate, but after winning an AL-record 114 games  
and sweeping the San Diego Padres in the World Series expectations 
clearly were heightened. 
</P>
<P>
	They rose even further after the Yankees re-signed all of last  
year's key players and then traded for Roger Clemens, the five-time 
Cy Young Award winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The record-setting season, however, has provided further  
motivation for opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	A small-market team like the Kansas City Royals, trying to keep  
its players and stay near .500, can make its season with a good 
showing against the World Series champions. 
</P>
<P>
	A struggling team like the injury-riddled Anaheim Angels can use  
a sweep in New York to vault back into contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no team that ever comes in here that is flat,'' Angels  
manager Terry Collins said after sweeping the Yankees. ``You can't 
do it. They are the best team in the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But they sure haven't played that way, especially during their  
7-9 streak the last two weeks -- a slump they didn't hit until they 
led the AL East by 18 1/2 games last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Whether coincidental or not, the skid paralleled the mixup in  
Texas when interim manager Don Zimmer announced he was leaving the 
team only to find out Joe Torre wasn't ready to return from 
prostate cancer surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre's absence, which should last about two more weeks, has  
been one of many for New York, which has put Clemens, Andy 
Pettitte, Jeff Nelson, Scott Brosius on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees also have played the entire season without Darryl  
Strawberry, who is on ``administrative leave'' after being arrested 
on charges of cocaine possession and solicitation. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is going to feel sorry for the Yankees,'' Paul O'Neill  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, New York's most reliable hitter the five seasons, is in  
a 3-for-27 slump. O'Neill is one of many Yankees struggling -- Chuck 
Knoblauch is 1-for-25, Brosius is 2-for-20 and Tino Martinez is 
4-for-20 -- and his distress is evident. 
</P>
<P>
	``We scored a lot of runs in batting practice,'' O'Neill said.  
``The problem is we didn't in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's frustrating, no doubt. That's the only way to describe  
it. You feel like you are letting a lot of people down when you 
play like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Known for slamming batting helmets and throwing water coolers,  
which he did Tuesday, O'Neill has now drifted into a more 
analytical stage. 
</P>
<P>
	He can be seen shaking his head after grounding into a  
rally-killing double play or taking extra swings in the batting 
cage. Neither has provided the answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Paul O'Neill is going to hit, and hopefully soon,'' Zimmer  
said. ``Eventually, they are all going to start hitting. I'm not 
worried about this club's hitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Zimmer was worried enough to call his first team meeting as  
manager Thursday. First he broke up a players-only meeting on 
Wednesday and then he delivered his own message Thursday: Be on 
time, play hard and, most important, have fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``How many ball players on the 29 other teams would like to be  
two games in front in their division,'' Zimmer said. ``If you're 
not having fun playing for this team, there's something wrong. 
Baseball is a kid's game and you have to have fun playing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish I had the right thing to say, then they could snap out  
of it.''

<HEADLINE> Phillies' Brantley Ready To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Phillies closer Jeff Brantley might not miss  
the whole season after all. 
</P>
<P>
	After Dr. James Andrews prescribed rehab instead of  
season-ending surgery on his right shoulder, Brantley has felt 
``fabulous'' in bullpen workouts and could be activated from the 
disabled list as early as Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley did pregame warmups and throwing Friday and warmed up  
in the bullpen during a 7-3 loss to the New York Mets. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brantley did very well in his workout,'' Phillies manager  
Terry Francona said. ``He said he felt great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means Brantley could come off the DL by the end of the  
weekend. If the Phillies believe he needs to throw more on the 
side, he will do so again Sunday and be activated Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Brantley, 35, acquired from St. Louis in the offseason, went on  
the disabled list April 29 with a sore right shoulder. He was 
eligible to return Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Two doctors diagnosed a torn labrum and recommended surgery,  
which probably would have ended Brantley's season. As a last 
resort, Brantley went to Birmingham, Ala., to get checked out by 
Andrews, who performed his most recent shoulder surgery in 1997. 
Andrews prescribed a cortisone shot and rest, and Brantley got 
positive results. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could pitch in a game right now,'' Brantley said during the  
Phillies' recent 5-1 road trip. ``But we don't want to push it. I 
don't want to be waffling back and forth between the DL all 
season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither do the Phillies, who traded former closer Ricky  
Bottalico and Garrett Stephenson to the Cardinals for Brantley, Ron 
Gant and right-hander Cliff Politte. The Cardinals are paying $1 
million of Brantley's $2.8 million salary, but Philadelphia doesn't 
have a proven closer if Brantley can't pitch. 
</P>
<P>
	The Phillies tried to bolster the bullpen by trading Paul  
Spoljaric to Toronto for right-hander Robert Person last week. 
</P>
<P>
	When Brantley comes off the disabled list, the Phillies will  
have to decide whether to send Mike Grace or Joel Bennett to the 
minors. Bennett was called up from Triple-A last week and won his 
first major league start in Denver.

<HEADLINE> Fortier Seeks Less Time in Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Lawyers for Michael Fortier argued that his  
12-year sentence in the Oklahoma City bombing should be reduced, 
claiming he never knew that money he raised helped pay for the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael McGuire told the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on  
Thursday that Fortier was ``reckless'' for not warning authorities 
before the 1995 blast that killed 168 people and injured more than 
500 others. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortier, 30, pleaded guilty to failing to alert authorities to  
the plot. He testified against Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols 
and admitted helping McVeigh sell stolen weapons and lying to FBI 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	But McGuire said McVeigh and Nichols never told his client how  
they planned to use the money raised from selling weapons at gun 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no agreement or condition or anything,'' he told the  
three-judge panel, noting that the bombing happened months later. 
``It all happened too far after the fact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money provided by Fortier, McGuire argued, should not have  
been used as grounds for his 12-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors argued Fortier knew the money would be used to help  
pay the expenses of McVeigh and Nichols as they roamed the 
Southwest, stealing explosives and guns to carry out the deadliest 
terrorist attack on American soil. 
</P>
<P>
	They also argued Fortier's sentence already had been reduced  
from 14 years to 12 years for his ``substantial assistance'' at 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	A ruling is not expected for several months.  
</P>
<P>
	McVeigh was sentenced to death for the bombing, and Nichols  
received a life prison sentence.

<HEADLINE> Probe Won't Change Reading Scores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two states that posted large gains on a national  
reading test would have shown only average performance had they not 
excluded more special-education students, an analysis by the 
Education Department reveals. One state with modest gains could 
also have been boosted by the exclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland and Kentucky, which were lauded last month for the 1994  
to 1998 increases in reading scores of fourth-grade students, also 
excluded significant numbers of special education students in that 
time period. Minnesota could have claimed higher average scores 
because it excluded fewer special-ed students. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither scores nor rankings will be affected, but the federal  
study of the 1998 test results could lead test-givers to change 
some policies, Pascal D. Forgione Jr., chief of the Education 
Department's statistical branch, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been woken up on the issue that we must monitor this  
participation rate,'' he said. ``If it keeps going like it is, the 
increase could be statisically significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forgione's department released the study results today at a  
meeting of the board that oversees the test. 
</P>
<P>
	Because many states used the gains to tout success of reforms  
back home, the validity and integrity of the national voluntary 
test is under the glare of cricial scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know people care a lot about the confidence of these test  
scores,'' he said. ``We will try to develop set of materials to 
help people understand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the research pointed out differences in average scores,  
he said, no rankings will be officially changed because the report 
used a model to compare test scores of included students with the 
estimated performance of the types of students who were excluded. 
</P>
<P>
	The study also found:  
</P>
<P>
	-- 10 of the 36 testing states excluded higher percentages of  
special-needs students. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 5 of the 36 states excluded higher numbers of non-native  
English speaking students. 
</P>
<P>
	-- 1 state that posted a modest gain actually did better under  
the analysis formula. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 reading scores of fourth-grade students -- the only  
grade level available for state-by-state comparison -- increased in 
several states, including those that suffered political fallout 
over previous poor showings. 
</P>
<P>
	The states that showed the largest score gains and largest  
increases all would have had lower average scores had 
special-education students been included. Of those states -- 
Connecticut, Kentucky, Louisiana and South Carolina -- only Kentucky 
remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they don't change the scores, they have a problem,'' said  
Richard G. Innes, a Kentucky education activist who tracks state 
education trends. He believes that state's average score, based on 
the performance of special-needs children on state tests, should 
drop at least three points. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 18 of the 30-plus participating states left out more  
special education students from the 1998 testing sample than from 
the 1994 group. Of those states, 15 posted gains in the average 
score. Kentucky pulled out 10 percent of students selected for its 
1998 sample, compared with 4 percent in 1994. And Connecticut, the 
nation's highest-scoring state, removed 10 percent of the students 
selected to participate, compared with 6 percent in 1994. Louisiana 
pulled 13 percent in 1998, up from 6 percent in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationwide percentage of students excluded did not increase.  
</P>
<P>
	States with more exclusions maintain that they followed the  
rules and that their gains are valid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know that our regular education students gained 7 points on  
their (average) scores,'' said Catherine Heitman, a spokeswoman for 
the Louisiana education department. ``We do not believe pulling out 
special education students affected that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many special-needs students took the test, until 1998, when  
states had to follow a federal law that required that special-needs 
students get special help on any test comparing their results with 
others. The testing board responded by having states exclude those 
students from the national sample. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, called the National Assessment of Educational  
Progress, and its board was established by Congress. The test is 
given roughly every two years to a nationwide sample of children in 
three grade levels in core subjects like math and reading. The 
voluntary test is generally the only way to compare student 
progress nationwide, because states' tests vary.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 206 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today after the government's  
report of a steep rise in consumer prices set off renewed worries 
about inflation and sent bond prices sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 206.76 at 10,900.43. Broader stock indicators were lower as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow had climbed 106.82 to close at 11,107.19, a  
new record. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff in stocks was sparked by the Labor Department's  
announcement that consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in April, the 
largest monthly gain in nearly nine years. The report was 
especially jarring following Thursday's producer-price report, 
which suggested inflation was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CPI is usually not out of line with that number,'' Barry  
Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``This 
was a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report led to a drop of more than two points in the price of  
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, pushing yields to 5.92 
percent, the highest level in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is perfectly comfortable as long as bond  
yields are below 6 percent,'' said Hyman. ``But as the yield is 
nearing 6 percent, it won't be so comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of inflation revived concerns that the Federal Reserve  
will at least consider an interest rate hike when its Open Market 
Committee meets next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond news pushed stocks of banking and financial companies  
lower. Chase Manhattan fell 4 7/8 to 79 1/8 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Merrill Lynch fell 5 5/16 to 80 15/16. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which contributed to Thursday's new Dow record with a  
stunning 20-point gain, slipped 8 15/16 to 237 1/16, as investors 
locked in their gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 30.83 at 1,336.73, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was down 51.98 at 2,530.02. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 505.13 million 
shares, behind Thursday's pace.

<HEADLINE> UMass Campus Mourns Lacrosse Player </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- Family, teammates and friends grieved at a  
memorial service Thursday and laid a wreath at a field in memory of 
a Massachusetts lacrosse player killed by an accident in practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric Sopracasa, 21, of Farmingville, N.Y., collapsed when struck  
in the chest by a lacrosse ball May 5 on the Amherst campus. 
</P>
<P>
	A state medical examiner awaited more tests before deciding on a  
cause of death. But other doctors say Sopracasa apparently died of 
a known but rare type of injury. 
</P>
<P>
	They say the lacrosse ball hit his chest at precisely the wrong  
moment in the cycle of his heart beat. Such a blow can confuse the 
heart and disrupt its normal beat. 
</P>
<P>
	About 400 people, including Sopracasa's parents and coaches,  
filled a hall at the Newman Center on campus for the hour-long 
memorial service. Sopracasa was remembered as a spirited player and 
warmhearted person. 
</P>
<P>
	``Eric constantly challenged himself,'' said teammate Jay Negus.  
``Tenacity enabled him to be a giant on the field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sopracasa, a junior, was a clothing marketing major and a  
starting defensive midfielder for the lacrosse team. 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Cannella, coach of the lacrosse team, said, ``When you  
recruit young men to become part of your program, they become part 
of you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	University Chancellor David Scott, who read a poem, added, ``The  
death of a young person always is hard to understand. This is a sad 
loss for the entire UMass community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those at the service later marched to the team's home field,  
where they placed the wreath. Sopracasa was injured at a separate 
practice field. 
</P>
<P>
	Campus spokeswoman Kay Scanlan later said administrators are  
reviewing the circumstances of the death ``to see if our procedures 
could be improved.'' But she said the lacrosse program is expected 
to remain on a solid footing.

<HEADLINE> Va. Candidates Running on Spite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- It's a maxim used for many things,  
including politics: Don't get mad, get even. 
</P>
<P>
	State legislator Anne ``Panny'' Rhodes angered Gov. Jim Gilmore,  
a fellow Republican, by opposing some of his initiatives. So 
Gilmore has taken the extraordinary step of endorsing her opponent 
in the June 8 primary. 
</P>
<P>
	Another House of Delegates member, William Robinson Jr., had a  
falling-out with friend Luther Edmonds. Now Edmonds is running 
against Robinson in a Democratic primary while awaiting retrial on 
charges he pistol-whipped Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rhodes is among a small band of moderate Republicans who  
have bucked Gilmore and his predecessor, George Allen, both 
conservatives, on tax cuts and major social issues such as abortion 
and welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing his backing for Ruble Hord, Ms. Rhodes'  
challenger, Gilmore said Ms. Rhodes had effectively switched 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not just about Panny Rhodes,'' said University of  
Virginia political analyst Larry Sabato. ``It's about a handful of 
other moderates who go their own way. It's a warning with a capital 
`W' -- toe the line, or this could happen to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Sabato said it is rare for governors to meddle in  
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilmore can afford the risk more than most governors because  
Virginia is the only state that does not allow its chief executive 
to seek re-election. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds is charged with malicious wounding, use of a firearm in  
a felony and the unlawful wearing of a mask in a 1997 attack on 
Robinson. A mistrial was declared Thursday after the jury 
deadlocked. Prosecutors said they will retry the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men parted ways when Robinson publicly disputed the  
reason Edmonds gave for resigning from the bench during a 
misconduct inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Edmonds said his personal feelings have nothing to do with his  
second attempt to unseat Robinson (the first came just weeks before 
the attack). ``I feel I'm a better candidate for the position,'' 
Edmonds said. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson told The Virginian-Pilot: ``I don't think there is any  
question about the real motivation of his candidacy -- spite.''

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Plunge / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices plunged today, pushing interest  
rates to the highest level in more than a year, after a report 
revealing the biggest leap in consumer prices in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 2 1/4 points,  
or $22.50 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
	Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, shot higher  
from late Thursday's 5.75 percent, ending the day at 5.92 percent. 
The yield is used to calculate the interest charged on many loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff in bonds, which accompanied a steep decline in the  
stock market, was sparked by government data showing that consumer 
prices jumped an unexpectedly sharp 0.7 percent in April, led by a 
record spike in energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The report played on fears that the Federal Reserve might boost  
interest rates to slow the economy and contain inflationary 
pressures. Rapid inflation and rising interest rates make 
fixed-income investments such as bonds less appealing. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader market Friday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell between 5/16 and 17/32 point, while intermediate 
maturities fell between 29/32 and 1 21/32 point, reported Bridge 
Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose from late Thursday's  
4.58 percent to 4.63 percent, while the discount rose 0.05 
percentage point to 4.51 percent. Six-month yields rose to 4.76 
percent, while the discount rose 0.08 percentage point to 4.58 
percent. One-year yields rose to 4.85 percent as the discount rose 
0.12 percentage point to 4.62 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.88 percent from late Thursday's 4.81 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 1 3/16 points to 121 25/32. The average 
yield to maturity rose to 5.38 percent, up from late Thursday's 
5.32 percent.

	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A federal jury Friday ordered that a

dumped into a bayou. Prosecutors said they were killed for guns and

<HEADLINE> Woman Convicted of Abusing Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A former nursing home aide was convicted  
Friday of abusing Alzheimer's patients, including an 83-year-old 
woman she forced to eat feces. 
</P>
<P>
	Stacy Arruda, 26, of Derry, N.H., was found guilty by a judge of  
two counts of elder abuse and seven counts of patient abuse. The 
charges carry a total of up to 24 years in prison and $37,000 in 
fines. 
</P>
<P>
	``The patients' frail conditions and the unspeakable nature of  
the attacks make these the most disturbing incidents of elderly 
abuse ever encountered by my office,'' Attorney General Tom Reilly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses, mostly co-workers, testified Arruda assaulted five  
residents, all over 80, while working at the Wilmington Woods 
Nursing Home. 
</P>
<P>
	She kicked, beat and spit on patients. In one incident, she  
kicked and stomped on the crotch of an 81-year-old resident.

<HEADLINE>  Cleveland Indians Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- First baseman Jim Thome, surprised as anyone to  
hear that Cleveland owner Richard Jacobs is putting the Indians up 
for sale, figures one radical idea deserves another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can get about 10 players and get enough money to  
buy this team,'' Thome said Thursday night at Jacobs Field. ``We 
were talking about it coming out here, me and Mark Langston. We 
were saying, `Let's get some money and buy this thing.' It would be 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome was kidding, of course. But as Clevelanders found out  
early Thursday morning, Jacobs was not. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned the city, Jacobs put his Indians on the  
market Thursday, hoping to find someone willing to keep the team in 
town and its reputation intact as one of baseball's hottest 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put it this way: I want to have a say in passing the  
torch,'' the 73-year-old Jacobs said. ``I don't want an executor of 
mine to say, `Well, Jacobs, he has no hand from the grave, he can't 
do anything on this. Let's make up our decision, who should be the 
owner of this team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, the Indians' chairman, president, CEO and controlling  
stockholder since buying the team with his late brother, David, for 
$45 million in 1986, said he decided a few weeks ago it was the 
right time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shocking,'' said Indians fan Selwyn Powell of Cleveland.  
``I never, ever, ever thought this would happen. Not with the run 
they've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 1/2 years ago, Browns owner Art Modell moved Cleveland's  
beloved NFL franchise to Baltimore. Only now is the sports-crazed 
city recovering from that as it welcomes back the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his news conference at the ballpark that bears his  
name, Jacobs sought to reassure Indians fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry,'' he said. ``This team's not going anywhere. We  
have a lease for 15 more years. And anyway, who would want to move 
a team like this? We're in a ballpark that has sold out 308 
straight games. Moving is out of the realm of speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Mike Hargrove said he would explain the situation to the  
players before they flew to Detroit for tonight's game against the 
Tigers. He did not think the announcement would distract the team 
from its goal of trying to win its first World Series title since 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a job to do on the field,'' Hargrove said. ``We've  
got to keep our focus. And to do that you need a certain amount of 
tunnel vision, which I think we've been able to do. I don't see 
that lessening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team is in first place in the AL Central with the best  
record in baseball at 24-9 -- Cleveland's best start in its 99-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Several local candidates were among the bidders for the new  
Browns last year, and their names immediately came up as 
speculation began about who could buy the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	But even potential suitors were caught off guard by the Indians'  
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale ``is a real surprise,'' said local lawyer Larry Dolan,  
who with his brother, Charles, chairman of Cablevision Systems, 
unsuccessfully bid for the Browns. The Dolans also have tried to 
buy the Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I was certainly very interested to learn about his  
decision, it is premature to say whether or not I am a prospective 
buyer,'' Larry Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy manufacturer Thomas Murdough, who briefly allied with Jacobs  
in a Browns bid, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were eventually purchased for $530 million by  
billionaire suburban Cleveland banker Al Lerner. The Browns issued 
a statement saying they were certain Jacobs ``will make the right 
decision for the Cleveland community and the Indians fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York developer Howard Milstein, another would-be Browns and  
Redskins buyer, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the team's board of directors hired two investment  
firms, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and McDonald Investments Inc., to 
identify potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he wants any prospective owner to be ``somebody  
committed to baseball and committed to Cleveland'' and that any 
sale would not be finalized until after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He would prefer any potential owner or ownership group to be  
from the Cleveland area, and insisted that if the right offer 
didn't come along, he would take the Indians off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said his decision was not prompted by any health or  
financial problems. With the price for major sports teams 
skyrocketing -- the Redskins' price tag, pending NFL approval, is 
$800 million -- Jacobs understands that now might be the perfect 
time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Redskins can command $800 million, the Indians should  
bask in that also,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the Indians became the third pro sports team, along  
with the NHL's Florida Panthers and NBA's Boston Celtics, to offer 
stocks to the public. The club sold about four million shares at 
$15 per share, a move which raised about $60 million for Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he has turned a healthy profit from his initial  
investment in the team and that the Indians, whose net revenues in 
1998 were $144.6 million, are ``making money, very good money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's stock closed Wednesday at $9.94 but soared to $16.25  
by the end of Thursday on the strength of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who made his fortune in real estate, has kept a  
low-profile as owner, deferring to general manager John Hart. Like 
everyone else, Hart was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a personal standpoint, my reaction was one of surprise  
and a feeling of sadness,'' Hart said. ``But as Dick explained them 
to me, his reasons were good, and it made sense for him and the 
franchise.''

<HEADLINE> Dell, Micron Settle FTC Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two of the largest computer makers have agreed  
to provide consumers with ``clear, readable and understandable 
information in their lease advertising,'' the Federal Trade 
Commission says. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer Corp. and Micron Electronics Inc. settled  
government charges they misled consumers with Internet 
advertisements to lease new computers with low monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said Thursday that ads from Dell and Micron included  
important cost information in inconspicuous or unreadable fine 
print, or they omitted the information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers want to know what's what, and advertisers have an  
obligation to tell them,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the 
FTC's Bureau of Competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC settlement, approved 4-0 by the commission, becomes  
final after a 60-day public comment period. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Dell, Libba Letton, described the problems  
with the company's ads as ``relatively minor and isolated, and they 
were quickly and easily addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell is the nation's top direct-sale computer maker, with sales  
last year of $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron, the third-largest direct-sales manufacturer, did not  
return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Under lease offers, consumers pay little or no money up front  
for a new computer but pay a monthly fee of $150 or less, typically 
for two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the lease, consumers can return the machine and  
lease a new one with the latest technology, or they can buy the 
older computer for its market value, usually a set percentage of 
its original price. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the long term, leasing a computer is almost always more  
expensive than buying one -- even if the purchase is charged to a 
credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC charged that ads from Dell failed to adequately explain  
to consumers that low monthly payments applied to a lease and not 
to a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pricing information on Internet ads from Dell and Micron  
actually was located on linked Web pages, the FTC charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer had to scroll down or click on a link to get the  
full information that Dell provided, and the FTC didn't think that 
was adequate,'' Letton said.

<HEADLINE> Parties Vie for Kosovo Bill Kudos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House and Republican-controlled  
Congress both claim victory in a $15 billion package paying for the 
air war against Yugoslavia, disaster aid to Central America and 
other needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers are expected to approve the package next week, capping  
weeks of maneuvering between the two sides. On Friday, the day 
after Senate-House negotiators struck a deal on a compromise 
measure, earlier White House veto threats all but dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's been significant progress in meeting the goals the  
president outlined,'' said Linda Ricci, spokeswoman for the White 
House budget office. ``We expect the president will be presented 
with a bill he can sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans latched onto the bill's defense funds as a win for  
their side. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly $12 billion of the measure is for the U.S. role in the  
NATO campaign against Yugoslavia and other Pentagon programs, 
doubling the money President Clinton sought. Republicans were eager 
to use that to burnish their pro-defense reputation, arguing that 
the bill is a first step toward reinvigorating a military that 
Clinton has allowed to shrivel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite our differences over the administration's Balkan  
policy, this bill sends a strong message to our troops in the field 
that the Congress supports them,'' said House Appropriations 
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., one of the bill's chief 
authors. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were bragging about language forbidding the federal  
government from grabbing any of the $246 billion tobacco companies 
have agreed to pay states in a legal settlement. Clinton had been 
counting on using billions from that kitty for health and 
anti-smoking programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal conservatives scored two wins, though both were largely  
symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly $2 billion of the package's cost will be paid for with  
cuts in domestic programs. Clinton didn't want any cuts, preferring 
to use the federal surplus for the entire cost. 
</P>
<P>
	At the insistence of House and Senate GOP leaders, a provision  
offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., was dropped that would have 
provided $140 million to back a $1 billion loan program for 
struggling steel companies. Byrd's prowess for winning home-state 
projects, unparalleled in Congress, has made his proposals an 
enticing target for conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., also benefited when he  
successfully pressured two House GOP negotiators to switch their 
earlier positions and vote to block Byrd's project. After five 
months as speaker in which he has passively let GOP strategy 
evolve, his action was seen by many Republicans as a rare act of 
decisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton administration officials claimed victories for limiting  
GOP-sought defense increases and environmental restrictions and 
winning funds for U.S. farmers and victims of domestic and overseas 
natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials boasted that they blocked a loan-guarantee  
program for oil and gas companies, narrowed a bid to let mining 
companies expand toxic dump sites and blocked an effort to lift 
fishing restrictions in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmental groups complained that too many  
anti-environmental provisions survived. These included items 
offered by Western senators delaying new rules that would force 
mining companies to pay more for cleanups and boosting royalties 
owed by oil companies drilling on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really should veto this thing,'' said Marty Hayden,  
political director of the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House may have scored the most points on the debate  
over how to use the budget surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	With most of the package paid for out of the surplus, which for  
now comes entirely from Social Security, it will be harder for the 
GOP to find money for the tax cuts it wants. It will also be 
tougher for Republicans to assert they are protecting every penny 
of the pension program -- a claim they want to drum into voters' 
minds in time for next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans adopted the same tax-and-spend-policy Democrats  
used for many years,'' said Stanley Collender, a budget analyst for 
Fleishman-Hilliard Inc., a consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats may also benefit from something that did not happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Republican bargainers blocked an amendment by Sen. Tom Harkin  
D-Iowa, that would have added $5 billion in emergency farm aid. 
Though they lost the money, Democrats hope they can use the vote as 
an issue in the 2000 congressional races.

<HEADLINE> Bush Blamed for Anti-Hate Law Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Democratic legislators are blaming Gov.  
George W. Bush for the failure of a Texas hate crimes bill that 
would protect homosexuals, saying the Republican presidential 
prospect has shown no leadership on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is named for James Byrd Jr., the black man dragged to  
death behind a pickup truck in East Texas, and has the backing of 
President Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Bill 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
	It would toughen the state's hate crimes law by increasing the  
criminal penalties. It would also specifically include homosexuals 
for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked repeatedly about the bill, Bush has said only: ``I will  
look at the bill when it makes it to my desk, if it makes it to my 
desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Rodney Ellis, a Houston Democrat, has suggested that  
presidential politics is playing a role, with the sexual 
orientation provision a sticking point. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since our governor is a leading presidential hopeful, the eyes  
of the world are on Texas,'' Ellis said. ``Everything we do now 
takes on national implications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill sailed through the Democratic-controlled House but has  
languished for weeks in a committee of the Republican-controlled 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats failed twice Thursday night to force the bill to the  
full Senate for a vote. The deadline for Senate committees to 
consider bills was midnight Friday, and the Legislature adjourns 
May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	``I beg the governor, get involved in this issue as you do tax  
reform,'' Democratic Sen. John Whitmire said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants the world to believe that he is a `compassionate  
conservative.' We want the world to know that his compassion does 
not extend to all the citizens of Texas,'' said the Rev. Michael 
Piazza of Dallas' Cathedral of Hope, which claims the world's 
largest homosexual congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Dianne Hardy-Garcia, executive director of the Lesbian and Gay  
Rights Lobby of Texas, attacked Bush's neutrality. ``His 
unconscionable, immoral lack of leadership on this issue is both 
tragic and exasperating,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Loyalties of Russia Army Unknown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- If Boris Yeltsin is counting on the support of  
Russia's security forces in his latest showdown with parliament, he 
may be in for a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin has not suggested he would use force against lawmakers  
who are trying to impeach him -- as he did in a political 
confrontation in 1993 -- and analysts say he's unlikely to resort to 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet he may not even have that option, since it's unclear how  
loyal Russian troops and generals are to their increasingly 
unpopular, erratic president. But it's also unclear whether they 
would go to battle in support of Yeltsin's parliamentary foes. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia's military and police forces are a huge question mark  
amid the country's political turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no loyalty to anyone,'' defense analyst Pavel  
Felgengauer said Friday. Besides, he added, Russian troops are so 
broke, poorly prepared and splintered that they may not be able to 
come to anyone's aid. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia is technically government-less, since Yeltsin fired the  
prime minister and Cabinet on Wednesday. Perhaps foreseeing a 
potential need for military backing, Yeltsin chose a new candidate 
for premier with a long security background, Sergei Stepashin. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin had headed the Interior Ministry, which is in charge  
of Russia's police and internal security forces. But Russian media 
have said Stepashin does not enjoy unflagging support of the rank 
and file. 
</P>
<P>
	The lower house of Russia's parliament is holding an impeachment  
debate expected to come to a vote Saturday. Even if lawmakers 
approve the motion, it is unlikely to win passage by the country's 
two top courts and upper house. But it would step up the stakes in 
Yeltsin's long-running feud with his Communist enemies. 
</P>
<P>
	Rumors are rife that Yeltsin could try to call up troops if  
legislators continue to defy him, or if the opposition stages mass 
protests against his rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers say Yeltsin would probably turn first for support to  
his presidential guard, as well as the Interior Ministry's OMON 
internal security troops, who have come to his aid before. Special 
units from the Federal Security Service, the main intelligence 
agency and perhaps the elite paratrooper forces would also likely 
be called on. 
</P>
<P>
	But they may not all comply. Yeltsin angered the OMON last year  
by trimming their ranks for budgetary reasons, and analysts say the 
paratroopers have long resented the president for favoring other 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone will turn against him. His bodyguard won't even fight  
for him,'' Felgengauer said. ``They're not ready to spill blood for 
Yeltsin as (military leaders) were willing to do in 1993.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin dissolved a rebellious parliament in 1993, prompting  
lawmakers to hole themselves up in the parliamentary headquarters. 
Yeltsin forced them out by sending tanks and troops to bombard the 
building after opposition supporters rioted in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	Even then, Yeltsin had trouble persuading the military to back  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Few seem eager to repeat that showdown.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Russian armed forces cannot be dragged into internal  
political processes,'' acting Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev told 
reporters Friday while reviewing Moscow's 27th Motorized Rifle 
Brigade. He insisted the visit was not connected to Russia's 
political instability. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergeyev is a Yeltsin ally, but is reportedly unpopular among  
the army brass. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist parliament speaker Gennady Seleznyov told reporters  
Friday: ``The army will never again interfere in political 
affairs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many are hoping things won't come to blows.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think people studied the experience of 1993, and won't let  
it happen again,'' said Vladimir Kozar, observer with the military 
newspaper Red Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no specific evidence that the security forces won't  
support Yeltsin. But I don't think anyone wants to find out,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no increased military presence around Moscow and  
no signs of unrest. 
</P>
<P>
	One reason for Yeltsin's predicament is the dire condition of  
Russia's military. Pay is extremely low and usually delayed, and 
morale is dismal. It is made up largely of conscripts, many of whom 
are unfit or undernourished. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the impeachment counts against Yeltsin is that he  
destroyed the once-mighty Soviet military.

<HEADLINE> Toddler Rescued From Well in Kansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MULVANE, Kan. (AP) -- Twenty feet below ground, Tim Deneen  
feverishly clawed through the last few inches of dirt to reach 
17-month-old Jessy Kraus, who had slipped into a narrow well and 
become trapped. 
</P>
<P>
	The firefighter caressed the boy's tiny, mud-encrusted feet and  
told him: ``Hang in there, just a few more minutes.'' Jessy was too 
tired to weep after spending five hours 16 feet under the surface 
of his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dramatic rescue broadcast nationwide Thursday night, the  
little boy was pulled free with only minor injuries. There was a 
cheer from rescuers and neighbors as he was lifted free of the hole 
that the rescuers had dug alongside the well to safely reach him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessy was whisked away to HCA Wesley Medical Center in Wichita  
within a few moments and was in good condition early today. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Curt Pickert said at a news conference this morning that  
Jessy ate scrambled eggs for breakfast and looked like a healthy 
toddler. He said the child suffered only a little hypothermia and 
superficial abrasions and should be released from the hospital 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's parents, Karen and Jerry Kraus, thanked rescuers,  
supporters -- and God. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jessy gave me a smile last night,'' Mrs. Kraus said today at a  
hospital news conference. ``He's doing great today and he's going 
home.'' The couple, looking emotionally drained, held up photos of 
the boy for reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordeal -- reminiscent of that of a Texas toddler more than a  
decade ago -- began at 6:55 p.m. Thursday when the boy slipped into 
the well his parents were digging behind their home in Mulvane, 20 
miles south of Wichita. The dirt well, only 8 inches to 10 inches 
wide and 25 feet deep, was probably being dug to water the yard, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraus saw his son fall in, but couldn't reach him in time,  
Sedgwick County Fire Marshal Greg Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The distraught parents mostly stayed inside the house as rescue  
workers dug their hole seven feet from the well. Oxygen tubes were 
lowered into the well and warm air was pumped in to keep the boy 
from getting too cold. Lumber shored up the well's sides to prevent 
rocks and dirt from falling on the child. 
</P>
<P>
	As the crowd gathered, a video camera lowered into the well  
showed that Jessy's arm was pinned above his head, but he was 
moving and crying and appeared to be unhurt. The boy even tugged on 
a rope during the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Occasionally, Mrs. Kraus or the boy's grandmother would come  
talk to him from the top of the well. The mother was ``calming him 
... telling him that she loves him,'' Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under emergency flood lights, about 50 emergency workers dug the  
shaft and then tunneled over to the well, 2 feet below the boy. As 
they got closer, they could hear him whimpering. 
</P>
<P>
	``My stomach was churning the whole time, knowing what he must  
be going through,'' said Deneen. 
</P>
<P>
	Deneen meticulously pulled more dirt away from the toddler's  
legs, comforting him as he worked to let him know someone was with 
him. Finally, he cleared enough space behind Jessy's head to insert 
a backboard. 
</P>
<P>
	His rough hands snagged Jessy's hair and the toddler screamed.  
Deneen apologized. Jessy tightly clenched his little fists and 
curled up his feet when Deneen strapped him into the board and neck 
brace. 
</P>
<P>
	Above ground, firefighters watched the drama unfold on a monitor  
linked to the video camera. Deneen handed the boy, clad in a 
T-shirt and shorts, to waiting firefighters in the rescue shaft and 
away he went. 
</P>
<P>
	Deneen, who brought up the boy's sandals, told reporters: ``He's  
out. We did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Midland, Texas, in 1987, the case of 18-month-old Jessica  
McClure created a nationwide sensation. 
</P>
<P>
	She fell into an abandoned well and became trapped 22 feet down  
in a hole 8 inches wide. It took emergency crews 2 1/2 days to reach 
the little girl. They rescued her -- a dramatic moment covered on 
live television -- after digging a parallel shaft and then breaking 
through the wall of the well. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessica's parents, now divorced, have kept a low profile in the  
years since, saying they wanted the girl to have a normal 
childhood. They did give a magazine interview for the 10th 
anniversary, in which Jessica was described as a healthy, active 
11-year-old with no memory of the ordeal, who makes A's and B's at 
school, plays the piano and French horn and whizzes through her 
neighborhood on skates. 
</P>
<P>
	In Wichita this morning, Sedgwick County Fire Chief Gary Curmode  
said his first thought Thursday evening had been of the Midland 
case. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we were lucky in that we didn't have the kind of soil they  
had in Texas,'' Curmode said on NBC's ``Today'' Show. Where the 
Midland rescuers had to cut through rock, the yard in Mulvane 
consisted of the soft clay typical of southeast Kansas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, firefighters worried that heavy equipment could compact  
the ground, possibly endangering Jessy further, Curmode said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our strategy was to dig mainly by hand and use just hand  
tools,'' he said. The fiber-optic video camera, borrowed from a 
nearby company, was critical in helping rescuers assess Jessy's 
condition and placement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Midland Assistant Fire Chief Eddie Klatt said this morning said  
the Kansas situation was ``kind of deja vu'' for him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of strange to see something so close'' to what  
Jessica went through, he said, adding he was ``tickled to death'' 
to learn of Jessy's safe rescue . 
</P>
<P>
	He said he would tell the Kansas rescuers: ``Praise the Lord.  
Congratulations for a job well done.''

<HEADLINE> Pippen Wants To Level Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- For Scottie Pippen, the Houston Rockets' playoff  
series with the Los Angeles Lakers has had more highs and lows than 
a roller coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
	He came crashing down in the first two games, pointing fingers  
after the Game 1 loss and scoring just three points in Game 2 on 
0-of-7 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen finally was back on top in Game 3 with a career-best 37  
points, helping the Rockets to a 102-88 victory Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether he can keep riding that high and  
help even the best-of-5 series at two games apiece, or is another 
fall on the horizon? Game 4 is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever lost my groove,'' Pippen said Friday  
after practice. ``I was just more aggressive last night, and I plan 
on being more aggressive throughout this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our manhood was on the line last night,'' he added. ``Letting  
this young team come out and really dominate us the first couple of 
games, we had to come out last night and prove that we're a team 
that deserves to be in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first two games, Pippen was 5-for-20 from the field,  
including 0-for-6 from 3-point range. In Game 3, he was 12-for-27 
from the field, including 3-for-5 on 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers' Kobe Bryant noticed a change.  
</P>
<P>
	``He came out more aggressive and did a better job of getting  
involved in their offense,'' Bryant said. ``He started going inside 
early and built up his confidence, and then he stepped back and 
started hitting the outside shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant promised Pippen wouldn't get the same chance in Game 4.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to make our adjustments and counterattack on  
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal said Bryant would make things much tougher on  
Pippen next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kobe's coming back,'' he said. ``Scottie didn't have to play  
that much defense yesterday, but he's going to have to play defense 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1, Bryant was guarding Pippen in the final seconds when  
Pippen lost his footing and control of the ball. The Lakers 
regained possession and went on to win 101-100. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game Pippen shifted the blame, questioning teammate  
Charles Barkley for fouling Shaquille O'Neal in the final minutes. 
Pippen then turned out a miserable Game 2 performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, shrugging off the earlier criticism, praised Pippen for  
turning things around in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very proud of my team,'' said Barkley, who had 30 points  
and 23 rebounds. ``Obviously, Scottie played great, and Brent Price 
and Sam Mack did, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, O'Neal led the Lakers with 26 points and 10 rebounds,  
while Bryant and Glen Rice each had 13 points. At Friday's 
workouts, Rice complained that he should have gotten the ball more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can do is try and go to the coach and ask him  
to run more plays for me,'' he said. ``I'm not going to go out 
there and break up a play to try and get Glen Rice involved. I just 
want it to happen in the flow of the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said the Lakers would simply have to get back to basics  
if they hope to lock up the series on Saturday. If the Rockets tie 
it, Game 5 would be Monday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get back to what we were doing in Los Angeles,  
which is playing inside-outside and playing smart basketball,'' 
O'Neal said. ``If we play well, we should be OK.''

<HEADLINE> Cubs Crackingdown on Wrigley Rowdies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- The party at Wrigley Field just got a little  
tamer. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Cubs implemented tighter security measures today,  
including restrictions on beer sales and added security personnel, 
in an effort to keep the Wrigley Rowdies from getting too out of 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happens now is that some will think we have overreacted  
and some will think we're not severe enough,'' said Mark McGuire, 
the Cubs' executive vice president of business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The crackdown comes 10 days after the Cubs' game against the  
Colorado Rockies was delayed in the eighth inning because fans, 
upset over an umpire's call, pelted the field with baseballs, 
bottles, coins and cups of beer. Colorado center fielder Darryl 
Hamilton said one fan threw a Jack Daniels bottle onto the field. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventy-five people were ejected, but there were no arrests.  
</P>
<P>
	The biggest change is that fans will only be allowed to buy two  
beers at a time now, instead of four. Beer will no longer be 
available in 20-ounce cups; 16-ounce cups will be the largest size 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Beer sales by vendors who roam the seats -- they're not allowed  
to sell in the bleachers -- will be cut off after the seventh 
inning. If fans want beer after that, they'll have to go to the 
concession stands on the concourses. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs also will keep a closer eye on the bleachers. Wrigley,  
surrounded by blocks of bars and restaurants, has long been known 
for its Bleacher Bums, some of whom turn the games into nine-inning 
parties where beer flows freely. 
</P>
<P>
	Security personnel in the front row of the bleachers was  
doubled, and security cameras will be added. Fans seen throwing 
objects on to the field could now face being arrested in addition 
to being tossed out of the park. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some fans out there who do not think they are doing  
wrong,'' McGuire said. ``We're trying to say it's not cute and it 
will not be tolerated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But fans will still be allowed to throw home-run balls hit by  
opposing teams. It's a long-standing tradition for Cub fans to 
throw homers back onto the field.

<HEADLINE>  Cleveland Indians Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- First baseman Jim Thome, surprised as anyone to  
hear that Cleveland owner Richard Jacobs is putting the Indians up 
for sale, figures one radical idea deserves another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can get about 10 players and get enough money to  
buy this team,'' Thome said Thursday night at Jacobs Field. ``We 
were talking about it coming out here, me and Mark Langston. We 
were saying, `Let's get some money and buy this thing.' It would be 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome was kidding, of course. But as Clevelanders found out  
early Thursday morning, Jacobs was not. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned the city, Jacobs put his Indians on the  
market Thursday, hoping to find someone willing to keep the team in 
town and its reputation intact as one of baseball's hottest 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put it this way: I want to have a say in passing the  
torch,'' the 73-year-old Jacobs said. ``I don't want an executor of 
mine to say, `Well, Jacobs, he has no hand from the grave, he can't 
do anything on this. Let's make up our decision, who should be the 
owner of this team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, the Indians' chairman, president, CEO and controlling  
stockholder since buying the team with his late brother, David, for 
$45 million in 1986, said he decided a few weeks ago it was the 
right time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shocking,'' said Indians fan Selwyn Powell of Cleveland.  
``I never, ever, ever thought this would happen. Not with the run 
they've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 1/2 years ago, Browns owner Art Modell moved Cleveland's  
beloved NFL franchise to Baltimore. Only now is the sports-crazed 
city recovering from that as it welcomes back the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his news conference at the ballpark that bears his  
name, Jacobs sought to reassure Indians fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry,'' he said. ``This team's not going anywhere. We  
have a lease for 15 more years. And anyway, who would want to move 
a team like this? We're in a ballpark that has sold out 308 
straight games. Moving is out of the realm of speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Mike Hargrove said he would explain the situation to the  
players before they flew to Detroit for tonight's game against the 
Tigers. He did not think the announcement would distract the team 
from its goal of trying to win its first World Series title since 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a job to do on the field,'' Hargrove said. ``We've  
got to keep our focus. And to do that you need a certain amount of 
tunnel vision, which I think we've been able to do. I don't see 
that lessening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team is in first place in the AL Central with the best  
record in baseball at 24-9 -- Cleveland's best start in its 99-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Several local candidates were among the bidders for the new  
Browns last year, and their names immediately came up as 
speculation began about who could buy the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	But even potential suitors were caught off guard by the Indians'  
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale ``is a real surprise,'' said local lawyer Larry Dolan,  
who with his brother, Charles, chairman of Cablevision Systems, 
unsuccessfully bid for the Browns. The Dolans also have tried to 
buy the Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I was certainly very interested to learn about his  
decision, it is premature to say whether or not I am a prospective 
buyer,'' Larry Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy manufacturer Thomas Murdough, who briefly allied with Jacobs  
in a Browns bid, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were eventually purchased for $530 million by  
billionaire suburban Cleveland banker Al Lerner. The Browns issued 
a statement saying they were certain Jacobs ``will make the right 
decision for the Cleveland community and the Indians fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York developer Howard Milstein, another would-be Browns and  
Redskins buyer, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the team's board of directors hired two investment  
firms, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and McDonald Investments Inc., to 
identify potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he wants any prospective owner to be ``somebody  
committed to baseball and committed to Cleveland'' and that any 
sale would not be finalized until after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He would prefer any potential owner or ownership group to be  
from the Cleveland area, and insisted that if the right offer 
didn't come along, he would take the Indians off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said his decision was not prompted by any health or  
financial problems. With the price for major sports teams 
skyrocketing -- the Redskins' price tag, pending NFL approval, is 
$800 million -- Jacobs understands that now might be the perfect 
time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Redskins can command $800 million, the Indians should  
bask in that also,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the Indians became the third pro sports team, along  
with the NHL's Florida Panthers and NBA's Boston Celtics, to offer 
stocks to the public. The club sold about four million shares at 
$15 per share, a move which raised about $60 million for Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he has turned a healthy profit from his initial  
investment in the team and that the Indians, whose net revenues in 
1998 were $144.6 million, are ``making money, very good money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's stock closed Wednesday at $9.94 but soared to $16.25  
by the end of Thursday on the strength of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who made his fortune in real estate, has kept a  
low-profile as owner, deferring to general manager John Hart. Like 
everyone else, Hart was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a personal standpoint, my reaction was one of surprise  
and a feeling of sadness,'' Hart said. ``But as Dick explained them 
to me, his reasons were good, and it made sense for him and the 
franchise.''

<HEADLINE> Group Sues CIA Over Data Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A private group alleged Thursday the CIA has  
broken long-standing promises to release histories of the 1953 coup 
in Iran, intervention by the agency in the 1948 Italian elections 
and nine former communist leaders of Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	Suing the CIA in federal court, the nonprofit National Security  
Archive accused the agency of ``withholding the histories of the 
Iranian coup in large part because they include references to 
activities by British intelligence cooperation with the CIA.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, after the Iranian government nationalized the  
British-owned oil industry, Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadeq was 
ousted in a clandestine CIA-backed coup to re-install the shah as a 
pro-American bulwark against communist expansion in the Middle 
East. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit says that the agency is putting off indefinitely a  
declassification project that includes materials on ``CIA 
intervention in the 1948 elections in Italy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit also stated that the CIA has refused to even  
acknowledge the existence of biographies of nine former East 
European leaders, seven of them now dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency's position runs counter to nearly a decade of pledges  
to declassify large portions of CIA historical archives, the 
private group said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Colleen  
Kollar-Kotelly, a Clinton appointee. 
</P>
<P>
	``No other nation's foreign intelligence agency has voluntarily  
released as much information about its past as has the CIA,'' said 
agency spokesman Mark Mansfield. 
</P>
<P>
	Mansfield said that ``we will build upon that record in the  
years ahead, within the limits imposed upon the director of central 
intelligence by law not to jeopardize intelligence sources and 
methods, impinge on our liaison relationship with other countries 
or interfere with our ability to carry out the agency's mission.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mansfield said the agency has released about 1,800 pages on  
covert action in Guatamala and more than 3,000 pages on the Bay of 
Pigs invasion of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the agency in the past five years has declassified over  
500 national intelligence estimates, more than 11,000 pages of 
finished intelligence on the foreign Soviet Union and 227,000 pages 
of records on the assassination of President Kennedy.

<HEADLINE> House Ethics Panel Warns Rep. DeLay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House ethics committee has told Majority  
Whip Tom DeLay not to let party politics and campaign contributions 
dictate official actions, a warning the committee then sent to all 
House members. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're happy the committee has disposed of this matter,'' said  
DeLay's deputy chief of staff, Tony Rudy, who confirmed Friday the 
Texas Republican received a private letter that neither DeLay nor 
the committee would make public. 
</P>
<P>
	In the May 11 memo to all members, the ethics panel -- formally,  
the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct -- wrote that 
government officials ``are prohibited from taking or withholding 
any official action on the basis of the partisan affiliation or the 
campaign contributions or support of the involved individuals.'' 
The same applies to threatened punitive actions, the memo said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting of House leaders last fall, DeLay and others  
expressed extreme anger at the decision of the Electronic 
Industries Alliance to hire former Rep. Dave McCurdy, D-Okla., as 
its president. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans wanted the position to go to Bill Paxon, who  
retired last year as a GOP lawmaker from New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Rosenker, spokesman for the electronics industry  
organization, said DeLay ``shared his views'' with the 
organization, which later hired a Republican staffer as its chief 
lobbyist. But Rosenker added, ``I don't believe we've been frozen 
out of anything. No one ever called this organization and made a 
threat to us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Further, he said, McCurdy has written checks to lawmakers and  
candidates from both parties, based on their support for the 
electronics industry. 
</P>
<P>
	A Republican official who attended some of the GOP leadership  
sessions but would not be quoted by name said a lot of anger was 
vented against the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the ethics committee was responding to news reports that  
leaked out after the session, which described comments that 
Republicans leaders would refuse to meet with alliance officials. 
</P>
<P>
	There was a brief delay last fall on an intellectual property  
bill that the alliance supported, and some Republicans were quoted 
at the time as linking the postponement to the decision to hire 
McCurdy. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear why the ethics committee did not send letters to  
other GOP leaders who attended the leadership session, including 
Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas and the former head of the 
House Republican campaign committee, John Linder of Georgia. Former 
Speaker Newt Gingrich is no longer in the committee's jurisdiction 
since he left the House. 
</P>
<P>
	DeLay is known for hardball political fund-raising tactics and  
carries the nickname ``The Hammer.''

<HEADLINE>  Worldy Manner Is Preakness Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A tuneup in the Kentucky Derby might be just  
what Worldly Manner needed to get ready for Saturday's $1 million 
Preakness Stakes at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant trainer Tom Albertrani said the Dubai-based colt has  
thrived at Churchill Downs since his seventh-place finish in the 
Derby on May 1 -- Worldly Manner's first race as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the Derby in great shape, and we're  
confident,'' Albertrani said Thursday. ``The Derby tuned him up a 
little. He's put on weight and he's more focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race served as a prep of sorts for Worldly Manner, who spent  
seven months training in the Dubai desert and had only one private 
trial race before shipping to Louisville less than two weeks before 
the Run for the Roses. 
</P>
<P>
	But his strong effort in the 1 1/4-mile Derby -- he was contending  
for the lead with Cat Thief entering the stretch -- was received 
well by owners Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum and Sheikh Maktoum al 
Maktoum. Charismatic, a 31-1 shot, won the Derby by a neck over 
Menifee in a 19-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worldly Manner ran a very credible race, and we were pleased  
with it,'' Albertrani said. ``We were excited at the quarter pole, 
but the last 100 yards he got a little weary. You can say he will 
improve off that race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Preakness distance is 1 3-16 miles, 1-16th of a mile shorter  
than the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner, who will be ridden again by Jerry Bailey, leaves  
from the No. 10 post and was 12-1 in the morning line. In his final 
workout Tuesday, he went 5 furlongs in 1:01 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner was trained by Bob Baffert as a 2-year-old, but  
John Mabee sold the colt for a reported $5 million. Before the 
Derby, Worldly Manner's last race was a victory in the Del Mar 
Futurity in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Saeed bin Suroor might consider changing his training  
methods and send the sheikh's horses to run in traditional Derby 
preps, Albertrani said: ``Maybe in the future we'll try a different 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he needed a race mentally more than physically,'' he  
added. ``Jerry asked him to come out running and he didn't realize 
he was going to take the bit and keep it.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor Testifies in Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Weeks before Reggie Lewis collapsed and died while  
practicing jump shots, his doctor told reporters the Boston Celtics 
star had a minor fainting condition that should not impede his 
basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic that under medical supervision Mr. Reggie  
Lewis will be able to return to professional basketball without 
limitation,'' Gilbert Mudge said at a May 10, 1993, news conference 
marking Lewis' release from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A video of that news conference was played Thursday for jurors  
at Mudge's malpractice trial as Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, 
wept. Harris-Lewis is suing the renowned cardiologist, who treated 
the All-Star in the months before he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was 27 when he died of cardiac arrhythmia while practicing  
at Brandeis University 11 weeks after Mudge's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking publicly for the first time since Lewis died, Mudge on  
Thursday testified his assessment that Lewis had neurocardiogenic 
syncope, a condition that causes fainting spells and is not related 
to the heart, was never a ``definitive diagnosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge also said there were ``ongoing concerns'' Lewis might have  
a potentially fatal cardiac ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet at the news conference -- and, according to Harris-Lewis, in  
private -- Mudge did not say he was concerned about a heart 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``After extensive testing, evaluation and review of all data, I  
believe that Mr. Lewis has a normal athlete's heart with normal 
functions,'' Mudge said then. ``Our testing showed no evidence of 
cardiomyopathy or abnormal life-threatening arrhythmias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Harris-Lewis' attorney, Robert Harley, asked Mudge if he  
lied at the news conference, the doctor replied, ``What I did say 
was very limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harley suggested that Mudge, suddenly in charge of care for  
``the most famous patient in Boston,'' was under pressure to tell 
Lewis, his wife, the Celtics and the public what they wanted to 
hear: that Lewis' condition was not as serious as first believed, 
and that he would play in the National Basketball Association 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of 12 doctors at New England Baptist Hospital initially  
diagnosed Lewis with cardiac arrhythmia after he collapsed during a 
playoff game in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises turned to Mudge at Brigham and Women's Hospital for  
a second opinion, and he initially agreed. But after further tests, 
Mudge revised the diagnosis and told Lewis he had neurocardiogenic 
syncope. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis sued Mudge and consultants Mark Creager and Peter  
Friedman, claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband's 
heart condition. A third consultant later settled for an 
undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge was expected to continue testifying today.

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Fundraises Down West Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Stepping off on a $3 million fund-raising sweep  
down the West Coast, President Clinton told Democratic contributors 
Friday that his 6 1/2 years in the White House have been ``a labor of 
love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if party patrons, who were paying as much as $25,000 for a  
weekend meal with Clinton, like the soaring stock market, they need 
to be concerned about who follows him in the White House, the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I won't be on the ballot in 2000. This is the first  
time in a long time I haven't been on a ballot,'' Clinton told 
Democrats with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it is terribly important to me that everyone in America  
understand that this (economy), on the one hand, didn't happen by 
accident -- but on the other hand, is not dependent upon any person 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What matters, he said, is that Democrats win.  
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said Democrats  
were counting on the economy to carry them to victory in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Republicans quadrupled the national debt, our president  
quadrupled the Dow Jones,'' Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the work that those of us in our administration have done  
in the last six years has been a labor of love,'' Clinton said. ``I 
literally get up and try to live with the spirit of gratitude every 
day for the good things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke at a $200,000 Seattle luncheon before heading to a  
$500,000 dinner in the San Francisco Bay area. The president's 
four-day take for Democrats -- with events also in Beverly Hills, 
San Diego and Las Vegas -- was expected to top $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was sweeping up at least $2 million in Beverly Hills, at  
an event hosted by some of movie-making's biggest names: Steven 
Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	His fund-raising trip drew criticism from Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott of Mississippi, who referred to the gun control debate 
unfolding in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend, the Clinton-Gore regime will be begging for cash  
from one of the polluters responsible for our nation's moral 
decline,'' he said. ``What's the message to our children? Democrats 
care about your safety, unless it's inconvenient to their partners 
in Hollywood?'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 175 people gathered on two corners near the Seattle  
luncheon site to protest the Clinton administration's handling of 
allegations that China stole nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters held signs labeling the president ``Made in  
China,'' and asking, ``Didn't China pay you enough?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up the street, another 75 people carried signs protesting the  
NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia, ``Stop bombing Yugoslavia,'' one 
sign said, and ``NATO bombs can't bring peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Rainier Club, Clinton passionately defended the NATO  
campaign against Yugoslavia's ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and 
apologized once more for the alliance's accidental bombing of the 
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	After being frozen out for days by President Jiang Zemin,  
Clinton spoke with the Chinese leader by telephone before leaving 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a terrible mistake in bombing the Chinese embassy and  
I regret it more than I can say. I talked to the president of China 
today and told him,'' Clinton reported. 
</P>
<P>
	He interspersed his frenetic fund raising with plenty of rest  
and relaxation, planning to spend Saturday relaxing with his 
daughter, Chelsea, near the Palo Alto, Calif., campus of Stanford 
University, where she is a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was reserved for the golf courses of Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Takes Stakes Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Silverbulletday showed why she might have won  
the Preakness by overpowering the field in Friday's Black-Eyed 
Susan and smashing the stakes record. 
</P>
<P>
	The best filly in the land was set to run in Saturday's $1  
million Preakness and challenge the boys for the first time. But 
the 3-year-old star drew the outside No. 14 post position, and 
trainer Bob Baffert and owner Mike Pegram decided to scratch her 
from the second leg of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, the overwhelming 1-9 favorite, took care of six  
challengers in a hurry in the $200,000 Black-Eyed Susan, winning by 
a comfortable two lengths over Dreams Gallore. Vee Vee Star was 
third, 16 1/2 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little like a consolation prize,'' Baffert said. ``I  
know the Black-Eyed Susan is a great race, but we had her ready for 
the Preakness. But I always put her before me and I always will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Gary Stevens aboard, Silverbulletday won her eighth  
straight race and 11th in 12 career starts. She covered 1 1/8 miles in 
1:47 4-5, 2-5 of a second better than the stakes record set by 
Imaginary Lady in 1989. The winning time was 3-5 of a second off 
the track record set by Private Terms in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving from the No. 1 post, Silverbulletday took the lead  
around the first turn, and was briefly challenged along the 
backstretch by The Happy Hopper. The daughter of Silver Deputy then 
took charge, moving to a six-length lead with just under 5-16ths of 
a mile left. And even though Dreams Gallore began gaining ground, 
the finish was never in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Baffert and Pegram will always have to answer the question:  
Should Silverbulletday have run in the Preaknees? 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary let her out of the gate and she just went with it,''  
Baffert said. ``From the 14 hole, she would have to sustain that 
run all the way. I don't know if even she could do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was worth $180,000 to Pegram and boosted  
Silverbulletday's earnings to $2,271,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday returned $2.20, $2.10 and $2.10. Dreams Gallore,  
who was second to Silverbulletday in the Kentucky Oaks two weeks 
ago, paid $2.10 and $2.10. Vee Vee Star returned $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison's Charm was fourth, followed by Mysterious Jak, The  
Happy Hopper and Magic Broad, more than 36 lengths behind 
Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert figured the poor post position for the Preakness was an  
omen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody's trying to tell us not to run,'' Baffert said.  
``She's a great filly. The Preakness is a great race. But these 
fillies come around rarely. I have to be really careful what I 
do.''

<HEADLINE> Global Crossing May Buy U S West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Baby Bell phone company U S West Inc. is in  
talks to be acquired by Global Crossing Ltd., a telecommunications 
upstart run by a former AT&AMP;T executive, a person familiar with the 
situation said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, a Denver-based provider of phone service in 14 western  
and midwestern states, declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, which is building a worldwide fiber optic  
network and recently agreed to buy a phone company named Frontier 
Corp., did not return calls seeking comment. Earlier this year, the 
Bermuda-based company lured Robert Annunziata away from AT&AMP;T to be 
its chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	The $11.2 billion Frontier deal may present a regulatory  
obstacle to a merger between Global Crossing and U S West. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to providing local service in 32 states, Frontier is  
one of the nation's 10 biggest long-distance companies. As a 
provider of local phone service, U S West is forbidden from owning 
more than 10 percent of a long-distance company. 
</P>
<P>
	With the addition of Frontier, Global's fiber network would  
connect 159 cities in the United States, Japan, Europe and Latin 
America. The Bermuda-based company is also planning undersea 
networks to link up four continents. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West is the nation's biggest provider of high-speed Internet  
access over digital subscriber lines, or DSL, a fledgling service 
that works over regular telephone wires. 
</P>
<P>
	DSL is considered the most worthy rival to the cable television  
wires that AT&AMP;T is using to build a multimedia network for TV, 
phone and Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire MediaOne Group, the nation's  
fourth largest cable company and formerly a sister company of U S 
West. That deal included an alliance with Comcast, the No. 3 cable 
company. Along with AT&AMP;T's pending alliance with Time Warner and 
its recent purchase of Tele-Communications Inc., AT&AMP;T will have 
access to the four largest cable systems in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, U S West  
shares were up 50 cents at $60.50 while Global Crossing's 
Nasdaq-listed shares were down 37 1/2 cents at $59.62 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Skies Packed With Cargo Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- As the country sleeps each night, the  
skies over Memphis glow with the lights of Federal Express jets, a 
string of mechanical fireflies headed to and from the delivery 
company's national distribution center. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes touch down one after another on three runways. Crews  
wearing knee pads and back braces rush to unload them, and within 
20 minutes roughly 1.3 million documents and boxes are sent into a 
maze of human and computerized sorters. Three hours later, the jets 
roar back into the air, their cargo rerouted to its final 
destination. 
</P>
<P>
	The rush of activity is a far cry from the company's first night  
in 1973, when a fleet of 25 planes handled 186 packages. It's also 
just a hint of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
	The use of air delivery services -- particularly overseas -- is  
expected to boom in the coming years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Smith, founder of Federal Express, the world's No. 1 air  
delivery business, says the industry is ``just reaching its growth 
stride.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ripples from such growth will be felt not only through the  
rest of the economy, but also the aviation industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Skies that are already crowded in the daytime are becoming more  
so at night, when cargo jets make their mad dash to hubs like 
Memphis or Louisville, Ky., where the air operation for United 
Parcel Service is based. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots are pushing the government to require the installation of  
collision avoidance equipment in cargo planes, just as it did for 
commercial airliners. 
</P>
<P>
	The traffic is also creating a heavy demand for flight crews.  
Young pilots once destined to spend years skipping from community 
to community in puddle jumpers are now being plucked to fly jets 
full of packages around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	That's creating a supply problem for the passenger airlines,  
whose heavy recruiting has already taken a toll on the military's 
supply of pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. express delivery business -- as the time-guaranteed  
delivery of packages and documents is known -- is roughly a $23 
billion industry. FedEx -- the official name today for Federal 
Express -- expects the business to more than quadruple to $100 
billion within 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx and other players such as United Parcel Service, Airborne  
Express and DHL expect even larger growth overseas, with the total 
marketplace perhaps reaching $250 billion by 2020. 
</P>
<P>
	What's fueling the growth is a change in how companies conduct  
their business. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it is increasingly easy to ship goods rapidly, and since  
companies now guarantee delivery times, businesses are less likely 
to keep expensive inventories on site. They are more interested in 
ordering products just in time for delivery to their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The parts for the average Dell computer, for example, spend  
little more than eight hours at the company's Texas manufacturing 
plant before they are assembled and shipped off to the buyer. 
</P>
<P>
	The transformation has turned airplanes and trucks into mobile  
warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
	``What's happened is that in the '70s and '80s, everyone  
considered air to be the premium spread of the world, sort of the 
butter. That is true, but what wasn't taken into account -- and what 
is being considered now -- is the savings that can create,'' said 
Steve Alterman, spokesman for the Cargo Airline Association, a 
trade group. 
</P>
<P>
	With the growth has come challenges.  
</P>
<P>
	Crowded skies, for example, have prompted UPS to develop a new  
collision avoidance system called ADS-B. It allows pilots to see 
traffic up to 100 miles away, as well as vehicles on the ground. 
UPS is now seeking government approval to install the devices in 
its fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	FedEx, UPS and their competitors also expect they will have to  
recruit more heavily as the competition for pilots heightens. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tom Weidemeyer, president of UPS Airlines, said the move  
toward globalization and the increasing use of electronic commerce 
such as Internet shopping spells a bright future for the air 
delivery industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The quick, easy movement of products ``will mean a limitless  
ability for anybody anywhere to be a global company,'' Weidemeyer 
said. ``Amazon.com has already proven that.''

<HEADLINE> Saints Sign Heisman Winner Williams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Heisman Trophy winner Ricky Williams has  
either the best contract ever or one of the worst, depending on how 
his NFL career plays out. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, the New Orleans Saints' only draft pick, today signed  
a seven-year deal with an optional eighth year. The contract 
includes an $8.84 million signing bonus and will be worth between 
$11.1 million and $68.4 million, contingent upon performance. 
</P>
<P>
	If he performs in the NFL like he performed in college, his  
contract would be the most lucrative ever given a rookie. If he 
fails to reach goals set in incentive clauses, he will earn the 
league minimum for the next seven years: $175,000 in year one, 
increasing annually to reach $400,000 in year seven. 
</P>
<P>
	``I decided to go with the big bonus on the front end and the  
rest I have to work for,'' Williams said. ``With this contract I'm 
going to be making great money if I'm playing well enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Saints swapped their six 1999 picks and selections in the  
first and third rounds next year to move up to No. 5 in the NFL 
draft last month so they could pick Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Coach Mike Ditka labeled Williams the final piece of the puzzle,  
saying a first-class ball carrier was all he needed to make the 
Saints a winner. 
</P>
<P>
	New Orleans has not had a winning season in six years, going  
6-10 each of Ditka's first two years. The Saints' offense was 28th 
in the league last season, the running game was last. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a decade since New Orleans has had a 1,000-yard  
rusher. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our plan is to make Ricky an important component of our  
offense,'' Ditka said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams finished his career at Texas as the NCAA's career  
rushing leader with 6,279 yards. He set 20 NCAA rushing records, 
including most rushing yards, all-purpose yards, highest average 
per carry, rushing touchdowns, total touchdowns and points scored. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is heavily loaded with incentives.  
</P>
<P>
	There are 26 targets that could earn him $50,000 for each one  
reached, up to a cap of $500,000. Those incentives include rushing 
for an average of 4.5 yards per carry or better, 12 or more rushing 
touchdowns, 12 or more receiving touchdowns, scoring 76 points, 
gaining 1,601 yards in total offense and playing in 35 percent of 
the offensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, there are two escalator clauses that could kick in.  
</P>
<P>
	The first escalator would boost Williams' salary each year in  
years 2-4 -- $1 million if he rushes for 1,600 yards, $1.5 million 
for 1,800 yards, $2 million for 2,000 yards, $2.1 million for 2,100 
yards. If he breaks the league single season rushing record of 
2,105 yards by Eric Dickerson, he would get a $3 million bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	The second escalator is based on Terrell Davis' contract, the  
richest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first four years, Davis rushed for 6,413 yards, had 7,594  
yards in rushing and receiving, averaged 4.8 yards per carry and 
scored 61 touchdowns. If Williams hits three of those four marks, 
his contract will automatically duplicate Davis'. 
</P>
<P>
	If that escalator kicks in, Williams' contract would be worth a  
total of $68.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also has a $100,000 bonus for taking part in the  
Saints' offseason program and $100,000 for not weighing over 240 
pounds at each of four weigh-ins. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams is the second No. 1 pick to sign a contract. Tim Couch  
signed with Cleveland on draft day. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there had been speculation that Williams' agent, Leland  
Hardy of No Limit Sports, would be hard to deal with or slow to 
reach an agreement, Saints salary cap consultant Terry O'Neil said 
negotiations, many of which were done on the golf course, were 
exceptionally smooth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there were a lot of misunderstandings about No Limit  
and what we'd do,'' Hardy said. ``I hope this will quiet that.''

	Jackson police spokesman Robert Graham said the accident took  
place at 10:25 p.m. Thursday ``when for some undetermined reason 
the driver lost control of the vehicle, causing it to flip several 
times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said accident investigators were looking into the reasons for  
the fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``An accident of this nature is devastating,'' said SIU head  
football coach Jan Quarless. ``We all -- coaches and players alike -- 
believe we are family which means we've lost a close member of our 
family. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charlie was a special person. He had never had many breaks in  
life, but had just recently been accepted into SIU's architectural 
technology school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Teague won a letter last season, had done well  
in spring drills and was expected to see a lot of action next 
season, according to Fred Huff, the sports information director at 
Southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Broussard was a defensive end last season but was being moved to  
an interior line position on defense.

<HEADLINE> Baker To Try To Get Into NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Former Auburn receiver Robert Baker, who was  
paroled in March after serving 10 months of a 15-year sentence for 
drug trafficking, will make a bid to get into the NFL through the 
supplemental draft. 
</P>
<P>
	``He weighed his options and he felt this was the best thing for  
him to do, to go to the NFL,'' agent Rick Davis told the Mobile 
Register. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, who is also former Auburn coach Terry Bowden's lawyer,  
told the newspaper he had been retained by Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker briefly considered regaining his eligibility to play for  
Auburn this fall as a fifth-year senior, but he dropped out of 
school this week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he would enhance his position in the draft if he  
went back to school,'' said Davis. ``We didn't recruit him. This 
was his decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, 23, of Gainesville, Fla., hasn't played football in three  
years. He led Auburn with 1,174 all-purpose yards in 1996, 
including 526 yards receiving. He was sentenced in May 1998 after 
pleading guilty to trafficking cocaine, but the mandatory 
three-year sentence for trafficking was waived. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he has talked to a number of NFL personnel about  
Baker, but admitted many appear skeptical. ``He's a question 
mark,'' Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
	The supplemental draft will be held in June or July.  
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Lemmerman, director of college scouting for the New  
Orleans Saints, said Baker's reputation may hamper his efforts to 
gain recognition. 
</P>
<P>
	``For our football team, we wouldn't mess with him,'' Lemmerman  
said. ``Does he get an opportunity? It will be hard. How do you 
sell it to your fans? They're going to look at this guy's past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker did not return phone calls to the Register seeking  
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after he was paroled, Baker contacted Auburn coach Tommy  
Tuberville about rejoining the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuberville, who never ruled out Baker's returning, said he told  
him to get back in school. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to make sure he had an opportunity to get back  
into mainstream life,'' Tuberville said. ``Somebody needed to throw 
out a hand and help him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said he signed Baker on Bowden's recommendation and only  
after a number of conversations with him.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Down Sharply; Coffee Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Wheat futures fell sharply Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade  
as forecasts for an end to heavy rains in winter wheat growing 
regions ignited fears the crop could undergo a later growth surge. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, coffee futures rose sharply, while cocoa  
futures sank. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat erased initial gains amid renewed pessimism about whether  
world demand will be strong enough to cut into ample supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Improved growing weather in winter wheat regions this weekend  
may prove beneficial to the crop and could boost yields. Wheat 
futures had found some strength this week amid concern that heavy 
recent rains will continue and leave the crops vulnerable to 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneficial rains also were expected over the weekend in Chinese  
growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures this week also found a measure of support from  
government projections that the crop will be 14 percent smaller 
than last year's, but the U.S. Agriculture Department also 
predicted inventories will swell to their highest since 1987 as 
farmers continues to suffer from cheaper competing crops and weak 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also were pressured Friday by talk the active July  
contract could fall to $2.10 a bushel before it expires. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 10 cents to $2.60 1/2 a bushel.  
</P>
<P>
	Coffee futures rose sharply on Board of Trade of the City of New  
York amid forecasts for the second cold snap of the year in Brazil, 
the world's largest producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Coffee prices during the Brazilian winter weather months are  
extremely sensitive to the idea of a damaging frost that could 
reduce the harvest. The most recent damaging frost occurred in 
1994, boosting prices 230 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil produced mainly robusta beans not favored by gourmet  
coffee drinkers, but its large crop often is mixed with arabica 
beans that are. 
</P>
<P>
	July arabica coffee rose 3.75 cents to $1.074 a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Cocoa futures sank the New York Board of Trade as sales of  
recently harvested crops picked up, adding to already plentiful 
world supplies. Bumper crops from Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia 
have left chocolate makers content to sit on the sidelines as 
arrivals continue to pour in to key ports and they await lower 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, ample rainfall in West African growing regions were  
likely to aid the fall crop, agronomists said. 
</P>
<P>
	July cocoa fell $27 to $961 a ton.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Lose Out in Bid for Bar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Trader Jon's, a storied hangout for  
aviators from the Pensacola Naval Air Station, is being sold to a 
New Jersey businessman, disappointing veterans who had wanted to 
buy and refurbish the ramshackle bar. 
</P>
<P>
	Relatives of owner Martin ``Trader Jon'' Weissman signed a  
contract on Thursday to turn the place over to John Cave, a former 
Army drill sergeant who owns a small airport and entertainment 
complex in Lumberton, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal is to become final within a month, after Cave inspects  
the bar, which needs thousands of dollars in repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Cave, 52, gave assurances he will preserve the bar's character,  
including the rare aviation memorabilia. ``I have no intention of 
doing anything else,'' he said. ``That's the only reason I wanted 
to get involved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trader Jon's has been a favorite of naval aviators since it  
opened in the early 1950s. It was the model for the bar featured in 
the movie ``An Officer and a Gentleman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bar is filled with pictures, model airplanes, flight suits,  
aircraft parts and other aviation artifacts. It includes an 
adjoining building Weissman turned into a Blue Angels museum to 
honor the precision flying team, based at Pensacola. 
</P>
<P>
	Trader Jon's closed earlier this year. It had been open on and  
off ever since Weissman, 83, suffered a paralyzing stroke in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Two former aviators had formed the nonprofit Trader Jon  
Preservation Squadron to make a bid for the bar, raising more than 
$200,000 through hat and T-shirt sales. But Weissman's family 
turned down an offer made last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're stunned,'' said Bob Stumpf, a former Blue Angels flight  
leader and retired Navy commander who helped make the bid. He said 
he and his partner, Kent Bolin, a former Marine helicopter pilot, 
``really in our hearts had Trader Jon's best interests in mind.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Yelstin Debate Dominates Duma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Whether inside or outside Russia's parliament, the  
anti-Yeltsin din on Friday was both loud and scorching. 
</P>
<P>
	In the legislative chamber, hard-liners in the State Duma,  
parliament's lower house, disparaged President Boris Yeltsin -- 
sometimes in the loftiest of terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Impeaching the president is the moral duty of every deputy,''  
Communist Svetlana Goryacheva told other legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawmakers weren't so high-minded, excoriating the  
68-year-old leader with bitingly personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very image of that person -- his expression, his gestures --  
radiates a threat,'' actor and ex-Culture Minister Nikolai Gubenko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the White House, the elephantine marble edifice where  
the Duma's chambers are located, Yeltsin's foes also had a field 
day. They chanted and waved red flags, drowning out the paltry 
crowd of Yeltsin supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearings began Thursday on a dull, almost soporific note,  
but the second day brought a series of impassioned speeches. Most 
spoke in favor of impeachment, and many mentioned the bloody 
1994-96 war in Chechnya as the key charge against Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has money for everything ... except for burying the last  
soldiers killed in Chechnya. If only for that, he should be 
impeached,'' said Stanislav Govorukhin, a filmmaker, whose screed 
against Yeltsin was frequently interrupted with applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you hear the wail of entire Russia -- free us from him,  
save our children!'' the mustachioed Govorukhin implored. 
</P>
<P>
	Apocalypse was on Vladimir Lysenko's tongue. In perhaps the most  
unexpected and impassioned speech of the day, the lawmaker charged 
Yeltsin with betraying democratic ideals and urged him to resign 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow might be too late,'' Lysenko said.  
</P>
<P>
	For sheer political theater, the prize may have gone to  
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Long known for angry and 
dramatic outbursts, he grabbed the Duma's attention as Communist 
opponents and even speaker Gennady Seleznyov tried in vain to 
silence him. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhirinovsky first demanded to speak alone for the entire 28  
minutes given to four of his party lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duma voted down the proposal, after which each of  
Zhirinovsky's allies surrendered his time to the leader -- claiming 
inability to speak because of upset stomachs or sore throats. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you, the best 450 people in the great country of Russia,  
are afraid of me, I must be the greatest man on Earth,'' 
Zhirinovsky told the lawmakers. ``Well, we'll continue tomorrow. 
You shall all go crazy tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scene, Zhirinovsky has been negotiating with the  
Kremlin over posts in a new Cabinet. In a rambling speech before 
the cameras, however, he left subtlety behind, urging the Duma to 
end debate and unite against common foes -- NATO and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``World War III against Russia may start in June,'' shouted  
Zhirinovsky.

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Gun Background Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Reversing a position taken earlier in the  
week, Senate Republicans pushed through a provision today they 
claimed would establish a system of background checks for all 
buyers of firearms at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	But even in advance of the 48-47 vote, President Clinton and  
Senate Democrats cited numerous loopholes and Republicans agreed to 
consider further changes. 
</P>
<P>
	The vote came after a clash over the role the National Rifle  
Association has played in the legislation, which was brought to the 
Senate floor less than a month after the Columbine High School 
shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., accused Republicans of faking an  
effort to pass tougher gun laws, at the behest of the NRA. 
</P>
<P>
	``National Rifle Association hasn't had a thing to do with it,''  
snapped the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman, Sen. Orrin Hatch, 
sponsor of the legislation. ``I don't care whether they accept it 
or not'' said the Utah Republican. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch and other Republicans struggled to amass a majority,  
lobbying GOP colleagues on the Senate floor as the roll call 
proceeded. In the end, 47 Republicans and Sen. Robert Byrd, 
D-W.Va., supported the proposal, while 40 Democrats and seven 
Republicans opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The uncertainty on the Senate floor -- lawmakers voting on a  
proposal that everyone knew would be changed later -- underscored 
the political stakes involved in the gun-control debate in the 
aftermath of the Colorado shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes after the background-check vote, the Senate killed  
Schumer's amendment, 50-43. It would have required Web sites 
selling guns to be federally licensed. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodded by some in their own ranks, Republicans offered  
concessions on the background check amendment Thursday, but Clinton 
ridiculed the proposals today. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new Senate Republican bill is still riddled with  
high-caliber loopholes,'' the president said at the White House. 
``It won't stop criminals from buying guns at gun shows. At the 
same time, it will open up a new pawnshop loophole that lets 
convicted felons get guns at a local pawnshop. That's actually 
worse than current law. I simply can't believe the Senate will make 
the same mistake twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``So, once again, I ask them to reject this phony proposal and  
to pass real legislation that requires the background checks 
necessary to prevent criminals from buying guns at gun shows which 
they cannot buy at gun stores,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republicans' abrupt U-turn underscored the shift in the gun-  
control debate following last month's shooting spree in Littleton, 
Colo., that left 14 high school students and a teacher dead. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Senate agreed to prohibit the import of  
high-capacity ammunition clips not included in a 1994 assault 
weapons ban. An effort to kill the measure was rejected, 59-39, 
with almost all votes in opposition cast by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats called it a victory over the NRA.  
</P>
<P>
	``The NRA said no and it passed anyway,'' Sen. Dianne Feinstein,  
D-Calif., said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate also agreed to a proposal by Sen. John Ashcroft,  
R-Mo., to ban juvenile possession of semiautomatic weapons and 
high-capacity ammunition clips. That vote was 96-2. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite this week's action, a big backlog of amendments  
threatened to derail Hatch's underlying bill, which would stiffen 
prosecution standards for juvenile offenders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're in such a doggone log jam here that we might have to  
pull this bill down,'' Hatch, R-Utah, sputtered from the floor late 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate on Wednesday approved an amendment by Sen. Larry  
Craig, R-Idaho, to make instant background checks of private sales 
at gun shows voluntary. But a half-dozen Republicans later 
complained to Craig, a member of the NRA's board of directors, that 
his amendment should go further to ensure that background checks 
are performed even in private sales at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said  
private polling in recent weeks has shown very strong support for 
gun control, even among potential voters in Republican presidential 
primaries. That is a marked shift from the past, in which base GOP 
voters were less supportive of gun control than the nation as a 
whole. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration also pounced on Wednesday's vote.  
Clinton, joined by Attorney General Janet Reno in some of the 
harshest terms she's used on congressional action, accused the 
Senate of ignoring the threat highlighted less than a month earlier 
by the shootings at Columbine High School. 
</P>
<P>
	By midafternoon Thursday, Craig announced that he would propose  
an amendment that would require background checks for all transfers 
of firearms at gun shows. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats at first rejoiced. But later, they accused Craig of  
not strengthening gun laws. Democrats said Craig's new proposal 
still would leave a group of people who would not be required to do 
background checks of purchasers. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig disagreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``Every gun transfer at gun shows would have a background check  
performed,'' Craig told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also said that under Craig's new proposal, a sale would  
be approved automatically if the background check was not completed 
within 24 hours, rather than the three days in current law. They 
also said the proposal would continue to allow an individual to 
pawn a gun and reclaim it without undergoing a background check. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans who voted no on today's 48-47 vote: Sens. John  
Chafee of Rhode Island, Mike Enzi of Wyoming, Peter Fitzgerald of 
Illinois, Bob Smith of New Hampshire, Craig Thomas of Wyoming, Fred 
Thompson of Tennessee and John Warner of Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Acting Russia P.M. Sets Out Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Boris Yeltsin's nominee for prime minister  
announced plans Friday for a new government, including measures 
designed to help the country out of its economic crisis and win 
approval from the State Duma, parliament's lower house. 
</P>
<P>
	Sergei Stepashin, a staunch Yeltsin ally, will face a tough  
battle for confirmation in the Duma, dominated by Communists and 
hostile to the Russian president. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin was appointed acting prime minister Wednesday after  
Yeltsin ousted Yevgeny Primakov from the job. On Thursday, 
parliament began impeachment hearings against Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duma will hold its vote on Stepashin's nomination next week.  
If he is rejected three times, Yeltsin is required by law to 
dissolve parliament and new elections will be held. 
</P>
<P>
	Vladimir Ryzhkov, a pro-Kremlin lawmaker, saw little chance that  
Stepashin would be confirmed as prime minister. ``People who are 
sure he will be approved the first time around are living in a 
parallel universe,'' he said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, former prime minister Viktor Chernomyrdin said he  
believed Stepashin would ultimately be confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will pass through the State Duma, and it does not matter at  
which time,'' Chernomyrdin told the ITAR-Tass news agency. ``It 
would be desirable to have the earliest approval.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist leader, said Stepashin would  
meet with the leaders of several parties on Tuesday to discuss his 
agenda for taking the country out of its political and economic 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Zyuganov, who said he had not been offered a job in the new  
government, was asked how Communist deputies will vote on 
Stepashin's nomination. ``It's too early to guess,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin met with his staff on Friday and set out a three-part  
program for his new government, the Interfax news agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	First, the government ``must guarantee the speedy approval of  
the package of economic bills drafted by the government of Yevgeny 
Primakov,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the bills are not passed, or if the new Cabinet is not  
approved, all existing and future agreements with international 
lending institutions, including the International Monetary Fund and 
the World Bank, would be threatened. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Monetary Fund has tentatively agreed to lend  
Russia $4.5 billion, but is waiting for parliament to pass a 
legislative package on economic policy before disbursing the first 
installment. 
</P>
<P>
	The second task for the government would be drafting the budget  
for the year 2000. The third proposal was for the government to 
assure the payment of wages, pensions and subsidies to the 
provinces, Interfax said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin said many members of his new government would be  
holdovers from Primakov's Cabinet. ``The backbone of the Cabinet 
will undoubtedly remain, and there will be no overhaul,'' he said, 
according to Interfax.

<HEADLINE> Brown: No Celebration for Sixers Yet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The temptation is there to keep celebrating  
into the night and weekend, basking in this rare moment of playoff 
glory. The Philadelphia 76ers haven't been this hot since Julius 
Erving soared through the air in the Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia coach Larry Brown is aware of that problem: There  
is still work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to treat it like a one-game series,'' said Brown,  
trying to restore some humility after the Sixers defeated the Magic 
97-85 Thursday night to take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-5 series. 
``We can't afford to slip up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by memories of an eight-year honeymoon with the NBA draft  
lottery, the emotional Sixers have pushed the favored Magic to the 
brink of elimination. But the basketball revival that has gripped 
Philadelphia could go wrong in a hurry if the Sixers don't finish 
the job in Game 4 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those fans in Orlando will be packing it in if we get this  
Game 4,'' Orlando sixth man Darrell Armstrong said Friday. 
``They're going to go crazy just like the fans here in the City of 
Brotherly Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic committed 27 turnovers, 20 in the first half, and  
watched the game degenerate further when Penny Hardaway complained 
that coach Chuck Daly didn't get him enough shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson, stifled by an onslaught of double teams and  
physical muggings ordered by Daly in Game 2, scored 33 points, had 
an NBA playoff record 10 steals and even led the cheers in the 
Sixers' first home playoff game since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a guy by the name of Michael Jordan, so I've seen  
63-point games in the playoffs,'' said Daly, who was not offended 
by Iverson's gesture for him to call a timeout when the Sixers ran 
away with the game in the third quarter. ``He is a great player, 
he's tough as nails. He gives no excuses. You've got to love him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-foot-1 Matt Geiger scored only 4 points, but the fiery,  
intimidating center got into heated confrontations with 6-10 Isaac 
Austin, 6-1 Armstrong and 68-year-old Daly in the opening minutes 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotion spread quickly through the First Union Center, the  
conflagration of nearly a decade of waiting for deplorable 
basketball to end. And it did. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd was about as good as any arena I've ever been in,  
and I've been in some good ones,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, aptly characterized by one writer as ``a chest-pass coach  
in a no-look world,'' was fine with the celebrating in the stands. 
He was furious, however, with some of the emotion displayed by his 
players on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson led the way with various forms of street-ball posturing,  
including the unthinkable gesture for Daly to call a timeout when 
Philadelphia gained its biggest lead, 23 points, in the third 
quarter. Larry Hughes, a fearless 20-year-old rookie, made the same 
signal with his hands after one of his high-flying dunks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It motivates me, because the series isn't over,'' Hardaway  
said of the fans' wild celebration. ``They are acting like the 
Sixers just swept this and we're going back home. We have one more 
game and we have something to prove. I've got something to prove 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown lectured his team on Friday about the importance of  
holding off the party until the job is done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came too far to let one big game at home give us the wrong  
impression,'' said Hughes, who nonetheless doesn't regret taunting 
the Magic. ``We got a little down there, too, so we were just 
trying to return the favor a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic's season hinges on whether Hardaway can put aside his  
differences with Daly long enough to send the series back to 
Orlando for Game 5. Hardaway scored most of his 18 points during 
garbage time and complained afterward about getting only 12 shots -- 
two in the first half 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 4, ``I'm coming out firing no matter what,'' Hardaway  
said. ``I don't care if I miss 25 or 30 shots. I just have to, 
because I'm going to get blamed for it either way. I'm in a no-win 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway is still bothered by partially torn ligaments in his  
right wrist. Sixers reserve guard Aaron McKie did not practice 
Friday and was limping badly with a deep thigh bruise. He is listed 
as questionable for Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrating aside, both teams are still questionable for Game 5.

<HEADLINE> Senior Tour's No. 2 Man Still Humble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALPHARETTA, Ga. (AP) -- It's business as usual at Doyle's Golf  
Center, even though the guy who runs the place is suddenly No. 2 on 
the PGA Senior Tour money list. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter how well he does in weekend tournaments, Allen Doyle  
spends the rest of the week answering phones, mowing grass and 
repairing clubs at his driving range in LaGrange, about an hour 
southwest of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle, a former college hockey player with a slap-shot inspired  
swing, has already won two tournaments and $762,000 this year, his 
first full season on the tour. That's a bit more than he makes from 
the golf center he has run since 1984, when he was talked into 
paying $500 for the rights to the lease. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would take me 10 years to make that at the range,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't expect him to give up his business. He still fixes  
clubs inside the red frame building and gets on his tractor to cut 
the uneven grass among the patches of clay and weeds on the 11-acre 
property. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old Doyle says he hasn't changed much, despite  
winning the PGA Seniors Championship and its $315,000 first prize. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't stay too comfortable and say `I've got it made now  
that I got a million dollars made,''' Doyle said as he headed back 
home following his 10th place finish at last week's Nationwide 
Championship in Alpharetta. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll find that anybody that never had that much, that when  
they get it, they know how to appreciate it,'' he said. ``Compare 
that to somebody who just gets it and goes hog wild and then has 
nothing. It's not going to happen with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, on most Mondays, you can still find Doyle at the modest  
range just down the road from a mobile-home dealership. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just have to have something to do,'' he said. ``I don't  
piddle around the house. I've got to get up in the morning and do 
something. So, if I'm not doing that, I'm just sitting on my 
fanny,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle doesn't quite fit the mold of the professional golfer, and  
he didn't become one until he was 46. 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe that explains his swing. The 6-foot-3, 210-pound Doyle,  
who bends his back nearly in half, takes the club barely past his 
waist, but his power comes from thick wrists and forearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, it's probably not as odd as it looks,'' Doyle said.  
``Probably a little slower than it looks, which would give you the 
idea it's a little more fluid. ... But it's short and choppy, you 
know, like a slap shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Larry Nelson, a fellow Georgian who is No. 3 on the money list,  
says many players have success with nontraditional swings. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's why on the scorecard, they just ask you, `How much?'  
not `How?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle, a Rhode Island native, played hockey at Norwich  
University. He settled in Georgia following a stint in the Army in 
the early 1970s and became one of the state's top amateur golfers. 
</P>
<P>
	Doyle waited to turn pro in part because he felt he needed a  
stable income -- the kind he earns from the golf range -- while he 
was saving for college for his daughters, 19 and 21. Of course, 
Erin and Michelle received golf scholarships at Southern 
Mississippi and South Alabama, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	And Doyle has never been overconfident about his game, although  
he won six Georgia amateur titles, membership on two Walker Cup 
teams and three World Amateur Cup teams. 
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't hard leaving amateur golf, but there wasn't anything  
wrong with being the big cheese either. Every place you went, you 
got treated special,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He turned pro in 1995 and won three times on the Nike Tour,  
earning a full exemption to the 1996 PGA Tour, making him the 
oldest rookie ever at 47. 
</P>
<P>
	He earned more than $200,000 in two years on the regular tour  
and another $165,000 last year in six Senior PGA events after 
turning 50 in June. 
</P>
<P>
	So his success this year is not entirely unexpected.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleasantly surprised I guess, but not shocked,'' Doyle  
said. ``I kind of felt that I could play out here, but I didn't 
expect to win twice, including a major, this soon.'' 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Martinez Pays Off For Red Sox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- When the Boston Red Sox made Pedro Martinez the  
highest-paid player in baseball history in November 1997, general 
manager Dan Duquette thought he had the best pitcher in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	It looks like Duquette was right.  
</P>
<P>
	Boston's Martinez has the most wins and strikeouts in the major  
leagues and he doesn't appear to be slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez (7-1) is off to one of the best starts of his career,  
and his 91 strikeouts leads the majors. Randy Johnson is second 
with 78. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the best I've seen in all my years,'' Seattle designated  
hitter Edgar Martinez said. ``I faced Roger Clemens in his early 
years and Nolan Ryan. They were tough, but Pedro is better. He's 
very tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With his 15-strikeout, 9-2 win over the Mariners on Wednesday  
night, Martinez tied a record for the most strikeouts in three 
consecutive nine inning games with 43. He struck out every Seattle 
starter -- including Ken Griffey Jr. and Jay Buhner three times each 
-- except John Mabry. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez also struck out 15 on May 7 against Oakland and 13 on  
May 1 against Anaheim. Dwight Gooden of the New York Mets had 43 
strikeouts from Sept. 7-17 in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a strong performance,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams  
said. ``They have an outstanding club with a lot of power. When you 
talk about being overpowering and striking out a lot of people -- at 
this level -- it's hard to do. I've seen some other teams, but I 
haven't seen the kind of power this man has.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez had nine strikeouts in each of his first two games and  
reached double figures for the sixth straight start -- a feat only 
he and Johnson have accomplished since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 National League Cy Young Award winner also had six  
straight games with 10 or more strikeouts with Montreal in June of 
that year. Johnson did it with Seattle last June 19-July 16. 
Martinez also had his best start in 1997, when he went 8-0. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, he allowed two runs, four hits and one walk in  
eight innings. Martinez, whose ERA is 1.81, didn't allow a hit in 
the first four innings, striking out nine with a nasty changeup and 
an overpowering fastball before David Segui's leadoff double in the 
fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 59 2-3 innings he has pitched since April 7, Martinez has  
yielded only 11 walks. The most he has walked in a game is three. 
</P>
<P>
	When was the last time the Mariners' Martinez had seen a pitcher  
so dominant? 
</P>
<P>
	``The last time we played him,'' Edgar Martinez said. ``He has  
three quality pitches with great control. Nobody intimidates him. 
He feels like he is running the show -- and he did (Wednesday) 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``So far this year, I've been healthy,'' Pedro Martinez said.  
``I've been making my pitches and I happen to get away with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's good for the Red Sox, whose other starters have  
struggled. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez hopes to continue to please the Fenway Park crowd,  
which booed when Williams made his first trip to the mound after 
Martinez had thrown 125 pitches, 83 for strikes. The fans, many of 
whom wave Dominican Republic flags in the stands when Martinez 
pitches, hoped to see the ace surpass his career high 15 strikeouts 
before being lifted from the game. 
</P>
<P>
	But that will have to come another day.  
</P>
<P>
	``I just pray that I can keep it going, that I can give them  
that strikeout whenever they root for it,'' Martinez said. ``I know 
it's not always going to be like that. But I'm always going to try 
to please them whenever they ask for it.''

<HEADLINE> Democrats Fighting for Farm Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans rejected $5.3 billion in emergency  
aid for farmers, but farm state Democrats say they'll continue 
their efforts on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., tried to  
get the money included in a supplemental spending bill being worked 
out by House and Senate budget negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	But when put to a vote, the farm aid proposal, which started as  
a $4.3 billion deal but increased as lawmakers added riders, got a 
14-14 tie vote. One Republican, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., voted 
with all the Democrats in favor of the package. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the committee agreed to $566 million for farmers, which  
includes money to replenish the shrinking coffers that supply farm 
loans. The proposal will still have to get past both floors of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said Thursday the money isn't nearly enough,  
particularly when budget planners agreed to $11.6 billion for the 
air assault on Yugoslavia and to boost defense spending. President 
Clinton had only requested $6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is telling farmers ``you better get down and paint your  
tractors in camouflage,'' said Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill. ``What does 
it take to get the attention of the Republican leadership around 
here?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``For them, on defense, the sky is the limit,'' said Dorgan.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said the agreement helped farmers.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats are grandstanding,'' said Sen. Thad Cochran,  
R-Miss., chairman of the Agriculture Committee's appropriations 
panel, adding that the GOP leaders are open to passing more money 
later this year if the administration requests it. ``We gave the 
administration everything they asked for and more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Selma Sierra, spokeswoman for Rep. Joe Skeen, R-N.M., said  
Clinton's request to replenish the farm loan funds was $152 
million, so Republicans increased it fivefold. ``If they think we 
don't care about farmers, then Democrats must be heartless,'' 
Sierra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress last year passed a $6 billion emergency package for  
farmers as prices plummeted. With low prices expected to continue 
much of this year, many lawmakers have pushed for early emergency 
funds to ease the pain.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Fundraises Down West Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Stepping off on a $3 million fund-raising sweep  
down the West Coast, President Clinton told Democratic contributors 
Friday that his 6 1/2 years in the White House have been ``a labor of 
love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But if party patrons, who were paying as much as $25,000 for a  
weekend meal with Clinton, like the soaring stock market, they need 
to be concerned about who follows him in the White House, the 
president said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know, I won't be on the ballot in 2000. This is the first  
time in a long time I haven't been on a ballot,'' Clinton told 
Democrats with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it is terribly important to me that everyone in America  
understand that this (economy), on the one hand, didn't happen by 
accident -- but on the other hand, is not dependent upon any person 
alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What matters, he said, is that Democrats win.  
</P>
<P>
	Democratic National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said Democrats  
were counting on the economy to carry them to victory in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``While Republicans quadrupled the national debt, our president  
quadrupled the Dow Jones,'' Andrew said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the work that those of us in our administration have done  
in the last six years has been a labor of love,'' Clinton said. ``I 
literally get up and try to live with the spirit of gratitude every 
day for the good things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke at a $200,000 Seattle luncheon before heading to a  
$500,000 dinner in the San Francisco Bay area. The president's 
four-day take for Democrats -- with events also in Beverly Hills, 
San Diego and Las Vegas -- was expected to top $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was sweeping up at least $2 million in Beverly Hills, at  
an event hosted by some of movie-making's biggest names: Steven 
Spielberg, David Geffen and Jeffrey Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
	His fund-raising trip drew criticism from Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott of Mississippi, who referred to the gun control debate 
unfolding in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	``This weekend, the Clinton-Gore regime will be begging for cash  
from one of the polluters responsible for our nation's moral 
decline,'' he said. ``What's the message to our children? Democrats 
care about your safety, unless it's inconvenient to their partners 
in Hollywood?'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 175 people gathered on two corners near the Seattle  
luncheon site to protest the Clinton administration's handling of 
allegations that China stole nuclear secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	The protesters held signs labeling the president ``Made in  
China,'' and asking, ``Didn't China pay you enough?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Up the street, another 75 people carried signs protesting the  
NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia, ``Stop bombing Yugoslavia,'' one 
sign said, and ``NATO bombs can't bring peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside the Rainier Club, Clinton passionately defended the NATO  
campaign against Yugoslavia's ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and 
apologized once more for the alliance's accidental bombing of the 
Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	After being frozen out for days by President Jiang Zemin,  
Clinton spoke with the Chinese leader by telephone before leaving 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``We made a terrible mistake in bombing the Chinese embassy and  
I regret it more than I can say. I talked to the president of China 
today and told him,'' Clinton reported. 
</P>
<P>
	He interspersed his frenetic fund raising with plenty of rest  
and relaxation, planning to spend Saturday relaxing with his 
daughter, Chelsea, near the Palo Alto, Calif., campus of Stanford 
University, where she is a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday was reserved for the golf courses of Las Vegas.

<HEADLINE> At Home, Microsoft in Cable Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. will partner with At  
Home Corp. to help small and medium-sized cable companies provide 
high-speed Internet connections for customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will become a strategic technology partner in At Home  
Solutions, a private venture that uses At Home's nationwide 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., will contribute its Window  
NT Server operating system and support and resources to assist in 
marketing the service, the companies said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources close to the deal said Microsoft's investment was worth  
$5 million, The Wall Street Journal reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	At Home estimates 15 million homes and businesses are served by  
smaller, local cable companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``We very much welcome Microsoft's involvement, which will help  
us to establish At Home Solutions as the clear broadband leader in 
the small and mid-sized cable markets,'' said At Home Solutions 
chairman Dean A. Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft and the Redwood City-based At Home had been seen as  
rivals since they both operate Internet portal sites.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Pulled From Pimlico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- No one will ever confuse the Black-Eyed Susan  
Stakes for the Preakness. They're as different as lining up against 
the rail and running from the 14th post position. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Pegram, the owner of Silverbulletday, would have preferred  
seeing his filly run in the prestigious Preakness. But after his 
horse drew the 14th post, Pegram pulled her from the race and 
entered Silverbulletday in today's Black-Eyed Susan, a 1 1/8-mile race 
for 3-year-old fillies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hurts, but it was the right thing to do. It was really  
unexpected, though,'' Pegram said Thursday. ``We had to look at the 
book to see how far the Black-Eyed Susan was. She was entered, but 
I never thought of anything but the Preakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, winner of 10 of 11 career races, was the  
overwhelming 1-5 early favorite in the $200,000 Black-Eyed Susan. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to take care of her,'' trainer Bob Baffert said. ``With  
the good ones, you've got to be so careful. This was a hard 
decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Black-Eyed Susan essentially served as an insurance policy  
for both the fillies he brought from Kentucky to Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert would have preferred to saddle Silverbulletday and  
Excellent Meeting for the Preakness. But only Excellent Meeting 
will run Saturday -- from the No. 7 spot. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grade II Black-Eyed Susan shapes up as Silverbulletday and  
seven other horses. Silverbulletday, coming off a dominant victory 
in the Grade I Kentucky Oaks, has won seven straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Dreams Gallore, who finished second in the Kentucky Oaks, and  
Madison's Charm opened at 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Happy Hopper, who won the Dixie Belle and Martha Washington  
Stakes at Oaklawn Park and finished second behind Excellent Meeting 
in the Fantasy, is also considered to be a contender. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner of the race will receive $120,000. Other entrants  
are: Mysterious Jak, who hasn't run outside of Maryland this year; 
Waltz, who has won two of three races in 1999; Vee Vee Star and 
Magic Broad.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Plot in Embassy Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- From irate workers who hurled bits of concrete at  
the U.S. Embassy for four days to sophisticated scholars of 
international affairs, Chinese are embracing a slew of conspiracy 
theories over NATO's bombing of their embassy in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, the missiles that slammed into the building in  
Belgrade symbolized a 100-year struggle to build a modern country 
in the face of bullying from foreign powers. Thrown into the mix 
are deep pride in China's long civilization and shame that it lags 
behind the West technologically. 
</P>
<P>
	The communist government has kept those emotions raw through  
five decades of propaganda outlining what it maintains are the 
humiliations visited on China by predatory foreigners. The 
leadership has urged Chinese to build a strong country that can 
never be humiliated again. 
</P>
<P>
	Western powers led by the United States are ``using all methods,  
including political, economic, military and diplomatic means to 
obstruct and destroy China's development,'' the People's Daily, the 
Communist Party's most authoritative newspaper, said in a 
commentary Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Far from accidental, the NATO bombing was a provocation to see a  
``united, advanced, hope-filled China pushed into chaos and an 
abyss,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Books and media reports that have railed against the United  
States off and on for the past decade have resonated with the 
public. From what China maintains were questionable calls that kept 
it from winning gold at the Atlanta Olympics to hectoring about 
human rights, many feel the United States has frustrated China's 
rise and overlooked progress in improving living standards and 
personal freedoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout NATO's air campaign, the entirely state-controlled  
media have focused on the U.S. role and civilian casualties in the 
airstrikes, while scarcely mentioning the killings and expulsions 
of ethnic Albanians in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	When NATO mistakenly attacked the Chinese Embassy on May 7,  
strong nationalist feelings unified China's people behind its 
government. Biased media coverage and partial, changing 
explanations from NATO fed a belief that the West wasn't telling 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
	As students, workers and others poured into the streets last  
Saturday, a mix of propaganda, patriotism, indignation and 
suspicion generated an array of conspiracy theories in the official 
media. 
</P>
<P>
	According to one, the United States wants to use the Yugoslav  
war to dominate Europe and then move on to Russia and China. 
Another says the embassy bombing was designed to push China into 
blocking recent peace moves in the United Nations and give NATO 
more time to pummel Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	Either way, the bombing was seen as a test of China's resolve.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is part of the United States' global strategy,'' said  
foreign policy expert Shen Jiru. ``The United States thinks we're 
weak and believes it will be unbeatable for another 15 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leading newspapers carried articles last week asking  
incredulously how U.S. spy satellites, the most advanced in the 
world, could have failed to recognize the prominent Chinese Embassy 
with its red flag flying. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people still question the explanation that it was an  
accident. Not because they have any hard evidence of conspiracy, 
but because the current evidence supplied by NATO and the United 
States is very shaky so far,'' said Jia Qingguo, a professor of 
international studies at Peking University. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was definitely done on purpose. How could it be anything  
else? They were using the most sophisticated weapons. This was 
Clinton's attempt to keep China down,'' said one protester taking a 
break from hurling bits of broken concrete at the British Embassy 
last Sunday. When asked his name, he replied ``Man of China.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment and news programs backed up the image of a China  
standing firm. 
</P>
<P>
	A memorial concert for the three journalists killed in the  
bombing was held Thursday night in the southern city of Shenzhen 
and broadcast by Hong Kong's Phoenix Television, which is widely 
viewed in southern and eastern China. 
</P>
<P>
	The concert, titled ``Today the Chinese can say No,'' featured  
refutations of NATO's explanation interspersed with pop songs and 
dances.

<HEADLINE> Court Voids EPA Air-Pollution Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court blocked the  
Environmental Protection Agency on Friday from imposing tougher air 
quality requirements the agency says are needed to protect people 
with respiratory problems and children. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling by a three-judge panel, acting on a lawsuit by a  
number of industry groups, was a major defeat for the Clinton 
administration, which has viewed the air regulations as one of its 
top environmental accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the EPA said it will ask the Justice Department to  
appeal, the ruling halted any further enforcement of rules imposed 
in July 1997 that require states to dramatically reduce the amount 
of ozone, or smog, and microscopic soot they may allow in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is ``deeply disappointed'' by the ruling,  
said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. ``We will continue 
to do everything in our power to ensure that the American people 
are adequately protected against ... harmful air pollutants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three judges of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District  
of Columbia rejected claims by the industry groups that the 
regulations were based on incomplete and poor science and were too 
costly. But two of the three judges concluded the EPA failed to 
justify the pollution levels it selected as minimum requirements to 
protect public health. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency ``construed (sections of) the Clean Air Act so  
loosely as to render them unconstitutional delegations of 
legislative power,'' wrote Judges Douglas H. Ginsburg and Stephen 
F. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge David S. Tatel, who joined the other two judges in some of  
the decision, nevertheless, issued a strong dissent on this key 
point. The EPA, in fact, used ``reasonable explanations'' for 
setting the standards it chose, wrote Tatel. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations imposed much tougher health standards for  
smog-causing ozone and opened the way for the first time for 
regulation of microscopic soot. The tighter standards put hundreds 
of counties in violation of federal air quality standards. 
</P>
<P>
	A broad array of industry groups, from electric utilities to  
trucking companies, vigorously fought the regulations, arguing they 
would require costly pollution reductions while the health benefits 
had yet to be shown. The EPA has argued that current ozone and soot 
standards do not protect certain segments of the population, 
including small children, the elderly and people with respiratory 
ailments. 
</P>
<P>
	When they were imposed, Vice President Al Gore called the  
tougher requirements ``the most significant steps in a generation 
to protect the American people, especially our children, from air 
pollution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The revised air standards limited ozone, an essential part of  
smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of 0.12 parts per million 
under the old requirement. And for the first time they required 
that states regulate microscopic particulates, or soot, from power 
plants, cars and other sources down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times 
smaller than the width of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court panel, with Tatel dissenting, said the EPA did  
not establish clear ``principles'' to support those specific 
standards and, instead, selected them arbitrarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry representatives and critics of the regulations in  
Congress quickly applauded the decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big victory, one of the biggest,'' said Robin Conrad,  
senior vice president for litigation at the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. She said the ruling acknowledged industry's claim that 
the EPA in setting the standard was ``picking numbers out of the 
hat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA will have to ``start the process all over again ... and  
justify its numbers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision shows that EPA Administrator Carol Browner  
clearly overreached her authority,'' said Sen. James M. Inhofe, 
R-Okla., who has argued the new standards were too burdensome on 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision stunned EPA officials and many environmentalists.  
</P>
<P>
	``This ruling is a direct assault on the principle of  
health-based air quality protection,'' said David Hawkins, head of 
the air and energy office of the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Karpinski, executive director of U.S. Public Interest  
Research Group, called it ``an outrageous decision on behalf of the 
polluters and ... a severe threat to public health.''

<HEADLINE> Quake Rocks Palm Springs Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALM SPRINGS, Calif. (AP) -- A magnitude-5.0 earthquake shook the  
desert near Palm Springs early today. There were no immediate 
reports of damage or injuries from the aftershock to a deadly 1992 
temblor. 
</P>
<P>
	The earthquake happened at 12:54 a.m. and was centered 19 miles  
northeast of Palm Springs, said Joe Franck, a seismologist at the 
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial quake was followed by a swarm of smaller tremors.  
Palm Springs is about 110 miles east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Gail Richardson, a clerk at the Joshua Tree sheriff's station,  
said deputies were fielding many calls from anxious residents but 
no one reported damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was felt throughout the entire basin, it was a pretty good  
one,'' Ms. Richardson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The magnitude-7.3 Landers earthquake struck June 28, 1992, and  
was followed a few hours later by a magnitude-6.5 quake hit in the 
San Bernardino Mountains. One person was killed. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been more than 70,000 aftershocks. This is the 24th  
aftershock with a magnitude of 5.0 or greater, Franck said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Faults 2 US Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- U.S. tobacco giant Phillip Morris,  
responding to pressure from government officials, says it is doing 
all it can to attack the sale of contraband cigarettes in Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
	The country's governors are threatening to file suit in a U.S.  
court against the maker of Marlboro cigarettes and British American 
Tobacco -- the two leading exporters of cigarettes to Colombia. The 
governors allege the companies are avoiding hundreds of millions of 
dollars in sales taxes by intentionally fostering illegal imports 
and sales of their cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
	Miguel Raad, the governor of northern Bolivar State and head of  
the national governors' association, said Wednesday the companies 
``have collaborated by action or omission'' in illegal cigarette 
sales which cost the government as much as $305 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	States levy a 48 percent sales tax on imported cigarettes,  
however the widespread contraband sales mean that taxes are evaded. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Cho, a spokesperson for Phillip Morris International  
in New York, said Thursday the company has tried to discourage 
contraband sales through advertising campaigns helping Colombians 
identify black market cigarettes and by tightening controls through 
its distributors. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, however, is largely the Colombian government's to  
resolve, she said. ``We don't have either the resources of the 
authority to substitute ourselves for the customs administration, 
border security forces or the law enforcement departments of any 
country,'' Cho said by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	British American Tobacco, which distributes Kent, Kool, Belmont  
and Free cigarettes in Colombia, did not return several telephone 
calls to its Bogota offices.

<HEADLINE> TRW Adjusts Earnings To Show Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Automotive parts maker TRW Inc. revised its  
first-quarter earnings report to show a loss of $28.4 million 
instead of the profit of $58.6 million originally reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The adjustment disclosed Friday was related to an $85.3 million  
charge for acquiring British auto parts maker LucasVarity. TRW, 
which also makes defense equipment, bought LucasVarity for $7 
billion earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	TRW said its first-quarter earnings adjustment reflects a  
valuation of LucasVarity's research and development and a $1.7 
million increase in its income tax rate. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, TRW's first-quarter earnings reported April 20 were  
reduced by $87 million for a net loss of $28.4 million, or 24 cents 
per share. That compares with net earnings of $129 million, or 
$1.03 per share, in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	In afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, TRW was off  
25 cents a share at $47.06 1/4.

<HEADLINE> Baltimore Mourns Loss of 'Homicide' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- ``Homicide: Life on the Streets'' gave John  
Wayne Smyth the chance to spread his wings as an actor. It wasn't 
much of a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	The bartender was hired six times as an extra on the NBC drama  
that was set and shot in Baltimore. His biggest role was a 
90-second appearance as a bar patron. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was typecasting,'' Smyth said as he nursed a hangover at  
The Cat's Eye Pub, across the street from the show's made-for-TV 
police station. Come to think of it, he had a hangover when the 
scene was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just nice memories,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Residents of Baltimore will have only memories of ``Homicide''  
from now on. The critically acclaimed but consistently low-rated 
show was canceled on Thursday after seven seasons. The last episode 
will air May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Belzer, who played the cynical yet surprisingly likable  
Detective John Munch, said the network based its decision to cancel 
the show, which won three Peabody awards, on the bottom line -- 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were always on the edge and always the critical favorite  
and had a great core audience that seemed to be there. But the 
brutal dollars and cents reality of television today... it didn't 
come down to artistic content but financial reality. It wasn't 
making enough money,'' Belzer said Friday, speaking from his home 
in France. 
</P>
<P>
	The show made a lot of money for Baltimore, about $28 million a  
year. It also brought people to Baltimore, and the colorful 
waterfront neighborhood of Fells Point where much of the show was 
filmed. Between 80 and 100 extras were hired per show. 
</P>
<P>
	Sona Gandhi-Brown, leasing manager of the upscale Henderson  
Wharf's apartments where several cast members lived, now must try 
to find renters for seven or eight units at $2,200 a month. She 
said that's pretty pricey for Baltimore, even for the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city's affection for the show and the crew's love for  
Baltimore went beyond economics. 
</P>
<P>
	David Burman owns the Waterfront Hotel and Restaurant, the bar  
that Munch and Detective Meldrick Lewis ``owned'' in the show. He 
said he will miss ``Homicide'' because the business got paid every 
time the show took it over to shoot a scene. Not to mention the 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm going to miss it. We got a lot of people from all over the  
country, from Europe, from Australia. They just want to come here 
and see the `Homicide' bar,'' said Burman, who sells black T-shirts 
with the image of a chalk outline of a body and the logo: 
``Homicide Witnessed at the Waterfront.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Fontana, the show's executive producer along with Hollywood  
movie producer Barry Levinson, said filming every one of the 122 
episodes in Baltimore brought the show realism. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that just by the nature of the fact it wasn't being  
shot on a back lot in Los Angeles, it allowed the city to be a full 
character on the show,'' he said. ``We showed the city as a 
breathing, living thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Producer David Simon, a former (Baltimore) Sun reporter who took  
a year off from the paper in 1988 to research ``Homicide: A Year on 
the Killing Streets,'' on which the drama was based, said there 
were concerns the series would make Baltimore look bad. They soon 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	``You would think it improbable that a show that is about murder  
and violence, and morality confronting immorality, would reflect 
well on a city, but somehow it did,'' Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Housekeeper Shirley Williams took the cancellation news hard.  
She cleaned for several cast members and is especially fond of 
Clark Johnson, who played Lewis, because he insisted on getting a 
hug from her each morning before he went off to the set. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of superstars are arrogant,'' she said. ``They were down  
to earth ... They drank in the bars around here, they mingled, they 
socialized.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said now he's going to have to find another place to  
berth his sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Baltimore was such a part of the show. The city was more  
important than any of us actors,'' Johnson said. ``I think 
Baltimore is really going to miss us.''

<HEADLINE> Anti-Yelstin Debate Dominates Duma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Whether inside or outside Russia's parliament, the  
anti-Yeltsin din on Friday was both loud and scorching. 
</P>
<P>
	In the legislative chamber, hard-liners in the State Duma,  
parliament's lower house, disparaged President Boris Yeltsin -- 
sometimes in the loftiest of terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``Impeaching the president is the moral duty of every deputy,''  
Communist Svetlana Goryacheva told other legislators. 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawmakers weren't so high-minded, excoriating the  
68-year-old leader with bitingly personal attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very image of that person -- his expression, his gestures --  
radiates a threat,'' actor and ex-Culture Minister Nikolai Gubenko 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside the White House, the elephantine marble edifice where  
the Duma's chambers are located, Yeltsin's foes also had a field 
day. They chanted and waved red flags, drowning out the paltry 
crowd of Yeltsin supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearings began Thursday on a dull, almost soporific note,  
but the second day brought a series of impassioned speeches. Most 
spoke in favor of impeachment, and many mentioned the bloody 
1994-96 war in Chechnya as the key charge against Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has money for everything ... except for burying the last  
soldiers killed in Chechnya. If only for that, he should be 
impeached,'' said Stanislav Govorukhin, a filmmaker, whose screed 
against Yeltsin was frequently interrupted with applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't you hear the wail of entire Russia -- free us from him,  
save our children!'' the mustachioed Govorukhin implored. 
</P>
<P>
	Apocalypse was on Vladimir Lysenko's tongue. In perhaps the most  
unexpected and impassioned speech of the day, the lawmaker charged 
Yeltsin with betraying democratic ideals and urged him to resign 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow might be too late,'' Lysenko said.  
</P>
<P>
	For sheer political theater, the prize may have gone to  
ultranationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Long known for angry and 
dramatic outbursts, he grabbed the Duma's attention as Communist 
opponents and even speaker Gennady Seleznyov tried in vain to 
silence him. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhirinovsky first demanded to speak alone for the entire 28  
minutes given to four of his party lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Duma voted down the proposal, after which each of  
Zhirinovsky's allies surrendered his time to the leader -- claiming 
inability to speak because of upset stomachs or sore throats. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you, the best 450 people in the great country of Russia,  
are afraid of me, I must be the greatest man on Earth,'' 
Zhirinovsky told the lawmakers. ``Well, we'll continue tomorrow. 
You shall all go crazy tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Behind the scene, Zhirinovsky has been negotiating with the  
Kremlin over posts in a new Cabinet. In a rambling speech before 
the cameras, however, he left subtlety behind, urging the Duma to 
end debate and unite against common foes -- NATO and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``World War III against Russia may start in June,'' shouted  
Zhirinovsky.

<HEADLINE> Hoops Star Transfers to Arizona </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WATERLOO, Ind. (AP) -- Luke Recker said Friday he will complete  
his college basketball eligibility at Arizona, where he hopes to 
follow the footsteps of Bison Dele and Chris Mills into the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	With his family, friends and former teachers at DeKalb High  
School looking on, Recker ended weeks of speculation and said he 
had chosen Arizona over Florida, Iowa, North Carolina and Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of the places would have been good for me, but my decision  
was Arizona was the best place for me,'' said Recker, who averaged 
16.2 points and 4.0 rebounds a game last season as a sophomore 
forward at Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Arizona fit his four criteria: He wanted a program with  
a chance for a national championship, where his skills would be 
used well, where he could use ``my passion and enthusiasm for the 
game,'' and where he could form a long-lasting relationship with 
the coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker specifically wanted a program in which he could develop  
into a shooting guard, the position he feels gives him the best 
shot at playing in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd be lying if I said the NBA is not a goal for me,'' Recker  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona coach Lute Olson said that goal was within reach.  
</P>
<P>
	``Luke is a kid who loves basketball. He has the size to play  
the three (position), but has the athleticism for the two-guard as 
well,'' Olson said in a news conference in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker will have to sit out next season to meet NCAA transfer  
requirements, leaving him two years of eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
	``He told us that he feels that a year of working on the  
strength will make a big difference for him. As with anyone, it 
will be difficult for him to have to sit out, but he has a positive 
attitude about it and feels this will help him accomplish what he 
has set out to do,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson said Recker had told him he liked Arizona's style of play  
and its success at grooming future NBA players, including Mills, 
Tom Tolbert and Dele, who was known as Brian Williams prior to the 
current NBA season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost every transfer we have had has gone on and played in  
the NBA,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Olson said he looked forward to having Recker's enthusiastic,  
hard-nosed playing style in practices, even though he cannot play 
next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``His presence in our program next year will make everyone even  
better. Even though he can't play, Luke will be very important in 
our team's progress. You can't believe what it does for a team to 
have a player like him involved in practice each day,'' Olson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's announcement came one month after Recker announced that  
he was leaving Indiana after two seasons to search for a program 
that he felt could better serve his development. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been satisfied with my development as a player. I  
blame no one but myself for this, and believe my development will 
best be served in another program,'' he said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker spoke favorably of all five programs he considered, and  
said his decision was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was up all night last night,'' he said during the news  
conference at the high school where he had earned Indiana Mr. 
Basketball honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Recker will be united at Arizona with this year's Indiana Mr.  
Basketball, point guard Jason Gardner, who led Indianapolis North 
Central to the Indiana state big-school championship.

	Firefighters broke through the side of the well about four hours  
after 17-month old Jesse fell in while playing in his back yard, 
Sedgwick County Fire Marshal Greg Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been very vocal, he's been talking to us and crying,''  
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 emergency workers worked under emergency flood lights  
as Jesse's parents, whose names were not released, talked to their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters dug a tunnel about 25 feet deep near the well and  
tunneled toward it to reach the child. Rescuers worked in 15-minute 
shifts, digging by hand toward the well and taking dirt out in 
5-gallon buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 neighbors joined television crews that were kept about  
a block from the scene in a recently built housing development in 
Mulvane, 20 miles south of Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were able to get a rope around his wrist, so he is  
somewhat secure,'' Mulvane Mayor Jim Ford told KSNW-TV. ``And he 
did help with the rope so that's telling us it's doing pretty 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The well is 20 to 25 feet deep and only 8 to 10 inches wide. The  
boy was outside with his father shortly before 7 p.m. when he fell 
16 feet and became stuck with one arm over his head, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers fed oxygen to Jesse through tubes lowered into the well  
to help the child breathe. Thompson said Jesse occasionally grabbed 
hold of a tube or tugged it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said the video showed the boy moving a little bit and  
crying. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency workers used lumber to shore up the well's sides to  
prevent rocks or dirt from falling on the child. Ford said he had 
talked to the child's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Needless to say, she's very distraught,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said the diggers were going to work slowly, but hoped  
to reach him by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what happened in Midland, Texas. It's a very similar  
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1987, 18-month-old Jessica McClure fell into an  
abandoned well in Midland and became trapped 22 feet down in a hole 
8 inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
	It took emergency crews 2 1/2 days to reach the little girl. They  
rescued her after digging a shaft parallel to the one that trapped 
her and then breaking through the wall of the well.

<HEADLINE> Thai Need for Finance Aid Wanes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Thailand might not have to withdraw the  
remaining $4.25 billion available under its $17.2 billion rescue 
program from the International Monetray Fund, a top finance 
ministry official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Ministry permanent secretary Suppachai Pisitvanich said  
that International Monetary Fund officials told him the Thai 
government has made progress in reviving the economy and can soon 
graduate from the program. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, he said he doesn't think Thailand will have to  
withdraw any more from the IMF program. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision rests with the central bank and Finance Minister  
Tarrin Nimmanahaeminda, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Thailand accepted the rescue program in August 1997, one month  
after the government abandoned its fixed foreign exchange system, 
triggering financial turmoil in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	The Thai government's most recent withdrawal was $490 million  
from the program in April, leaving $4.25 billion available. 
</P>
<P>
	The government now has other sources for its borrowing, such as  
Japan's Miyazawa regional aid fund and the World Bank's aid 
programs, Suppachai said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ministry is expected to conclude this round of IMF  
discussions next week.

<HEADLINE> Hercules' Star To Blast Into Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hercules is blasting into space.  
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Sorbo, star of TV's ``Hercules: The Legendary Journeys,''  
will trade mythology for a science fiction-action series based on 
the work of the late ``Star Trek'' creator Gene Roddenberry. 
</P>
<P>
	The new syndicated series, expected to debut in the fall of  
2000, is being developed by Roddenberry's widow, Majel Barrett 
Roddenberry, with Tribune Entertainment Co. and Sorbo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since my pre-teen days, I have been a fan of Mr. Roddenberry  
and the worlds he created in `Star Trek,''' Sorbo said. ``I guess 
you could say I'm trading the past for the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two Roddenberry projects are under development. Sorbo can choose  
which he wants to star in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene Roddenberrry's Andromeda'' is about a scientist on a  
distant planet who is inadvertently transported 500 years into the 
future. The other show, ``Gene Roddenberry's Starship,'' tells the 
adventures of an exploratory space vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorbo's ``Hercules'' will wrap its five-year run in December.

<HEADLINE> Gun Issue Tricky for GOP Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The abrupt shift on gun control by  
congressional Republicans underscores the difficulty facing GOP 
presidential candidates tackling the tricky issue in the wake of 
the Colorado school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, an old GOP ally, appeared to win  
a major victory Wednesday when the Senate rejected a Democratic 
measure requiring background checks of firearms sales at gun shows. 
The Senate passed a measure by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, to make 
the checks voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders retreated under pressure Thursday from  
rank-and-file Republicans, including presidential candidate John 
McCain of Arizona. He and several other senators said they were 
unhappy with Wednesday's vote, even though they had voted in favor 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a realization that there was a loophole that had to  
be closed,'' McCain said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 48-47 Friday to approve a measure establishing  
a system of background checks for all buyers of firearms at gun 
shows, overriding criticism from Democrats and the White House that 
new loopholes will give criminals access to firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an overly burdensome requirement in the face of  
the tragic shootings at Columbine,'' McCain said after the vote 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional change-of-course reflects a growing sentiment  
in Washington that voters want new limits on guns. Several party 
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said private polling 
conducted after last month's shooting at Columbine High School in 
Colorado reveals strong support for gun control, even among 
Republican primary voters. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a marked shift from the past.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of that polling has been conducted for Elizabeth Dole, the  
former American Red Cross leader who ranks second in most GOP 
presidential polls. In a series of high-profile announcements, Mrs. 
Dole opposed concealed-weapons laws and supported bans on assault 
weapons and armor-piercing bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advisers are betting that the issue will help her build a  
base of female voters and pull moderate Democrats into GOP 
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	An added bonus: The against-the-grain stances drew attention to  
her candidacy just as her campaign appeared stalled, aides say 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for Democrats and Republicans to put  
consensus before confrontation so we can get tough on crime,'' Mrs. 
Dole said Friday during a campaign swing through Iowa. That means 
``instant background checks should be required wherever guns are 
commercially sold,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to help the police fight crime,'' she said. ``I do not  
see a reason for a family to have an assault weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early GOP favorite, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is harder to  
pin down. 
</P>
<P>
	He expressed support for background checks in Texas, but did so  
only after a bill to that effect died in the state legislature. The 
governor later explained that he never endorsed the bill, which he 
said had many flaws, and urged Congress to address the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said Thursday that Bush would not have supported the  
Democratic gun show measure defeated in the Senate. Bush believes 
the bill would have imposed too many regulations and given too much 
power to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, spokesman 
David Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush favored the Craig proposal, though he would prefer the  
checks be mandatory, Beckwith said. Hours later, the GOP-led Senate 
reversed course and seemed to adopt Bush's position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it should be required that any vendor ... should have  
access to (the federal database) and required to use it,'' Beckwith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander, competing with Bush and Dole for moderate GOP  
voters, said shortly after the Colorado shooting that future 
massacres ``will not be stopped by more laws coming out of 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a subtle shift, the former Tennessee governor took no  
position on the bill Thursday but spokesman Steve Schmidt said, 
``Federal gun control legislation is something that Gov. Alexander 
is not opposed to, to keep guns out of the hands of people who 
shouldn't have them: Criminals, the insane and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative businessman Steve Forbes said he would have  
supported Craig's measure, but called it a ``quick fix'' and said 
the solution to mounting violence is ``reshaping our culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rest of the GOP candidates oppose any new  
restrictions on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle and conservative activist Gary  
Bauer said they support voluntary, not mandatory, background checks 
at gun shows. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire opposed even the 
Craig measure, and was among a small group of Republican senators 
who voted against an attempt to stiffen it on the floor on Friday.

<HEADLINE> GOP Angry Over Miranda Law Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration could take more  
dangerous criminals off the streets under a 31-year-old law that 
makes it easier for prosecutors to use voluntary confessions, 
Senate Republicans say. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the Clinton Justice Department has refused to use the  
law, which permits admission of confessions into evidence at trial, 
regardless of whether the suspects were read their ``Miranda'' 
rights, Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It makes absolutely no sense for the Clinton administration to  
not utilize (the law), especially when there is precedence for its 
use and the courts have found it to be constitutional,'' Thurmond 
said. ``America does not need its Justice Department making 
arguments on behalf of criminals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven presidential administrations, Republican and Democratic  
alike, have refused to enforce the law out of concern about its 
constitutionality. 
</P>
<P>
	The law, passed by Congress in 1968, says a suspect's confession  
can be used at trial as long as federal judges are sure the 
statement was given voluntarily, whether or not law enforcement 
officers recited the Miranda warning. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of Americans have seen movie and TV police officers  
tell suspects: ``You have the right to remain silent. Anything you 
say may be used against you in a court of law. You have the right 
to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, an attorney will be 
appointed for you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police nationwide have been giving such warnings before  
questioning criminal suspects in custody ever since the Supreme 
Court said they had to in a 1966 decision called Miranda vs. 
Arizona. Failure to do so often means a confession or incriminating 
remark made to police is inadmissible as evidence in court. 
</P>
<P>
	The disagreement is over whether Miranda warnings are  
constitutionally required or just one way to ensure that any 
incriminating statements are made voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics have said Miranda warnings discourage guilty suspects  
from confessing, make their prosecutions more difficult and 
increase the chance that their cases will be thrown out on 
``technicalities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In February, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals said the 1968 federal law trumped the Miranda decision 
and freed federal law enforcement officers from having to give the 
warnings in every case. 
</P>
<P>
	Confessions are key in many prosecutions, and prosecutors often  
are unable to win their cases without them, Stephen Markman, a 
former Reagan administration assistant attorney general, told the 
Senate Judiciary criminal justice oversight subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Confession is good for the soul, and it's also very good for  
law enforcement,'' Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., said. ``The cost of 
Miranda far exceeds its benefits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a written statement submitted to the subcommittee, the  
Justice Department said it believes the 4th Circuit's decision was 
incorrect, and the Supreme Court has never overruled the Miranda 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	The department has not decided what position it will take if the  
case makes it to the Supreme Court, said James Robinson, assistant 
attorney general for Justice's criminal division.

<HEADLINE> Former POW To Throw Out Pitch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A parade, belated birthday party -- and, now, the  
Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
	Army Spc. Steven Gonzales, one of three American soldiers held  
captive 32 days by Yugoslav authorities, is set to throw out the 
ceremonial first pitch at Sunday's game against the San Francisco 
Giants. 
</P>

Gonzales has inspired us all through his remarkable courage, 
bravery and steadfast patriotism through a difficult and 
challenging ordeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gonzales, who grew up in Palestine, returned to Texas May 7  
after Yugoslav authorities released the POWs. He has been spending 
some quiet time at his parents' home in Huntsville. 
</P>
<P>
	That city is planning a parade and a birthday party for Gonzales  
on May 22. The solider turned 22 while in captivity.

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury Calls Ex-Michigan Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A Michigan booster whose ties to the basketball  
team led to an NCAA investigation and the firing of coach Steve 
Fisher is the subject of a grand jury investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel has subpoenaed former Michigan basketball players,  
including NBA players Chris Webber, Robert Traylor, Louis Bullock 
and Maurice Taylor, the Detroit Free Press reported Friday, citing 
an unidentified person close to the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The grand jury is trying to determine if Ed Martin paid players  
and ran a gambling ring. The school banned Martin from having 
contact with athletes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	L. Fallasha Erwin, a lawyer and agent for Webber, now with the  
Sacramento Kings, was asked whether his client had been subpoenaed 
or interviewed by the FBI. He said only that Webber would 
cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to the FBI were not immediately returned, and the U.S.  
Attorney's office in Detroit had no comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was a target in a 1997 investigation that led to minor  
NCAA sanctions and Fisher's dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
	David Price, the NCAA's vice president for enforcement, told The  
Ann Arbor News the organization could pursue any new violations 
under the organization's four-year statute of limitations. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bill Saum, the NCAA's director of agent and gambling  
activities, said the NCAA will see how the investigation proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Wiretaps on Martin recorded conversations with several former  
stars, including Webber, Traylor, Bullock and Taylor, the Free 
Press reported, citing an unidentified person close to the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Those recordings provided the basis for search warrants executed  
last month on Martin's home, 10 other homes and an office, the 
source said. Authorities contend the raids netted roughly $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources told the Ann Arbor paper and The Detroit News that  
Martin, a retired Ford Motor Co. electrician, focused his operation 
at the Ford Rouge Complex in Dearborn. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the sources, gamblers would bet on the daily three-  
or four-digit numbers picked by the legal state lottery. But 
Martin's operation would give bettors higher odds for winning than 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Sources believe only one Ford plant, the Rouge complex, is  
involved. Eleven residences, one office and one safety deposit box 
were raided April 28 by the FBI and IRS agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents, according to federal court records, seized gambling  
materials at each home they raided. They also confiscated several 
loaded hand guns and more than $165,000 in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	The raid on Martin's home uncovered a copy of a Western Union  
transaction between Martin and Traylor, who left Michigan in 1998 
and now plays for the Milwaukee Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ann Arbor News reported that a computer check of records  
found Traylor's mailing address had been the same as Martin's home 
address while Traylor was playing for Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, Traylor and Martin's attorney could not be reached for  
comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players under scrutiny, the Free Press sources said,  
include Taylor, Traylor, Bullock and Jalen Rose of Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Traylor has denied accepting money from Martin, the Free Press  
said. Rose called the matter ``unnecessary drama, and I won't feed 
into that foolishness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When reached at his parents' Maryland home, Bullock said of the  
suspected payments to players: ``I didn't have anything to do with 
it.'' He said he had not been interviewed by federal agents or, 
apparently, been subpoenaed for the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	As for Martin, Bullock said: ``I never accepted anything from  
him. That's all you need to write. My parents are well off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Athletic director Tom Goss said this week the Wolverines have  
taken strong steps in the past two years to shield athletes from 
Martin.

<HEADLINE> Court Rules on Race, Border Stops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Border Patrol agents can consider ethnicity  
when they make traffic stops, a federal appeals court ruled in a 
case involving two Hispanic men who turned their cars around to 
avoid a checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling comes at a time when the use ethnic background as the  
basis for traffic stops is receiving increasing attention across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on  
Thursday upheld the detention of two Hispanic men stopped 50 miles 
inside the United States after they tried to avoid a highway 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it was appropriate that among the things the  
officers considered in making the stop was the fact the men turned 
around, and that they were Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the majority, visiting U.S. District Judge Frank C.  
Damrell of Fresno pointed to a Supreme Court decision in a 1975 
case, in which the court listed a number of things the police could 
consider in such an instance. 
</P>
<P>
	Among them were the character of the area; nearness to the  
border; traffic patterns; previous smuggling problems in the area, 
the officer's experience; and the behavior of the passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	After a motorist told authorities that two cars with Mexican  
plates turned around a mile from the checkpoint, they were stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents searched the cars of German Espinoza Montero-Camargo and  
Lorenzo Sanchez-Guillen and found two large bags of marijuana and a 
.32-caliber pistol. The men were charged.

<HEADLINE> Witness Shows Crack in 'Blue Wall' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- He's just one cop, sitting in one courtroom,  
testifying in one case. But Detective Eric Turetzky's testimony 
against fellow cops in the alleged torture of a Haitian immigrant 
signifies a crack in the so-called ``blue wall of silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing what all police officers should do, but it takes a  
great deal of courage to do it,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir 
said Thursday as Turetzky spent a second day on the stand in the 
explosive case. 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old Turetzky was an eyewitness to what federal  
prosecutors say was a brutal attack on Abner Louima in the bathroom 
of the 70th Precinct stationhouse two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Four police officers are accused of violating Louima's civil  
rights by beating and sexually brutalizing him following a brawl at 
a Brooklyn nightclub. The officers were allegedly upset that one 
had been punched in the melee. A fifth officer is accused of 
covering up the beating. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have used testimony by Turetzky in a bid to bolster  
Louima's claim that Officer Charles Schwarz held him down on the 
bathroom floor while Officer Justin Volpe rammed a broken broom 
handle into his rectum. 
</P>
<P>
	Louima, who is black, suffered a ruptured colon and bladder. The  
case sent shockwaves through the city and strained already 
difficult relations between police and New York City's minority 
community. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have tried to portray Turetzky as an  
opportunist, pointing out that the former patrolman was promoted to 
detective for cooperating with the investigation into the case. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point Thursday, defense attorney Stephen Worth asked  
Turetzky: ``Do you consider yourself a hero cop who's broken the 
`blue wall of silence?''' 
</P>
<P>
	``No, sir,'' Turetzky said, later adding, ``I came forward to  
say what happened. ... It was my duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not every police officer shares that sentiment. Often, critics  
say, officers refuse to testify against other cops -- the ``blue 
wall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, everyone is Sgt. Schultz from `Hogan's Heroes' -- `I  
know nothing, I saw nothing,''' said lawyer Ron Kuby, a frequent 
police critic. ``Those not willing to actually come forward and lie 
in defense of their brutal brethren usually suffer memory 
failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turetzky had his memory challenged Thursday. The officer was  
confronted with evidence that he changed key parts of his story 
about the night of Aug. 9, 1997, when police arrested Louima. 
</P>
<P>
	He also admitted threatening to kick a pregnant woman in the  
stomach for refusing to leave the scene. But he did it with 
composure, sitting straight and addressing combative defense 
attorneys as ``sir.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas Reppetto, head of the watchdog Citizens Crime Commission,  
suggested that the ``blue wall'' was never as absolute as some 
suggest. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have always been officers willing to speak up,''  
Reppetto said, harking back to Frank Serpico's landmark testimony 
before the Knapp Commission. ``Perhaps there have not been as many 
as there should have been.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Serpico was a plainclothes officer who was labeled a traitor by  
many of his colleagues in the 1970s for turning in crooked cops. 
His story was turned into a best-selling book and a hit movie, both 
called ``Serpico.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two decades later, he surfaced at the Mollen Commission's police  
corruption probe and criticized the department. After 20 years, he 
said, few bricks were missing from the ``wall of silence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mollen Commission had no Serpico-esque do-gooders -- just  
cops who publicly implicated their fellow crooks. Kuby said a lack 
of police cooperation is often responsible for crooked cops going 
free. 
</P>
<P>
	``Almost every police case that has failed has failed in large  
part because the blue wall has held,'' Kuby said, citing the 1983 
slaying of graffiti artist Michael Stewart as a perfect example. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Jeb Bush Signs Child Abuse Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Six months after the beating death of a  
6-year-old girl, Gov. Jeb Bush on Friday signed a law intended to 
plug holes in the state's child abuse investigation system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kayla McKean Child Protection Act addresses many of the  
problems that allowed the girl's repeated abuse by her father to go 
undetected by state investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will make us much more vigilant in the effort of protecting  
children,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires the Florida Department of Children &AMP; Families  
to contact law enforcement officials and work with them when child 
abuse is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency also must assign a single caseworker to each  
investigation and caseworkers must maintain a master file 
containing all reports of abuse. The agency also must investigate 
any suspicions of child abuse reported by judges, teachers or 
school officials. Judges will be bound by law to report suspected 
abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	There must be face-to-face interviews with the child, siblings  
and parents during all investigations, under the new law. Any adult 
who fails to report abuse or neglect taking place in his or her 
household can be charged with a third-degree felony, punishable by 
five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot to me,'' said Kayla's mother, Elisabeth McKean,  
who attended the signing ceremony. ``It means Kayla's death wasn't 
senseless. It means that other kids will be protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kayla's father, Richard Adams, 24, is charged with murder and  
allegedly confessed to beating her after she soiled her underwear 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Children and Families came under scrutiny and  
the agency has conceded that its investigators and caseworkers 
missed repeated signs that Kayla was being abused.

<HEADLINE> `Hero Cop' in Louima Case Attacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The detective who prosecutors say shattered a  
police code of silence in the alleged bathroom torture of a 
prisoner denied Thursday that he talked to save himself and gain 
glory. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you consider yourself a hero cop who's broken the `blue  
wall of silence'?'' defense attorney Stephen Worth asked Detective 
Eric Turetzky during cross-examination at the brutality trial of 
five fellow officers. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, sir,'' Turetzky said, adding later, ``I came forward to  
say what happened. ... It was my duty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four police officers are accused of beating Abner Louima  
following a brawl at a Brooklyn nightclub. Two of the officers are 
accused of using a broom handle to sodomize Louima, a Haitian 
immigrant, in a precinct bathroom. A fifth officer is charged with 
covering up the beating. 
</P>
<P>
	The brutal nature of the allegations shocked many and has  
strained relations between police and minorities. The accused 
officers are white; Louima is black. 
</P>
<P>
	A multimillion-dollar lawsuit filed on Louima's behalf alleges  
rogue cops were shielded by the ``blue wall of silence'' -- a 
supposed code among some officers never to turn each other in. 
</P>
<P>
	Turetzky, 28, was accused by the defense of changing key parts  
of his story about the August 1997 night Louima was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony, Louima said Officer Justin Volpe mistakenly  
thought he had punched him outside a nightclub the night of his 
arrest. He said Volpe later rammed a wooden stick into his rectum 
and mouth while Officer Charles Schwarz held him down on the 
precinct's bathroom floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz and three other officers are charged with taking turns  
beating Louima. Volpe and Schwarz are additionally charged with the 
bathroom attack. A fifth officer, Michael Bellomo, is charged with 
covering up the assault. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Turetzky testified seeing Schwarz lead a  
handcuffed Louima, whose pants were at his ankles, toward the 
bathroom. He said he later spotted Volpe marching Louima away from 
an area outside the bathroom, holding what appeared to be a broken 
broom handle. 
</P>
<P>
	After putting the prisoner in a holding pen, a disheveled and  
sullen Volpe ``was swinging the stick around like a sword and 
hitting it against the wall,'' the detective said. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, Volpe's attorney, Marvyn Kornberg, produced a  
transcript of a departmental investigation interview in which 
Turetzky indicated Schwarz -- who denies ever being in the bathroom 
-- or Wiese may have brought the prisoner out. 
</P>
<P>
	In the interview, Turetzky said, ``Like I said before, I wasn't  
sure who removed the defendant from the bathroom, but I distinctly 
remember Officer Volpe standing there with a stick.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turetzky conceded in cross-examination that he came forward only  
after the case was making headlines, Volpe was in custody, 
superiors were being transferred and departmental investigators 
were scheduling involuntary interviews with all 70th Precinct 
officers on duty that night. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't it true that you were scared to death about what would  
happen to you?'' Worth asked the detective, who received a 
promotion after cooperating with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``No, sir,'' he replied.

<HEADLINE> US Won't Cut Yugoslavia Web Access </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said today it will  
not try to limit Internet access for some of Yugoslavia's citizens 
under its trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Full and open access to the Internet can only help the Serbian  
people know the ugly truth about the atrocities and crimes against 
humanity being perpetrated in Kosovo by the Milosevic regime,'' 
State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Loral Space and Communications Ltd. of New York said Thursday  
that it might be forced to cut transmissions into Yugoslavia from 
one of its satellites, which serves at least two of the country's 
major Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton issued an executive order two weeks ago  
banning U.S. companies from selling or supplying to Yugoslavia 
``any goods, software, technology or services,'' although the order 
allows for the ``special consideration of the humanitarian needs of 
refugees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Security Council said earlier that information  
services are generally considered exempt from trade embargoes, but 
that electronic commerce is affected. The Internet performs both 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rubin said today there was ``no truth to allegations that we  
are attempting to cut off the flow of information to Serbia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The Serbian people deserve to access independent and objective  
information, whether by the Internet or other media,'' Rubin said. 
``We encourage the people of Serbia to use the Internet and other 
open media to challenge the misinformation they are receiving from 
the Milosevic press within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Loral Space said today it was discussing its obligations under  
the embargo with the Treasury Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts said any move by the United States to limit civilian use  
of the Internet would be unprecedented. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has already attacked Serbian broadcast stations to stem  
what it describes as propaganda, and Serbs have established an 
extraordinary network on the Internet criticizing NATO airstrikes. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Internet also serves as a conduit for civilians to  
receive unadulterated news reports about NATO efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet remains at this point one of the major sources  
inside Yugoslavia for objective news reporting about the war,'' 
said Jim Dempsey of the Washington-based Center for Democracy and 
Technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Word of the threat to shut down Internet access to at least  
parts of Yugoslavia spread quickly across the global network, where 
it was condemned in some e-mail messages and online discussion 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``To put it bluntly, we somehow got used to air-raid sirens,  
bombings and threats of invasion, but we don't know how we're going 
to survive without the Internet,'' said Alex Krstanovic, cofounder 
of Beonet, one of the Internet providers in Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	But some argued that access should be cut off.  
</P>
<P>
	``Continuing to provide these services would be kind of like  
giving aid to the enemy,'' one person wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The possible loss of Internet access also illustrated the  
fragility of the computer network and the importance assigned to it 
internationally. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer traffic in Yugoslavia uses both satellite and  
traditional land-based telephone lines, but the loss of the Loral 
satellite could dramatically reduce the Internet bandwidth 
available to citizens there, causing slow connections or even 
blackouts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Runners Can't Come to U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The closing of the U.S. Embassy in China will  
force five Chinese runners to miss three races in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the May 22 New York 10K Mini Marathon, the May 23  
Rock 'n' Roll Marathon in San Diego and the May 31 Bolder Boulder 
10K race at Boulder, Colo., said their expected Chinese runners 
will not compete because they cannot get visas from the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're all impacted by it,'' Anne Roberts, elite athlete  
coordinator for the New York race, said Friday. ``The embassy is 
locked up like a drum. Nobody's getting in and nobody's getting 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The embassy has been shut since May 8, when NATO bombed China's  
embassy in Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York and Boulder races will each lose the same three  
runners and the San Diego race will lose two others. 
</P>
<P>
	Missing from New York and Boulder will be Zhao Shengzhi, Wang  
Yanrong and Lu Jing. All three have run the 10K (6.2 miles) under 
33 minutes, led by Wang's 32 minutes, 31 seconds. This would have 
been their first time in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest loss will be at Boulder, since the Chinese women won  
the team title last year in their first appearance in the race. Lu 
also was a member of that team, 
</P>
<P>
	``They would have been a great asset to the field,'' race  
director Cliff Bosley said. ``There will be 15 foreign countries 
among the women. They would have been the 16th.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Absent from San Diego will be Wang Yanfang, a 2:29:17  
marathoner, and Zhang Shujing, with a best of 2:35:16, both at the 
1997 Beijing Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed,'' elite athlete coordinator Mike Long  
said. ``We would have liked to have had them.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with prices falling in Tokyo and Hong Kong but surging in 
Kuala Lumpur and Taipei. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at  
16,810.39 points, down 40.86 points, or 0.24 percent from Thursday. 
On Thursday, the index lost 96.11 points, or 0.57 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices initially rose in reaction to record gains on Wall  
Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average rose 106.82 points 
to close at 11,107.19, breezing past the previous closing record of 
11,031.59, posted May 7. 
</P>
<P>
	But players grew cautious about pushing prices higher before a  
series of closely watched earnings reports for the last fiscal 
year, ending in March, which are expected in coming weeks, traders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Institutional investors start selling each time the Nikkei  
average nears 17,000,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy general 
manager of the equity department at Daiwa Securities SB Capital 
Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.18 yen late Friday,  
up 0.60 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New 
York level of 121.85 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Hong Kong slumped Friday after two straight  
sessions of advances. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, fell 198.15 points, or 1.5 percent, closing at 
12,855.52. On Thursday, the index had gained 40.7 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said share prices fell as investors took profits  
following recent sharp gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``As the index rose to 13,000 points, the atmosphere has turned  
cautious,'' said James So, head of sales at Asia Financial 
(Securities) Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysian share prices soared on hopes that Malaysia will be  
reinstated into the closely-watched Morgan Stanley Capital 
International Indexes, or MSCI, dealers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange's Composite Index, which tracks  
100 key stocks, rose 4.5 percent, or 33.29 points, to close at 
766.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley is expected to announce changes Monday to the  
components of its index, which is widely watched by fund managers 
in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Malaysia is in the index, we can expect money from the U.S.  
to enter the local bourse,'' said an institutional dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices in Taiwan also closed sharply higher, fueled by  
gains in U.S. stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Taipei market's key Weighted Stock Price Index rose 176.33  
points, or 2.37 percent, to 7,592.53. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Share prices closed sharply higher as the Indonesia  
government signed a new letter of intent with the International 
Monetary Fund, paving the way for the release of around U.S. dlr 1 
billion in loans from the IMF's bailout package. The Composite 
Index rose 15.130 points, or 2.6 percent, to 591.634. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed sharply higher,  
spurred on by broad demand for local blue-chip stocks, brokers 
said. The benchmark NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 32.17 points or 1.5 
percent, to 2,251.32. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower on fears of a possible  
rise in key U.S. interest rates next week, traders said. The 
30-company Philippine Stock Exchange Index fell 19.26 points, or 
0.8 percent, to 2,502.75. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices closed generally higher, after  
the country's major banks and other blue-chip industrial stocks 
helped to boost the market indicator. The All Ordinaries Index rose 
25.4 points, or 0.8 percent, to 3,055.0. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices closed lower on concerns about rising  
interest rates. The Korea Composite Stock Price Index fell 4.54 
points, or 0.6 percent, to 737.83. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Share prices closed higher, with the benchmark index  
gaining on the back of selective buying of index linked stocks. The 
Straits Times Index rose 14.45 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,883.28.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Miami's Tim Hardaway was fined $5,000 by the NBA  
today for failing to leave the court in a timely fashion and 
verbally abusing the officials following his ejection from Game 3 
of the Heat's playoff series against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was automatically ejected after incurring two technical  
fouls during the Heat's 97-73 loss, which gave the Knicks a 2-1 
lead in the best-of-5 series. Game 4 is tonight at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, bothered by a sore right knee, has been disappointing  
in the series, shooting less than 19 percent from the field in the 
first three games and averaging only 7.3 points. He has made only 
one of 14 3-point field goals, and is averaging 4.0 turnovers.

<HEADLINE> eBay, SkyTel in Online Auction Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- SkyTel and eBay Inc. have announced plans  
to establish a wireless person-to-person online auction service. 
</P>
<P>
	The service is to begin in July and will allow eBay users to  
receive auction updates and participate in auctions via wireless 
devices such as pagers, cell phones and personal digital systems. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the beginning of what I think will be a series of  
electronic commerce-oriented killer applications,'' said J.C. 
Bradford analyst Bob Bolen of Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson-based SkyTel also will have the ability to send auction  
notices to eBay users who already own wireless devices with 
Internet e-mail addresses, including cell phones and personal 
digital assistants. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Wesley, vice president of marketing and business  
development for the San Jose, Calif.,-based eBay, said in a 
statement that the company's customers ``often tell us they would 
like to follow eBay away from the home or the office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``SkyTel will make it possible for eBay users to get the very  
latest information on the items they are bidding on and selling 
when they are running errands, doing the shopping or driving the 
kids to school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SkyTel provides wireless messaging services. The company had  
1998 revenues of $518.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
	EBay operates a 24-hour Web service which lists items such as  
collectibles, computers, memorabilia and stamps. The company had 
1998 revenues of $47.4 million.

<HEADLINE> Mother, 3 Kids Found Dead in Tenn. </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A woman who suffered hallucinations and  
thought everyone was out to get her killed her three children with 
a shotgun before taking her own life. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of the children, ages 4, 5 and 7, were found on a bed  
Thursday evening. Their mother, 28-year-old Tonya Avery, lay dead 
on the floor nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Avery left a suicide note telling Danny Patterson, her  
boyfriend and father of the two girls, ``that she and the children 
loved him,'' police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The note gave no reason for the killings, but police said  
investigators were told Ms. Avery had ``exhibited recent signs of 
paranoia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She just started seeing and hearing things and everything, and  
thought that everybody was against her and thought that she was 
going to die,'' said Albert Davis, Ms. Avery's father. ``I just 
never thought it would come to this.''

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Seeks To Stop US West Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. asked federal regulators Friday not  
to let local Bell telephone company U S West Inc. provide 
long-distance service to customers in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
	State regulators recently agreed to remove local calling  
boundaries within the state, which would free U S West to offer 
long-distance service within the state but not across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal regulations, local phone companies that carry  
telephone service across those local calling boundaries are, 
technically, offering long-distance service. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West said it is gearing up to offer long-distance service  
within Arizona but has set no specific date to start. 
</P>
<P>
	In a filing to the Federal Communications Commission, however,  
AT&AMP;T contends that U S West first must open its local phone market 
to competitors and obtain approval from the commission before 
providing instate long-distance service. U S West disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``AT&AMP;T is running to regulators to block benefits of added  
competition that would come to Arizona consumers,'' said U S West 
spokesman David Beigie. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T, citing a 1997 FCC Common Carrier Bureau order, argues that  
a 1996 telecommunications law gives the FCC exclusive authority to 
set local calling boundaries. Arizona regulators, AT&AMP;T said, 
overstepped their authority with a decision to set one statewide 
local calling area.

<HEADLINE> Ban Approved on Calif. Paint Toxins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DIAMOND BAR, Calif. (AP) -- Regulators in Southern California  
approved new rules today that will force manufacturers to spend 
hundreds of millions of dollars to develop new paint formulas to 
eliminate tons of polluting fumes. 
</P>
<P>
	South Coast Air Quality Management District board members  
adopted the regulations over vociferous opposition from 
manufacturers, who said the requirements are too strict and could 
force smaller manufacturers out of business. The new rules cover 
several counties in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters believe the rules for paint, wood stains and other  
coatings could influence paint makers across the nation in the same 
way that California laws forced auto makers and gasoline refiners 
to follow stricter guidelines to reduce emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is truly a historic moment in the longterm battle for  
clean air,'' said Barry Wallerstein, the district's executive 
director. ``As technology advances and good products become 
available, there isn't any reason for other areas of the country 
not to use them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents said the new rules not only will cost too much but are  
counterproductive. Home and business owners will have to paint more 
frequently because new paints won't have the same durability under 
the hot California sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are faced with a rule that would essentially ban all the  
products we manufacture,'' said Jerry Mulnix, president and general 
manager of Cal Western Paints, a specialty paintmaker based in 
Santa Fe Springs, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	After Friday's vote, representatives of El Rap, a paint industry  
association formed to fight the new rules, said they would consider 
legal action and other options to prevent the law from taking 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The happiest people are regulators who still have not proven  
anything'' about the harm caused by paint vapors, said Ken 
Khachigian, an attorney representing the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulations are designed to reduce ``volatile organic  
compounds,'' vapors released from paint as it dries. Such compounds 
typically are found in highest quantities in glossy, oil-based 
paints used to cover bridges, storage tanks and other outdoor 
structures. In homes, such paints are often used to paint exterior 
doors, bathrooms and kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	Water-based paints used for most home interiors usually are low  
in volatile compounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Air quality officials estimate that paint fumes are responsible  
for putting 58 tons of pollutants into the air during the spring 
and summer, when outdoor painting is heaviest. By 2010, the amount 
is expected to climb to 63 tons. 
</P>
<P>
	That's more than the amount of pollution produced by 1.8 million  
automobiles or all petroleum refining, storage and transfer 
activity in the region, according to management district figures. 
The new law would remove 22 tons of paint pollutants from the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The management district has estimated it will cost the paint  
industry about $800 million to meet the new standards. Industry 
officials figure it will cost them much more. To be fully 
compliant, they said, manufacturers would have to replace 7,000 
separate formulas, each at a cost of about $250,000, said Ray 
Robinson, a member of El Rap. 
</P>
<P>
	The rules would begin to take effect in 2002. The phase-in would  
be complete by 2006. But the regulations call for continuing 
assessment of technology that, by the air quality district's 
admission, is not fully developed. 
</P>
<P>
	That concerned Madelyn K. Harding, product compliance  
administrator for Sherwin Williams, the big paint manufacturer 
based in Cleveland, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
	``We consider these regulations to require numerous  
technological breakthroughs that are not predictable,'' she told 
the board before it voted. 
</P>
<P>
	Some manufacturers supported the law. A representative of  
Dunn-Edwards Paint Corp., a Los Angeles-based manufacturer that 
sells in Southwestern states, said manufacturers must accept 
responsibility for developing cleaner paints. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rule is costly to the paint industry in the short term,  
but we'll be able to meet the requirements and provide quality 
coatings to our customers,'' said Edward Edwards, part-owner of the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller manufacturers also complained about an aspect of the  
rules that allows averaging -- giving a business an overall 
pollution quota. Big producers, such as Dunn-Edwards, could avoid 
reformulating high-polluting paints because it's pollutant average 
would be offset by big-volume sales of low-polluting water-based 
paints. 
</P>
<P>
	Smaller shops that specialize in making oil-based paints for  
industrial use will be at a competitive disadvantage, said Cal 
Western's Mulnix. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be the deadliest proposal here today for small  
manufacturers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Third-Graders Save Classmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE VILLAGE, Ind. (AP) -- Two third-graders who ignored their  
classmates' cries to wait for an adult are being hailed as heroes 
for saving a 9-year-old from accidentally hanging himself on a 
flagpole rope at their school. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Mahone was unconscious when Kasey Perkins and Tommy  
Richardson lifted the rope from around his neck, saving him from 
choking to death. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son is alive because of those two little boys,'' said Sam's  
mother, Catherine Mahone. ``They're tiny heroes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Mahone said her son told her he was ``goofing around'' with  
the rope during a Tuesday recess at Lake Village Elementary School 
in the small town of Lake Village, about 50 miles southeast of 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The second-grader told her he remembered putting the rope around  
his neck before becoming unable to breathe. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he saw a bright light, then everything went black,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasey, 10, and Tommy, 9, were playing soccer when they saw Sam  
hanging by the rope from a flagpole, which was attached to a nearby 
scoreboard. The boy was blue and foaming at the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	Ignoring their classmates' cries to wait for an adult, Kasey  
lifted Sam while Tommy undid the rope. 
</P>
<P>
	``My son knew enough to not move him after he was down,'' said  
Tiffany Perkins, Kasey's mother. ``We watch a lot of the 911 TV 
shows, and they learn a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sam was rushed to a hospital and was released on Wednesday. The  
boy is ``doing well,'' Mrs. Mahone said, but he has a red ring 
around his neck and broken capillaries around his eyes and ears. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mahones gave each boy a stuffed animal as a reward, and the  
school plans to recognize the boys with a merit award. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're proud the boys had the foresight to do something  
immediately,'' said Steve Sharp, the school's principal. ``They 
were scared, but they did a heroic deed.''

<HEADLINE> Actor Fighting Navajo Court Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Navajo Supreme Court has ruled against Sioux  
actor and activist Russell Means in a case that could define the 
power of tribal courts across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled it had criminal jurisdiction over all Indians on  
the Navajo Reservation, regardless of their tribal affiliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every tribe is going to take a careful look at this,'' said  
Robert Williams, professor of law and American Indian studies at 
the University of Arizona. ``The stakes are very big.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Means, a member of the Oglala Sioux Nation, was charged in a  
Navajo court in December 1997 with threatening and beating his 
father-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
	The former American Indian Movement leader, who led a 1973  
uprising at Wounded Knee, S.D., had lived on and off the Navajo 
Reservation for 10 years with his former wife, who is Navajo. 
</P>
<P>
	Means challenged a 1991 law passed by Congress authorizing  
tribal courts to try Indians who are not members of their tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 ruling Tuesday, the Navajo Supreme Court cited a 1977  
U.S. Supreme Court decision that defined ``Indian'' as a political 
rather than a racial category. 
</P>
<P>
	The law discriminates against Indians not belonging to the  
ruling tribe, said Means, who has appeared in such films as 
``Natural Born Killers'' and ``The Last of the Mohicans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't any rights on any reservation in America except my  
own, so I want to be treated like any other American,'' Means said 
Thursday from his home in Santa Fe, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	Means, 59, has vowed to fight the Navajo, the nation's largest  
tribe, all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Non-Indians on reservations are already clearly not subject to  
tribal courts (under the 1991 law),'' said his lawyer, John Trebon. 
``Why would tribal courts have criminal jurisdiction (in this 
case)? The only difference being race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case has drawn the attention of legal experts and Indian  
officials throughout the country. Oral arguments were heard in 
February at Harvard Law School. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said removing tribal jurisdiction over all Indians on  
reservations could pose significant problems. At some reservations, 
up to half the residents are not members of the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Means emerged as a leader in the two-month standoff  
that followed AIM's takeover of Wounded Knee. The group was 
protesting reservation conditions and the federally backed tribal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Shootouts left two protesters dead and a federal marshal  
paralyzed.

<HEADLINE> Nairobi Renovations Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- These are rare sights for Nairobi  
residents: tractors plowing new roads, construction workers 
painting buildings, gardeners planting trees and flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Such scenes have become familiar in recent weeks, all part of a  
$59.7 million rehabilitation project that officials say has been on 
the table for some time. 
</P>
<P>
	But many in this bustling but badly atrophying East African  
capital are skeptical of the timing of the repairs, which come just 
as political and business leaders from all over central and 
southern Africa stream into Nairobi for a regional trade summit. 
</P>
<P>
	The improvements, critics say, are more of a quickie facelift  
for the benefit of visiting dignitaries than a substantive 
renovation for the city's residents or its future. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's insulting! They won't do it for us, but they'll do it for  
them,'' Linda Mukherjee, 42, a Nairobi housewife, said in the 
health spa locker room of the swank Serena Nairobi Hotel. ``It's a 
joke.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Work began downtown last month and has continued at a pace  
residents find hard to believe in a city where mammoth potholes, 
busted traffic lights, rock-dirt sidewalks and a sporadic power 
supply are the norm. 
</P>
<P>
	But government officials say the much-needed improvements were  
already planned and just got bumped up because of the Common Market 
for Eastern and Southern Africa meeting, which opened Thursday and 
is scheduled to run through May 25. 
</P>
<P>
	Seventeen African heads of state are expected to attend the  
COMESA meeting, as well as hundreds of other public officials and 
businesspeople. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is an impression being created that we are spending four  
billion Kenya shillings for COMESA, while this is not true,'' 
Minister of Local Government Sam Ongeri said on the private Kenya 
Television Network this week. ``It so happens that COMESA is coming 
when these improvements are taking place and we are taking 
advantage of this situation to speed up the beautification 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Evidence of the improvements were everywhere this week, with  
workers furiously plowing away rubble and planting trees and 
flowers along the city's main thoroughfares. 
</P>
<P>
	They also were busy at the Kenya International Conference  
Center. The center, which is owned by President Daniel arap Moi's 
ruling KANU Party, has fallen -- like much of the city -- into a 
state of dire disrepair in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	On a recent business day, repairmen painted new lines at a  
jammed traffic circle at the entrance to downtown, blocking one 
lane on a road many already consider a deathtrap because of its 
poor condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The lines trailed off just outside the traffic circle heading  
away from downtown -- leading to areas COMESA delegates are less 
likely to travel. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nairobi City Council's idea of roads are only those to be  
used by the COMESA delegates,'' a cartoon in the private East 
African Standard newspaper said this week. 
</P>
<P>
	The 21-nation COMESA was created in 1993 with the goals of  
achieving regional free trade areas by 2000, common tariffs by 2004 
and monetary union by 2025. 
</P>
<P>
	Ongeri said the repairs are being funded by private donors and  
will benefit the entire city, not just the square-mile area that 
makes up downtown Nairobi. But the remote industrial areas -- and 
the even more distant slums where the majority of Nairobi residents 
live -- have not seen any attention so far. 
</P>
<P>
	Nairobi officials have refused to disclose who is funding the  
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	But one city council official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said that because of the makeover council members won't 
be receiving their salaries on time this month and were planning to 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil servants in Kenya often don't get paid on time, and  
government promises to fight corruption have not been kept. All of 
that stokes Kenyans' skepticism about the repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	So while the government here views the COMESA conference and the  
trade show that comes with it as a chance to spruce up the city, 
many residents believe it will only create more headaches -- 
particularly for Nairobi's poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Police haven't disclosed their public transportation plan for  
next week, when the conference kicks into high gear, but residents 
expect city buses and ``matatus'' -- the jammed and decrepit 
minibuses that ferry Kenyans around Nairobi -- to be banned from 
downtown, as is typical during major events.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Hopkins Official Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A former Johns Hopkins University administrator  
has admitted he failed to pay taxes on nearly $350,000 he got from 
an alleged billing fraud and kickback scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Schuerholz pleaded guilty Thursday to a count of tax  
evasion, saying failed to pay $97,962 in federal income taxes from 
1992 to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge set sentencing for Sept. 3.  
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors will seek a jail sentence of 15 to 18 months  
for Schuerholz, who was fired from Hopkins in 1997 after 
allegations of kickbacks surfaced in a lawsuit involving a 
university contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	The maximum penalty is five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.  
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz also must pay back taxes and penalties on the amount  
he failed to report, said Domenic J. LaPonzina, spokesman for the 
Internal Revenue Service in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Schuerholz had the sole authority to award  
contracts up to $500,000. He set up bogus bank accounts in the 
names of two shell companies, according to court papers. 
</P>
<P>
	The documents show a series of transactions between Hopkins and  
Elco Electric Inc., an electrical contractor headed by Schuerholz's 
cousin, Donald. 
</P>
<P>
	After the university paid Elco, Schuerholz asked Donald to write  
checks to the shell companies and provided bogus invoices to cover 
the payments, court papers show. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuerholz's attorney, James P. Ulwick, acknowledged his client  
failed to report money he received from Elco. But Ulwick disagreed 
with the government's characterization of ``kickbacks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There's another side to this,'' he said. ``I hope it will come  
out at sentencing.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Sink; Dow Down 152.63 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today after the government's  
report of a steep rise in consumer prices intensified worries about 
inflation and sent bond prices sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
down 152.63 at 10,954.56. Broader stock indicators were lower as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow had climbed 106.82 to close at 11,107.19, a  
new record. 
</P>
<P>
	The selloff in stocks was sparked by the Labor Department's  
announcement that consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in April, the 
largest monthly gain in nearly nine years. The report was 
especially jarring following Thursday's producer-price report, 
which suggested inflation was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CPI is usually not out of line with that number,'' Barry  
Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``This 
was a surprise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report led to a drop of more than two points in the price of  
the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, pushing yields to 5.92 
percent, the highest level in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is perfectly comfortable as long as bond  
yields are below 6 percent,'' said Hyman. ``But as the yield is 
nearing 6 percent, it won't be so comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fears of inflation revived concerns that the Federal Reserve  
will at least consider an interest rate hike when its Open Market 
Committee meets next Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond news pushed stocks of banking and financial companies  
lower. Chase Manhattan fell 4 to 80 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Merrill Lynch fell 5 3/8 to 80 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
	IBM, which contributed to Thursday's new Dow record with a  
stunning 20-point gain, slipped 5 5/8 to 240 3/8, as investors locked in 
their gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was off 24.10 at 1,343.46, and  
the Nasdaq composite index was down 31.06 at 2,550.94. Nas 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 11-to-3 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 359 million 
shares, ahead of Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was down 11.08 at 640.27, and the  
American Stock Exchange composite index was down 9.46 at 790.93.

<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Professional boxer Dezi Ford was convicted  
of involuntary manslaughter in the beating death of his toddler 
son, and was sentenced today to eight years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stark County Common Pleas Court jury, which began  
deliberations late Thursday, could have convicted Ford of murder. 
The sentence was imposed by Judge John Haas. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the 30-year-old lightweight caused massive  
internal injuries to his son, Zontius, as he playfully boxed with 
the 14-month-old last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford initially admitted to police that he killed his son  
accidentally, but on the witness stand Thursday recanted statements 
he made to officers. He said he shadowboxed with the boy but never 
connected. 
</P>
<P>
	The baby's mother, Alvina Harris, 33, testified that she had  
left the baby in Ford's care while she went to shop. When she 
returned, she found the baby's eyes rolled back and his tongue 
flailing.

<HEADLINE> NHL's Blues-Stars Series Is Even / Hockey Game Story  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Proving again that nothing in the regular season  
matters when the NHL playoffs begin, the fifth-seeded St. Louis 
Blues and the top-seeded Dallas Stars are deadlocked in a series 
that is far more even than anyone predicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stars, who finished the season with a league-best 114 points  
to the Blues' 87, suddenly find themselves with a tough assignment 
heading into Saturday's Game 5 in Dallas -- if they want to 
recapture the momentum from the Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blues took a two-game deficit in the best-of-7 series back  
to their home ice, and surprised Dallas by taking two straight 
overtime games by scores of 3-2. Overtime has been good to the 
Blues, who are 4-2 through 11 playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Winning in overtime gives us a great feeling,'' winger Geoff  
Courtnall said. ``When games are that close all the way through, 
and you get a big goal at the end, it lifts the room and lifts all 
the guys and gives the guy who scores a lot of confidence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Confidence that may carry the series to a full seven games,  
Stars coach Ken Hitchcock thinks. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got two good teams going at it. We knew that going  
in,'' Hitchcock said. ``I just don't see anything different the 
next three games. I think it's going to come down to the wire, and 
hopefully our home ice is an advantage for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blues coach Joel Quenneville is similarly modest-yet-optimistic.  
``It's been a heck of a run so far,'' he said. ``We think we have a 
chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchcock, a master of turning a molehill opponent into a  
mountainous enemy with his rhetoric, may not have been exaggerating 
when he said St. Louis was going to be a very tough matchup. 
</P>
<P>
	The tied series should be less of a surprise because -- rankings  
aside -- the numbers are very similar for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Both squads' power plays are looking futile: Dallas is 1-for-21,  
while St. Louis is 2-for-21. That's a credit to the Stars' penalty 
killing, because the Blues had the best power play in the first 
round. Keeping Al MacInnis' atomic shot from the point a non-factor 
is a big reason why. 
</P>
<P>
	Both teams are getting points from all over the lineup, not just  
from the expected big guns. St. Louis sniper Pierre Turgeon has 
four goals and 11 points and Dallas' Joe Nieuwendyk has five goals 
and eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	From the lower-paid side of the rosters, consider Blues rookie  
Jochen Hecht's two goals in the last two games or Dallas grinder 
Mike Keane's two goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Where they are not even is in expectations. The pressure is  
squarely on the Stars, who can only be marked failures if they 
don't make the Stanley Cup finals. The Stars said they are not 
exactly shaking in fear of the persistent Blues. 
</P>
<P>
	``This team has dealt with adversity all year,'' defenseman  
Richard Matvichuk said. ``With the experience we have, there no 
doubt in my mind we're going to bounce back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few things should help their planned rebound.  
</P>
<P>
	Faceoff master Guy Carbonneau is due back Saturday, as is  
defenseman Shawn Chambers. Both have been out with knee injuries. 
It will be the first time Carbonneau has played in this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get a guy like Guy Carbonneau back in your lineup,  
it's nothing but good,'' Matvichuk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Stars have not lost at home yet. If the series goes to  
seven games, they will play there for two of the three remaining 
games.

	CANNES, France (AP) -- There may be grumbling about the quality  
of some films at Cannes, but no one will ever complain about the 
festival's ability to throw a good dinner party. 
</P>
<P>
	The banquet for 600 guests following the opening film, ``The  
Barber of Siberia,'' was an extravagant tribute to the movie's 
Russian origins. 
</P>
<P>
	Once guests could make their way past the photographers begging  
Claudia Schiffer to keep posing -- ``One more, Claudia, PLEASE!!'' -- 
they entered a huge tent on the beach and were handed a perfectly 
chilled flute of champagne. 
</P>
<P>
	They dined on blinis with caviar (the chef needed 50 pounds of  
the stuff); lobster (he needed 600 of them) and ombrine cuite (a 
fish dish). For dessert, a sublime creme brulee and, with coffee, 
tiny raspberry tarts. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the generously flowing wines, each guest had a vodka  
glass, promptly refilled all evening. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those enjoying the meal were jury members Holly Hunter and  
Jeff Goldblum, as well as Jeremy Irons and Faye Dunaway. 
</P>
<P>
	The next day, even the trade papers raved about the food. If  
only the film itself had garnered the same raves. (It didn't come 
close.) 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Guillaume Depardieu, son of the prolific French star  
Gerard Depardieu, was forced to blush at the news conference for 
his film, ``Pola X.'' In the movie, the young Depardieu has what 
they call a ``non-simulated'' sex scene. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's director, Leo Carax, said it wasn't difficult to film  
such a realistic tableau. 
</P>
<P>
	Easy for him to say, his actor countered.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was difficult ... to be on form, if you know what I mean,''  
he said diplomatically. 
</P>
<P>
	Could such scenes be turning into a trend? One of the most  
talked-about items at last year's festival was a similarly 
``non-simulated'' sex scene -- actually, an orgy -- in the respected 
director Lars von Trier's ``The Idiots.'' It evoked a gasp even 
from the most jaded spectators. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking of von Trier, Fine Line Pictures has just paid an  
estimated $5 million for the U.S. rights to his next film, ``Dancer 
in the Dark,'' an English-language musical starring the Icelandic 
singer Bjork and the French perennial favorite, Catherine Deneuve. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Trier, a reclusive Dane, won the 1996 Golden Palm at Cannes  
for ``Breaking the Waves.'' Last year's ``The Idiots,'' about a 
group of young people trying to get in touch with their ``inner 
idiots,'' was less successful. 
</P>
<P>
	Bjork is to play a Czech immigrant who works in a factory but  
dreams of a life in classic Hollywood musicals. In the dream 
numbers, according to the Hollywood Reporter, she will be joined by 
co-workers in the factory, including Deneuve. (Deneuve as a factory 
worker?) 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Everybody gets something different out of Cannes. Take Peri  
Gilpin, the American TV actress from ``Frasier.'' She's getting ... 
decorating tips. 
</P>
<P>
	On this glitzy, overpriced strip of the Riviera?  
</P>
<P>
	Well, Gilpin says, she's about to get married and she's thinking  
about decorating a lot. And landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love the mixture of Roman pines and palms,'' she said. ``My  
fiance and I were jumping with glee. All the shutters, and the 
details. You just want to copy everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gilpin is in town for a more serious reason: she's participating  
in Cure by the Shore -- a fundraiser to fight cancer -- organized by 
Lily Tartikoff, widow of the late TV executive Brandon Tartikoff.

</P>
<P>
	BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) -- Ricardo Gangeme, a prominent  
Argentine journalist, died Thursday after being shot in the head in 
the Southern city of Trelew. He was 56. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangeme was editor of El Informador Chubutense and former editor  
of the Buenos Aires daily Cronica. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangeme's wallet was left untouched and robbery did not appear  
to be a motive, police said. Colleagues reported that Gangeme, a 
crusading crime-fighting journalist, recently had received threats. 
</P>
<P>
	Jorge E. Fascetto, president of the Inter American Press  
Association, told a local radio station that hundreds of 
journalists have been killed worldwide through the years, with few 
cases getting solved. 
</P>
<P>
	Gangeme was the first journalist killed in Argentina since the  
January 1997 slaying of Jose Luis Cabezas, a photojournalist for 
the newsweekly Noticias, whose killing remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Colombia and Brazil have recently led the list of journalists  
slain in Latin America.

</P>
<P>
	SIDNEY, Neb. (AP) -- Jack Lowe, a former publisher of the Sidney  
Telegraph, died Friday at age 90. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowe began working at the newspaper while in high school and  
continued his association with the paper throughout his life. He 
rose to editor of the Telegraph and was a co-owner and co-publisher 
from 1950-1971. He continued to write a column for the paper after 
his retirement until shortly before his death. 
</P>
<P>
	He was honored by the Nebraska Press Association with its Master  
Editor and Publisher Award. He was inducted into the Nebraska 
Newspaper Hall of Fame in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Known affectionately in western Nebraska as ``Mr. Sidney,'' Lowe  
was mayor of Sidney from 1952-1954 and served three times as 
interim city manager in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	He was the first executive director of Panhandle Growth Inc.  
from 1973 to 1978 and then served as the first president of the 
shortline Sidney &AMP; Lowe Railroad until its construction was 
completed in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, daughter and son-in-law.

<P>
                            *Leon Thomas    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Thomas, a jazz singer known for his  
wordless yodeling style, died May 8 of heart failure as a result of 
leukemia. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas developed the technique -- which he later called  
``soularphone'' -- in the late 1960s when he performed with musician 
Pharoah Sanders. His throat articulation was compared to African 
pygmy and American Indian singing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Sanders, Thomas helped develop ``kosmigroov,'' a type  
of spiritual African-tinged soul-jazz exemplified in recordings 
like ``The Creator Has a Master Plan'' (1969) and 
``Hum-Allah-Hum-Allah-Hum Allah'' (1970). 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Illinois, Thomas moved to New York in 1958 and worked as  
a straight blues-jazz singer. By the mid-1960s he was performing 
with Count Basie and Mary Lou Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in his career he recorded albums for the Flying Dutchman  
label, and spent two years with the band Santana. In recent years, 
he often sang at the Lenox Lounge in Harlem. 

</P>
<P>
                            *Karl Yoneda    	
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Karl Yoneda, a Japanese-American  
longshoreman who was vilified for his marriage to a white woman, 
died Sunday at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in the United States but educated in Japan, Yoneda opposed  
Japan's rising militarism and dodged being drafted into the 
Imperial Japanese Army by returning to America in 1926. 
</P>
<P>
	He adopted the name Karl, after Karl Marx.  
</P>
<P>
	In 1931, while taking part in an unemployment demonstration, he  
was beaten and thrown into a Los Angeles jail. Elaine Black, then 
secretary of the Community International Labor Defense Committee, 
bailed him out. 
</P>
<P>
	The two began living together -- they could not legally  
intermarry in California. Dubbed ``Tiger woman'' by the Hearst 
papers and revered as the ``Red Angel'' by her admirers, she later 
married Yoneda. Their lifelong partnership ended only when she died 
at age 81 a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Yoneda later became a longshoreman, his wife an office worker.  
Both continued their activism, opposing the Vietnam War and the 
neutron bomb and joining in the ``Free Angela Davis'' campaign.

<HEADLINE> Congress Drops Gondola Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress has decided not to provide $40  
million in compensation for last year's accident in which a U.S. 
Marine jet killed 20 skiers in an Italian cable car, a move an 
Italian official derided as ``another insupportable slight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate and House negotiators dropped the provision this week  
from a wide-ranging package financing the air campaign against 
Yugoslavia, aid to hurricane-ravaged Central America and other 
items. It had been approved in March by the Senate, but ran into 
opposition in the House and from the Defense Department. In 
addition to the now-canceled congressionally mandated compensation, 
the United States is paying other money to the Italian government 
to help the victims' families 
</P>
<P>
	The decision angered officials in Italy, where the accident  
prompted calls for the expulsion of U.S. forces from bases in 
Italy. The bases are now used for the airstrikes on Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have made fools of us for the second time,'' Italian  
Justice Minister Oliviero Diliberto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Referring to Italy's belief that the crew of the Marine jet had  
been given overly lenient sentences, Diliberto said, ``It's another 
insupportable slight to the ... victims of a slaughter that still, 
today, one year later, hasn't found justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberta Synal, the Washington spokeswoman for families of the  
seven German victims of the accident, said that while Congress is 
spending billions of dollars to protect Kosovars in Yugoslavia, 
``For some strange reason they don't find it necessary to support 
the human rights of the families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Feb. 3, 1998, a Marine Corps EA-6B Prowler jet on a training  
mission in the Italian Alps sliced the gondola cable, sending the 
20 skiers on an eight-second, 370-foot plunge to their deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	The jet's pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby was acquitted of 20 counts  
of involuntary manslaughter for the deaths of the passengers aboard 
the Mount Cermis gondola cable, though he was later sentenced to 
six months in prison and dismissed from the corps for helping 
destroy a videotape of the flight. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional provision had been sponsored by Sen. Chuck  
Robb, D-Va., a former Marine who since last summer has been trying 
to persuade the Pentagon to compensate the families. Pentagon 
officials have said they support compensating the families, but 
under a treaty that requires such matters to be pursued in Italy's 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Robb's provision, up to $2 million would have been paid  
for the family of each victim. The House did not approve that 
provision. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has said the United States would make amends  
for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rome, the U.S. Information Service issued a statement saying  
``The United States reaffirms its commitment to provide 
compensation for the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bill for direct U.S. payments to the victims that was just  
rejected by Congress does not in any way reduce or alter the 
commitment of the United States to fulfill its commitment to 
provide compensation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the NATO treaty, the United States will reimburse Italy  
for 75 percent of whatever it decides to pay families who file 
claims, the USIS said. Italy has already given the families 
$55,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States has reimbursed Italy for 75 percent of that,  
and the Defense Department has funds available now to pay ``any 
additional requests for reimbursements,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal that lost out in Congress would have provided  
immediate compensation to the victims' families instead of waiting 
for Italian courts to act first.

<HEADLINE> Child Rescued From Well in Kansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MULVANE, Kan. (AP) -- A toddler who fell 16 feet into a narrow  
well Thursday night was pulled free five hours later by 
firefighters who dug a tunnel to rescue him. He survived with 
``just some bumps and some scrapes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 17-month-old Jessy was brought out to cheers and applause  
from rescue workers shortly before midnight as his family waited 
above. Strapped to a backboard and wearing a neck brace, he was 
taken away in an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
	Wichita firefighter Tim Deneen, who pulled the boy out, said he  
was dirty but looked all right. 
</P>
<P>
	``He didn't cry until I moved him. Then he let go,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	During the rescue, the boy talked to rescuers and his parents  
from deep inside the well, which was only 8 to 10 inches wide and 
25 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessy's mother was ``calming him ... telling him that she loves  
him,'' Sedgwick County Fire Marshal Greg Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deneen said he kept telling the boy, ``hang in there, we'll have  
you out in just a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under emergency flood lights, about 50 emergency workers dug a  
trench about 25 feet deep alongside the well. They worked in 
15-minute shifts, digging by hand toward the well and taking dirt 
out in 5-gallon buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 neighbors joined television crews about a block from  
the scene at a new housing development in Mulvane, 20 miles south 
of Wichita. The scene was reminiscent of another toddler rescue in 
Texas more than 11 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers fed oxygen to Jessy through tubes lowered into the  
well, and warm air was pumped in to keep him from getting too cold. 
Thompson said the ground temperature was about 65 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	A video camera lowered into the well showed the boy's arm was  
pinned above his head, but that he was moving and crying and 
appeared to be unhurt. The boy was secured with a rope, which he 
tugged on during the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessy's parents, whose names were not released, saw their son  
briefly before he was taken to a medical helicopter. Kasey Baker, 
spokeswoman at Wesley Medical Center in Wichita, said Jessy would 
spend the night there. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jessy is in good condition. Just some bumps and some  
scrapes,'' she said. ``They're observing him overnight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The well in his backyard had been dug recently and had not been  
finished. Jessy's father was in the yard with him when the little 
boy slipped into the well shortly before 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency workers used lumber to shore up the well's sides to  
prevent rocks or dirt from falling on the child. 
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said the diggers worked slowly to make sure the walls  
didn't cave it on the child. He said it was a similar situation to 
when a child fell into a well in Midland, Texas, about 11 1/2 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1987, 18-month-old Jessica McClure fell into an  
abandoned well in Midland and became trapped 22 feet down in a hole 
8 inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
	It took emergency crews 2 1/2 days to reach the little girl. They  
rescued her after digging a shaft parallel to the one that trapped 
her and then breaking through the wall of the well.

<HEADLINE> Disney Nixes Violent Video Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Walt Disney Co. is pulling the plug on violent video arcade  
games at Disneyland and Walt Disney World in response to the school 
massacre in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty games were to be removed by a vendor, Disneyland said  
Friday, and violent games were also being taken out of two 
Disney-owned hotels. The Anaheim, Calif., park did not provide a 
list of titles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Orlando, Fla., staff members at Walt Disney World have been  
removing violent games over the past two weeks, spokeswoman Diane 
Ledder said. They were evaluating the content of games at all four 
theme parks, Downtown Disney and 16 hotels. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy distinguishes between games in which humans are  
targets and those that are simple accuracy contests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't think there's any place for violent video games  
at Disneyland,'' park spokesman Ray Gomez said. ``This has probably 
been under consideration for a while, but the events in April 
brought it to the forefront of our thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, two teen-agers at Columbine High in Littleton,  
Colo., shot and killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before 
committing suicide.

<HEADLINE> CDC Says Driving Is Safer Now </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Even though there are now about 215 million  
vehicles on the roads, cruising down the highway today is far safer 
than it was during the early part of the century, according to 
statistics on traffic deaths. 
</P>
<P>
	Safety measures such as seat belts, bumpers and the yellow  
center line have contributed to a 90 percent drop in U.S. motor 
vehicle deaths per miles traveled since 1925, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sum of those is what has helped to reduce the motor  
vehicle fatality rate -- things that we really take for granted,'' 
said Dr. Bruce Jones of the CDC's National Center for Injury 
Prevention and Control. 
</P>
<P>
	Rigid steering wheels have been replaced by more  
energy-absorbent ones. Shatterproof windshields and seat belts have 
become the norm, as have cushioned dashboards. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were cars with dashboards made from hard material with  
edges and knobs and stuff sticking out that aren't there any more 
because it was hazardous,'' Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	The result has been a drop in deaths from 18 per 100 million  
vehicle miles traveled in 1925 to 1.7 in 1997, the CDC said. At the 
same time, total miles driven has increased tenfold, and there are 
11 times as many vehicles on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	The vehicle safety report was part of the CDC's series on this  
century's greatest achievements in public health. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes came about as part of the National Safety Act,  
passed in 1966 after vehicle fatalities had risen for five straight 
years. The legislation paved the way for the National Highway 
Traffic Safety Administration. It was the first time the government 
established federal regulations for automobiles and roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon narrow, unmarked roads from the days of the Model T became  
well-lit thoroughfares with painted lines, concrete barriers and 
guardrails. And child safety seats and motorcycle helmets 
eventually became required by law. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 11 percent of drivers and passengers wore seat belts in the  
early 1980s. Now, about 68 percent of drivers wear them. 
</P>
<P>
	Approximately 40,000 people are killed in the United States each  
year in auto crashes, which remain the leading cause of death among 
people ages 1 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite all the successes we've had, this is still a leading  
major public health problem,'' Jones said.

<HEADLINE> Heat's Tim Hardaway Is Fined $5,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Miami's Tim Hardaway was fined $5,000 by the NBA  
today for failing to leave the court in a timely fashion and 
verbally abusing the officials following his ejection from Game 3 
of the Heat's playoff series against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway was automatically ejected after incurring two technical  
fouls during the Heat's 97-73 loss, which gave the Knicks a 2-1 
lead in the best-of-5 series. Game 4 is tonight at Madison Square 
Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway, bothered by a sore right knee, has been disappointing  
in the series, shooting less than 19 percent from the field in the 
first three games and averaging only 7.3 points. He has made only 
one of 14 3-point field goals, and is averaging 4.0 turnovers.

<HEADLINE> Jeb Bush Signs Child Abuse Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Six months after the beating death of a  
6-year-old girl, Gov. Jeb Bush has signed a law intended to plug 
holes in Florida's child abuse investigation system. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kayla McKean Child Protection Act addresses many of the  
problems that allowed the girl's repeated abuse by her father to go 
undetected by state investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will make us much more vigilant in the effort of protecting  
children,'' Bush said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires the Florida Department of Children &AMP; Families  
to contact law enforcement officials and work with them when child 
abuse is suspected. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency must assign a single caseworker to each investigation  
and caseworkers must maintain a file containing all reports of 
abuse. The agency also must investigate any suspicions of child 
abuse reported by judges, teachers or school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	There must be face-to-face interviews with the child, siblings  
and parents during investigations under the new law. Any adult who 
fails to report abuse or neglect in his or her household can be 
charged with a felony, punishable by five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot to me,'' said Kayla's mother, Elisabeth McKean,  
who attended the signing ceremony. ``It means Kayla's death wasn't 
senseless. It means that other kids will be protected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kayla's father, Richard Adams, 24, is charged with murder and  
allegedly confessed to beating her after she soiled her underwear 
last year.

<HEADLINE> Child Stuck in Well in Kansas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MULVANE, Kan. (AP) -- A toddler fell more than 15 feet into a  
narrow well Thursday night and firefighters dug a tunnel to rescue 
the boy, who appeared to be in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters broke through the side of the well about four hours  
after 17-month old Jesse fell in while playing in his back yard, 
Sedgwick County Fire Marshal Greg Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been very vocal, he's been talking to us and crying,''  
Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	About 50 emergency workers worked under emergency flood lights  
as Jesse's parents, whose names were not released, talked to their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters dug a tunnel about 25 feet deep near the well and  
tunneled toward it to reach the child. Rescuers worked in 15-minute 
shifts, digging by hand toward the well and taking dirt out in 
5-gallon buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 neighbors joined television crews that were kept about  
a block from the scene in a recently built housing development in 
Mulvane, 20 miles south of Wichita. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were able to get a rope around his wrist, so he is  
somewhat secure,'' Mulvane Mayor Jim Ford told KSNW-TV. ``And he 
did help with the rope so that's telling us it's doing pretty 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The well is 20 to 25 feet deep and only 8 to 10 inches wide. The  
boy was outside with his father shortly before 7 p.m. when he fell 
16 feet and became stuck with one arm over his head, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers fed oxygen to Jesse through tubes lowered into the well  
to help the child breathe. Thompson said Jesse occasionally grabbed 
hold of a tube or tugged it. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford said the video showed the boy moving a little bit and  
crying. 
</P>
<P>
	Emergency workers used lumber to shore up the well's sides to  
prevent rocks or dirt from falling on the child. Ford said he had 
talked to the child's mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``Needless to say, she's very distraught,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Thompson said the diggers were going to work slowly, but hoped  
to reach him by midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know what happened in Midland, Texas. It's a very similar  
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1987, 18-month-old Jessica McClure fell into an  
abandoned well in Midland and became trapped 22 feet down in a hole 
8 inches wide. 
</P>
<P>
	It took emergency crews 2 1/2 days to reach the little girl. They  
rescued her after digging a shaft parallel to the one that trapped 
her and then breaking through the wall of the well.

<HEADLINE> Adidas Plans To Open More Stores </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAVERTON, Ore. (AP) -- Adidas America is looking for possible  
locations for high-profile stores in major U.S. cities despite a 
slowdown in sneaker sales growth this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas is scouting in New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Miami, San  
Francisco, Los Angeles and Seattle and hopes to begin work soon on 
new stores in at least two of those cities. It hasn't signed leases 
for any location. 
</P>
<P>
	The new retail shops will adopt a format similar to the  
5,000-square-foot store Adidas opened in Portland two years ago. 
``The stores will follow that template,'' said Adidas spokesman 
John Fread. 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas already operates 38 outlet stores, which are intended  
primarily to sell off excess inventory at a discount. It has been 
considering a move into higher-end retailing for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas' move comes as many retailers are battling sluggish  
consumer demand for athletic footwear and apparel. 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas anticipates sales growth in 1999 to be less than 10  
percent, down from the 68 percent surge last year when its North 
American revenues topped $1.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Fread said the stores will allow the company to test products,  
signage and merchandising techniques with a variety of customers. 
It will in turn pass on effective ideas to its retail customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``When things become more challenging, you need to do business  
better,'' Fread said. ``This is an investment in how to do 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adidas America is the Beaverton-based subsidiary of German  
athletics giant Adidas AG. The parent company owns the Salomon 
brand of ski and snowboard gear and the Taylor Made brand of golf 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Its rival Nike Inc., the best-selling sneaker marketer, already  
has 13 NikeTown stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't even say that word,'' Adidas spokesman John Fread  
said when asked about NikeTown.

<HEADLINE> 2nd Dragging Death Trial Moved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The trial of the second defendant in the dragging  
death of a black man was ordered moved Friday from Jasper to the 
city of Bryan, 140 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge in the case previously decided to move the trial out  
of Jasper at the request both the defense and the prosecution. The 
defense argued that people in Jasper, where the crime took place, 
may be inclined to convict the defendant to salvage the town's 
image. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury selection will begin in early August for the trial of  
Lawrence Russell Brewer, with opening statements set for Aug. 30. 
Bryan is a city of 60,000 in Brazos County, about 80 miles 
northwest of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Brewer, 32, is one of three white men arrested in the June 7  
slaying of James Byrd Jr. The 49-year-old black man was chained to 
a pickup truck and dragged to pieces in a crime that shocked the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	The first man to be tried, 24-year-old John William King, was  
convicted and sentenced to death in Jasper earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The third man, Shawn Allen Berry, will be tried later.

<HEADLINE> MacArthur Returns in Movie Biography </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- What a difference a uniform makes.  
</P>
<P>
	Even now, decades later, few would fail to recognize that  
austere figure in officer's cap and sunglasses, with the corncob 
pipe jutting from his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	But how many would recognize the mild-looking fellow with  
thinning, neatly combed hair, frolicking in the garden with his 
little son? 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides of Gen. Douglas MacArthur -- American war hero and  
loving family man -- emerge in vivid close-up in ``MacArthur,'' an 
enthralling and wonderfully straightforward biography from producer 
Austin Hoyt. It airs Monday and Tuesday, May 17 and 18, at 9 p.m. 
EDT (check local listings) in the PBS ``The American Experience'' 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	``MacArthur'' offers no startling revelations, nor does it need  
to. Like an ancient Greek drama, this is a tale to be handed down 
through the generations. The opening line of the narration says it 
all: ``In the theater of war he was producer, director and star. 
But brilliant military victories were shadowed by crushing personal 
defeats.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Facing the Japanese in the Philippines in World War II,  
MacArthur presided over the worst defeat in American military 
history. Three years later, he would orchestrate Japan's surrender 
aboard the battleship Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	For his role in quelling the Bonus March on Washington by  
impoverished World War I veterans during the Depression, he became 
a symbol of oppressive authoritarianism. Yet as a military 
occupier, his foresight and magnanimity helped create today's 
peaceful, democratic Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	When the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, MacArthur was  
heard to say, ``Men like me are obsolete. ... There will be no more 
wars.'' Yet five years later, at the age of 70, he masterminded the 
Inchon landings, the highly risky amphibious invasion that reversed 
the course of the Korean War. 
</P>
<P>
	And still the wild ride wasn't over. In April 1951, after a  
series of clashes with President Harry S. Truman over the conduct 
of the Korean War, MacArthur was fired. He came home a hero with 
presidential ambitions. But that high office would go to his former 
clerk, an equally gifted but less disputatious soldier, Dwight D. 
Eisenhower. 
</P>
<P>
	``Old soldiers never die,'' MacArthur declared in his memorable  
farewell speech to Congress, ``they just fade away.'' And fade away 
he did, dying in 1964, age 84, just as Vietnam was becoming 
America's next great war. 
</P>
<P>
	The film shows the general as a deeply human figure: vain,  
publicity-hungry, given to flights of lyrical oratory. (As 
superintendent of West Point, he encouraged cadets to write 
poetry.) After his first marriage failed, he set up house with 
Isabel Rosario Cooper, aka ``Dimples,'' his half-Filipino mistress, 
in Washington D.C., coolly ignoring the racial hang-ups of the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	His second marriage, to Jean Faircloth, 20 years his junior,  
lasted 27 years until his death in 1964. They had one son, Arthur, 
who would become a musician. 
</P>
<P>
	The seeds of MacArthur's greatness, and his downfall, probably  
were planted in his boyhood on a U.S. Army base in New Mexico. It 
was there, historian Geoffrey Perret surmises, that young MacArthur 
absorbed the idea that ``it is the military that pushes the 
frontier back, and the civilians come afterward.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father, Arthur MacArthur, was a Civil War hero who felt  
cheated of his due by know-nothing politicians and transmitted that 
grudge to Douglas. Disdain for superiors, especially civilian ones, 
would become a recurring theme of MacArthur's life, culminating in 
his clash with Truman. MacArthur saw no substitute for total 
victory in Korea, even if that meant full-scale war with China. 
Truman wanted to limit the war lest it escalate into World War III. 
</P>
<P>
	Where might MacArthur find an American military hero today? The  
Gulf? Yugoslavia? He might have to settle for Scott Ritter, the 
Marine major who resigned last year as a U.N. weapons inspector in 
Iraq, protesting that the U.S. government was thwarting his 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchanges eerily reminiscent of the past, a Republican  
senator called Ritter a hero, while a Democrat said he should leave 
the big decisions to the politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	In the MacArthur-Truman struggle of wills, the public sided  
overwhelmingly with MacArthur. Yet ultimately, history would be 
kinder to Truman, viewing the man from Missouri as having defended 
a hallowed principle: that the elected government, not the brass, 
makes policy. 
</P>
<P>
	How will future generations view the debate over Iraq? Or  
Kosovo, or anywhere else where politicians must weigh military 
action against the diplomatic realities of the day? ``MacArthur'' 
steers clear of preaching lessons for the 1990s. It leaves viewers 
to draw their own lessons from this remarkable American life.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Raises Funds in Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Less than a week after complaining about too  
much violence coming out of Hollywood, President Clinton will 
attend a Hollywood fund-raiser this weekend to generate at least $2 
million for congressional Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	The fund-raiser, whose hosts will be DreamWorks partners Steven  
Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen, follows a grueling 
week in Washington for the entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood is in the middle of an often-partisan debate over how  
to respond -- and who to blame -- for last month's high school 
massacre in Littleton, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's attendance points to the influence the entertainment  
industry enjoys in politics and its deep pockets come election 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most politicians might feel a little bit peculiar about  
sucking up fund-raising dollars from the same people who blew them 
off a few days earlier, but Bill Clinton is not most politicians,'' 
said Republican commentator Dan Schnur. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the president met with entertainment industry  
lobbyists, clergy, children, parents and gun manufacturers, though 
executives from the film and music business declined to attend. 
Clinton challenged the makers of violent movies, video games and 
CDs to consider the potential consequences of their products. 
</P>
<P>
	At a fund-raising luncheon Friday in Seattle, Clinton did not  
single out the entertainment industry for responsibility. Still, he 
said, there was inconclusive proof that violence in entertainment 
affected children who were already vulnerable and anti-social. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 300 studies now which show that hours and hours and  
hours a week after years and years and years of watching sustained 
indiscriminate violence makes young people less sensitive to 
violence and to its consequences.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andy Spahn, political adviser to the DreamWorks partners, said  
he sees nothing unusual about the president issuing the challenge 
to Hollywood one day, and accepting campaign money from it the 
next. He added that scheduling conflicts prevented the DreamWorks 
officials from attending the Washington meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has taken a very balanced and constructive  
approach in the aftermath of Littleton,'' Spahn said. ``What we're 
not happy with is the scapegoating that comes from some of the 
Republican leaders in the House and Senate and frankly from members 
of the media. Attempting to blame or connect Hollywood to the 
violence of Littleton is absurd.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, he said, the ``fundamental bottom line issue is access  
to guns.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was shameful that the United States Congress failed to take  
action to limit access to guns. That is the height of hypocrisy,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Senate Republicans did pass new restrictions on gun  
show sales, but Clinton said the provision was ``riddled with 
high-caliber loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was much agreement in the Senate on proposals directed at  
the entertainment industry. The Senate overwhelmingly approved a $2 
million federal study on the effects of entertainment products on 
young people, and authorized a federal investigation into movie 
studio marketing practices. 
</P>
<P>
	Political analyst Sherri Bebitch Jeffe of Claremont Graduate  
University noted that Hollywood has a long history supporting the 
president, and that it continues now to back Democrats in part 
because ``there is not yet on the scene a viable alternative in the 
Republican Party.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Money is the mother's milk of politics,'' she said. ``It's as  
simple as that. It's the system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1996 election, Clinton received $442,000 from TV and  
movie executives and their families, compared with $166,000 for 
Republican challenger Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Entertainment figures also generously donated to Clinton's legal  
defense fund during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Among those giving 
$10,000 were rock singer Don Henley, TV producer Paul Simms and 
former studio mogul Lew Wasserman. Actor Robert De Niro gave 
$5,000. 
</P>
<P>
	This is in addition to millions of dollars in ``soft-money''  
donations the industry has made to the Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will perform at the Saturday night  
dinner at a hilltop Beverly Hills mansion. The event is expected to 
draw about 125 entertainment industry figures, including Meg Ryan, 
Dennis Quaid, Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, Whoopi Goldberg and Ed 
Burns. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets cost from $25,000 to $100,000 per couple and the money  
will go to Democratic candidates for the House and Senate in the 
next elections. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt and Senate 
Democratic leader Tom Daschle will also attend.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Foes Work on Tax Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- No longer bitter foes over impeachment, Reps.  
Lindsey Graham and Robert Wexler are working together on a tax 
relief bill they say could help ease lingering partisan tensions. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last year in this Congress has been tough. It's been  
bitter,'' Graham, R-S.C., said Thursday. ``I'm glad to be part of 
something constructive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graham was one of the House managers who unsuccessfully urged  
the Senate to remove President Clinton from office after the House 
had approved two articles of impeachment related to the president's 
affair with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Wexler, D-Fla., was an outspoken member of the Judiciary  
Committee who accused the GOP of blind partisanship in pursuing the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite those differences, Wexler and Graham said they did  
manage to get acquainted during the impeachment proceedings and 
decided they had common goals of pushing for middle-class tax 
relief this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am hopeful this kind of bipartisan spirit will prevail,''  
Wexler said. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months since the Senate acquitted Clinton, Wexler and  
Graham announced they will sponsor the House version of legislation 
originally developed by Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Sen. 
Paul Coverdell, R-Ga. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure gradually would expand the lowest 15 percent income  
tax bracket to include more people, exempt the first $5,000 in 
long-term capital gains from taxes by 2004, raise the limit on IRA 
contributions from $2,000 to $3,000, and exempt the first $500 in a 
couple's dividend and interest income from taxes, $250 for singles.

	``It had previously been my view that nothing good came out of  
the impeachment proceedings,'' Torricelli told reporters. ``There 
is a chance to resurrect something good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the impeachment trial, the House managers were unable to  
persuade senators to approve live witness testimony, but Torricelli 
told Graham things were different on this tax bill.

	Republican budget resolutions adopted by the House and Senate  
envision almost $800 billion in tax relief over the next decade. 
Committees with tax jurisdiction are already looking at options; 
the bipartisan bill would cost roughly $134 billion over five 
years, sponsors said.

<HEADLINE> Andrews Denies Tabloid Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) -- Julie Andrews is denying a tabloid  
report that she was treated for drug dependency, saying she 
received care to help her cope with grief related to throat surgery 
and the death of an aunt. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Andrews, 63, recently checked in at the Sierra Tucson  
facility in Arizona for ``guidance and management of emotional 
issues related to grief,'' her lawyers said a statement Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I identified emotional issues surrounding my grief that made  
me wish to take action sooner rather than later,'' Ms. Andrews 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The May 25 issue of The Globe reports she was treated for drug  
dependency, the statement said. Representatives for the tabloid did 
not return calls seeking comment after business hours Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyers, Peter Parcher and Orin Snyder, said the singer and  
actress ``does not have, and never has had, a drug or alcohol 
dependency problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Andrews has been unable to sing since she underwent a  
procedure to remove noncancerous throat nodules two years ago. She 
starred in Broadway's ``My Fair Lady,'' and ``Victor/Victoria,'' 
and in such film classics as ``The Sound of Music'' and ``Mary 
Poppins.''

<HEADLINE> Jockey Diaz OK After Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANHASSET, N.Y. (AP) -- Jockey Vladimir Diaz was in stable  
condition Friday, a day after being badly hurt when his mount broke 
down during a race at Belmont Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz had a fractured right hip, a broken collarbone and seven  
broken ribs, according to a spokeswoman at North Shore University 
Hospital. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Blazers Await Jazz or Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers have a few days  
to rest -- and to keep tabs on the Sacramento-Utah series. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a remarkable week for the Blazers, who went from  
underachievers to undefeated in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last Friday, the Blazers were in a sour mood after losing  
four of their last five regular-season games, including a 
momentum-crushing 28-point blowout against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, on the eve of Game 1 of their first-round series  
against Phoenix, the Blazers impatiently answered questions about 
whether they could regain their stride against the surging Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers emphatically erased those doubts with a 3-0 sweep,  
completed with Wednesday night's 103-93 comeback victory in 
Phoenix. Portland ended a six-year string of first-round exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a really good feeling,'' said forward Brian Grant, who  
like other Blazers played in his first winning playoff series. 
``Walt Williams and I may have been jumping around extra hard on 
the sidelines because we were in Sacramento together. We've both 
been down some rough roads. Now, to make it to the second round -- 
we're not saying it's like a championship or anything, but it's 
just a big relief to make it to the second round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant recovered from a painful bone bruise in his left knee to  
have a terrific series: He averaged 19.3 points and 9.3 rebounds 
and made 71.9 percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	After a physical, emotionally draining Game 3, the Blazers  
arrived back in Portland on Thursday and took the rest of the day 
off. They were scheduled to practice today, but a hot topic surely 
will be the stunning collapse of the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's improbable 84-81 overtime loss in Sacramento on Wednesday  
night gave the Blazers hope for opening the second round at the 
Rose Garden. Should the Jazz lose the series, Portland would have 
homecourt advantage against the Kings, who were 0-4 against the 
Blazers this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Isaiah Rider was listed as day to day on Thursday  
after spraining his right knee in the third quarter Wednesday. 
Rider was said to be walking fine, however, and indicated he would 
be ready for the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider was hurt when he dove for a loose ball and the Suns' Tom  
Gugliotta fell into his right knee. Rider came back and, although 
he contributed little on the court, urged his teammates on loudly 
and waved a towel from the sideline. After the game, he even 
compared himself to Willis Reed and his famed hobbling entrance for 
the New York Knicks in the 1970 finals. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers came very close to losing their cool several times  
during the game. 
</P>
<P>
	When Rider was fouled hard by Danny Manning late in the second  
quarter, he briefly confronted Manning, but then walked away. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, however, left the bench area to defend Rider, an act  
that usually carries an automatic one-game suspension. Williams was 
not suspended Thursday, and a league official said the incident was 
still being looked at. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland has gotten into trouble all season for outbursts and  
tantrums directed at officials, and Wednesday night was no 
different. Rasheed Wallace, whose protests have been characterized 
by wide-eyed, open-jawed looks and flailing arms, was particularly 
animated after one call. There also was a brief altercation behind 
the Blazers bench involving seldom-used and injured rookie guard 
Bonzi Wells and a Phoenix security guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Guys have to understand that you can't react to everything  
that happens,'' point guard Damon Stoudamire told The Oregonian. 
``It just magnifies everything. It just makes it worse. Wherever we 
play in the second round, it's going to be the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Portland's emotion and energy carried it through  
with a 24-10 run to end the game and the series. And that kind of 
intensity -- in measured doses -- will be needed if the Blazers are 
to advance to the Western Conference finals and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't come here to get into the second round. I came here  
because I felt this team had the best opportunity to win a world 
championship,'' said Greg Anthony, who signed as a free agent 
following the lockout. ``So far, I feel real happy about my 
decision.''

<HEADLINE> PAL Investors Want No-Strike Promise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Philippine Airlines chairman Lucio  
Tan said Friday that prospective investors want a guarantee that 
airline workers will not strike for 10 years before they invest in 
the troubled carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan is negotiating with several potential investors from Europe,  
Singapore and Hong Kong in hopes of raising $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Tan, who owns 70 percent of PAL's stock, has pledged to put in  
$100 million and is looking for investors to provide the other 
half. 
</P>
<P>
	``If our labor is cooperating 10 years, no strike, then  
foreigners will come in with $100 million,'' Tan told reporters 
after meeting PAL's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	The capital infusion is a key element of a rehabilitation plan  
that also calls for a reduction of PAL's fleet from 54 to 22 
aircraft and a drastic cut in its workforce. 
</P>
<P>
	Manila's corporate regulator, the Securities and Exchange  
Commission, has said it will order the liquidation of Asia's oldest 
airline, if airline officials cannot raise the money by June 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Airline president Avelino Zapanta said company officials will  
meet with leaders of the airline's two unions, representing flight 
and ground personnel, to obtain the no-strike guarantee in exchange 
for stock in the company. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the 8,000 PAL workers agreed in September not to launch  
any work stoppage, but Zapanta said many still resist giving up 
their right to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	President Joseph Estrada has said the government will not bail  
out PAL but has ordered officials to help the flag carrier seek new 
investors because of the potential economic impact if the airline 
shuts down. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has been unable to pay $2.2 billion in debts largely  
incurred in an ambitious but ill-timed fleet modernization program. 
The carrier has been unable to service its loans as a result of 
Asia's economic crisis and a debilitating pilots' strike.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Claims NATO Hit Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO warplanes dropped cluster bombs  
on a convoy of ethnic Albanian refugees in Kosovo early today, 
killing as many as 100 civilians, state-controlled media claimed. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said it was investigating the report and could make no  
immediate comment. The State Department urged skepticism on Serb 
reports that blamed the allies for the attack until the facts are 
known. 
</P>
<P>
	Tank-killing Apache helicopters flown by U.S. pilots held a  
live-fire exercise today along the Kosovo-Albania border, 
meanwhile, and the first lady visited a refugee camp in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters taken by Serb authorities to the village, Korisa, saw  
dozens of charred bodies and wrecked tractors. 
</P>
<P>
	In Korisa, 40 miles southwest of Kosovo's capital, an Associated  
Press Television News crew allowed to travel to the scene saw 
bodies, including two children, burned beyond recognition near two 
craters beside a road. 
</P>
<P>
	Shocked survivors stood around, and reporters were shown a group  
of about 50 women and children huddled in the cellar of a village 
home crying. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 20 wrecked tractors were seen smoldering nearby, and TV  
footage showed wrecked buildings and a single tennis shoe lying in 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	One villager, Feriz Emini, asked how many were killed, said: ``I  
don't know the exact number. Many. Everyone was sleeping.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Local police claimed there are no police or military  
installations near Korisa. 
</P>
<P>
	Yugoslav officials said a convoy of about 500 refugees was  
heading out of Kosovo toward Albania and had decided to spend the 
night at Korisa. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said it was investigating the report by the Tanjug  
state-controlled news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman, promised the ``full story ...  
full facts'' -- and an admission of wrongdoing if an investigation 
shows NATO's warplanes made an errant airstrike. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the allies could not immediately confirm or deny the  
Tanjug report of 100 dead; other Yugoslav media gave a different 
casualty figure: killing 50 and injuring 50. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has admitted to several wayward missiles since its air  
campaign against Yugoslavia began -- most recently the bombing of 
the Chinese embassy in Belgrade a week ago that killed three 
journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Serb Media Center reported NATO aircraft dropped eight  
cluster bombs on the village. 
</P>
<P>
	It said all the wounded, mainly women, children and old people,  
were taken to Prizren's hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	British officials said any investigation into erroneous  
airstrikes now include a new element. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are now reports of Kosovar people being rounded up and  
herded under bridges so that when NATO aircraft attack these 
bridges, these people can be displayed as civilian casualties,'' 
British Defense Minister John Spellar told reporters in London. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said  
the attack claim is being carefully reviewed because ``it's an area 
where there was Serb shelling and in the general area there was 
substantial NATO activity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the past practice of the Belgrade television of  
misleading the world and misleading the Serb people with blatant, 
outright lies, I would urge everyone involved to treat Belgrade's 
information on this subject with extreme caution until NATO, which 
has shown its willingness to admit when mistakes were made, has 
been able to complete its assessment of what happened,'' Rubin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If verified -- and Shea noted foreign journalists normally denied  
access were bused to the reported attack site for propaganda 
purposes, the casualty figure would be the second-highest in NATO's 
seven-week-old air campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	On April 14, 75 ethnic Albanian refugees died in an accidental  
attack on a convoy near the southwestern Kosovo town of Djakovica. 
NATO acknowledged a misfire. 
</P>
<P>
	Seeing for herself the plight of Kosovo Albanians, first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that America and its allies will 
not let ``the evil'' perpetrated against them by Slobodan Milosevic 
prevent refugees from returning to their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of smiling refugee children crowded the fence at the  
Stenkovec camp in Macedonia as the first lady entered the tent 
city, accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill, a key figure 
in failed negotiations with Yugoslavia's president. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge camp, with some 23,000 refugees, is the main tent city  
where Kosovo Albanians with relatives in the United States are 
screened for possible transport to America. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third of the some 780,000 ethnic Albanian refugees  
who have fled or been expelled since March by Serbian forces from 
Kosovo, a neighboring province of Yugoslavia's Serb republic, are 
in Macedonia. Most are in Albania. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the long delay in deploying U.S. Apache helicopters  
in Kosovo may be coming to an end after the gunships' Albania-based 
artillery support units held their first live-fire exercises today. 
</P>
<P>
	The units fired some 100 rounds from 105 mm howitzers at a range  
30 miles northeast of Tirana's Rinas airport. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are ready to go. We are sick and tired of waiting here for  
a month without doing what we are trained to do,'' said an Apache 
pilot, prevented from giving his name by U.S. military regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Apaches have crashed in training flights in Albania, killing  
two pilots. NATO officials say the losses and intelligence showing 
Yugoslav forces still have a number of SA-18 shoulder-fired 
missiles have delayed their use in battle. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, NATO reported its heaviest bombing of the  
campaign that began March 24, pounding Serbian targets, knocking 
out electricity in Yugoslavia's three largest cities -- Belgrade, 
Nis and Novi Sad, and hitting arms and supplies hidden in tunnels. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO said it had launched 679 sorties, the largest number so far  
-- including 237 strikes on targets on the ground and another 90 
against Yugoslav air defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	All manned aircraft returned safely to base, NATO said, although  
it acknowledged two unmanned reconnaissance drones were lost. The 
cause of the crashes were being investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Airstrikes concentrated on Serb ground forces in Kosovo that  
have conducted a crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists since 
February 1998.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Victim's Story Told at Church </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- As explosions and gunfire thundered  
through the halls of Columbine High, Cassie Bernall closed her eyes 
and clasped her hands in prayer. One of the killers pointed a 
shotgun at her and asked if she believed in God. 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	And then he killed her.  
</P>
<P>
	Around the country, Ms. Bernall's affirmation of faith has been  
recounted in Sunday school classes and at church youth gatherings. 
The 17-year-old girl has been cited as an example to other young 
people. She has become something of a martyr. 
</P>
<P>
	In Catonsville, Md., Kristen Eppard, 15, was so moved by Ms.  
Bernall's story that she plans to take the young woman's name when 
she is confirmed Sunday at the Church of the Good Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thought it was really awesome how she did that,'' said  
Miss Eppard, whose father is a priest in their charismatic 
Episcopal faith. ``She's a martyr because she stood up for God and 
she died that way. I want to be just like her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elementary school teacher Kathi Cossey of Houston said Ms.  
Bernall's death ``made me really think, what would I say, knowing 
that you're going to go to heaven and someone is sitting there with 
a gun.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many Internet sites are devoted to Ms. Bernall's life and death.  
One such site shows her smiling face hovering in clouds as Jesus 
peeks over her shoulder. Under her chin are the words: ``Yes ... I 
Believe!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randall Balmer, a professor of American religious history at  
Barnard College in New York City, said there has been a groundswell 
to designate Ms. Bernall a martyr, something that has not been done 
in the Protestant faith since the 1500s. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is really quite extraordinary,'' he said. ``The flames of  
martyrdom are being fanned by these various preachers who 
apparently have embellished the story as they have told it. It 
takes on a life of its own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``At some level, it's an attempt to make sense of an  
essentially senseless act. It also speaks to the kind of universal 
human hankering for role models.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like most teen-age girls, Ms. Bernall fretted about boys, her  
weight and being popular. A few years ago, the blue-eyed blonde 
fell in with the wrong crowd. She dabbled in witchcraft and was 
fascinated with suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Her parents, Brad and Misty, moved her to a different school and  
sent her to West Bowles Community Church, an Evangelical 
Presbyterian congregation. 
</P>
<P>
	Under protest, Ms. Bernall joined the church's youth group,  
where her anger gradually subsided. About two years ago, she 
returned from a retreat as a converted Christian, said Dave 
McPherson, West Bowles' youth pastor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen kids that get a change for a week and they're back  
into the old grind,'' he said. ``Not Cassie. She dug in, and 
spiritually, she started reading her Bible and she started 
praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She studied hard, enjoyed photography and art and hoped to win a  
scholarship to attend college in Britain, which she had recently 
visited, said 17-year-old Craig Nason, a fellow youth group member. 
She often carried a Bible at school and wore a bracelet that read 
``What Would Jesus Do?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She was like the rest of us,'' Nason said. ``She had fears.  
She had doubts. But she chose to have faith through all of those 
things. What made Cassie incredible is she had faith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson said Ms. Bernall struggled with everyday problems  
after her conversion but stayed her religious course. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was saying, `I sure would like to be popular, but I'm not  
going to let it get in the way of my spirituality. I wish I were 
built different, I wish I was slim, I wish I was the prom queen. I 
wish that I had certain dates,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Bernall was studying Shakespeare in the Columbine High  
library when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold began their rampage. In 
all, 12 students and a teacher died before Harris and Klebold 
committed suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement issued at Ms. Bernall's funeral, the Bernalls  
said: ``Her life was rightly centered around our Lord Jesus. It was 
for her strong faith in God and His promise of eternal life that 
she made her stand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McPherson believes her legacy will be to lead more people toward  
Christ. At his church, attendance is up about 500 people because of 
the massacre, he said. Other religious leaders have reported 
similar increases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's been very much across the board, anyone who would  
identify with Cassie's faith, not her denomination, but her faith 
in Christ,'' said Doug Clark, field director of the San Diego-based 
National Network of Youth Ministries. ``Cassie is being seen as a 
hero.''

<HEADLINE> Pistons Fight Back Against Atlanta  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Facing elimination, the Detroit  
Pistons went back to an old formula. They let their guards take 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dumars, of course, was part of the 1989-90 championship  
tandem -- sharing the backcourt with Isiah Thomas. Now, Dumars has 
Lindsey Hunter on his wing. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the third game of their first-round series with Atlanta,  
it almost looked like Thomas was back. Hunter was diving for balls, 
breaking up passes and generally playing playoff-style basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Detroit beat the Hawks 79-63 and lived to play  
again after the lowest-scoring game in NBA playoff history. Atlanta 
still owns a 2-1 edge in the best-of-5 series and can eliminate the 
Pistons tonight at The Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pistons are vowing to go out with a fight.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can't let up now,'' said Dumars, who will retire at the end  
of this season. ``We're still on the brink of elimination. When 
you're on the brink, you have to play desperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his hustle, Hunter had 13 points, four assists  
and three steals in Game 3. He also managed to keep Atlanta guard 
Mookie Blaylock in check, holding him to just eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play the first two games like I did in the regular  
season, but I had to put that behind me,'' Hunter said. ``I love 
the challenge of battling Mookie. He outplayed me two games in a 
row and I was determined not to let it be three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another key for the Pistons was their ability to contain Dikembe  
Mutombo, the Hawks' 7-foot-2 center. In the first two games, 
Mutombo dominated and Atlanta routed the Pistons, winning each game 
by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Game 3, the Pistons never had fewer than two bodies on  
Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
	They knocked him around a little bit, too. With 6:22 to go in  
the third quarter, Mutombo drove the lane only to be banged to the 
floor by Grant Hill. It was Hill's fourth foul, but the Pistons had 
sent a message: Someone other than Mutombo would have to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It speaks volumes of him and not wanting to give up,'' said  
Dumars, who had 11 points, including 3-of-4 from 3-point range. ``A 
year or two ago, I don't know if he'd take that foul. I think he's 
growing up, and that play kind of displays that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Hawks were not pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it was a message foul,'' Hawks coach Lenny  
Wilkens said. ``But if you don't go for the ball, the referee has 
to have the courage to call the flagrant foul. That's not asking 
them to give us something, that's the rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 63 points were the fewest ever scored by the Hawks in a  
playoff game and the second-lowest in NBA history, topped only by 
the 54 points by Utah in last year's NBA Finals against the Chicago 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks' previous low was 71 in 1950 when they were the  
Tri-Cities Black Hawks.

<HEADLINE> Mount Baker Gets the Most Snow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Of all the snowcaps, Mount Baker may be No. 1.  
</P>
<P>
	It has unofficially become the world's most snowed upon peak,  
breaking a 27-year-old record for snowfall in a single season. 
</P>
<P>
	After 2 inches of snow fell Wednesday, the Mount Baker Ski Area  
had accumulated 1,124 inches since Nov. 1, 1998 -- almost 94 feet, 
or about the height of a 10-story building. 
</P>
<P>
	The previous record, established in 1971-72 on nearby Mount  
Rainier, was 1,122 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was the slowest 2 inches of snow I've ever seen fall at  
Mount Baker,'' said spokeswoman Gwyn Howat, who spent Tuesday night 
at a lodge on the mountain so she could be there when it happened. 
``It was a bit like watching the pot boil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The record came as little surprise to ski center staff. In  
February, the mountain got so much snow they were forced to close 
the ski slopes for two days and to lengthen a 25-foot snow 
measuring stick that lay buried for days. 
</P>
<P>
	The center sold record numbers of season passes, used twice the  
usual amount of dynamite for avalanche control, and had to place 
classified ads for shovelers to help dig out chair lifts and cut 
down roadside snowbanks, Howat said. 
</P>
<P>
	The ski season on Mount Baker closed May 2.  
</P>
<P>
	The record is unofficial until validated by the National Climate  
Extremes Committee -- a process that could take several months, said 
Andy Horvitz, a climatologist at the National Weather Service's 
Office of Meteorology in Silver Spring, Md. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration runs the  
climate extremes committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are working with the ski area to arrange a site visit, to  
find out how they measure the snow, get copies of data and snow 
removal records,'' Horvitz said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mount Baker site is not one of the nation's 11,000 National  
Weather Service Cooperative stations, which are equipped with 
standard weather bureau instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts are careful to define a record as only the greatest  
measured amount of snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always the recognition that there have got to be large  
areas in the Himalayas (with more snow), but there's no one there 
to measure it,'' said Mike Changery, head of the climate monitoring 
branch of the National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Mount Baker's thick mantle of snow comes courtesy of extremely  
wet coastal storms. The storms blow in from the Pacific, cool above 
the 10,775-foot volcano -- about 60 miles north of Seattle -- and 
dump snow on the ski area to the north.

<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and  
opposition leader Ehud Barak were left in suspense Friday as two 
minor contenders dropped hints but did not make a firm pledge to 
pull out before Monday's election. 
</P>
<P>
	New polls indicate that Barak has widened his lead over  
Netanyahu, but unless minor candidates withdraw the Labor leader 
might not get the 50 percent plus one vote he needs to clinch a 
first-round victory. 
</P>
<P>
	All eyes were on Yitzhak Mordechai, the center party candidate  
who was fired by Netanyahu as defense minister and who has vowed to 
stay on despite sinking in the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The other contenders -- Azmi Bishara, the first-ever Arab  
candidate, and Benny Begin, the hawkish son of the late Prime 
Minister Menachem Begin -- were expected to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls published Friday showed Barak widening his lead by about  
four percentage points since last week. 
</P>
<P>
	A Gallup poll in the Maariv daily gave Barak 48.5 percent and  
Netanyahu 35.5 percent in a five-way race. Mordechai won 4.6 
percent, Bishara received 2.5 percent and Begin got 2.1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In a head-to-head contest, the poll gave Barak 54.2 percent and  
Netanyahu 37.4 percent. The poll questioned 1,100 Israeli adults 
and had a margin of error of four percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	A Dahaf poll in another newspaper, Yediot Ahronot, also put  
Barak ahead, but by a smaller margin: 44 percent to Netanyahu's 38 
percent in the first round, and 51 percent to Netanyahu's 41 
percent in a second. For this poll, 1,100 Israeli adults were 
questioned. It gave a margin of error of three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Mordechai was not expected to make any move about staying in the  
race until Saturday night. If he dropped out, he would raise hopes 
for Barak to win a first-round victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Cheered by hundreds of supporters at a campaign rally, Mordechai  
pledged Thursday to stay in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not deterred by the results of this or that poll,''  
Mordechai said. ``The election is the real poll.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But pressure for Mordechai to withdraw has grown this week, with  
members of his own party asking him to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishara was widely expected to withdraw over the weekend. He has  
said from the beginning that his main reason for running was to 
galvanize the 500,000 Israeli Arab voters -- about 11 percent of the 
electorate of 4.3 million -- and to press for Arab rights. 
</P>
<P>
	His withdrawal would be a coup for Barak, whose Labor party is  
traditionally supported by Israeli Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	Begin, who opposes territorial compromise with the Palestinians,  
is expected to decide Sunday whether he will stay in the race. 
Begin is said to have been driven into the race by a personal 
grudge against Netanyahu. 
</P>
<P>
	The candidates and parties will make their last pitches to the  
public Saturday night, when the final election ads are broadcast on 
television.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Derby Hearing Set </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The Arkansas Racing Commission is to  
hear an appeal May 24 from jockey Billy Patin, who was suspended 
from racing for a year after a ruling that he carried an illegal 
electrical device when the horse he rode finished first in the 
Arkansas Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing originally was set for last Wednesday but was  
postponed because of lawyers' scheduling conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewards for Oaklawn Park last week disqualified Patin's mount  
Valhol and ordered the $300,000 first-place share of the purse to 
be redistributed. Second-place finisher Certain was declared the 
new winner. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin was fined $2,500 and suspended through the end of 1999 --  
the maximum punishment available to stewards. The three-member 
panel referred the matter to the state Racing Commission with the 
suggestion that it extend Patin's suspension through May 5, 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Stewards reached their decision after reviewing a videotape that  
showed a black item falling from Patin's hand shortly after 
Valhol's victory. A tractor driver testified that he found an 
electrical device on the track in the same vicinity as the object 
was shown falling from the video. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin, testifying before stewards, suggested that the falling  
black object may have been a black rubber band used to hold his 
shirt sleeves closed. Patin said he noticed he was missing one of 
the four bands when he returned to the jockeys' room after the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	Patin's attorney also suggested that the electrical device could  
have been dropped from any of the other jockeys in the race, or 
been dropped sometime in the past and then turned up by tractors 
and disks reworking the track's loose dirt after the derby was run. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing Commission attorney Byron Freeland said the hearing will  
include witnesses, questioning and evidence -- much like the 
stewards' hearing. A majority of the five-member commission is 
needed to uphold the stewards' ruling. An appeal then could be 
filed in circuit court.

	FAIRFAX, Va. (AP) -- Sen. Robert C. Byrd, the proud guardian of  
the historic rights and privileges of the Senate, has waived 
congressional immunity and offered to face the consequences for 
causing a fender-bender. 
</P>
<P>
	The 81-year-old West Virginia Democrat told prosecutors that he  
doesn't want special treatment in connection with the May 7 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	He could be fined an amount to be determined by a judge.  
</P>
<P>
	The senator had been given a ticket for following too closely,  
but the citation was dropped under the constitutional provision 
that grants members of Congress immunity from arrest while Congress 
is in session. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd spokeswoman Ann Adler said the senator ``wants to do the  
right thing legally. He wants to appear in court -- the whole 
thing.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Court Says Race Appropriate in Stop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Border Patrol agents can consider ethnicity  
when they make traffic stops, according to a federal court ruling 
in a case involving two Hispanic men who turned their cars around 
to avoid a checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 2-1 ruling, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on  
Thursday upheld the detention of the men stopped 50 miles inside 
the United States after they tried to avoid a highway checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	The court said it was appropriate that among the things the  
officers considered in making the stop was the fact that the men 
were Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities stopped the men after a motorist said that two cars  
with Mexican plates turned around a mile from the checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents searched the cars of German Espinoza Montero-Camargo and  
Lorenzo Sanchez-Guillen and found two large bags of marijuana and a 
.32-caliber pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	This week's ruling upheld Montero-Camargo's guilty plea to  
conspiracy to possess marijuana with intent to distribute and 
Sanchez-Guillen's conviction on the same charge and for being an 
illegal alien possessing ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
	In a dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski wrote that ``none of the  
`numerous other factors' cited by the majority justify the stop.'' 
He cited a 1994 case in which the same court ruled that reasonable 
suspicion can't be based on broad profiles that cast suspicion on 
entire categories of people.

<HEADLINE> Bus Driver Had History of Pot Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- The driver of charter bus that crashed on  
Mother's Day, killing 22 people, had been fired twice in the last 
decade for marijuana use and tested positive for the drug shortly 
after the deadly wreck, federal investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
	Custom Bus Charters driver Frank Bedell, 46, lost bus driving  
jobs in 1989 and 1996 after tests showed he had used marijuana, the 
National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal investigator also confirmed that Bedell, who has  
congestive heart disease, kidney problems and diabetes, tested 
positive for marijuana when he was hospitalized Sunday after the 
bus veered off a highway and plunged down an embankment. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear how long before the crash Bedell might have  
smoked marijuana or whether the drug contributed to the accident, 
said NTSB investigator Ken Suydam. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's another piece of the puzzle we have to put together,''  
Suydam said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell tested positive for marijuana while employed as a city  
bus driver in New Orleans and in suburban Jefferson Parish. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometime after being hired in New Orleans in 1976, Bedell was  
given a drug test because he had been absent for work for eight 
days, Suydam said. After testing positive for marijuana, Bedell 
spent several months attending classes in an employee assistance 
program. 
</P>
<P>
	But he later tested positive again for the drug and was fired in  
March 1989, Suydam said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Bedell was hired as a driver for suburban buses. He  
failed a marijuana drug test the next year, Suydam said. Bedell 
spent two months in a drug rehabilitation program, but tested 
positive again for the drug in 1996 and was terminated a week 
later. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities previously said he tested positive for cocaine in  
1997 after applying for a job with Greyhound. 
</P>
<P>
	But Bedell passed at least three drug tests while working for  
Custom Bus Charters, the company that provided the bus for the 
Mother's Day gambling excursion to a Mississippi casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Custom president Donna Begovich said in a statement Thursday  
that she was shocked to learn Bedell tested positive for marijuana 
after the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, Custom had no way of knowing Frank's drug usage at  
any time,'' Begovich said. ``Frank Bedell passed his pre-employment 
drug test, the city's drug test, a police background check and 
three subsequent random drug tests within an 18-month period. What 
else could we have done?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suydam said investigators also focused Thursday on a report that  
Bedell checked into a hospital emergency room 12 hours before 
Sunday's crash for treatment of dehydration and extremely low blood 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	The cause of the crash has yet to be determined. Bedell remains  
in a hospital and is unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Bedell's medical history has not been linked to the accident by  
the NTSB investigators. However, investigators say the case shows 
gaps in the system to make sure bus drivers are medically sound.

<HEADLINE> Cotton Socks Cause Athletes Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cotton socks are worse than old-fashioned for athletes -- they  
can also be harmful in some situations, a sock expert says. 
</P>
<P>
	``State of the art today is using 100 percent synthetic  
fibers,'' said podiatrist Douglas Richie Jr. of the Los Angeles 
suburb of Los Alamitos. ``Synthetic fibers are markedly different 
from cotton or wool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing the older fibers gives an athlete or a hiker a higher  
risk of foot troubles such as blisters and bruises, Richie and 
other experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would avoid cotton socks at all costs,'' said podiatrist  
Stephen Pribut of George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	However, an official of a company that makes cotton and  
synthetic fiber socks said that, for ordinary wear, cotton will do 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetic fibers made of such materials as polypropylene and  
Teflon are better for what socks are supposed to do, said Richie, 
who has done research on sock performance. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those functions is to keep sweat away from the foot,  
because a wet foot is more likely to blister and become infected. 
</P>
<P>
	It's like what happens to skin when you spend too long in the  
tub, Pribut said: ``Your skin gets white and a little more mushy.'' 
Twisting and shearing forces make blisters form. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure created by activity drives sweat back into the  
outside layer of skin, a covering of protein that is the remains of 
dead skin cells. The moisture softens the protein, Pribut said. 
</P>
<P>
	Movement, such as walking or running, can tear part of the outer  
layer away from the underlying live skin cells, creating a gap that 
fills with fluid, which aching hikers and runners know as blisters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a properly made sock, however, the movement also can pump  
sweat away from the foot, Richie said. The moisture enters air 
pockets in the fabric, and stepping squeezes the sweat out, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the process breaks down if pressure permanently flattens the  
fabric, leaving no room for air pockets, Richie said. Cotton is 
more prone to flatten, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other part of the sweat-removal process is how to get rid of  
it once it has been taken away from the foot. Synthetic fabrics do 
this better because they dry more quickly, Richie said. 
</P>
<P>
	A denser weave makes for more air pockets and less compaction.  
Better socks have more terrycloth loops in them, Richie said. A 
buyer can tell the difference in the store simply by turning the 
socks inside out. 
</P>
<P>
	Some newer socks also rely on a blister-prevention method that  
dates from the old days, combining a light liner with a heavier 
outer sock. By wearing what amounts to two pair, the shearing force 
that otherwise would fall on the sock and the skin is dissipated to 
the inner and outer sock. 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetic sports socks are far from cheap. They can run $20 or  
more, although a person can get a decent pair for $8, Pribut said. 
Cotton athletic socks have the advantage of being cheap, but mere 
price does not make them acceptable to some podiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetics will last longer, anyway, so the cost difference  
shrinks when you factor in the cost of constantly replacing wornout 
cotton, Richie said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other cost factors as well. Synthetic sports socks are  
thicker, so people who buy the socks may also need new shoes, said 
Debbie Lazenby, spokeswoman for Thorlo, a synthetic sports socks 
company in Statesville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people purchase their footwear too small,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	And if you are not working up a big sweat, you can get by  
without synthetic sports socks, Richie said. ``Cotton is acceptable 
for casual wear,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of what most people use athletic socks for, which is  
just walking around, cotton is fine,'' said Kevin Angliss, 
president of Auburn Hosiery Mills in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is a sock licensee for Wilson and Converse sports  
socks in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	For workouts and games, Angliss agreed that synthetics would be  
better.

<HEADLINE> NBC Kills 'Homicide' After 7 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' has been killed  
off by NBC. The last new episode of the critically acclaimed show 
that has struggled all of its seven years with low ratings will be 
May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	From its premiere in January 1993, the series about a squad of  
Baltimore homicide detectives was never a ratings winner and fought 
for its life year after year. Airing Friday at 10 p.m. EDT, it has 
clung in recent seasons to third place behind ABC's ``20/20'' and 
CBS's cop drama ``Nash Bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It won numerous honors, including three Peabody Awards, the most  
recent of them last year for an episode about a commuter pushed 
beneath a subway train. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmed in Baltimore, the series wrapped for the season in March  
with cast and crew uncertain about their future. Official word of 
the cancellation is expected Monday, when NBC announces its fall 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, NBC Entertainment president Garth  
Ancier thanked ``Homicide'' executive producers Barry Levinson and 
Tom Fontana and ``their extremely talented cast and crew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cast member Yaphet Kotto, who lives in Baltimore, said he was  
saddened but not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been literally emotional, crying in the streets  
and in the stores,'' he told WBAL-TV in Baltimore. ``This is a very 
emotional thing with people who are fans of `Homicide.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm speechless. I'm bummed,'' said Tim Lee, who works at his  
family's dry cleaning business and used to chat with the show's 
writers when they dropped off their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Baltimore and I'm pretty proud of the city. To  
see something that puts Baltimore on Hollywood's map, and to have 
that canceled is pretty sad,'' he told The (Baltimore) Sun.

<HEADLINE> Ganga Tries To Keep African Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Jean-Claude Ganga is fighting to keep his job as  
Africa's top Olympic official, even though he's been expelled from 
the IOC, ousted from his national Olympic committee and shunned by 
many fellow African sports leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, the former International Olympic Committee member at the  
heart of the Salt Lake City bribery scandal, has refused to 
relinquish the presidency of the Association of National Olympic 
Committees of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	His critics have launched a campaign to force him out.  
</P>
<P>
	``If Ganga continues to be president of the African Olympic  
movement, it sends out a very negative message throughout the 
world,'' said Sam Ramsamy, head of South Africa's Olympic 
committee. ``I urge all the national Olympic committees of Africa 
to take a very assertive position and force Ganga to resign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga, of the Republic of Congo, was one of six IOC members  
expelled in March in the vote-buying case stemming from Salt Lake's 
winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga was cited for receiving more than $200,000 in cash and  
inducements, far more than any other member implicated in the 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being thrown out of the IOC, Ganga was removed  
late last month as president of his national Olympic committee. He 
was replaced by Raymond Ibaca, a former committee head. 
</P>
<P>
	In another snub, organizers of the All Africa Games -- scheduled  
to be held in South Africa in September -- announced this week that 
Ganga had been dropped as a patron. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ganga has rebuffed demands for his resignation as ANOCA  
president and taken steps to stifle his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics -- including ANOCA general secretary Tomas Sithole of  
Zimbabwe -- had hoped to secure his ouster at an emergency meeting 
of the association's executive committee in Lome, Togo, on April 
28. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ganga, who chaired the meeting, pushed through a resolution  
saying he would ``reflect about the future'' until the next ANOCA 
general assembly in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also announced that the general assembly, originally  
scheduled to be held in Johannesburg, South Africa, in September, 
would be moved to Lome in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga's actions have prompted protests from several African  
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Chamunda, president of the confederation representing 10  
southern African national Olympic committees, disassociated himself 
from the communique issued after the April 28 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Chamunda accused Ganga of manipulating the meeting to divert  
attention from ``his untenable continued position'' as ANOCA 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The general feeling was that Mr. Ganga should immediately and  
without delay voluntarily resign his position as president of 
ANOCA,'' Chamunda said in a letter to other African officials. 
``Instead Mr. Ganga chose to procrastinate and defer the decision 
indefinitely.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chamunda said unless Ganga resigns immediately, he will petition  
for an emergency ANOCA general assembly to expel him and ``put an 
end to this shameful saga.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attempts to reach Ganga by telephone in Congo, Cameroon and  
Paris were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of Ganga's case, the IOC is expected to amend its  
charter to specify that any member expelled from the committee 
should be banned from holding any leadership position in the 
Olympic movement. It's unlikely the rule would be applied 
retroactively against Ganga. 
</P>
<P>
	``If an athlete is found guilty in one sport, he is suspended  
from all activities,'' Ramsamy said. ``It should be the same in the 
Olympic movement. It seems this was an oversight in the first 
place. It needs to be corrected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ganga also is a vice president of the global Association of  
National Olympic Committees, which represents more than 200 
countries. His position may come up for review at an executive 
committee meeting in Paris on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Rubin Reaches Deal Over Labels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before he announced his resignation, Treasury  
Secretary Robert Rubin struck a deal with Sen. Strom Thurmond to 
consider tougher health labels on wine bottles. In exchange, the 
senator stopped blocking confirmation of three top Treasury 
appointees. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the latest development in a battle that has been waged  
since the Agriculture Department issued its Dietary Guidelines for 
Americans in 1996, which said moderate drinking has been associated 
with reduced heart disease risk. 
</P>
<P>
	The Treasury Department announced in February that it had  
approved two statements for wine labels that included references to 
some of the health effects of drinking wine. The approval was not 
an endorsement but only a reflection of the agency's finding that 
the statements were neither false nor misleading, the department 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	One statement read: ``The proud people who made this wine  
encourage you to consult your family doctor about the health 
effects of wine consumption.'' The other said: ``To learn the 
health effects of wine consumption, send for the federal 
government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans,'' and provides a 
mailing address and a Web site. 
</P>
<P>
	The labels approved in February were criticized by several  
groups, including the American Medical Association and the American 
Heart Association, on grounds they could promote drinking. 
</P>
<P>
	Thurmond, who lost a daughter to a drunken driving accident,  
immediately denounced the decision as ``irresponsible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If the secretary of the Treasury ... or anyone else in either  
government or industry thought I would not react to this decision, 
they made a losing bet,'' Thurmond, R-S.C., said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	The senator placed holds on three Treasury Department appointees  
-- Timothy F. Geithner, Gary Gensler and Edwin M. Truman, 
essentially blocking their appointments from coming up before the 
Senate, said Thurmond spokesman John DeCrosta. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the secretary was painfully aware of our  
disappointment with how this issue was handled and the need to 
revisit this,'' DeCrosta said. ``We made our displeasure as clear 
as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin responded by sending a letter dated April 21 to Thurmond  
saying, ``I regret that we did not consult with you more closely 
prior to the approval of two wine labels containing health-related 
statements.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms would open the issue for public comment. 
</P>
<P>
	``The notice will also ask whether the negative health  
consequences of alcohol consumption or abuse disqualify these 
products entirely from entitlement to any health-related 
statements,'' Rubin wrote. ``Assuming the appropriate factual and 
constitutional predicates, ATF would then have the authority to 
prohibit directional health statements such as those on the 
recently approved labels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three appointments were confirmed the day Rubin wrote the  
letter.

<HEADLINE> Jazz or Kings, Blazers Don't Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The question was inevitable, and the  
Portland Trail Blazers handled it like skilled politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Which team would they rather play in the second round of the  
playoffs, the Utah Jazz or the Sacramento Kings? 
</P>
<P>
	``Careful who you wish for -- you may get 'em,'' Blazers coach  
Mike Dunleavy said. ``Whoever it is, it is. And we'll take care of 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would seem obvious who the Blazers would rather have win the  
surprisingly competitive best-of-5 series. Portland swept all four 
games against Sacramento during the regular season, while the 
Blazers lost two of three to Utah, the two-time defending Western 
Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers point guard Damon Stoudamire was so certain the Jazz  
would win Game 4 against the Kings on Friday night and even the 
series 2-2 that he didn't even plan to watch it on TV. ``I'm going 
out,'' he said, adding that he'd monitor updates from a bar 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	Stoudamire missed a thriller, as the Jazz pulled out a 90-89  
victory on John Stockton's jumper with 0.7 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to have a mindset to play Utah,'' Stoudamire said  
after Friday's 2 1/2-hour practice. ``And Sacramento would be a bonus. 
Everybody in here feels pretty confident against Sacramento. But 
against Utah, we'd have to take it up to a whole other level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Blazers were more leery of the Kings, the only team to  
average more than 100 points a game in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to wipe that slate clean,'' guard Jim Jackson said.  
He recalled a similar situation when he played for Ohio State in 
1992. The Buckeyes had beaten Michigan's Fab Five twice during the 
regular season, then lost to the Wolverines in the NCAA 
tournament's round of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that game, in that situation, they were the better team on  
that night,'' Jackson said. ``So in this series, you see that 
Sacramento is playing a lot better than Utah, even though Utah beat 
them three times during the regular season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arvydas Sabonis, Portland's stoic Lithuanian center, summed up  
the Blazers' confidence when a reporter asked if he was preparing 
differently for the Jazz or the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Same,'' he said simply.  
</P>
<P>
	Blazers guard Isaiah Rider didn't practice Friday because of a  
sprained right knee suffered in Wednesday's series-clinching 
victory over Phoenix. Rider was going for a loose ball when the 
Suns' Tom Gugliotta fell backward into Rider's knee. Dunleavy said 
Rider's condition has improved, and he should be ready when the 
second round begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's feeling better,'' Dunleavy said.  
</P>
<P>
	All of the Blazers are feeling fine, having advanced to the  
second round for the first time in seven years. Now they're 
thinking bigger, while holding out hope of regaining homecourt 
advantage for the second round should Sacramento win the series. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected to get past the first round,'' Jackson said.  
``It's a good position to be in. It gives you a sense that we've 
already made it to the next level. Now everybody else has to come 
to that next level with us.''

<HEADLINE> Dollar Rises, Tokyo Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Signs of a healthy American economy helped send the  
dollar higher against the Japanese yen today. Tokyo share prices 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar cost 122.18 yen as of late today, up 0.60 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of 
121.85 yen overnight. It ranged during the day from 121.63 yen to 
122.23 yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average closed at 16,810.39  
points, down 40.86 points, or 0.24 percent from Thursday. On 
Thursday, the index lost 96.11 points, or 0.57 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was well-supported by U.S.  
economic data released late Thursday, which indicated inflation is 
still nascent in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuji Takano, assistant foreign exchange manager at ABN AMRO  
Bank in Tokyo, said that the strong U.S. economy as well as rising 
share prices on Wall Street favor a strong dollar. ``Japanese are 
even buying at these high levels,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average on Thursday closed at yet  
another record high of 11,107.19 points, up 106.82. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro bought 130.33 yen in the late  
afternoon, up from 129.36 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices initially rose moderately on the  
overnight stock gains in New York. But players grew cautious about 
pushing prices higher before a series of closely watched earnings 
reports for the last fiscal year, ending in March, which are 
expected in coming weeks, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Institutional investors start selling each time the Nikkei  
average nears 17,000,'' said Kazunori Jinnai, deputy general 
manager of the equity department at Daiwa Securities SB Capital 
Markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 4.52 points, or 0.33 percent, to 1,347.45. 
The TOPIX fell 9.18 points, or 0.67 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the first section totaled about 727.8 million, up from  
579.4 million Thursday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 650 
to 504, while 156 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 212 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 1.240 percent from 1.300 percent late Thursday, 
driving its price up to 102.33 yen from 101.78 yen.

<HEADLINE> Pollsters Question Internet Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Internet surveys are a great  
way to stir up interest in Web sites, but pollsters want to make a 
clear distinction between those surveys and polls that measure 
public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	They are considering the possibility of a rating system that  
would require pollsters to inform the public and the media which 
polls are conducted using scientific standards. Pollsters searched 
for a solution to the difficult problem Friday during the annual 
meeting of the American Association for Public Opinion Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't overstate the concern that people who practice  
polling have about this,'' said Nancy Belden, a Washington pollster 
who organized the standards discussion. ``It is more urgent because 
of the proliferation of Internet polling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Mitofsky, the veteran New York City pollster who heads  
the group's standards committee, emphasized it's too early to know 
what solution the group will finally pursue. 
</P>
<P>
	But studies of the online surveys have shown their results are  
very different from scientific polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew Research Center ran a comparison of its own probability  
polls and the results of self-selected survey responses to the same 
questions on America Online. More than half in the open online 
survey disapproved of the job President Clinton was doing, while 
two-thirds in the scientific telephone poll approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientific surveys use a technique called random digit dialing,  
in which a computer picks phone numbers at random and the poll 
results are weighted geographically and demographically to 
represent the population as a whole. Most Web polls are 
self-selected, meaning Internet users decide themselves whether to 
respond. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet surveys are increasingly being targeted by interest  
groups that want a new forum to promote their cause. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK Internet Brigade, let's get out there and stand strong for  
Pat!'' was the rallying cry posted recently on Pat Buchanan's 
official web site. The site encourages supporters to ``hit the 
online polls and register your vote for PJB.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aides with several other presidential campaigns, Republican and  
Democratic, said they encourage participation in such polls, but 
have made no organized effort to influence the results. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters are trying to cut confusion caused by the Internet  
surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	At CNN, poll director Keating Holland helped convince those who  
run the online surveys to call them ``quick votes'' to make a clear 
distinction that they are not scientific polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The technology of the Internet has simply made more visible a  
problem pollsters have faced for years. Mail-in polls, which have 
been around for years, can cause the same confusion as Internet 
polls, because the poll taker usually has little control over who 
decides to respond. 
</P>
<P>
	One firm has advocated using Internet surveys for election  
polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Leonard Bayer, chief scientist at Harris Black International of  
Rochester, N.Y., says his techniques include finding a large sample 
of willing respondents on the Internet who can be canvassed by 
e-mail. ``Part of the pollsters' art and science is knowing how to 
weight and interpret survey results so that they are projectable to 
the population,'' Bayer said.

<HEADLINE> Brown: No Celebration for Sixers Yet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The temptation is there to keep celebrating  
into the night and weekend, basking in this rare moment of playoff 
glory. The Philadelphia 76ers haven't been this hot since Julius 
Erving soared through the air in the Spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
	Philadelphia coach Larry Brown is aware of that problem: There  
is still work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to treat it like a one-game series,'' said Brown,  
trying to restore some humility after the Sixers defeated the Magic 
97-85 Thursday night to take a 2-1 lead in their best-of-5 series. 
``We can't afford to slip up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Driven by memories of an eight-year honeymoon with the NBA draft  
lottery, the emotional Sixers have pushed the favored Magic to the 
brink of elimination. But the basketball revival that has gripped 
Philadelphia could go wrong in a hurry if the Sixers don't finish 
the job in Game 4 Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those fans in Orlando will be packing it in if we get this  
Game 4,'' Orlando sixth man Darrell Armstrong said Friday. 
``They're going to go crazy just like the fans here in the City of 
Brotherly Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic committed 27 turnovers, 20 in the first half, and  
watched the game degenerate further when Penny Hardaway complained 
that coach Chuck Daly didn't get him enough shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Iverson, stifled by an onslaught of double teams and  
physical muggings ordered by Daly in Game 2, scored 33 points, had 
an NBA playoff record 10 steals and even led the cheers in the 
Sixers' first home playoff game since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've seen a guy by the name of Michael Jordan, so I've seen  
63-point games in the playoffs,'' said Daly, who was not offended 
by Iverson's gesture for him to call a timeout when the Sixers ran 
away with the game in the third quarter. ``He is a great player, 
he's tough as nails. He gives no excuses. You've got to love him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven-foot-1 Matt Geiger scored only 4 points, but the fiery,  
intimidating center got into heated confrontations with 6-10 Isaac 
Austin, 6-1 Armstrong and 68-year-old Daly in the opening minutes 
of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The emotion spread quickly through the First Union Center, the  
conflagration of nearly a decade of waiting for deplorable 
basketball to end. And it did. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd was about as good as any arena I've ever been in,  
and I've been in some good ones,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, aptly characterized by one writer as ``a chest-pass coach  
in a no-look world,'' was fine with the celebrating in the stands. 
He was furious, however, with some of the emotion displayed by his 
players on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Iverson led the way with various forms of street-ball posturing,  
including the unthinkable gesture for Daly to call a timeout when 
Philadelphia gained its biggest lead, 23 points, in the third 
quarter. Larry Hughes, a fearless 20-year-old rookie, made the same 
signal with his hands after one of his high-flying dunks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It motivates me, because the series isn't over,'' Hardaway  
said of the fans' wild celebration. ``They are acting like the 
Sixers just swept this and we're going back home. We have one more 
game and we have something to prove. I've got something to prove 
...'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown lectured his team on Friday about the importance of  
holding off the party until the job is done. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came too far to let one big game at home give us the wrong  
impression,'' said Hughes, who nonetheless doesn't regret taunting 
the Magic. ``We got a little down there, too, so we were just 
trying to return the favor a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Magic's season hinges on whether Hardaway can put aside his  
differences with Daly long enough to send the series back to 
Orlando for Game 5. Hardaway scored most of his 18 points during 
garbage time and complained afterward about getting only 12 shots -- 
two in the first half 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 4, ``I'm coming out firing no matter what,'' Hardaway  
said. ``I don't care if I miss 25 or 30 shots. I just have to, 
because I'm going to get blamed for it either way. I'm in a no-win 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway is still bothered by partially torn ligaments in his  
right wrist. Sixers reserve guard Aaron McKie did not practice 
Friday and was limping badly with a deep thigh bruise. He is listed 
as questionable for Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	Celebrating aside, both teams are still questionable for Game 5.

<HEADLINE> Report: Fence Caught Deadly Wheel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A wheel that came off Stan Wattles' race  
car was contained initially by a catch fence at Lowe's Motor 
Speedway before it was deflected back onto the track and propelled 
into the stands when struck by another car. 
</P>
<P>
	That was what IRL officials said in a preliminary report Friday  
on the fatal accident that sent debris into the crowd during the 
IRL's VisionAire 500 on May 1. Three fans were killed and eight 
injured at the track in nearby Concord -- the first spectator deaths 
in the facility's 40-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wheel did not go through the fence, nor did it go over the  
fence as a direct result of Wattles' initial impact,'' Leo Mehl, 
the executive director of the Indy Racing League, said in a 
prepared statement. ``The wheel of the Wattles car was clearly 
propelled over the fence when it was struck by the car driven by 
John Paul.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wattles lost control of his car on the race's 59th lap. He  
veered to the right and into the outside wall on Turn 4. Both 
right-side tires came off the car. 
</P>
<P>
	The track's 15-foot wheel fence did contain the debris from the  
initial crash, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the No. 10 car, driven by John Paul Jr.,  
traveled through the debris and one of the wheels from the Wattles 
car struck the John Paul car, causing the wheel to be deflected 
over the fence into the adjacent spectator stand,' Mehl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have been trying to piece together the accident by  
examining race footage and Paul's car, which had evidence that it 
was hit by the tire, said track president H.A. ``Humpy'' Wheeler 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They also know where the tire landed, so they know the  
trajectory of where it was launched,'' he said, noting that the 
string of events also was corroborated by eyewitness account. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler said there isn't a lot of video or still photos to work  
with, but added that, ``I can assure you this thing is being as 
thoroughly analyzed as any accident in motorsports. We want to make 
sure this does not happen again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Speedway Motorsports Inc. is looking at adding as much as 4 1/2  
feet to the catch fences at Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth, 
where fences are nearly identical to those at Charlotte track. 
</P>
<P>
	The work, which would be done before the Longhorn 500 on June  
12, would make that speedway's fence as high above the track as the 
one at Indianapolis Motor Speedway and among the highest of any 
U.S. speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler is also looking at possible new wheel fence designs for  
the North Carolina track. The designs could be unveiled as soon as 
Tuesday, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Despite Bad Economic News </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against other currencies Friday  
after plunging when unexpectedly high consumer price numbers sent 
stocks and bonds tumbling. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar's rise against the yen began during Asian trading as  
weak Japanese economic news crippled the yen's fight for stability. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was quoted at $1.0654 in late trading in New York, down  
from $1.0660 late Thursday. Also, the dollar was quoted at 1.5059 
Swiss francs, up from 1.5027, and 1.4640 Canadian dollars, up from 
1.4583. The British pound fell to $1.6184 from $1.6205. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the dollar rose to 122.73 Japanese yen from 121.85  
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders were busy Friday, shoving the dollar first in one  
direction, then another. 
</P>
<P>
	The action during U.S. trading started with the morning release  
of data from the Labor Department, which said consumer prices 
jumped in April an unexpectedly sharp 0.7 percent, the largest 
monthly gain in nine years. 
</P>
<P>
	Traders dumped dollars and bought other currencies as the equity  
and bond markets fell. The 30-year Treasury bond had its largest 
one-day decline since early October as its yield hit highs not seen 
in a year. 
</P>
<P>
	But after a few minutes, bullish sentiment about the U.S.  
economy triggered a round of dollar-buying, pushing the currency 
higher than it was Thursday during late trading. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've been everywhere but we finally ended higher,'' said  
Kathy Jones, a currency analyst at Prudential Securities. adding 
that the high yields on the bonds attracted dollar-buyers paying 
attention to the lower yields in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	In Asian trading, investors moved to the dollar early and  
dropped yen as Japan's Economic Planning Agency's monthly report 
said their economy is stalled in an extremely severe state. 
</P>
<P>
	The report cited the 11th straight month of falling department  
store sales, corporate investment in plant and equipment falling at 
a ``fast pace,'' and record-setting unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's declining domestic demand despite all of the stimulus.  
Eventually, the Bank of Japan will have to do more'' to fight 
Japan's worst recession since World War II, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the euro countries are no longer traded separately  
and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's exchange rate, the dollar was worth: 1.8359  
German marks, up from 1.8349; 6.1576 French francs, up from 6.1538; 
and 1,818.18 Italian lire, up from 1,814.88.

<HEADLINE> Wal-Mart Rejects Contraceptive Pill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Wal-Mart, the nation's largest  
retailer, has decided not to sell the morning-after pill at its 
2,400 pharmacy counters. 
</P>
<P>
	WalMart, with a large part of its customer base in conservative,  
small-town America, said Friday that the decision had nothing to do 
with ethical concerns. Instead, it said it concluded that the 
emergency contraceptive might not sell well enough to make it worth 
the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	Family planning advocates criticized the move, saying that some  
women, particularly those in small towns where Wal-Mart has little 
competition, would have greater difficulty finding the drug, 
Preven. 
</P>
<P>
	``They will come to understand that this decision is  
misguided,'' she the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation 
of America, Gloria Feldt. ``Pharmacies have a moral obligation to 
provide health care to women, and frankly, emergency contraception 
prevents unintended pregnancies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she asked to meet with Wal-Mart executives.  
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, WalMart has banned other products, including  
some kinds of music, handguns and men's magazines, on moral 
grounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to carry anything that we feel will offend our  
customers, but that was not the judgment in this case,'' Wal-Mart 
spokesman Jay Allen said from the company's Bentonville 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen said Wal-Mart selects products it believes its customers  
will want and decided not to sell the drug when it became available 
in October, in part because of potentially low sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sales wouldn't be the only factor, but it would be one of the  
factors,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He would not say what the other factors were but said Wal-Mart  
is not banning the drug because of the debate over abortion 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not the job of a Wal-Mart store to get involved on  
either side of an issue,'' Allen said. ``It is to serve the 
millions of customers and shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wal-Mart said it will refer women who want the drug to nearby  
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Preven is essentially a large dose of regular birth control  
pills. Before Preven was approved, some doctors would tell women to 
take an excess dose of their birth control pills if they had had 
unprotected sex and wanted to prevent pregnancy. Preven is easier 
to use because it comes packaged in a kit that includes simple 
directions and a pregnancy test. 
</P>
<P>
	Preven can be used up to 72 hours after unprotected sex to stop  
a pregnancy. It stops ovulation and prevents fertilized eggs from 
implanting in the uterine wall. The drug is not the same as RU-486, 
which can be used in the first seven weeks of pregnancy to induce 
an abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Some abortion foes oppose Preve. But because three days is too  
soon to tell if a woman is pregnant, many anti-abortion groups 
haven't taken a stand on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way to know if fertilization has occurred,'' said  
Rose Mimms, the director of Arkansas Right to Life. ``We have 
enough work to do without taking on something when there's still a 
question of whether there is life there or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A researcher told the government in 1997 that there was a market  
for Preven to prevent about 2.3 million pregnancies a year. The 
company that makes it, Gynetics Inc. of Somerville, N.J., has sold 
about 80,000 doses since October, according to IMS Health, a market 
data firm. 
</P>
<P>
	Gynetics president Roderick Mackenzie said, ``It can only be  
because they don't think the volume is big enough. I just assume 
it's the money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the Walgreens drug store chain, spokeswoman Yvette Venable  
said of Preven, ``It hasn't been a very strong seller, but we plan 
to continue carrying it.''

<HEADLINE> Ga. Tech's Glover Wants NBA Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia Tech's Dion Glover hasn't played a game  
in almost 14 months. Still, his next game might be in the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover, a 6-foot-5 guard who missed all of last season because  
of a knee injury, declared himself eligible for the NBA draft 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to explore my options of where I would be drafted,''  
Glover said in a statement released by the school. He said he would 
not sign with an agent, however, so he can keep his college 
eligibility intact if he decides to pull out before the June 30 
draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover's decision is somewhat surprising since he hasn't played  
competitively since 1997-98. That season, he was the No. 3 freshman 
scorer in the nation with 18.4 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first practice as a sophomore, Glover tore the anterior  
cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his left knee during a 
seemingly harmless one-on-one drill. He spent the rest of the 
season making a full recovery from the injury. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had talked with Dion about this option when he was first  
injured,'' Tech coach Bobby Cremins said in the statement. ``He has 
taken full advantage of the NBA rules and has promised me that he 
will retain his college eligibility while considering his 
options.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glover said he will pay his own way to a tryout camp in Chicago  
and also will work out individually for NBA teams. 
</P>
<P>
	He can withdraw his name 72 hours prior to the 30 draft. Also,  
if he goes through the two-round process without being picked, he 
has 30 days to request that his college eligibility be restored. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's going to be careful,'' said Tech spokesman Mike Finn.  
</P>
<P>
	He had the third highest-scoring season (608 points) ever  
recorded by a Tech freshman -- behind Kenny Anderson and Stephon 
Marbury -- and tied the freshman school scoring record with a 
33-point effort against Seton Hall in the National Invitation 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	After flirting with the idea of turning pro after his first  
season, Glover decided to return to Tech for at least one more 
year. Now, he may be gone after that lone year on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Glover is one of 13 players who have declared for the draft. The  
list includes Jumaine Jones of rival Georgia and three stars from 
the ACC -- William Avery and Elton Brand of Duke and Steve Francis 
of Maryland.

<HEADLINE> Military Survey Finds Low Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Use of alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs  
among active duty U.S. service members last year was the lowest 
since the military began tracking it in 1980, the Pentagon said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sue Bailey, the assistant secretary of defense for health  
affairs, called the 1998 survey results encouraging but said the 
changes from the previous survey three years earlier were ``not 
significant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Heavy drinking was acknowledged by 15.4 percent in the latest  
survey, down from 17.1 percent in 1995. Heavy drinking was defined 
as consuming five or more drinks per occasion at least once a week. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest survey, 29.9 percent said they had smoked a  
cigarette in the past 30 days. That is down slightly from 31.9 
percent in 1995 and compares with 51 percent in 1980. The Defense 
Department's goal is 20 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Cigar or pipe smoking, however, rose sharply, from 18.7 percent  
in 1995 to 32.6 percent last year. The survey report said the jump 
in cigar or pipe smoking ``should be of concern'' to the Defense 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The percentage who reported using illegal drugs fell to 2.7  
percent from 3.0 percent in 1995. In 1980, when the Pentagon's 
survey of health-related behavior was first given, 27.6 percent 
said they used drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Military members' health-related behavior has been surveyed by  
the Pentagon seven times since 1980. Last year's survey was 
self-administered anonymously by 17,264 active duty men and women 
in all pay grades of all service branches at bases around the 
world.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Officials Meet in Salt Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The scandal that scorched the Olympic  
rings comes full circle this week. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since the million-dollar scheme of cash,  
trips, medical care and scholarships was revealed last November, 
International Olympic Committee leaders return to Salt Lake City, 
where bidders thought they had to buy votes to get the 2002 Winter 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	With those Olympics just 1,000 days away and donations down to a  
trickle, Salt Lake organizers are desperately seeking cash and 
preparing cost-cutting measures that include brown-bag lunches for 
volunteers and no seats for some ticket-buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	And IOC leaders, painted as a bunch of caviar-loving freeloaders  
who can't say no, are struggling to restore the public trust. 
</P>
<P>
	On the heels of the weekend's unveiling of the games' mascot and  
the start of a 1,000-day countdown clock, the visit is the first 
since last June by the task force that coordinates Olympic 
preparations between the Salt Lake Organizing Committee and IOC 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Things have changed drastically since then. The main stadium is  
done, the Olympic Village is under construction and just three 
venues -- the ski jumps, cross-country and biathlon courses and a 
cover for the speedskating oval -- have yet to be finished. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers say all facilities will be ready by the fall of 2000.  
</P>
<P>
	But the biggest differences the commission will find are in the  
leadership, finances and style of the SLOC, all directly linked to 
the scandal that broke with a local TV report last November and 
quickly spread worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Greeting the commission will be Mitt Romney, a venture  
capitalist and third organizing committee president since Salt Lake 
was awarded the games in 1995. He is trying to right the ship and 
avoid red ink at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
	While dealing with subjects ranging from transportation to  
tickets, the commission will work in offices where the staff is 
about two-thirds its planned level. It will review a $1.45 billion 
budget Romney wants to cut by $84 million, with a $300 million hole 
to fill in sponsor fees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mitt Romney will give them a clear picture of where we are  
financially, with the mountains we still must climb in raising an 
unprecedented amount of sponsorship dollars,'' said Shelley Thomas, 
SLOC's senior vice president for communications. ``He will give 
them a state of the union, so to speak, about our situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney, who stepped in when Frank Joklik resigned as president  
at the height of the scandal last winter, has imposed a hiring 
freeze, with 200 people now working for SLOC instead of the planned 
320. 
</P>
<P>
	He's drawn up plans to scrap some spectator seating, use  
portable toilets at venues and even ask volunteers to bring their 
own lunches, as he's already done with SLOC's board. There may also 
be some trimming of the five-star treatment the IOC itself receives 
during the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will let them know that we are running lean, we intend to  
continue to run lean, that we are going to find new ways to 
accomplish additional goals,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Romney will also play host -- literally -- to the visitors. Thomas  
said a dinner at the new president's home is the only social event 
on the calendar for the four-day meeting that starts Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's quite a change. Salt Lake bidders got in trouble by being  
too lavish with hospitality, offering dinners, ski trips and 
courtside seats at Utah Jazz games, among other inducements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz, locked in a first-round playoff series with  
Sacramento, could be playing at home during the meetings. But if 
IOC members want to catch some NBA action in the Delta Center, 
they'll have to do it on their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have an entertainment budget to purchase tickets for  
Jazz games,'' Thomas said.	   What the SLOC does have is hope. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a survey by one prominent sponsor, John Hancock, that  
showed a plunge in public support for the Olympics and their 
corporate partners, Thomas said the drought in sponsor sign-ups may 
be ending. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC on Friday announced the first new national sponsor in  
nearly a year. Marker Ltd. of Salt Lake will supply all the 
uniforms for staff at the games, a sponsorship worth at least $20 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Utah companies have agreed to donate the medals and  
natural gas for the games. O.C. Tanner Co. is a maker of awards 
jewelry and Questar Corp. is the state's biggest natural gas 
company. The value of those deals is between $5 million and $10 
million each. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas said that, strangely, the scandal might now be producing  
new marketing opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is activity out there,'' she said. ``I don't know how to  
explain it, but there is more awareness that the Winter Olympics 
will be in Salt Lake City in 2002 than ever before, and I think 
there is a feeling that more eyes will be watching these games 
following what has just occurred in the Olympic movement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe it's American corporate pride, and we're going to make  
this a positive experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC, meanwhile, struggles with its own image. Despite the  
largest purge in its history, with 10 members expelled or 
resigning, the international committee remains under fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics complain that the case of a prominent member, Phil Coles  
of Australia, remains open despite mounting evidence of abuse of 
power. They also point to a bloated, 80-member reform commission 
answering to IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch as a sure sign 
the committee wants to remain a closed-door club. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic officials insist that perception is wrong, and  
rebuilding efforts will be part of the trip to Salt Lake. Thomas 
said the IOC planned daily news briefings to try to clear the air 
and strengthen ties with Salt Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	``I see an effort on their part to be more available, to be more  
forthcoming with information,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	 *End Adv for May 15-16

<HEADLINE> Pistons Fight Back Against Atlanta  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Facing elimination, the Detroit  
Pistons went back to an old formula. They let their guards take 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Dumars, of course, was part of the 1989-90 championship  
tandem -- sharing the backcourt with Isiah Thomas. Now, Dumars has 
Lindsey Hunter on his wing. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the third game of their first-round series with Atlanta,  
it almost looked like Thomas was back. Hunter was diving for balls, 
breaking up passes and generally playing playoff-style basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, Detroit beat the Hawks 79-63 and lived to play  
again after the lowest-scoring game in NBA playoff history. Atlanta 
still owns a 2-1 edge in the best-of-5 series and can eliminate the 
Pistons tonight at The Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Pistons are vowing to go out with a fight.  
</P>
<P>
	``We can't let up now,'' said Dumars, who will retire at the end  
of this season. ``We're still on the brink of elimination. When 
you're on the brink, you have to play desperate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his hustle, Hunter had 13 points, four assists  
and three steals in Game 3. He also managed to keep Atlanta guard 
Mookie Blaylock in check, holding him to just eight points. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't play the first two games like I did in the regular  
season, but I had to put that behind me,'' Hunter said. ``I love 
the challenge of battling Mookie. He outplayed me two games in a 
row and I was determined not to let it be three.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another key for the Pistons was their ability to contain Dikembe  
Mutombo, the Hawks' 7-foot-2 center. In the first two games, 
Mutombo dominated and Atlanta routed the Pistons, winning each game 
by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Game 3, the Pistons never had fewer than two bodies on  
Mutombo. 
</P>
<P>
	They knocked him around a little bit, too. With 6:22 to go in  
the third quarter, Mutombo drove the lane only to be banged to the 
floor by Grant Hill. It was Hill's fourth foul, but the Pistons had 
sent a message: Someone other than Mutombo would have to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It speaks volumes of him and not wanting to give up,'' said  
Dumars, who had 11 points, including 3-of-4 from 3-point range. ``A 
year or two ago, I don't know if he'd take that foul. I think he's 
growing up, and that play kind of displays that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the Hawks were not pleased.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if it was a message foul,'' Hawks coach Lenny  
Wilkens said. ``But if you don't go for the ball, the referee has 
to have the courage to call the flagrant foul. That's not asking 
them to give us something, that's the rule.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 63 points were the fewest ever scored by the Hawks in a  
playoff game and the second-lowest in NBA history, topped only by 
the 54 points by Utah in last year's NBA Finals against the Chicago 
Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hawks' previous low was 71 in 1950 when they were the  
Tri-Cities Black Hawks. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlanta's 27 points in the first half was the lowest half in  
Hawks' playoff history. The club's previous low-water mark was 28 
in the second half against Chicago on May 10, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will come out next game attacking the basket,'' Mutombo  
said. ``We are going to make adjustments and trap more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Pistons can force a fifth game, it will be played Sunday  
in Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Dell, Micron Settle FTC Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two of the largest computer makers have agreed  
to provide consumers with ``clear, readable and understandable 
information in their lease advertising,'' the Federal Trade 
Commission says. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer Corp. and Micron Electronics Inc. settled  
government charges they misled consumers with Internet 
advertisements to lease new computers with low monthly payments. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC said Thursday that ads from Dell and Micron included  
important cost information in inconspicuous or unreadable fine 
print, or they omitted the information. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers want to know what's what, and advertisers have an  
obligation to tell them,'' said Jodie Bernstein, director of the 
FTC's Bureau of Competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC settlement, approved 4-0 by the commission, becomes  
final after a 60-day public comment period. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Dell, Libba Letton, described the problems  
with the company's ads as ``relatively minor and isolated, and they 
were quickly and easily addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dell is the nation's top direct-sale computer maker, with sales  
last year of $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Micron, the third-largest direct-sales manufacturer, did not  
return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	Under lease offers, consumers pay little or no money up front  
for a new computer but pay a monthly fee of $150 or less, typically 
for two or three years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the lease, consumers can return the machine and  
lease a new one with the latest technology, or they can buy the 
older computer for its market value, usually a set percentage of 
its original price. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the long term, leasing a computer is almost always more  
expensive than buying one -- even if the purchase is charged to a 
credit card. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC charged that ads from Dell failed to adequately explain  
to consumers that low monthly payments applied to a lease and not 
to a purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Some pricing information on Internet ads from Dell and Micron  
actually was located on linked Web pages, the FTC charged. 
</P>
<P>
	``The consumer had to scroll down or click on a link to get the  
full information that Dell provided, and the FTC didn't think that 
was adequate,'' Letton said.

<HEADLINE> Parties Vie for Kosovo Bill Kudos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A legislative package financing the airstrikes  
on Yugoslavia has Republicans crowing that they are rebuilding a 
hollowed-out military while Democrats can say they outmaneuvered 
the GOP over how federal surpluses should be used. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after House-Senate negotiators struck a compromise on the  
$15 billion spending bill, earlier White House veto threats all but 
vanished. Clinton administration officials claimed victories for 
limiting GOP-sought defense increases and environmental 
restrictions and winning funds for U.S. farmers and victims of 
domestic and overseas natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	``This bill is vastly improved upon the legislation and  
expectations we were looking at just one month ago,'' said Linda 
Ricci, spokeswoman for the White House budget office. ``We expect 
the president will be presented with a bill he can sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans latched onto the bill's defense funds as a triumph  
for their side. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly $12 billion of the measure is for the U.S. role in the  
NATO campaign against Yugoslavia and other Pentagon programs, 
doubling the money President Clinton sought. Republicans who 
control Congress were eager to use that to burnish their 
pro-defense reputation, arguing that the bill is a first step 
toward reinvigorating a military that Clinton has allowed to 
shrivel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite our differences over the administration's Balkan  
policy, this bill sends a strong message to our troops in the field 
that the Congress supports them,'' said House Appropriations 
Committee Chairman Bill Young, R-Fla., one of the bill's chief 
authors. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were bragging about language forbidding the federal  
government from grabbing any of the $246 billion tobacco companies 
have agreed to pay states in a legal settlement. Clinton had been 
counting on using billions from that kitty for health and 
anti-smoking programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiscal conservatives scored two wins, though both were largely  
symbolic. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly $2 billion of the package's cost will be paid for with  
cuts in domestic programs. Clinton didn't want any cuts, preferring 
to use the federal surplus for the entire cost. 
</P>
<P>
	At the insistence of House and Senate GOP leaders, a provision  
offered by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., was dropped that would have 
provided $140 million to back a $1 billion loan program for 
struggling steel companies. Byrd's prowess for winning home-state 
projects, unparalleled in Congress, has made his proposals an 
enticing target for conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., also benefited when he  
successfully pressured two House GOP negotiators to switch their 
earlier positions and vote to block Byrd's project. After five 
months as speaker in which he has passively let GOP strategy 
evolve, his action was seen by many Republicans as a rare act of 
decisiveness. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House scored some political points on the budget  
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
	With most of the package paid for out of the surplus, which for  
now comes entirely from Social Security, it will be harder for the 
GOP to find money for the tax cuts it wants. It will also be 
tougher for Republicans to claim they are protecting every penny of 
the pension program -- a claim they want to drum into voters' minds 
in time for next year's elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``Republicans adopted the same tax-and-spend policy Democrats  
used for many years,'' said Stanley Collender, a budget analyst for 
Fleishman-Hilliard Inc., the consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials boasted that they blocked a loan-guarantee  
program for oil and gas companies, narrowed a bid to let mining 
companies expand toxic dump sites and blocked an effort to lift 
fishing restrictions in Alaska's Glacier Bay National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	But environmental groups complained that too many  
anti-environmental provisions survived. These included items 
offered by Western senators delaying new rules that would force 
mining companies to pay more for cleanups and boosting royalties 
owed by oil companies drilling on public lands. 
</P>
<P>
	``He really should veto this thing,'' said Marty Hayden,  
political director of the Earthjustice Legal Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats may also benefit from something that did not happen.  
</P>
<P>
	Republican bargainers blocked an amendment by Sen. Tom Harkin  
D-Iowa, that would have added $5 billion in emergency farm aid. 
Though they lost the money, Democrats hope they can use the vote as 
an issue in the 2000 congressional races.

<HEADLINE> Group Unites Dead Cops' Families </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                       *Assiated Press Writer    	
</P>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The news of a cop fighting for his life drew  
Molly Winters into her past. Another family was about to relive her 
nightmare of eight years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Winters did not know Indiana Conservation Officer Karl Kelley  
when she heard of his drowning accident last April. But she drove 
108 miles from her home in Muncie, Ind., to the Louisville, Ky. 
hospital where he was clinging to life in case his family needed 
any help. 
</P>
<P>
	They did. When Kelley died hours later, Winters was there for  
his wife and kids. Now they are friends, bound by common tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	``After something like that happens, you just barely get through  
each day, let alone trying to make any kind of major decisions,'' 
said Laura Kelley Jones, one of Kelley's grown children. 
</P>
<P>
	Winters is a member of Concerns of Police Survivors, or COPS, a  
15-year-old group dedicated to helping spouses, children and 
co-workers of those killed in the line of duty. The survivors offer 
emotional support, run errands, complete paperwork, help organize 
funerals and sometimes become friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Winters and Jones are to be in Washington this weekend at  
National Police Week ceremonies honoring officers killed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just good to be around a couple thousand other people who  
are going through the same thing, and knowing you're not the only 
one,'' said Jones, who was at a candlelight vigil in Washington on 
Thursday as her father's name was carved into the stone of the 
National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	It was at a similar event 16 years ago that 10 police widows  
came up with the idea for COPS. Fifteen years later, there are 37 
national chapters and about 9,000 families involved. COPS' annual 
seminars have expanded from serving just spouses to include 
officers' co-workers, children and other relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to cry, or laugh, or if you feel like screaming or  
whatever, you don't feel uncomfortable,'' said Winters, whose 
husband was shot to death in 1990 while working for the Muncie 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone around you has gone through the same thing. They  
understand if you're laughing and crying about your officer at the 
same time,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Detective Douglas Shugars of the U.S. Capitol Police has  
volunteered his time for nine years during police week at the COPS 
for Kids seminars. But this year he is seeking healing for himself. 
</P>
<P>
	His partner and friend, Detective John Gibson, was shot and  
killed July 24 when a man entered the U.S. Capitol and opened fire 
on staffers and tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right after John was shot, my mind raced with thoughts,''  
Shugars said. ``I knew a little of what I was going to experience 
from working with the kids, but I had no idea the magnitude of the 
emotions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Winters formed the Indiana chapter of COPS in 1998. Like COPS  
volunteers across the country, she responds to hospitals when 
officers are shot or gravely injured. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to give back what I was given,'' Winters explained.  
</P>
<P>
	So does Jones. She said the outpouring of help she received  
after her father's death makes her want to get involved with COPS. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember a lot of names and faces in the days  
following the accident,'' Jones said. ``I just remember there were 
people who had been through the same thing who were bending over 
backwards to help.''

<HEADLINE> Doctor Testifies in Lewis Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Weeks before Reggie Lewis collapsed and died while  
practicing jump shots, his doctor told reporters the Boston Celtics 
star had a minor fainting condition that should not impede his 
basketball career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am optimistic that under medical supervision Mr. Reggie  
Lewis will be able to return to professional basketball without 
limitation,'' Gilbert Mudge said at a May 10, 1993, news conference 
marking Lewis' release from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	A video of that news conference was played Thursday for jurors  
at Mudge's malpractice trial as Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, 
wept. Harris-Lewis is suing the renowned cardiologist, who treated 
the All-Star in the months before he died. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis was 27 when he died of cardiac arrhythmia while practicing  
at Brandeis University 11 weeks after Mudge's news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking publicly for the first time since Lewis died, Mudge on  
Thursday testified his assessment that Lewis had neurocardiogenic 
syncope, a condition that causes fainting spells and is not related 
to the heart, was never a ``definitive diagnosis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge also said there were ``ongoing concerns'' Lewis might have  
a potentially fatal cardiac ailment. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet at the news conference -- and, according to Harris-Lewis, in  
private -- Mudge did not say he was concerned about a heart 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
	``After extensive testing, evaluation and review of all data, I  
believe that Mr. Lewis has a normal athlete's heart with normal 
functions,'' Mudge said then. ``Our testing showed no evidence of 
cardiomyopathy or abnormal life-threatening arrhythmias.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Harris-Lewis' attorney, Robert Harley, asked Mudge if he  
lied at the news conference, the doctor replied, ``What I did say 
was very limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harley suggested that Mudge, suddenly in charge of care for  
``the most famous patient in Boston,'' was under pressure to tell 
Lewis, his wife, the Celtics and the public what they wanted to 
hear: that Lewis' condition was not as serious as first believed, 
and that he would play in the National Basketball Association 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	A team of 12 doctors at New England Baptist Hospital initially  
diagnosed Lewis with cardiac arrhythmia after he collapsed during a 
playoff game in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lewises turned to Mudge at Brigham and Women's Hospital for  
a second opinion, and he initially agreed. But after further tests, 
Mudge revised the diagnosis and told Lewis he had neurocardiogenic 
syncope. 
</P>
<P>
	Harris-Lewis sued Mudge and consultants Mark Creager and Peter  
Friedman, claiming they misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband's 
heart condition. A third consultant later settled for an 
undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	Mudge was expected to continue testifying today.

<HEADLINE> Fed Bond Funds: Handle With Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spectacularly successful as they have been with  
many other types of investments, mutual funds don't score very high 
in the huge market for U.S. government securities. 
</P>
<P>
	As of the latest tally by Morningstar Inc. in Chicago,  
government-bond mutual funds had assets of about $115 billion -- in 
a market where the amount of securities outstanding runs to several 
trillion dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	General and specialty bond funds, which invest in corporate and  
other types of bonds, are more than three times as big as 
government-bond funds, with combined assets of about $390 billion. 
Municipal bond funds, at a little more than $300 billion in assets, 
also are much larger. 
</P>
<P>
	Funds that invest in long-term government bonds are so few and  
so small they almost qualify as an endangered species, with less 
than $6 billion in their coffers. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not as though they are dealing in something dangerous or  
obscure. Bonds issued by the U.S. Treasury are generally accepted 
as the safest investment you can make, and they are very popular 
with individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The story of why government funds aren't any bigger than they  
are sheds some light on the limitations of the fund concept -- how 
it happens that, with all their benefits, funds aren't the answer 
to every investment need in every situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the things favoring bond funds in general don't carry  
the same weight in the long-term government group,'' observes 
analyst Steve Chung in the Morningstar Mutual Funds research 
service's latest report on the sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``For example, the diversified portfolios of bond funds give  
investors an easy defense against credit risk. But credit risk 
isn't a concern in the realm of U.S. government securities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's assumed that Uncle Sam is the least likely, among all the  
world's issuers of debt, ever to default on a scheduled payment of 
interest or principal. If there ever was a U.S. default, it's also 
assumed that all other debt securities (and stocks too, for that 
matter) would go into the tank as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Want even more assurance? Consider that Uncle Sam, who promises  
to pay off bonds in dollars, has the power to print more dollars in 
case of a shortfall. Such an action might cause severe inflation 
problems, but the contractual promise of the bonds would be 
honored. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung adds, ``Bond funds also give investors access to  
professional money managers who are trained to locate the best 
opportunities in the fixed-income market. However, the 
government-bond market is highly efficient, and few opportunities 
exist for managers to add value.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still another key distinction: Individual investors often find  
it very difficult to buy corporate, municipal or foreign bonds in 
bite-sized amounts at advantageous prices. Commissions and market 
spreads, or the difference between a dealer's buy and sell prices, 
can cost a bundle. 
</P>
<P>
	But Treasury securities can be bought direct from the government  
without commission charges, in denominations as small as $1,000 to 
$10,000. Information on this program is available from any Federal 
Reserve bank or branch. 
</P>
<P>
	And of course, if you invest directly in bonds, you don't have  
to bear the expense of fund management and administrative costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chung is quick to add that government-bond funds aren't devoid  
of any attractions. ``The funds in this group do have some clear 
advantages over individual bonds. Portfolio construction and 
rebalancing is easier using funds, for example,'' he notes. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, in a fund portfolio the interest payments tend be spread  
out evenly over time, allowing for that money to be reinvested 
continuously through the ups and downs of the interest rate cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	If all your money is tied up in a single bond, you run the risk  
that its interest-payment or maturity date will come at a time when 
interest rates are low and the options for reinvesting the money 
aren't attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	However -- and this is a big however -- if you want an investment  
that matures at a set time, bonds are likely to fill the bill much 
better than a bond fund, which as a managed portfolio has no set 
maturity date.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Rig Count Up by 2 / Oil and Gas Rig Count  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- The number of rigs actively exploring for oil and  
natural gas in the United States rose by two Friday to 507, the 
second time the count has moved above 500 for in six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the rigs running nationwide this week, 142 were exploring for  
oil and 365 for gas, Houston-based Baker Hughes Inc. reported. 
During the same week last year, 876 rigs were operating in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes has kept track of the count since 1944. The tally  
peaked at 4,530 on Dec. 28, 1981, during the height of the oil 
boom, but has set record lows in nine of the last 17 weeks. The 
latest was 498 on April 9. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite recent gains, weak oil and gas prices over the past year  
are to blame for the lack of drilling activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker Hughes says there probably are fewer domestic rigs looking  
for oil and gas now than at any time since industry's emerging days 
of the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the major oil- and gas-producing states, Wyoming gained five  
rigs and Louisiana added two. 
</P>
<P>
	Oklahoma lost four, Texas fell by three and California slipped  
by one. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska and New Mexico were unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Gun Issue Tricky for GOP Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The abrupt shift on gun control by  
congressional Republicans underscores the difficulty facing GOP 
presidential candidates tackling the tricky issue in the wake of 
the Colorado school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, an old GOP ally, appeared to win  
a major victory Wednesday when the Senate rejected a Democratic 
measure requiring background checks of firearms sales at gun shows. 
The Senate passed a measure by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, to make 
the checks voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders retreated under pressure Thursday from  
rank-and-file Republicans, including presidential candidate John 
McCain of Arizona. He and several other senators said they were 
unhappy with Wednesday's vote, even though they had voted in favor 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a realization that there was a loophole that had to  
be closed,'' McCain said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 48-47 Friday to approve a measure establishing  
a system of background checks for all buyers of firearms at gun 
shows, overriding criticism from Democrats and the White House that 
new loopholes will give criminals access to firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an overly burdensome requirement in the face of  
the tragic shootings at Columbine,'' McCain said after the vote 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional change-of-course reflects a growing sentiment  
in Washington that voters want new limits on guns. Several party 
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said private polling 
conducted after last month's shooting at Columbine High School in 
Colorado reveals strong support for gun control, even among 
Republican primary voters. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a marked shift from the past.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of that polling has been conducted for Elizabeth Dole, the  
former American Red Cross leader who ranks second in most GOP 
presidential polls. In a series of high-profile announcements, Mrs. 
Dole opposed concealed-weapons laws and supported bans on assault 
weapons and armor-piercing bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advisers are betting that the issue will help her build a  
base of female voters and pull moderate Democrats into GOP 
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	An added bonus: The against-the-grain stances drew attention to  
her candidacy just as her campaign appeared stalled, aides say 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for Democrats and Republicans to put  
consensus before confrontation so we can get tough on crime,'' Mrs. 
Dole said Friday during a campaign swing through Iowa. That means 
``instant background checks should be required wherever guns are 
commercially sold,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to help the police fight crime,'' she said. ``I do not  
see a reason for a family to have an assault weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early GOP favorite, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is harder to  
pin down. 
</P>
<P>
	He expressed support for background checks in Texas, but did so  
only after a bill to that effect died in the state legislature. The 
governor later explained that he never endorsed the bill, which he 
said had many flaws, and urged Congress to address the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said Thursday that Bush would not have supported the  
Democratic gun show measure defeated in the Senate. Bush believes 
the bill would have imposed too many regulations and given too much 
power to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, spokesman 
David Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush favored the Craig proposal, though he would prefer the  
checks be mandatory, Beckwith said. Hours later, the GOP-led Senate 
reversed course and seemed to adopt Bush's position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it should be required that any vendor ... should have  
access to (the federal database) and required to use it,'' Beckwith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander, competing with Bush and Dole for moderate GOP  
voters, said shortly after the Colorado shooting that future 
massacres ``will not be stopped by more laws coming out of 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a subtle shift, the former Tennessee governor took no  
position on the bill Thursday but spokesman Steve Schmidt said, 
``Federal gun control legislation is something that Gov. Alexander 
is not opposed to, to keep guns out of the hands of people who 
shouldn't have them: Criminals, the insane and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative businessman Steve Forbes said he would have  
supported Craig's measure, but called it a ``quick fix'' and said 
the solution to mounting violence is ``reshaping our culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rest of the GOP candidates oppose any new  
restrictions on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle and conservative activist Gary  
Bauer said they support voluntary, not mandatory, background checks 
at gun shows. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire opposed even the 
Craig measure, and was among a small group of Republican senators 
who voted against an attempt to stiffen it on the floor on Friday.

	``It is a miracle and it is a blessing,'' said the boy's mother,  
Karen Kraus. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessy, who is 17 months old, was released Friday from HCA Wesley  
Medical Center 12 hours after his nationally televised rescue from 
the well in his back yard in Mulvane, 20 miles south of Wichita. He 
had been trapped 16 feet below ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Firefighters had to dig a hole by hand alongside the well to get  
him out because they feared the use of heavy equipment would injure 
him. Rescuers and neighbors cheered when firefighter Tim Deneen 
brought Jessy to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
	``He smiled for me. He knew me. He looked at me. It is a smile I  
won't ever forget,'' Mrs. Kraus said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jessy suffered from exposure and some scrapes, Dr. Curt Pickert  
said at the Wichita hospital. The boy ate a plate of scrambled eggs 
at the hospital, then went home to take a nap. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little boy is going to live and have a normal life thanks to  
them,'' said Annie Schlaegel, the boy's grandmother, of his 
rescuers. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kraus and her husband, Jerry, who also have an 8-year-old  
son, Cody, were digging the dirt well in a new subdivision. They 
wouldn't say why they needed the well, which is only 8 to 10 inches 
wide and 25 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities said the well was probably being dug to water  
the yard. Private wells are common and not illegal in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	The ordeal was reminiscent of that of a Texas toddler more than  
a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In Midland, Texas, in 1987, the case of 18-month-old Jessica  
McClure created a nationwide sensation after she fell into an 
abandoned well and became trapped 22 feet down in a hole 8 inches 
wide. It took emergency crews 2 1/2 days to reach the little girl. 
</P>
<P>
	Kraus, a truck driver, saw his son fall in but couldn't reach  
him in time, Sedgwick County Fire Marshal Greg Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``All it took was one second,'' Mrs. Kraus said.  
</P>
<P>
	Under flood lights, about 50 emergency workers dug a hole  
alongside the well shaft, seven feet away. The distraught parents 
mostly stayed inside as rescuers worked to reach the boy. 
</P>
<P>
	Oxygen tubes were lowered into the well and warm air was pumped  
in to keep the boy from getting too cold. Lumber was used to shore 
up the well's sides to prevent rocks and dirt from falling on 
Jessy. 
</P>
<P>
	After the shaft was dug, rescuers tunneled over to the well 2  
feet below the boy. As they got closer, they could hear him 
whimpering. 
</P>
<P>
	``My stomach was churning the whole time, knowing what he must  
be going through,'' Deneen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Deneen feverishly clawed through the last few inches of dirt to  
reach Jessy, then caressed the boy's tiny, mud-encrusted feet and 
told him: ``Hang in there, just a few more minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Deneen cleared enough space behind Jessy's head to  
insert a backboard the child could be strapped to. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's my little buddy,'' Deneen told Mrs. Kraus as she rushed  
to see Jessy. ``I know he is your kid, but he is special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A video camera lowered into the well helped rescuers get to the  
boy, who tugged on a rope during the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	Choking back tears at a news conference, Jerry Kraus said he  
couldn't think of a word big enough to thank everybody. Mrs. Kraus 
found some words of her own. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think you are heroes, and we want to thank God for letting  
us keep Jessy,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Judge Rejects Memphis Police Quotas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) -- Racial quotas used by the Memphis Police  
Department to promote black officers for more than two decades have 
been ruled unconstitutional by a federal judge. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Jerome Turner set a June 30 hearing to  
determine how much money should be awarded to white officers who 
were denied promotions because of the quotas. 
</P>
<P>
	The city began using a quota system in the early 1970s under  
pressure from the U.S. Justice Department to try to remedy past 
discrimination against black officers. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 100 white officers sued in 1989 and 1990 after they  
were passed over for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, the city created race-neutral tests. The ``validated''  
tests measure job-related abilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, if the city had developed such a validated test, the  
city would be released from the obligations to use affirmative 
action,'' Turner said in his ruling Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The court finds that the city could have developed a validated  
testing procedure prior to 1988, and that its attempts to do so 
were meager.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City attorney Louis Britt had no comment on whether the city  
will appeal.

<HEADLINE> Threats Force Class To End Early </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLEN, Texas (AP) -- The school board in this Dallas suburb has  
canceled the remaining two weeks of class for all 9,800 students 
because of repeated bomb threats following the Colorado school 
massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents were angry and students puzzled when they found the  
schools closed on Friday morning. The board's decision was reached 
only hours earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sure we can guarantee the safety of every student.  
We had to err on the side of caution,'' said district spokesman Tim 
Carroll. ``We have to assume every threat is real even if deep down 
a lot of us think these are kids, these are threats, these are just 
jokes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen schools received 11 bomb threats this week, but no bombs  
were found. A 15-year-old middle school student was charged with 
calling in a threat from his school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said the threats were taken more seriously because of  
the assault that left 15 people dead at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo., last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it's ridiculous,'' parent Kurt Dowd said of the  
cancellation. ``I think they're playing right into the hands of 
these people that are perpetrating this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Allen High School, students were allowed inside Friday -- but  
only after passing newly installed metal detectors -- to gather 
backpacks and other belongings. Few took the threats seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kids trying to test the system,'' Vinh Nguyen said. ``I  
don't think they mean to hurt anybody, they just want to get out of 
school. I'm pretty ticked off. They got what they wanted.''

<HEADLINE> Former Auburn Star Signs With Agent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Former Auburn receiver Robert Baker, paroled  
in March after serving 10 months of a 15-year sentence for drug 
trafficking, will take his chances with the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the question is whether any NFL team will take a chance on  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``For our football team, we wouldn't mess with him,'' said Bruce  
Lemmerman, director of college scouting for the New Orleans Saints. 
``Does he get an opportunity? It will be hard. How do you sell it 
to your fans? They're going to look at this guy's past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, who had one year of college eligibility left, has signed  
with an agent and will enter the NFL's supplemental draft. His 
agent, Rick Davis of West Palm Beach, Fla., was skeptical at first. 
But Davis is also the lawyer for former Auburn coach Terry Bowden, 
who recommended he speak to Baker. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm real impressed after talking with him,'' Davis told the  
Mobile Register. ``He's sorry for what he did and he knows he made 
a mistake. Some people will never let him forget it. But he has an 
opportunity to influence people in a positive way now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis did not return calls from The Associated Press seeking  
comment Friday. NFL spokesman Greg Aiello was out of the office and 
unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker, 23 of Gainesville, Fla., met with new coach Tommy  
Tuberville shortly after his release about possibly returning this 
fall as a fifth-year senior. But he dropped out of school this week 
and will enter the draft in either June or July. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told him he would enhance his position in the draft if he  
went back to school,'' Davis said. ``We didn't recruit him. This 
was his decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baker hasn't played football in three years. He led Auburn with  
1,174 all-purpose yards in 1996, including 526 yards receiving. He 
was academically ineligible for the 1997 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Baker was sentenced in May 1998 after pleading guilty to  
trafficking cocaine. The mandatory three-year sentence for 
trafficking was waived.

<HEADLINE>  Worldy Manner Is Preakness Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A tuneup in the Kentucky Derby might be just  
what Worldly Manner needed to get ready for Saturday's $1 million 
Preakness Stakes at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant trainer Tom Albertrani said the Dubai-based colt has  
thrived at Churchill Downs since his seventh-place finish in the 
Derby on May 1 -- Worldly Manner's first race as a 3-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the Derby in great shape, and we're  
confident,'' Albertrani said Thursday. ``The Derby tuned him up a 
little. He's put on weight and he's more focused.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The race served as a prep of sorts for Worldly Manner, who spent  
seven months training in the Dubai desert and had only one private 
trial race before shipping to Louisville less than two weeks before 
the Run for the Roses. 
</P>
<P>
	But his strong effort in the 1 1/4-mile Derby -- he was contending  
for the lead with Cat Thief entering the stretch -- was received 
well by owners Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum and Sheikh Maktoum al 
Maktoum. Charismatic, a 31-1 shot, won the Derby by a neck over 
Menifee in a 19-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
	``Worldly Manner ran a very credible race, and we were pleased  
with it,'' Albertrani said. ``We were excited at the quarter pole, 
but the last 100 yards he got a little weary. You can say he will 
improve off that race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Preakness distance is 1 3-16 miles, 1-16th of a mile shorter  
than the Derby. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner, who will be ridden again by Jerry Bailey, leaves  
from the No. 10 post and was 12-1 in the morning line. In his final 
workout Tuesday, he went 5 furlongs in 1:01 at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner was trained by Bob Baffert as a 2-year-old, but  
John Mabee sold the colt for a reported $5 million. Before the 
Derby, Worldly Manner's last race was a victory in the Del Mar 
Futurity in September. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Saeed bin Suroor might consider changing his training  
methods and send the sheikh's horses to run in traditional Derby 
preps, Albertrani said: ``Maybe in the future we'll try a different 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe he needed a race mentally more than physically,'' he  
added. ``Jerry asked him to come out running and he didn't realize 
he was going to take the bit and keep it.''

<HEADLINE> Pipe Bombs Found on Ind. Van </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAZIL, Ind. (AP) -- A 13-year-old boy with a grudge against a  
girl at school was arrested Friday on suspicion of planting at 
least seven pipe bombs -- one of which exploded -- on two vehicles 
belonging to her parents. 
</P>
<P>
	The boy was taken out of his middle school by police and is  
scheduled to appear in juvenile court next week. 
</P>
<P>
	A pipe bomb attached to Tonya M. Corn's van and exploded Friday  
as she was driving, but she was not hurt. Police later found two 
unexploded bombs that fell off her van and four more pipe bombs 
attached to her husband's vehicle at the couple's home. 
</P>
<P>
	``It all happened today, and we ain't in the mood to discuss  
nothing,'' Mike Corn said. ``We've told our story to the police 30 
or 40 times today already.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The boy's name was not released.  
</P>
<P>
	State Trooper David Kuhn said the couple told police several  
weeks ago that the boy was stalking the family. The stalking began 
after the couple's daughter told school officials the boy had 
brought a gun to school, Kuhn said. 
</P>
<P>
	School Superintendent Thomas Rohr said rumors that the boy had  
brought a gun to school were never confirmed.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Plant Recalls Packaged Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Nearly 17,000 pounds of ready-to-eat meat  
products are being recalled after inspectors detected listeria 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The bacteria was found in only one brand of the packaged meat,  
but White Packing Co. is voluntary recalling 16 brands processed at 
its plant in Williamston and distributed in North Carolina, South 
Carolina, New York, New Jersey and Virginia, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reports of illnesses.  
</P>
<P>
	Samples taken from packages of Western Beef Cooked Sliced Ham  
processed on May 4 confirmed the presence of listeria, a kind of 
bacteria that can cause high fever, severe headache, neck 
stiffness, nausea and can lead to death. 
</P>
<P>
	Products affected by the recall include: Jesse Jones brand thick  
bologna, premium ham and premium chopped ham; Super A brand cooked 
salami, luncheon loaf, chicken bologna and bologna; Western Beef 
brand cooked salami, luncheon loaf, beef bologna, turkey bologna, 
bologna, chicken bologna and sliced cooked ham; Shop Rite brand 
cooked salami and Olymel brand sliced cooked ham. 
</P>
<P>
	Only products bearing a sell-by date of June 23 are affected by  
the recall. Buyers can return the product to the store for a 
refund.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Forecaster Lacks Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- William Gray, a scientist who has  
been issuing a closely read hurricane forecast every year for more 
than a decade, may be forced out of the prediction business for 
lack of funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't get money,'' said Gray, a professor at Colorado State  
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, 69, used to get funding from the National Oceanic and  
Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation and the 
insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The insurance industry stopped paying when his federally funded  
research became available for free on the Internet. NOAA has 
rejected his requests for funding for the past six years. The 
Federal Emergency Management Agency also rejected funding. 
</P>
<P>
	His only support now comes from the NSF, $145,000, which after  
overhead and other research, amounts to about $50,000, he said. He 
said he needs $400,000 a year to keep his forecasts coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said he believes his research has been rejected because he  
has publicly questioned the validity of sophisticated computer 
programs -- called numeric models -- that are becoming the dominant 
method of forecasting. The programs use mathematical formulas to 
forecast the weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray uses computer programs but primarily bases his predictions  
on what he calls the cultural method, or study of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	A March 30 rejection letter from NOAA said Gray's grant proposal  
``lacks sufficient discussion of methodology to permit an effective 
evaluation of the approach.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Tomastik of NOAA said the decisions to reject Gray's  
proposals were made by a peer review committee of fellow 
scientists, not the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray's forecasts are read closely along the Atlantic and Gulf  
coasts. 
</P>
<P>
	His forecasts have been close to the mark during the 16 years he  
made predictions, with 1997 the major exception. He predicted seven 
hurricanes with three of them major; only three occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	``More times than not he is on the right side of climatology,''  
said Max Mayfield, deputy director of the National Hurricane Center 
in Coral Gables, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1999 season, Gray has predicted 14 named storms and nine  
hurricanes, four of them major.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States and China tried Friday  
to narrow their differences over NATO's attack on Beijing's embassy 
in Belgrade, one of several conflicts related to Yugoslavia that 
have deadlocked much of the Security Council's work. The two 
countries were working on a council reaction to the embassy attack

troops and special police in Kosovo, hitting heavy armor and arms 
supplies hidden in tunnels. On Friday, NATO bombs hit a convoy of 
ethnic Albanian refugees and killed dozens, Yugoslavia claimed. 
Serb media was reporting 79 bodies had been found. NATO says it's

<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- On a $3 million fund-raising tour of the West

the White House have been ``a labor of love.'' Party patrons were 
paying as much as $25,000 for a weekend meal with Clinton. He spoke 
at a $200,000 Seattle luncheon before heading to a $500,000 dinner 
in the San Francisco Bay area. The president's four-day take for 
Democrats -- with events also in Beverly Hills, San Diego and Las

well-known among health professionals, who point to economics, 
health systems, racism and culture in trying to explain them. ``No 
simple solutions would eliminate these disparities,'' concludes the 
report, released Friday by the Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based

	ST. PETERSBURG BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Pollsters gathering Friday  
said scientific polls could be drowned out by the proliferation of 
Internet surveys that they say don't accurately measure public 
opinion. Now pollsters are considering the possibility of a poll 
rating system that would require pollsters to inform the public and 
the media which polls are conducted with scientific standards. 
Pollsters struggled with the difficult problem during the annual

officials called the move ``another insupportable slight.'' Senate 
and House negotiators dropped the provision this week from a

	NEW YORK (AP) -- With Tim Hardaway finding his scoring touch,  
Alonzo Mourning shutting down Patrick Ewing and Miami's bench 
giving it a sorely needed boost, the Heat staved off elimination 
Friday night by defeating New York 87-72. Hardaway had his highest 
scoring game of the series with 14 points, including a 3-pointer 
that put Miami ahead for good with 7:54 left. Mourning had 16 
points and 13 rebounds and held Ewing to three points and one 
rebound in the second half.

<HEADLINE>  Silverbulletday Takes Stakes Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Silverbulletday showed why she might have won  
the Preakness by overpowering the field in Friday's Black-Eyed 
Susan and smashing the stakes record. 
</P>
<P>
	The best filly in the land was set to run in Saturday's $1  
million Preakness and challenge the boys for the first time. But 
the 3-year-old star drew the outside No. 14 post position, and 
trainer Bob Baffert and owner Mike Pegram decided to scratch her 
from the second leg of the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday, the overwhelming 1-9 favorite, took care of six  
challengers in a hurry in the $200,000 Black-Eyed Susan, winning by 
a comfortable two lengths over Dreams Gallore. Vee Vee Star was 
third, 16 1/2 lengths back. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little like a consolation prize,'' Baffert said. ``I  
know the Black-Eyed Susan is a great race, but we had her ready for 
the Preakness. But I always put her before me and I always will.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Gary Stevens aboard, Silverbulletday won her eighth  
straight race and 11th in 12 career starts. She covered 1 1/8 miles in 
1:47 4-5, 2-5 of a second better than the stakes record set by 
Imaginary Lady in 1989. The winning time was 3-5 of a second off 
the track record set by Private Terms in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaving from the No. 1 post, Silverbulletday took the lead  
around the first turn, and was briefly challenged along the 
backstretch by The Happy Hopper. The daughter of Silver Deputy then 
took charge, moving to a six-length lead with just under 5-16ths of 
a mile left. And even though Dreams Gallore began gaining ground, 
the finish was never in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Baffert and Pegram will always have to answer the question:  
Should Silverbulletday have run in the Preaknees? 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary let her out of the gate and she just went with it,''  
Baffert said. ``From the 14 hole, she would have to sustain that 
run all the way. I don't know if even she could do that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was worth $180,000 to Pegram and boosted  
Silverbulletday's earnings to $2,271,750. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday returned $2.20, $2.10 and $2.10. Dreams Gallore,  
who was second to Silverbulletday in the Kentucky Oaks two weeks 
ago, paid $2.10 and $2.10. Vee Vee Star returned $2.10 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Madison's Charm was fourth, followed by Mysterious Jak, The  
Happy Hopper and Magic Broad, more than 36 lengths behind 
Silverbulletday. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert figured the poor post position for the Preakness was an  
omen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Somebody's trying to tell us not to run,'' Baffert said.  
``She's a great filly. The Preakness is a great race. But these 
fillies come around rarely. I have to be really careful what I 
do.''

<HEADLINE> Threats End Dallas School Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALLEN, Texas (AP) -- The school board in this Dallas suburb  
canceled the remaining two weeks of class Friday for all 9,800 
students because of repeated bomb threats following the Colorado 
school massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents were angry and students puzzled when they found the  
schools closed on Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The school board reached the decision after a meeting that began  
Thursday night and stretched an hour past midnight. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sure we can guarantee the safety of every student.  
We had to err on the side of caution,'' said district spokesman Tim 
Carroll. ``We have to assume every threat is real even if deep down 
a lot of us think these are kids, these are threats, these are just 
jokes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Allen schools received 11 bomb threats this week, but no bombs  
have been found. A 15-year-old middle school student was charged 
with calling in a threat from his school cafeteria. 
</P>
<P>
	Carroll said the threats were taken more seriously because of  
the assault that left 15 people dead at Columbine High School in 
Littleton, Colo., last month. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just think it's ridiculous,'' parent Kurt Dowd said of the  
cancellation. ``I think they're playing right into the hands of 
these people that are perpetrating this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Allen High School, students were allowed inside Friday -- but  
only after passing newly installed metal detectors -- to gather 
backpacks and other belongings. Few of them took the threats 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kids trying to test the system,'' Vinh Nguyen said. ``I  
don't think they mean to hurt anybody, they just want to get out of 
school. I'm pretty ticked off. They got what they wanted.''

<HEADLINE> Jazz or Kings, Blazers Don't Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The question was inevitable, and the  
Portland Trail Blazers handled it like skilled politicians. 
</P>
<P>
	Which team would they rather play in the second round of the  
playoffs, the Utah Jazz or the Sacramento Kings? 
</P>
<P>
	``Careful who you wish for -- you may get 'em,'' Blazers coach  
Mike Dunleavy said. ``Whoever it is, it is. And we'll take care of 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would seem obvious who the Blazers would rather have win the  
surprisingly competitive best-of-5 series. Portland swept all four 
games against Sacramento during the regular season, while the 
Blazers lost two of three to Utah, the two-time defending Western 
Conference champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Blazers point guard Damon Stoudamire was so certain the Jazz  
would win Game 4 against the Kings on Friday night and even the 
series 2-2 that he didn't even plan to watch it on TV. ``I'm going 
out,'' he said, adding that he'd monitor updates from a bar 
downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	``The series isn't over by any means,'' Stoudamire said after  
Friday's 2 1/2-hour practice. ``We need to have a mindset to play 
Utah, and Sacramento would be a bonus. Everybody in here feels 
pretty confident against Sacramento. But against Utah, we'd have to 
take it up to a whole other level.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other Blazers were more leery of the Kings, the only team to  
average more than 100 points a game in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to wipe that slate clean,'' guard Jim Jackson said.  
He recalled a similar situation when he played for Ohio State in 
1992. The Buckeyes had beaten Michigan's Fab Five twice during the 
regular season, then lost to the Wolverines in the NCAA 
tournament's round of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	``In that game, in that situation, they were the better team on  
that night,'' Jackson said. ``So in this series, you see that 
Sacramento is playing a lot better than Utah, even though Utah beat 
them three times during the regular season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arvydas Sabonis, Portland's stoic Lithuanian center, summed up  
the Blazers' confidence when a reporter asked if he was preparing 
differently for the Jazz or the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Same,'' he said simply.  
</P>
<P>
	Blazers guard Isaiah Rider didn't practice Friday because of a  
sprained right knee suffered in Wednesday's series-clinching 
victory over Phoenix. Rider was going for a loose ball when the 
Suns' Tom Gugliotta fell backward into Rider's knee. Dunleavy said 
Rider's condition has improved, and he should be ready when the 
second round begins. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's feeling better,'' Dunleavy said.  
</P>
<P>
	All of the Blazers are feeling fine, having advanced to the  
second round for the first time in seven years. Now they're 
thinking bigger, while holding out hope of regaining homecourt 
advantage for the second round should Sacramento win. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expected to get past the first round,'' Jackson said.  
``It's a good position to be in. It gives you a sense that we've 
already made it to the next level. Now everybody else has to come 
to that next level with us.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls Paper To Back Gore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hearing that The New York Times was about to  
publish a story on the state of Vice President Al Gore's 
presidential campaign, President Clinton picked up a phone and put 
in his two cents' worth. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's take: The campaign, which many pundits say is  
off to a bumpy start, ``is in a lot better shape now than it was 
eight weeks ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Clinton called Thursday night to volunteer his  
impressions. The president said he was not alarmed by the state of 
the campaign and still expects Gore to win the Democratic 
nomination next year. He also acknowledged advising Gore to loosen 
up. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is true that I have urged him to go out there and enjoy  
this,'' Clinton said. ``I have told him to go out and have a good 
time. I want people to know him the way I know him. I want people 
to see him the way I see him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton specifically praised Gore's decision to name former Rep.  
Tony Coelho, D-Calif., as his campaign manager: ``He's a strong man 
and an experienced person and he'll really take a lot of the 
burdens off the vice president.''

<HEADLINE> NBC Kills 'Homicide' After 7 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' has been killed  
off by NBC. The last new episode of the critically acclaimed show 
that has struggled all of its seven years with low ratings will be 
May 21. 
</P>
<P>
	From its premiere in January 1993, the series about a squad of  
Baltimore homicide detectives was never a ratings winner and fought 
for its life year after year. Airing Friday at 10 p.m. EDT, it has 
clung in recent seasons to third place behind ABC's ``20/20'' and 
CBS's cop drama ``Nash Bridges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It won numerous honors, including three Peabody Awards, the most  
recent of them last year for an episode about a commuter pushed 
beneath a subway train. 
</P>
<P>
	Filmed in Baltimore, the series wrapped for the season in March  
with cast and crew uncertain about their future. Official word of 
the cancellation is expected Monday, when NBC announces its fall 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, NBC Entertainment president Garth  
Ancier thanked ``Homicide'' executive producers Barry Levinson and 
Tom Fontana and ``their extremely talented cast and crew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cast member Yaphet Kotto, who lives in Baltimore, said he was  
saddened but not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have been literally emotional, crying in the streets  
and in the stores,'' he told WBAL-TV in Baltimore. ``This is a very 
emotional thing with people who are fans of `Homicide.''' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm speechless. I'm bummed,'' said Tim Lee, who works at his  
family's dry cleaning business and used to chat with the show's 
writers when they dropped off their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I grew up in Baltimore and I'm pretty proud of the city. To  
see something that puts Baltimore on Hollywood's map, and to have 
that canceled is pretty sad,'' he told The (Baltimore) Sun.

<HEADLINE> Mark Tuinei Remembered at Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Mark Tuinei was remembered for how he lived, not  
how he died. 
</P>
<P>
	At the funeral service Thursday night for the former Dallas  
Cowboys offensive lineman, there was no talk about how, on his last 
night in Dallas before a planned move back to Hawaii, he ingested a 
fatal combination of the drugs, including heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 6-foot-5, 320-pound lineman, who died May 6, was  
remembered as a big man with an even bigger heart, a guy who would 
patiently sign autographs until every fan who wanted one had one, a 
man who downplayed his own achievements to focus on making those 
around him feel important. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not ashamed of my brother,'' said Tom Tuinei, who then  
read from Scripture. ``Let he who is without sin among you cast the 
first stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's casket was draped with a Dallas Cowboys blanket and a  
Cowboys flag was displayed in the church. Nieces and nephews wore 
jerseys with Tuinei's No. 71 and the words ``Uncle Mark'' on the 
back as they scampered across the grassy grounds of Central Union 
Church, where he married his wife, Pono, in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Signed as a free agent in 1983, Dallas intended to try Tuinei as  
a defensive lineman. Instead, he became an anchor on an offensive 
line that led the Cowboys to Super Bowl championships in 1993, 1994 
and 1996. He retired in 1998 after being felled by a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He was laid to rest wearing one of his Super Bowl rings. A  
football and other personal items also were placed in the casket. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. William Olds, a former ROTC instructor at the University of  
Hawaii who Tuinei credited with helping to set him straight, said 
it was Tuinei alone who decided to abandon a life of trouble to 
make something of himself and make his family proud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then, he felt like the whole world was against him, that  
trouble followed him all around,'' Olds said of when Tuinei came to 
him for help in the early 1980s. ``He came to me and said he needed 
to get his life on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olds likened Tuinei to the lead character in the television show  
``Touched by an Angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark Tuinei was my angel,'' Olds said, choking back tears. ``I  
sincerely believe he was here to touch the lives of many people. 
And he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's best friend of nearly 25 years, J.K. Spielman, recalled  
how his buddy was always thinking about others. He retold a story 
about Tuinei being given a limousine to attend a taping of a local 
Dallas television show hosted by Cowboy teammate Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	After taping the show, the limo took Tuinei and his guests to a  
restaurant, but then Tuinei made the limo driver take him home so 
he could get his own car so the driver could go home and spend time 
with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so large in stature, yet so soft in his heart,''  
Spielman said. ``He touched the lives of more people in 39 years 
than most of us will in 80.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Spielman and Olds said Tuinei never expressed any personal  
troubles in the weeks leading up to his death, and both expressed 
shock at the fact he died from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``One bad choice and, unfortunately, that's how it ended,''  
Spielman said. ``I know he did not have a problem that way because 
I knew him very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No members of the Cowboys attended the memorial service. A  
service was held last week in Dallas and was attended by many 
present and former Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those at the Hawaii service were Arizona coach Dick Tomey,  
who coached Tuinei at Hawaii; former Hawaii teammate and former San 
Francisco 49er Jesse Sapolu; former NFL pro and Hawaii teammate 
Rich Miano; and current Hawaii coach June Jones.

<HEADLINE> Heat Face Elimination Tonight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's time to find out if Pat Riley has another  
bit of motivational magic up his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's Miami Heat are on the brink of elimination tonight in  
Game 4 of their first-round series against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we've worked for, everything we've talked about is  
on the brink. We've got to bring it all and play well,'' Riley said 
Thursday. ``It can't just be a maniacal effort, it's got to be a 
maniacal effort with effective offense and defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big part of that equation will be Tim Hardaway, whose play has  
been unproductive throughout the series with the exception of his 
11 assists in Game 2. Hardaway still wasn't talking Thursday, so 
his numbers were left to speak for themselves: 6-for-32 from the 
field, 1-for-14 from 3-point range, 22 total points and one 
ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidently, things haven't been going his way thus far,''  
teammate Alonzo Mourning said, ``but I know he can turn things 
around. I've seen him turn things around, and this series is far 
from being over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway had a miserable night in Game 3 as the Heat lost by 24  
-- their second blowout defeat in the series. He shot just 1-for-8, 
including 0-for-5 on 3-pointers, and lost his composure by getting 
ejected early in the fourth quarter when he realized the game was a 
lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
	At practice Thursday, Hardaway refused to speak to the media and  
stood on the court shooting while his teammates tried to come up 
with explanations for his slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y'all keep talking about Timmy, Timmy, and Timmy's our point  
guard,'' Mourning said. ``But listen to me, we've got a lot of 
confidence in him. He knows what he has to do to get us going, and 
he's capable of doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim's a competitor and a clutch player all his career, and if  
anybody can come back, he can,'' Dan Majerle said. ``Tim's our 
leader obviously, but if Tim's not doing it someone else has to do 
it. Look at everybody's numbers, except Zo's, and they're down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Heat's second-leading scorer in this series is  
Voshon Lenard, who has been limited to 23 minutes of garbage time 
in Game 1 and Game 3, but has 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Take away Lenard's 6-for-8 shooting from 3-point range, and the  
rest of the Heat are a shocking 8-for-49. At one point in Game 3, 
they were 0-for-17 from behind the arc. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley seemed to hint that Lenard might get a little more playing  
time tonight. Majerle has been taking up most of the minutes at 
shooting guard, but has been hampered by two bone spurs in his 
collarbone -- both of which are fractured. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerle has shot just 2-for-13 in the series, Keith Askins  
hasn't scored a single point, Jamal Mashburn has gone to the 
free-throw line only three times and P.J. Brown' scoring and 
rebounding numbers have dipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks have tried to contain Hardaway by picking him up  
defensively well above the 3-point line and by having their big men 
sprint back on defense to establish position in case Hardaway 
drives past his man in transition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's best effort of the series came in Game 2, when he had  
11 assists, but shot 1-for-5 from the field. In Game 1, he shot 
4-for-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Game 2, I don't think we were successful against him at  
all,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``He dominated the game 
without shooting, and I think that's what great players do. As far 
as the other games, everybody goes through tough stretches, and 
he's just gone through a tough stretch. But we never have, and 
never will, underestimate him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks are trying to become just the second eighth-seeded  
playoff team in NBA history to knock off a No. 1 seed. Denver did 
it to Seattle in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Disney Pulls Video Games From Park </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Walt Disney Co. is pulling the plug  
on violent video arcade games at Disneyland and Walt Disney World 
in response to the school massacre in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty games were to be unplugged by Friday and then removed by  
a vendor, Disneyland said. Violent games were also being taken out 
of two Disney-owned hotels. Disneyland did not provide a list of 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
	In Orlando, Fla., staff members at Walt Disney World began  
removing the violent games within the past two weeks, said 
spokeswoman Diane Ledder. They were evaluating the content of games 
at its four theme parks, Downtown Disney and 16 hotels, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The new policy distinguishes between games in which humans are  
targets and those that are simple accuracy contests. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just don't think there's any place for violent video games  
at Disneyland,'' park spokesman Ray Gomez said. ``This has probably 
been under consideration for a while, but the events in April 
brought it to the forefront of our thinking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On April 20, two teen-agers at Columbine High in Littleton,  
Colo., shot and killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before 
committing suicide.

<HEADLINE> House Increases CIA Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Spending on intelligence gathering and  
analysis would increase under a plan passed by the House, although 
overall funding for intelligence would drop slightly. Lawmakers 
worried that tight budgets in the past have hurt U.S. intelligence 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The House approved the largely classified spending plan for the  
CIA and 10 other intelligence-related agencies Thursday on a voice 
vote after overwhelmingly defeating a measure that would have 
frozen the intelligence budget at 1998 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of the bill is classified. But Rep. Julian Dixon,  
D-Calif., ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, 
said the total amount is actually slightly less than this year's 
level. Based on previously released figures and interviews with 
knowledgeable U.S. officials, the amount sought for next year is 
believed to be about $27 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to reverse a very serious trend of decline and  
atrophy'' in intelligence spending, Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., 
chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in a telephone interview, Goss said that this year's  
spending on intelligence marked a sharp increase over 1998 and that 
the legislation authorizing money for next year calls for slightly 
lower spending levels, it largely sustains the increase. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, changes in which government accounts are included  
in the intelligence bill means that a lower total still could mean 
more spending on core intelligence priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill provides spending authority and policy guidance for the  
CIA, National Security Agency, National Reconnaissance Office, 
Defense Intelligence Agency and FBI, among other agencies. Much of 
the money in the bill goes to costly technical intelligence 
programs involving satellites and other hardware managed by the NRO 
and NSA. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some partisan questioning of President Clinton's  
commitment to improving intelligence, the measure adds less than 1 
percent to the administration's request. Debate came amid 
congressional attention to alleged Chinese espionage at U.S. 
nuclear weapons labs and a high-profile CIA blunder that led to the 
NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, which awaits Senate consideration, adds money in  
several intelligence areas to address concern over these issues. 
The measure: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Increases money for FBI counterintelligence investigations and  
training. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Accepts Clinton's proposal to boost the Department of Energy's  
security and counterintelligence program. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Adds money for computer security at military, intelligence and  
nuclear weapons centers. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Boosts spending for foreign language training, a problem cited  
by a CIA review team looking at the national security implications 
of Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Includes a ``substantial increase'' for CIA analysis of  
foreign nuclear weapons programs, particularly in China and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Decreases the space launch and hardware budget for the NRO  
while adding money on the analysis side of the intelligence 
community so that reams of raw intelligence -- from satellite data 
to the change in address of a foreign embassy -- can be better 
managed. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Michael Castle, R-Del., said there is more spy satellite  
imagery flowing into U.S. intelligence centers than analysts can 
handle. More money is needed for technology to intercept foreign 
communications and electronic signals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are at risk of going deaf to the worldwide explosion of  
communications technology,'' Castle said. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats rejected the argument that the Chinese Embassy bombing  
stemmed from underfunding of intelligence programs. Rep. Peter 
DeFazio, D-Ore., questioned how the CIA could have erred in 
planning the bombing target when his own staff was able to pull 
down from the Internet the correct address of the Chinese Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. intelligence official, speaking on condition of  
anonymity, said that because the CIA was not looking for the 
Chinese Embassy but was trying to pinpoint a Yugoslav government 
facility, the error was not simply the result of out-of-date maps.

<HEADLINE> Sewage Splatters Salt Lake Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Maybe it's a bird, maybe it's a plane. But  
it is certainly sewage. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's no joke in the Salt Lake Valley, where gobs of thick,  
raw sewage have fallen from the sky a dozen times since April 9, 
soiling as many as seven houses at once. 
</P>
<P>
	Neighbors are pointing fingers at aircraft, but the Federal  
Aviation Administration says commercial jets aren't designed to 
jettison sewage. A biplane was spotted before one attack, but 
federal agents said the tip didn't pan out. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheriff's deputies are studying ``splatter patterns'' and  
firefighters are hosing down houses. Prosecutors have assigned an 
investigator to the case and authorities are issuing stern 
warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has never been funny,'' said Mayor Janice Auger of hard-hit  
suburban Taylorsville. ``The experience is really gross. The smell 
is terrible. This is a health issue. There's a lot of diseases in 
fecal matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is feces, but they can't tell if it's animal or human,''  
sheriff's Capt. Lee Smith said of the first lab tests on the foul 
emissions. 
</P>
<P>
	The initial strikes have spawned crude, ground-launched  
copycats, and edgy residents are reporting even minor bird 
droppings on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Perkins says it would take a ``600-pound pigeon with  
diarrhea'' to produce the coverage that prompted his son to ask, 
``Dad, what's all the mud doing on the house?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took 500 gallons of water and 30 gallons of bleach to clean  
the home that is 2,000 feet below a flight path where jets glide at 
200 mph toward Salt Lake City International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA has all but ruled out jets as a culprit, saying their  
toilet tanks can be flushed only from an exterior valve. 
</P>
<P>
	Any leak would contain a telltale bluish disinfectant, the FAA  
and aircraft manufacturers say, and none of the splatterings had a 
trace of blue. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA, no stranger to reports of weird phenomena, doesn't know  
what to make of the mess. ``We never heard anything like this,'' 
agency spokesman Mitch Barker said, ``nothing like what's been 
going on in Salt Lake.''

<HEADLINE> Swedish Twins Impress NHL Scouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LILLEHAMMER, Norway (AP) -- A couple of shy Swedish twins who  
would prefer to continue playing together are getting plenty of 
attention from NHL scouts at the World Hockey Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	While Daniel and Henrik Sedin haven't stood out on a team loaded  
with NHL talent, the 18-year-olds are expected to hold center stage 
at June's NHL entry draft . Many expect them to among the first 
five players chosen. 
</P>
<P>
	Having played on the same team all their hockey lives, and on  
the same line for the past six years, Henrik and Daniel are not 
anxious to be split up. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the twins were toying with the idea that Daniel, the  
higher-rated and younger by six minutes, might go into this year's 
draft, while Henrik would wait until 2000, increasing the odds of 
both ending up in the same city. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, however, both seem to be leaning toward joining the  
draft this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course, I'd prefer to play with my brother, it would be  
fun,'' Daniel said. ``It's easy to play with Henrik, so it would 
help. But it's not all-important. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we go on different teams that's just part of the business.  
We can be away from each other, that's not a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ordinarily, players must make their decision by May 1, but the  
twins received an extension until 10 days after the world 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sedins will get one last chance to impress the scouts when  
Sweden plays Canada on Saturday for third place in the tournament. 
The Czech Republic also Finland in the first of two games for the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
	If they split, a shootout will decide the championship after  
Game 2 on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The twins are just the latest talent to come out of  
Ornskoldsvik, a little hockey factory about 400 miles north of 
Stockholm that has produced NHL stars Peter Forsberg, Niklas 
Sundstrom and Markus Naslund. 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel and Henrik had a strong regular season, and an  
even-better Swedish Hockey League championship series for MoDo. For 
that, they were rewarded with an invitation to the national team's 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever they decide, the pair said they would play at least  
another year in Sweden before heading for North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to get stronger and better at everything,'' Henrik  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	So identical are the twins, only their uniform numbers and they  
way the hold their sticks give them separate identities in the 
minds of many. Henrik is right-handed shot and Daniel shoots from 
the left side. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are so similar, and it's obvious they have the same train  
of thought,'' said former NHL player Rich Sutter, twin brother to 
the San Jose Sharks' Ron Sutter. ``Just watching them you can tell 
there is something else there, something undefinable. 
</P>
<P>
	``They remind me of Ron and myself, the same patterns are there.  
``It's hard to put into words, but I guess there's a bit of magic 
there. I can see it in those kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the twins admit there is a special bond which probably  
goes beyond simple time, they downplay the magic between them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not telepathy or anything. If he's hurt I don't think I  
feel anything,'' Daniel said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``But we think very much alike and we are very close,'' Henrik  
said. ``We do think the same way, we finish each others' sentences, 
we answer questions the same way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That proved to be true when they were separately asked if there  
was a leader between them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the boss. I'm older,'' was Henrik's answer.  
</P>
<P>
	``Me, I'm the boss,'' Daniel said.

<HEADLINE> Feds Lift Limits on Duke Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Federal regulators who slapped restrictions  
on medical researchers at Duke University Medical Center amid 
concerns about safety have lifted their limits on human 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office for Protection from Research Risks, a division of the  
National Institutes of Health, on Monday ordered Duke to stop 
enrolling new patients in federally funded medical experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	The regulators said administrators at one of the country's  
leading clinical research centers had been too slow improving 
oversight of experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	The OPRR on Friday released researchers from the freeze. A day  
earlier, Duke administrators submitted a plan for ensuring the 
hospital's Institutional Review Board could keep up with 2,000 
experiments involving thousands of human subjects. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it was satisfied with the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``They presented to us adequate plans to correct the problems we  
had identified,'' said Dr. Michael Carome, the OPRR's top 
compliance officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is still work to be done. We view this as a new  
beginning for them and expect significant improvements in their 
program to protect human subjects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency found that members of the board -- which gives  
approval for tests and monitors patients in those studies -- had 
voted on projects in ways that created potential conflicts of 
interest and did not review research to assure patient safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke officials said that problems cited were mostly due to poor  
record keeping and that no patients were endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has about 2,000 research projects under way involving  
thousands of patients. Duke received $228 million in 1998 for 
federal and non-governmental research, with tens of millions for 
human clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Carome said that 250 to 300 government-funded projects remain  
under suspension until Duke shows the projects have been 
appropriately reviewed by a review board. 
</P>
<P>
	Recruitment of subjects and other actions in those projects  
cannot proceed until the new review is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Duke had been banned from recruiting new patients to  
federally funded programs, research was allowed to continue on 
those already enrolled in such experiments.

<HEADLINE> Sanders Returns To Cincinnati </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Reggie Sanders had a tender hamstring when he  
returned to Cincinnati on Friday, and he knew how that would play. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans would say: Reggie's hurt? So what else is new?  
</P>
<P>
	It didn't bother him. Sanders has started his baseball career  
over in San Diego, where he says the fans haven't made such an 
issue out of his frequent injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``When my hamstring was hurting and when my back started hurting  
a little bit, it's like the media and the fans (in San Diego) were 
saying, `He plays so hard, I see exactly why he gets hurt,''' 
Sanders said. ``But if it was the media here, it's something 
totally different. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything's good. I've moved on.''  
</P>
<P>
	After seven seasons in Cincinnati, the Reds grew weary of his  
undependability and traded him to San Diego on Feb. 2 as part of 
the Greg Vaughn deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders, 31, had missed half of the 1996 and 1997 seasons  
because of myriad injuries. Fans grew frustrated and teammates made 
jokes about his brittleness behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
	The outfielder developed a live-and-let-live attitude in his  
final seasons with the Reds: If the fans wanted to question his 
toughness, let 'em. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's one thing I had to learn. That's one thing that made me  
the player I am today,'' Sanders said. ``You can't worry about what 
the critics say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the only one who knows what's going on with my body. There  
was one point when I was a younger player that it used to bother 
me. Now it's not an issue anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders has been bothered by a sore back, wrist and hamstring  
this season, but played in 28 of the Padres' 34 games. He left a 
game after the fifth inning Wednesday because of a sore hamstring, 
but was in the lineup Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a few boos but not much of a reaction overall when he  
came to the plate in the first inning and flew out. He ended up 
going 1-for-4 with a walk in a 7-3 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Before arriving in Cincinnati, he said he was determined to play  
in the city where he felt maligned. He was more diplomatic about 
his feelings Friday, but he was in the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he wanted to show Cincinnatians something, he said,  
``No, I have nothing to prove. This is not a proving session for me 
-- coming here to try to get 15 home runs or this and that. It's not 
about that. It's just about us trying to come in here and win a 
series and go back home.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, neither team has gotten the advantage in the trade.  
Sanders is batting .295 with seven homers, 12 RBIs and eight 
steals. Vaughn is hitting .209 with eight homers, 20 RBIs and four 
steals. Both teams were in last place in their divisions before the 
game began. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanders said he hasn't followed the Reds since he was traded,  
except to glance in the newspapers occasionally. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm one of those people that when I move, I move,'' he said.  
``I've always been that way. It's nothing personal. That's just the 
way I am.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Passes Gun Background Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senate Republicans forced passage of new  
restrictions on gun show sales Friday, overriding solid Democratic 
opposition and a complaint by President Clinton that the provision 
was ``riddled with high-caliber loopholes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vote, 48-47, marked a retreat on the part of the GOP and  
came in an atmosphere of intense political jockeying over gun 
control spurred by last month's shooting rampage at a Colorado high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	``They know the public wants gun control, but they're afraid to  
offend the National Rifle Association,'' Sen. Charles Schumer, 
D-N.Y., said of the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, ``The National Rifle  
Association hasn't had a thing to do with it. I don't care whether 
they accept it or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said their proposal would require background checks  
for anyone who buys a weapon at a gun show. The GOP had refused 
earlier in the week to accept such a plan, and Hatch and others 
said they might be open to further concessions on other gun control 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, it was not clear whether the bill would ever  
come to a final vote. Lawmakers of the two parties accused each 
other of laboring to make sure it died. 
</P>
<P>
	Senatorial tempers flared during the day, as Hatch and Schumer  
clashed on the floor and the Utah Republican later challenged 
Clinton heatedly. ``The president doesn't know what he's talking 
about,'' Hatch said. ``He hasn't told the truth on this from word 
one, and we all know it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans, led by Hatch and Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, said  
their intention was to require a background check on anyone seeking 
to make a purchase at a gun show. On Wednesday, Republicans muscled 
through passage of a plan requiring only voluntary checks in some 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said even the revised measure was loophole-filled.  
Sensing the political upper hand, they refused to allow Republicans 
to clarify their proposal further, forcing GOP senators to cast 
votes on a measure that Clinton attacked vigorously earlier in the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new Senate Republican bill is still riddled with  
high-caliber loopholes,'' the president said at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``It won't stop criminals from buying guns at gun shows. At the  
same time, it will open up a new pawnshop loophole that lets 
convicted felons get guns at a local pawnshop. That's actually 
worse than current law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The maneuvering came on legislation to increase prosecution of  
juvenile offenders. Majority Leader Trent Lott brought the measure 
to the floor this week expressly to allow the political parties to 
respond to the shootings in the Columbine High School in which two 
student gunmen killed 12 fellow students and a teacher before 
killing themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats responded with a raft of gun control proposals, while  
Republicans generally sought to turn the debate toward violence 
present in modern-day television programming, movies, video games 
and the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	To underscore that, Lott issued a statement critical of  
Clinton's weekend fundraising trip to the West Coast. ``What's the 
message to our children? Democrats care about your safety, unless 
it's inconvenient to their partners in Hollywood,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate GOP aides conceded their party was outmaneuvered on the  
issue, and other officials said recent private polling indicated 
strong support for gun-control measures even among GOP voters who 
have opposed it in the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Democrats have seized on a political issue, and I  
understand that and regret that,'' said Sen. John McCain of 
Arizona, a contender for the GOP presidential nomination and one of 
a group of senators who forced Craig and Hatch to reverse course. 
</P>
<P>
	On other issues, the Senate rejected a proposal by Schumer to  
require Internet Web sites to obtain federal licenses if they sell 
firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	And Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., announced that he and Hatch had  
agreed to a bipartisan proposal requiring sale of safety locks with 
guns. His office said the measure had the support of the Senate's 
gun-control advocates. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP amendment on gun shows was agreed to in an unusual  
atmosphere in which Hatch and members of the GOP leadership openly 
lobbied reluctant Republicans to save the provision from rejection. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, 47 Republicans and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va.,  
supported the proposal, while 40 Democrats and seven Republicans 
opposed it. The political crosscurrents were evidence in the roster 
of Republicans who voted against the proposal. They ranged from 
gun-control advocates such as John Chafee of Rhode Island to 
gun-control foes such as Sens. Bob Smith of New Hampshire and Craig 
Thomas of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	Idaho's Craig said the intent of the GOP was clear: ``An  
individual who wants to obtain a gun at any gun show must submit to 
a background check.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats insisted the legislation was drafted to exempt some  
purchasers and raised several other objections. 
</P>
<P>
	They charged it would open up a new loophole by allowing anyone  
who pawned a gun to retrieve it without undergoing a background 
check. Democrats said that would allow criminals to obtain guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch and McCain both told reporters they were open to possible  
changes to address that issue. 
</P>
<P>
	But Craig balked at that and also objected to Democratic demands  
for new record-keeping requirements on the gun-sale instant checks. 
``I'm not going to let hysteria in this country let law-abiding 
citizens be dropped into a web,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Consumer Prices Jump in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer prices took the biggest leap in nine  
years last month as Americans faced a record spike in gasoline 
prices and costs jumped for many other goods and services -- from 
food and clothing to doctor's office visits and airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	``The best news on inflation is probably behind us,'' said Sung  
Won Sohn, an economist with Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. 
``Even though one month does not make a trend ..., I think we are 
beginning to see pent-up price pressure show up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	April's 0.7 percent rise in the Consumer Price Index, reported  
by the Labor Department on Friday, was the largest since October 
1990 and pushed the rate of inflation so far this year to 3.3 
percent on an annual basis. That compares with a 1.6 percent rise 
for all of 1998, a year in which consumers benefited from falling 
energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street investors, sensitive that signs of inflation could  
prompt Federal Reserve officials to raise interest rates, were 
spooked. The Dow Jones average of industrial stocks closed at just 
over 10,913, down almost 194 points although slightly off its 
in-session lows. Bond prices also were down sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	A 6.1 percent surge in energy prices, the biggest one-month gain  
on record, led the inflation upswing. Gasoline prices soared 15 
percent in April, the most since the government started keeping 
track in 1935. The cost of fuel oil and electricity also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	The surge in energy prices was predicted, however, and is  
expected to be temporary. 
</P>
<P>
	After global economic turmoil pulled energy prices down sharply  
last year, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed 
this spring to limit production for a while. Unlike most previous 
OPEC cutbacks, this one so far has been generally followed. Also, 
analysts say, military fuel demands for the conflict in Yugoslavia 
are tightening energy markets. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gas stations nationwide  
found the average per-gallon price of gasoline was $1.2337 on May 
7, up about 23 cents since it bottomed out in February. The 
respected industry report also noted that pump prices now appear to 
be stabilizing after several weeks of quick growth. 
</P>
<P>
	Food prices also went up in April, by 0.1 percent, after a  
decline in March. Fresh vegetable prices fell 0.4 percent as early 
spring harvests began, but the cost of fruit soared 3.8 percent as 
droughts in Florida contributed to that increase. Meat, poultry, 
fish and egg prices rose 0.3 percent, including a 1 percent 
increase in the cost of beef. 
</P>
<P>
	But the greatest worry to economists was an unexpectedly sharp  
0.4 percent April increase in core prices, which exclude the 
often-volatile energy and food categories. It was the biggest 
increase in core prices since January 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of that, this report I think has more credibility. It  
may not just be a temporary bump,'' Sohn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothing prices jumped 1.5 percent, the biggest monthly increase  
since March of 1990. Housing prices were up 0.4 percent, including 
a 1.9 percent increase in hotel prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The cost of medical care rose 0.4 percent. Prescription drug  
prices rose 0.8 percent, doctor's office prices 0.4 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco prices jumped 3.6 percent. Airfares rose 2 percent.  
Motor vehicle prices rose 0.1 percent, which analysts said largely 
reflected expiration of new year's sales incentives. 
</P>
<P>
	Brisk spending by American consumers, enjoying the lowest  
unemployment rate in almost three decades and big stock market 
gains, has been credited with keeping the U.S. economy healthy in 
the midst of international economic trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	A third of the world's countries have gone into recession during  
the past two years. The resulting fall in world demand for U.S. 
products and flood of discount-priced imports have helped keep 
inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
	But now there are signs that other countries may be recovering --  
a twist that economists warned could cause inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate report Friday, the Federal Reserve said production  
at the nation's factories, mines and utilities rose 0.6 percent in 
April, the most since August 1998. Output rose across the board, 
from consumer products including home electronics and clothing, to 
business equipment and construction supplies. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts said they still don't expect an interest rate  
increase when Fed officials have their next meeting, scheduled for 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``But it is a much closer call,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief  
economist for Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	Some economists predict the nation's central bank could signal  
interest rate hikes will be coming later this year by switching its 
``bias'' -- a publicly disclosed gauge of Fed officials' state of 
mind -- to favor raising rates. Its current position is neutral.

<HEADLINE> Baffert's Lone Filly in Preakness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Trainer Bob Baffert's once-powerful brigade of  
classic horses has dwindled to one tough filly -- Excellent Meeting 
-- for Saturday's Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	After his other star filly, Silverbulletday, drew an unfavorable  
No. 14 post position, Baffert and owner Mike Pegram took her out of 
the Preakness on Thursday and put her in today's Black-Eyed Susan 
Stakes at Pimlico. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Bob will be well represented in the Derby with  
Excellent Meeting,'' Pegram said of the John Mabee-owned filly who 
finished fifth in the Kentucky Derby. ``We're disappointed because 
we came here to run in the Preakness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Baffert confirmed that Prime Timber, fourth  
in the Derby, was out of the Preakness. A few days later, he said 
Prime Timber was also out of the Sir Barton Stakes on the 
undercard. 
</P>
<P>
	Baffert's other Derby runner, General Challenge, was declared  
out of the Preakness the day after enduring a rough trip in the 
Derby and finishing 11th. 
</P>
<P>
	And by the time the Belmont Stakes rolls around on June 5,  
Baffert might not even saddle a horse in the race that brought him 
to the brink of winning Triple Crowns with Silver Charm in 1997 and 
Real Quiet in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``This could our last stop,'' Baffert said.  
</P>
<P>
	But that doesn't mean Excellent Meeting won't give Baffert a  
chance for his third straight Preakness win. 
</P>
<P>
	``It takes an exceptional filly to run with these colts, and  
Excellent Meeting showed it in the Derby with the trip that she 
had,'' Baffert said, pointing out she was only 2 1/4 lengths behind 
the winner, Charismatic, after a bumpy start. ``She easily could 
have won the race. She came out of it great. I wasn't pointing her 
to this race. I just let her tell me how she came out of the Derby, 
and I told Mr. Mabee she came out of it unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vicar, a disappointing 18th in the Derby after leaving from the  
No. 17 post, also was expected to be withdrawn from Preakness by 
trainer Carl Nafzger. Vicar, winner of the Fountain of Youth and 
Florida Derby, drew the No. 13 post in Wednesday night's draw. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not wishing anybody any bad luck,'' Nafzger said, ``but we  
just will not run from No. 13. If we scratch, it won't be until 
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Silverbulletday out, jockey Gary Stevens became available,  
and trainer Nick Zito signed him up to ride Stephen Got Even in the 
Preakness. Stevens replaces Chris McCarron, who sustained a 
hairline fracture near the left heel when he was unseated while 
working a horse Monday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had luck with Gary in the past,'' Zito said. ``He rode  
Halory Hunter for us to win the Blue Grass last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Thursday's announced defections, a field of 12 3-year-olds  
is expected to go to the post in the 124th Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
	Excellent Meeting, with Kent Desormeaux aboard, will attempt to  
become the fifth filly to win the Preakness -- the first since 
Nellie Morse in 1924. Winning Colors was the last filly to run in 
the Preakness, finishing third for trainer D. Wayne Lukas in 1988. 
She'll also be just the third filly to run in the second leg of the 
Triple Crown since 1939. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Derby, Excellent Meeting won seven of 11 starts  
against her own sex, including handing Silverbulletday her only 
loss last August. 
</P>
<P>
	Menifee, runner-up to Derby winner Charismatic, was the 5-2  
favorite, with Excellent Meeting the second choice at 5-1. 
Charismatic, with Chris Antley aboard, was 6-1, with Cat Thief, 
Lukas' other Preakness colt, at 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Dubai-based Worldly Manner, who finished seventh in the Derby  
after staying in contention entering the stretch, might be another 
horse to watch. 
</P>
<P>
	``He came out of the Derby in great shape, and we're pretty  
confident,'' assistant trainer Tom Albertrani said. ``The Derby 
tuned him up a little.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Worldly Manner, with Jerry Bailey in the irons, was a 12-1  
choice. The colt is owned by Godolphin Racing, Inc., the Dubai arm 
of Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum and Sheikh Maktoum al Maktoum's 
racing empire. 
</P>
<P>
	Albertrani said Sheikh Mohammed will attend the Preakness.

<HEADLINE> No. 1 Ranking In Sight for Rafter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Patrick Rafter, covered with red dirt and slugging  
it out from the baseline, is moving closer to the No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	He advanced to the semifinals of the Italian Open, grinding out  
a 4-6, 7-5, 6-1 victory Friday over Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big surprise for me,'' Rafter said. ``You have all the  
top guys here, and I came in with very little form. I don't know 
why it's happening this week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter lost two consecutive opening-round matches before Rome.  
The serve-and-volleyer reached his first semifinal since September, 
when he won a second straight U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, if he keeps going and captures this tuneup for the French  
Open, he can vault from a No. 4 ranking to the top. 
</P>
<P>
	The three players ahead of him -- No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 2  
Pete Sampras and No. 3 Carlos Moya -- have all lost already in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm getting closer,'' Rafter said. ``But it's not necessarily  
driving me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when his serve was average, Rafter had to rally after  
being down a set and 2-0 in the second to a player ranked No. 32 in 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Temperatures topped 80 degrees and occasional gusts kicked red  
dust into the players' eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter next faces No. 15 seed Felix Mantilla. The Spaniard  
advanced Friday with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over German qualifier David 
Prinosil. Mantilla's eight career titles all have come on clay. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other half of the draw, No. 3 seed Alex Corretja of Spain  
beat unseeded Argentine Franco Squillari 5-7, 7-6 (7-4), 7-5. 
Squillari squandered a match point when serving at 5-4 in the 
second set, clubbing a forehand into the net to end a 33-stroke 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	No. 16 seed Gustavo Kuerten, the 1997 French Open champion,  
defeated No. 10 Karol Kucera 3-6, 6-4, 7-5 for the last semifinal 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter was a surprise semifinalist at the French Open two years  
ago but has won no clay titles. He showed great patience against 
Lapentti. 
</P>
<P>
	``So far, the clay has been good for me,'' Rafter said. ``Many  
years in the past it hasn't been. I'm just enjoying every match 
because you never know how long it's going to last.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It didn't look as if Friday's encounter would last long.  
Lapentti got to everything, put service returns at Rafter's ankles 
and rifled passing shots. 
</P>
<P>
	But the match shifted when Lapentti had three break points to go  
up 3-0 in the second set. Rafter used an ace and two service 
winners to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would have been another kick in the head. That was one  
point that made the difference,'' Rafter said. ``It could have 
easily been 6-4, 6-1, and the crowd would have booed me off the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he broke at love in the fourth game to make it 2-2, and  
broke again in the last game of the second set when Lapentti missed 
four backhands on extended rallies. 
</P>
<P>
	``You play well, your confidence grows,'' said Lapentti, an  
Australian Open semifinalist in January. ``You start to miss and it 
keeps getting worse.''

	Stocks Plunge; Dow Ends Down 193.87  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today, with the Dow Jones  
industrial average tumbling more than 193 points, after the 
government's report of a steep rise in consumer prices renewed 
inflation worries and sent bond prices sharply lower. Analysts said 
the 0.7 percent rise in the consumer price index caught the market 
by surprise. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 193.87 at 
10,913.32, more than wiping out a 106.82-point gain yesterday that 
gave the Dow a new closing high of 11,107.19. Broader stock 
indicators were sharply lower as well. The Nasdaq composite index 
fell 54.13 to 2,527.87. The inflation report led to a drop of more 
than two points in the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury 
bond, pushing yields to 5.92 percent, the highest level in nearly a 
year. The bond yield stood at 5.89 percent late in the session.

	Court Voids EPA Air-Pollution Rules

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court today set aside new  
air quality standards issued by the Environmental Protection Agency 
in 1997, handing the Clinton administration a major environmental 
defeat. The three-judge panel, acting on a lawsuit by a number of 
industry groups, said the EPA in setting the new standards put in 
place a section of the 1990 Clean Air Act ``so loosely as to render 
them unconstitutional delegations of legislative power.'' The EPA 
issued a statement saying it will ask the Justice Department to 
appeal the decision, probably first to the full circuit, and if 
necessary to the U.S. Supreme Court.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Production at the nation's factories, mines  
and utilities rose 0.6 percent in April, the Federal Reserve said, 
the most since August 1998. That followed a 0.5 percent March 
increase, revised to reflect much stronger industrial activity than 
previously reported. Output of consumer products rose 0.6 percent 
in April. Production of durable goods, including cars, furniture 
and home electronics jumped 2.1 percent in April. Production of 
nondurables, such as food and fuel, increased 0.2 percent with 
increases for chemicals and clothing offsetting disruptions at 
refineries.

upstart run by a former AT&AMP;T executive, a person familiar with the 
situation said today. U S West declined comment. Based in Denver, 
it provides phone service in 14 Western and midwestern states. 
Global Crossing, which is building a worldwide fiber optic network 
and recently agreed to buy a phone company named Frontier Corp., 
did not return calls seeking comment. Earlier this year, the 
Bermuda-based company lured Robert Annunziata away from AT&AMP;T to be 
its chief executive. U S West shares were at 62 1/2, up 2 1/4. Global 
Crossing shares were at 61 3/8, up 1 3/8.

	Survey: Black Women Invest Less

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Black women want to invest in stocks, but  
they've been stymied by family demands such as caring for children 
and financially supporting others, according to a study released 
today about the investment attitudes of blacks and whites. Overall, 
blacks are underinvested because of ``formidable cultural and 
demographic factors,'' even as the bull market still roars on Wall 
Street, according to the second annual survey sponsored by Ariel 
Mutual Funds and Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. ``After working so hard to 
join the middle class, many blacks are still missing out on the 
greatest wealth-building opportunity in American history,'' said 
John Rogers, president of Ariel Mutual Funds, a black-owned 
investment firm.

	Chase Manhattan Exec Eyed for Fed  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House is getting closer to choosing  
a banker active in lending to disadvantaged people and businesses 
as a new governor of the Federal Reserve Board. The Clinton 
administration is currently tangling with Senate Banking Committee 
head Phil Gramm, R-Texas, over federal requirements for banks to do 
that kind of lending. Any White House nominee for the post would 
have to be approved by the banking panel before being confirmed by 
the full Senate. Carol J. Parry is an executive vice president of 
Chase Manhattan Bank, the nation's third-largest. She is in charge 
of community development lending programs, making her responsible 
for loans for low- and moderate-income housing, commercial 
revitalization projects and businesses owned by women and 
minorities.

All of the games were to be unplugged by today and then removed by 
a vendor, the park said. Disneyland did not provide a list of

first-quarter earnings report to show a loss of $28.4 million 
instead of the profit of $58.6 million originally reported. The 
adjustment disclosed today was related to an $85.3 million charge 
for acquiring British auto parts maker LucasVarity. TRW, which also 
makes defense equipment, bought LucasVarity for $7 billion earlier 
this year. TRW said its first-quarter earnings adjustment reflects 
a valuation of LucasVarity's research and development and a $1.7 
million increase in its income tax rate. TRW shares were at 47 1/8, 
down 3/16.

<HEADLINE> Rare Triple Transplant Performed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Michigan businessman was adjusting to a new  
heart, liver and kidney following an extremely rare 
triple-transplant operation performed last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Kent Slater, 64, of Rockford, Mich., became only the second  
person to undergo such surgery in the United States, according to 
the Virginia-based United Network of Organ Sharing, which tracks 
all U.S. organ transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater needed the May 7 operation, which took 14 hours, because  
of the combined effects of rheumatic fever and a hepatitis C 
infection. He also suffered from progressive heart failure, which 
prevented vital organs from getting enough oxygen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel pretty good, considering,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	University of Chicago Hospitals spokesman John Easton said  
Slater remained in serious condition early today. Doctors 
considered it too early to say whether his body would reject the 
new organs, Easton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said that Slater's heart was transplanted first,  
followed by the liver -- the riskiest part of the operation since 
the solution used to preserve the liver prior to transplant can be 
deadly to a heart if not flushed out properly. The kidney was 
transplanted last. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Millis oversaw Slater's liver and kidney transplants  
and Dr. Valluvan Jeevanandam transplanted his heart. All the organs 
came from the same donor. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Thomas Starzl, who in 1989 performed the only other U.S.  
heart-liver-kidney transplant, lauded the Chicago doctors' 
accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big deal,'' said Starzl, a retired surgeon at the  
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ``Every stage of the 
enterprise is more complex than in a normal transplant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Starzl's triple-transplant patient -- 26-year-old Lisa Martin --  
died of kidney disease four months after her operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Such radical surgeries have raised ethical questions about  
giving multiple organs to one person instead of trying to save more 
patients. There are 66,000 Americans awaiting major organ 
transplants. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said in Slater's case, the organs probably would have  
gone unused because the donor also had been infected with hepatitis 
C. That excluded those organs from use in uninfected patients. 
Also, Slater and the donor both shared type AB blood, the rarest 
type.

<HEADLINE> Mark Tuinei Remembered at Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Mark Tuinei was remembered for how he lived, not  
how he died. 
</P>
<P>
	At the funeral service Thursday night for the former Dallas  
Cowboys offensive lineman, there was no talk about how, on his last 
night in Dallas before a planned move back to Hawaii, he ingested a 
fatal combination of the drugs, including heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the 6-foot-5, 320-pound lineman, who died May 6, was  
remembered as a big man with an even bigger heart, a guy who would 
patiently sign autographs until every fan who wanted one had one, a 
man who downplayed his own achievements to focus on making those 
around him feel important. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am not ashamed of my brother,'' said Tom Tuinei, who then  
read from Scripture. ``Let he who is without sin among you cast the 
first stone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's casket was draped with a Dallas Cowboys blanket and a  
Cowboys flag was displayed in the church. Nieces and nephews wore 
jerseys with Tuinei's No. 71 and the words ``Uncle Mark'' on the 
back as they scampered across the grassy grounds of Central Union 
Church, where he married his wife, Pono, in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
	Signed as a free agent in 1983, Dallas intended to try Tuinei as  
a defensive lineman. Instead, he became an anchor on an offensive 
line that led the Cowboys to Super Bowl championships in 1993, 1994 
and 1996. He retired in 1998 after being felled by a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He was laid to rest wearing one of his Super Bowl rings. A  
football and other personal items also were placed in the casket. 
</P>
<P>
	Col. William Olds, a former ROTC instructor at the University of  
Hawaii who Tuinei credited with helping to set him straight, said 
it was Tuinei alone who decided to abandon a life of trouble to 
make something of himself and make his family proud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Back then, he felt like the whole world was against him, that  
trouble followed him all around,'' Olds said of when Tuinei came to 
him for help in the early 1980s. ``He came to me and said he needed 
to get his life on track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Olds likened Tuinei to the lead character in the television show  
``Touched by an Angel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Mark Tuinei was my angel,'' Olds said, choking back tears. ``I  
sincerely believe he was here to touch the lives of many people. 
And he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tuinei's best friend of nearly 25 years, J.K. Spielman, recalled  
how his buddy was always thinking about others. He retold a story 
about Tuinei being given a limousine to attend a taping of a local 
Dallas television show hosted by Cowboy teammate Deion Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
	After taping the show, the limo took Tuinei and his guests to a  
restaurant, but then Tuinei made the limo driver take him home so 
he could get his own car so the driver could go home and spend time 
with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was so large in stature, yet so soft in his heart,''  
Spielman said. ``He touched the lives of more people in 39 years 
than most of us will in 80.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Spielman and Olds said Tuinei never expressed any personal  
troubles in the weeks leading up to his death, and both expressed 
shock at the fact he died from drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	``One bad choice and, unfortunately, that's how it ended,''  
Spielman said. ``I know he did not have a problem that way because 
I knew him very well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	No members of the Cowboys attended the memorial service. A  
service was held last week in Dallas and was attended by many 
present and former Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Among those at the Hawaii service were Arizona coach Dick Tomey,  
who coached Tuinei at Hawaii; former Hawaii teammate and former San 
Francisco 49er Jesse Sapolu; former NFL pro and Hawaii teammate 
Rich Miano; and current Hawaii coach June Jones.

<HEADLINE> Portland Weather Challenge to Runner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Sprinter Ato Boldon wasn't planning to  
take a shot at a world record this weekend. It's a good thing, 
because rain and chilly temperatures are expected to slow down 
everyone's times at Saturday's Adidas Oregon Track Classic. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, one of the world's fastest men in both the 100 and 200,  
will instead use the meet to refine his ``drive phase'' -- a 
carefully honed technique used to go from the starting blocks to 
top speed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like a choreographed dance, and I need to make sure I hit  
all the steps,'' Boldon said Friday, resting beneath covers in his 
hotel room, the heat cranked up. ``I don't want a close race, 
especially in this weather. You don't want to have to press. You 
want to put everybody away early.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon is the headliner at the meet, to be held at Lewis &AMP; Clark  
College. It's the first of five outdoor events in the inaugural 
Golden Spike Tour. The series ends with the USA Championships in 
Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if Boldon has a bad race or holds up considerably, he  
probably will break the meet 100 record of 10.15, held by Terry 
Bowen. Boldon's closest competition likely will come from Brian 
Lewis, whose personal-best is 10.0. 
</P>
<P>
	Other notable entries at the Classic include hurdler Allen  
Johnson, pole vaulter Jeff Hartwig and distance runner Regina 
Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon had a sore right hamstring that forced him to slow up in  
the second half of last week's 100 at the Modesto Relays, which he 
won with a wind-aided time of 9.89. But he said the leg has 
completely healed. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon's friend and HSI teammate, Maurice Greene, competed at  
Modesto in different heats. Greene, ranked No. 1 in the 100 last 
year, isn't entered in the Oregon Classic, but arrived Friday to 
support Boldon. 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon and Greene, who each have run a 9.86, are again expected  
to challenge the world 100 record of 9.84 set by Donovan Bailey at 
the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. But the friends haven't placed much 
importance on reaching the mark. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maurice and I decided this year that we were not going to talk  
world record,'' Boldon said. ``People immediately thought, `Yeah, 
that's because they said it last year and it didn't happen.' No, 
not at all. We feel that changes our focus, when we go out there 
and try to run to make the clock stop at a world record, as opposed 
to run the race and let the clock worry about itself. I think you 
have to go for the best race, and that becomes the world record 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	``My singular focus this year is the world championships, as  
opposed to any record.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Boldon, who has his own web site (www.atoboldon.com), monitors  
weather sites and answers e-mail with a laptop he takes with him on 
the road, said he received a dispatch from a European fan who 
listed all the sub-9.90 100s since 1997. They all belong to either 
Greene or Boldon. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was totally amazing to me,'' Boldon said. ``It really  
makes me see that Maurice and I have been literally doing things 
that have not been done before. So I think because of that we see 
it as kind of us against them. It's like Maurice and I are back to 
back, with our fists up.''

<HEADLINE> Texas Prep Breaks Pole Vault Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Orangefield senior Eric Eshbach set a  
scholastic pole vault record of 18 feet, 2 1/4 inches at the Texas 
state high school meet today, shattering the previous mark of 17-9 1/2 
by Joe Dial of Marlow, Okla., in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Dial's mark was set at a meet sanctioned by the National  
Federation of State High School Athletic Associations. 
</P>
<P>
	Eshbach's vault also surpassed the best American schoolboy mark  
ever recorded. Brandon Richards vaulted 18-2 at Eugene, Ore. in 
1985 but his mark was set the summer before he entered college and 
was not considered for the record. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I had it in me,'' Eshbach said. ``I just didn't know  
when it would come. I knew the day I jumped 18 I'd go higher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eshbach cleared 17-6, 17-10 and 18-0 on his first tries. He then  
missed his first two attempts at 18-2 1/4, before clearing. 
</P>
<P>
	Eshbach pushed the bar to 18-6, but after two misses and citing  
a sore back, he had enough.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Spending Bill Headed for Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional leaders plan to push legislation  
through the House and Senate next week that would double the funds 
President Clinton requested for the battle over Kosovo, assistance 
to U.S. farmers and aid for Central American hurricane victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Capping three days of bargaining, House-Senate negotiators shook  
hands Thursday evening on a package that ultimately swelled to 
nearly $15 billion. Clinton had sought $6 billion for the air 
campaign against Yugoslavia, and just over $1 billion for Central 
America, farmers and assorted other programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The final hurdle was overcome after House bargainers, pressed by  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., reversed themselves and 
rejected a guaranteed loan program for some steel companies 
proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. The steel assistance and a 
similar program for ailing oil and gas companies sponsored by Sen. 
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., will be considered later in a separate 
package, which unlike the Kosovo measure will have no guarantee of 
reaching the president's desk. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been going to conferences with senators for years,'' said  
29-year House veteran Rep. Bill Young, R-Fla., chairman of the 
House Appropriations Committee. ``We always hit one or two 
obstacles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans won a defense increase in the package, which would  
provide $11.8 billion for the air attacks on Yugoslavia, a general 
military buildup and Balkan refugees. That doubling of Clinton's 
request helped the GOP polish its pro-Pentagon credentials and will 
help them live within next year's budget limits. 
</P>
<P>
	They also got language proposed by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
R-Texas, blocking Clinton from grabbing any of the $246 billion 
states have won from a legal settlement with the tobacco industry. 
Clinton wanted to use a portion of those funds for anti-tobacco and 
other health programs. The president argues that some of the money 
belongs to the federal government under the Medicaid 
health-insurance program. 
</P>
<P>
	But three months after Clinton requested the aid for Honduras  
and other Central American countries battered by the deadly 
Hurricane Mitch, he finally got it -- along with four times the 
amount he sought for U.S. farmers hurt by low commodities prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP provisions the administration opposed as  
anti-environmental were either rejected or watered down. These 
included an effort by Alaska's senators to protect commercial 
fishing in Glacier Bay National Park and a drive by Domenici to 
prevent the silvery minnow from being protected in the Rio Grande 
River. 
</P>
<P>
	All but $1.6 billion of the bill's cost will be paid out of this  
year's projected $111 billion federal surplus. The rest will come 
from cuts in domestic programs, mostly food stamp funds some 
lawmakers said would be unused. The administration defeated earlier 
GOP plans to cut money used to back loans by international banks 
and to purchase nuclear materials from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
	Byrd's steel provision was removed from the bill after two House  
Republicans reversed themselves Thursday and House negotiators 
voted 12-11 to reject the program. The two were Reps. Ralph Regula, 
R-Ohio, and Joe Skeen, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had some discussions,'' Regula said of his meeting with  
Hastert. ``That's his role as leader, which is perfectly 
appropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The provision, approved last month by the Senate, would have  
provided $140 million to back $1 billion in loan guarantees for 
moderate-sized steel companies hurt by imports. Among them would be 
the Weirton Steel Corp. of Weirton, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I see here is a steamroller,'' Byrd said of the vote that  
knocked the steel provision out of the spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Remaining in the bill was a Senate-approved provision providing  
up to $4.3 million to pay reparations for Japanese people interned 
during World War II, including some from Latin America who were 
placed in U.S. detention camps. 
</P>
<P>
	Leaders decided against reducing the $900 million in added  
funding the compromise would provide to the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency following the tornadoes that hit Oklahoma and 
other states.

<HEADLINE> Drug Maker Fights To Extend Patents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It is only a single drug, but a legislative  
battle over whether to extend Claritin's patent involves some of 
Capitol Hill's top lobbyists. At stake is $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough Corp. has brought in some big names to push  
legislation that could extend the patent on its popular 
anti-allergy drug by three years. The patent is set to expire in 
2002. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other side, generic drug makers are waging a lobbying  
battle of their own, eager to break into new, lucrative markets. 
When Schering-Plough's patent expires, generic drug makers will be 
able to sell their own versions of Claritin. 
</P>
<P>
	Under a 1984 law, Claritin and six other lesser-known drugs that  
were being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration received 
only two-year patent extensions rather than the five years given 
other pharmaceuticals. 
</P>
<P>
	The current legislation in Congress, sponsored by Reps. Ed  
Bryant, R-Tenn., and Jim McDermott, D-Wash., would allow the 
companies that make these seven drugs to ask the U.S. Patent and 
Trademark Office for another three years of patent protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``These medicines were kept off the market and away from the  
American public, in many cases for 10 years or more, because of 
administrative delays that had nothing to do with their safety to 
consumers,'' McDermott said. 
</P>
<P>
	Helping to make the case for the bill is an all-star lineup of  
lobbyists, including former Federal Aviation Deputy Administrator 
Linda Daschle, wife of the Senate's top Democrat, Tom Daschle of 
South Dakota; former Democratic Sen. Dennis DeConcini; former 
Republican Rep. Vin Weber; former White House Chief of Staff Howard 
Baker; and former Watergate prosecutor Richard Ben-Veniste. 
</P>
<P>
	``What they're doing is adding a tax onto people who need the  
drugs to more than pay for the expenses of the lobbyists,'' said an 
opponent of the legislation, Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough also has gotten some unsolicited help from  
former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who wrote a letter to the 
lawmakers leading the charge for the bill. An aide to Koop said he 
acted on his own and is not being paid by the drug company. 
</P>
<P>
	``America's pharmaceutical research engine drives major advances  
in the treatment and cure of disease,'' Koop wrote. ``Patent 
protection is a major factor stimulating this research and drug 
development.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough spokesman William O'Donnell said the bill would  
not guarantee a patent extension, only an independent examination 
of whether the company should get another three years of 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
	``We support a fair and equitable process,'' O'Donnell said.  
``We are trying to get support for that general principle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schering-Plough has made similar attempts in the past to pass  
the legislation. Last October, lawmakers tried unsuccessfully to 
attach the provision to the giant session-ending spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Schering-Plough already had big-name lobbyists  
working for it like DeConcini and Peter Knight, who was campaign 
manager for President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But as the expiration date nears, Schering-Plough has beefed up  
its lobbying team. Two of its newer members, Daschle and 
Ben-Veniste, recently lobbied Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., who said 
he still was undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	The generic drug makers are running ads directed at lawmakers  
and their staffs. They emphasize consumers would be the big winners 
if they could buy lower-cost generic versions sooner rather than 
later, never mentioning their own financial interest in the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Buddy Menn, vice president for government affairs at the Generic  
Pharmaceutical Industry Association, delivered that message in a 
large first-floor Capitol meeting room to House Democrats, and over 
the telephone to officials at AARP and Consumers Union. 
</P>
<P>
	``The message is the one solution to the rising costs of  
prescription drugs is good old-fashioned competition,'' Menn said.

<HEADLINE> Internet Poll Validity Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PETERSBURG BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Pollsters say scientific polls  
could be drowned out by the proliferation of Internet surveys that 
they say don't accurately measure public opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	Now pollsters are considering the possibility of a poll rating  
system that would require pollsters to inform the public and the 
media which polls are conducted with scientific standards. 
Pollsters struggled with the difficult problem Friday during the 
annual meeting of the American Association for Public Opinion 
Research. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't overstate the concern that people who practice  
polling have about this,'' said Nancy Belden, a Washington pollster 
who organized the standards discussion. ``It is more urgent because 
of the proliferation of Internet polling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warren Mitofsky, the veteran New York City pollster who heads  
the group's standards committee, emphasized it is too early to know 
what solution the group will pursue, but a ratings system is one 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pew Research Center ran a comparison of its own scientific  
polls and the results of self-selected survey responses to the same 
questions on America Online. More than half in the open online 
survey disapproved of the job President Clinton was doing, while 
two-thirds in the scientific telephone poll approved. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientific surveys use a technique called random digit dialing,  
in which a computer picks telephone numbers at random and the poll 
results are weighted geographically and demographically to 
represent the population as a whole. Most Web polls are 
self-selected, meaning Internet users decide themselves whether to 
participate. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet surveys are increasingly being targeted by interest  
groups that want a new forum to promote their causes. 
</P>
<P>
	``OK Internet Brigade, let's get out there and stand strong for  
Pat!'' was the rallying cry posted recently on Pat Buchanan's 
official web site. The site encourages supporters to ``hit the 
online polls and register your vote for PJB.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't view it as skewing the numbers, just getting out the  
vote,'' said Bob Adams, a spokesman for the Republican presidential 
candidate. Aides with several other presidential campaigns, 
Republican and Democratic, said they encourage participation in 
such polls, but have made no organized effort to influence the 
results. 
</P>
<P>
	The online votes are good at creating the kind of Web site  
traffic that can produce revenues for those who run the sites, said 
Dan Murphy, a market research expert with Relevant Knowledge in 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters are trying to reduce confusion caused by these  
Internet surveys. 
</P>
<P>
	At CNN, poll director Keating Holland helped convince those who  
run the online surveys to call them ``quick votes'' to make a clear 
distinction that they are not scientific polls. 
</P>
<P>
	``My greatest fear is that the public sees no difference between  
online polling and scientific polling,'' Rich Morin, director of 
polling for The Washington Post, said in a recent interview.	   The technology of the Internet has simply made more visible a 
problem pollsters have faced for years. Mail-in polls, which have 
been around for years, can cause the same confusion as Internet 
polls, because the poll taker usually has little control over who 
decides to respond.

<HEADLINE> Duke Research Ban Lifted by NIH </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- The government lifted most restrictions  
Friday on federally funded medical research on humans at Duke 
University, three days after the experiments were suspended because 
of lax safety oversight. 
</P>
<P>
	The government said it was satisfied with the university's plan  
to correct the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``They presented to us adequate plans to correct the problems we  
had identified,'' said Dr. Michael A. Carome, chief compliance 
officer for Office for Protection From Research Risks, a part of 
the National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there is still work to be done. We view this as a new  
beginning for them and expect significant improvements in their 
program to protect human subjects.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the agency had ordered Duke not to enroll new  
subjects in federally funded experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency found that members of the medical center's  
Institutional Review Board -- which gives approval for tests and 
monitors patients in those studies -- had voted on projects in ways 
that created potential conflicts of interest and did not review 
research to assure patient safety. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke officials said that problems cited were mostly due to poor  
record keeping and that no patients were endangered. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke has about 2,000 research projects under way involving  
thousands of patients. Duke received $228 million in 1998 for 
federal and non-governmental research, with tens of millions for 
human clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael A. Carome, chief compliance officer for OPRR, said  
that 250 to 300 government-funded projects remain under suspension 
until Duke shows the projects have been appropriately reviewed by a 
review board. 
</P>
<P>
	Recruitment of subjects and other actions in those projects  
cannot proceed until the new review is completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Duke had been banned from recruiting new patients to  
federally funded programs, research was allowed to continue on 
those already enrolled in such experiments.

<HEADLINE> Teen Indicted for Hacking Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A teen-ager identified as a computer hacker  
whose name appeared on the Internet site for the White House after 
vandals altered it this week has been indicted in Virginia on 
charges he broke into another government computer. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury indicted Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of  
computer intrusion. Burns, reportedly known on the Internet as 
``Zyklon,'' was accused of breaking into a computer between August 
1998 and January 1999 in northern Virginia that is used by the U.S. 
Information Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zyklon'' was one of a dozen names listed on the hacked version  
of the White House Web site, which was altered overnight Sunday for 
a few minutes before government computers automatically detected 
the intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment returned Thursday also accuses Burns of breaking  
into two other computers, one owned by LaserNet of Fairfax, Va., 
and the other by Issue Dynamics Inc. of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Simon of Issue Dynamics said he was cooperating with the  
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that computer criminals need to be  
identified, prosecuted and caught, and we're pleased that the FBI 
is not treating this as a minor matter. It wasn't an insignificant 
incident. It was a very concentrated, serious effort over a period 
of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns was not charged in the attack on the White House  
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening page of the White House site was altered briefly to  
show a black Web page with the names of the hacker organizations 
claiming responsibility, along with messages, ``Your box was 
own3d'' and ``Stop all the war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The page also included the phrase, ``following peeps get some  
shouts,'' and listed a dozen names, including ``Zyklon.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Tours Macedonia Camp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) -- Touched by the plight of Kosovo  
Albanians, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said today that 
America and the NATO allies will not let ``the evil'' perpetrated 
by Slobodan Milosevic prevent them from returning home. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of smiling refugee children crowded the fence at the  
Stenkovec camp as the first lady walked into the tent city 
accompanied by U.S. Ambassador Christopher Hill, one of the key 
peace negotiators in the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was given a UNICEF cap by a boy who later told  
reporters he had been at the camp for two weeks after Serb police 
drove his family from Urosevac, telling his father they would kill 
the children if the family did not leave the southern Kosovo town. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleven-year-old Fatos Rexhep said his father died of a heart  
attack en route to safety in Macedonia. 
</P>
<P>
	Another refugee, 42-year-old Fetie Pronaj, told Mrs. Clinton  
that she had lost contact with her three children and husband, a 
Kosovo Liberation Army fighter, three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mrs. Clinton promised I would be with my family very soon,''  
Pronaj said. 
</P>
<P>
	In remarks to aid workers, Mrs. Clinton stressed that the United  
States would not abandon its efforts to get the refugees home -- 
some 780,000 ethnic Albanian refugees have been driven from Kosovo 
by Serb forces since March. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to send a message to the refugees that we do not intend  
to let the evil which Milosevic perpetrated against these people 
keep them away from their homeland and their homes,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is a very basic, fundamental commitment that is shared  
not only by those in the U.S. who are committed to this effort but 
our allies as well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The huge Stenkovec camp, with some 23,000 refugees, is the main  
tent city were Kosovo Albanians with relatives in the United States 
are screened for possible transport to America. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly one-third of the ethnic Albanian refugees who fled or  
have been expelled by Serb forces from Kosovo, a neighboring 
province of Yugoslavia's Serb republic, are in Macedonia. Most are 
in Albania, with lesser numbers in Bosnia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said his wife's mission is ``to clarify our  
compassion and concern for the predominantly Muslim Kosovar 
Albanians who've been driven out of their homes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the Stenkovec camp, refugees said they'd been told that  
somebody famous was coming to visit, and only later read in 
newspapers that it would be Mrs. Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overcrowded camp, many refugees complained that they were  
not allowed near Mrs. Clinton by security guards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wanted to see what she looked like and say hello,''  
said one disappointed young boy. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been signs of growing tensions in the overcrowded  
tent city. On Monday, refugees staged a mass protest complaining 
about poor conditions and alleged harassment by Slav Macedonian 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady, who stopped over in Naples, Italy, en route to  
Macedonia, was welcomed at Skopje airport's by Nada Gligorova, wife 
of President Kiro Gligorov, government officials and Hill, a key 
figure in failed negotiations with Milosevic to resolve the Kosovo 
conflict short of NATO military force. 
</P>
<P>
	She arrived in a U.S. Air Force C-130 transport plane, with an  
honor guard behind in a Black Hawk helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the Stenkovec camp, Mrs. Clinton visited a  
16th-century Orthodox Church and admired its frescoes and icons 
before meeting with local Macedonian aid agencies who were the 
first to help the refugees at the beginning of the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton flew here after visiting Belfast, Northern Ireland,  
and London, where she focused on the role of women and children, 
including addressing a children's rights conference in the British 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton will return to Washington from Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Hiss Grand Jury Records Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Citing their historical relevance and the  
public's right to know, a judge ordered the release of thousands of 
secret grand jury papers in the Cold War-era perjury case against 
Alger Hiss. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-year-old papers are thought to reveal key information  
about one of the most disputed episodes of the era. Hiss, a key 
government aide, was accused of spying for the Soviet Union in 
1948, but was tried on perjury charges when the statute of 
limitations for espionage expired. 
</P>
<P>
	He was sent to prison for three years in 1951 and died in 1996  
at age 92, still maintaining his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Access to such information inevitably enhances the accuracy of  
history and undermines the false conspiracy theories and 
revisionism that tend to arise when information remains secret,'' 
U.S. District Judge Peter Leisure said in his ruling Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision could give historians a legal precedent to open  
grand jury records in other significant cases. Grand jury 
proceedings are normally secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiss' son, Tony, praised the judge's ruling, saying his father  
hoped ``the full truth would be disclosed and people could see for 
themselves that he had always been an honorable and patriotic 
public servant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government fought hard to keep the 3,500 pages of  
testimony secret. Marvin Smilon, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Mary 
Jo White, said prosecutors had not decided whether to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiss, a former State Department aide, was convicted of perjury  
for lying to the grand jury in a case that lifted a 
Communist-hunting Richard Nixon, then a young congressman, to 
national prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	In challenging the release of the papers, the government argued  
that there was no legal precedent to make such material public and 
that grand juries are less inhibited when they act in secret. 
</P>
<P>
	But Leisure said he found the government's opposition perplexing  
because no national security interest was asserted and barely any 
privacy concerns were raised. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement Thursday, White called the rules safeguarding the  
secrecy of grand jury proceedings ``among the most important in our 
criminal justice system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rules do not contain an exception for historical interest,  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	David C. Vladeck, director of the Public Citizen Litigation  
Group, the legal arm of Ralph Nader's organization that fought for 
the papers' release, said Leisure's ruling ``marks the first real 
inroads into the idea that grand jury records ought to be kept 
secret forever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among those backing the opening of the files were conservative  
editor William F. Buckley and John Earl Haynes, a Library of 
Congress historian and co-author of several books on the Cold War 
and American Communism. 
</P>
<P>
	Tony Hiss, a visiting scholar at New York University's Taub  
Urban Research Center, said his father was not bitter about Nixon's 
role in his prosecution or about his years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always thought of Nixon as a young politician on the rise.  
He didn't think Nixon had anything personal against him, that he 
just saw an opportunity to advance,'' Hiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said prison life taught his father to appreciate ordinary  
aspects of life. 
</P>
<P>
	``He used to like to say to me that three years in prison is a  
good corrective to three years in Harvard,'' Hiss said.

	Senate Backs Gun Show Limits  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The GOP-led Senate today voted 48-47 for new  
restrictions on gun show sales, despite President Clinton's warning 
that the provision was ``riddled with high-caliber loopholes.'' The 
political maneuvering involved legislation to increase prosecution 
of juvenile offenders following the Columbine High School massacre 
near Denver. The Senate turned down a proposal to require Internet

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Dow Jones industrial average fell 193.87

off renewed worries about inflation. It wiped out yesterday's 
106.82-point gain that set a new closing high of 11,107.19. Broader 
stock indicators and bond prices were also loser. On the NYSE, 
losers led gainers 2,411-676. The Nasdaq fell 54.13 to 2,527.87. 
The 0.7 percent rise in the consumer price index for April was the

	Court Blocks Air Pollution Rules

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal appeals court today blocked the  
Environmental Protection Agency from imposing tougher air quality 
requirements the agency says are needed to protect people with 
respiratory problems and children. A three-judge panel acted on a 
lawsuit by a number of industry groups. Although the EPA said it 
will ask the Justice Department to appeal, the ruling halted any 
further enforcement of rules imposed in July 1997 that require 
states to dramatically reduce the amount of ozone, or smog, and 
microscopic soot they may allow in the air.

charred bodies, wrecked tractors and terrified survivors. The 
state-run Tanjug news agency reported ``ceaseless'' NATO air 
activity over Kosovo Friday night with attacks near several major 
cities. NATO said it was investigating the claim, while the State 
Department said Serb reports of the attack should be viewed with 
skepticism. The Serb-run Media Center in Kosovo reported 79 were

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Wins Trial in Missouri </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- Cigarette makers have defeated a Missouri  
lawsuit seeking millions of dollars and had the largest judgment 
ever entered in a tobacco trial cut by more than half in Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
	An Oregon judge on Thursday slashed a $79.5 million punitive  
damages verdict against Philip Morris to $32 million, which still 
remains the largest award ever against a tobacco company. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury had awarded the family of Jesse Williams the punitive  
damages plus $821,485 in compensatory damages for medical costs and 
pain and suffering. Williams was a former school janitor who died 
of lung cancer in 1997 at age 67 after smoking Marlboro cigarettes 
for 42 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge did not cut the compensatory amount.  
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Supreme Court said there are limits,'' Multnomah  
County Circuit Judge Anna Brown said. ``By no means is my personal 
point of view substituted for that of the jury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors said they were infuriated by documents showing that  
Philip Morris executives had lied for decades about the link 
between smoking and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	William Gaylord, who represented the Williams family, said  
during the hearing over damages that any reduction would be a 
public relations coup for the company. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- twice in Florida and once in New Jersey, Oregon and 
California. The Florida and New Jersey verdicts were overturned on 
appeal, while the $51.5 million award in California was halved by a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kansas City, Mo., on Thursday, a federal jury handed Brown &AMP;  
Williamson Tobacco Corp. its second victory in four days, deciding 
the company was not at fault in the case of a smoker who died of 
lung cancer in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Steele's family had sued for $26 million, claiming the  
company sold him an unreasonably dangerous product. 
</P>
<P>
	But jury foreman Gary White said Steele ``was quite aware of the  
dangers, but the pleasures outweighed the dangers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, a jury in Memphis, Tenn., cleared B&AMP;W and two other  
tobacco companies of liability in the deaths of three smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry analyst Gary Black of Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. said  
the recent trial victories showed investors the industry can manage 
legal challenges. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry needed to win this case and the case in Memphis  
to show plaintiffs' attorneys that these cases are not easy to 
win,'' Black said. ``They needed to show they were in control.''

<HEADLINE> Revision of Hate Crime Law Stalls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Efforts to strengthen Texas' hate crimes  
law failed again in the state Senate -- a failure the bill's sponsor 
attributed to presidential politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since our governor is a leading presidential hopeful, the eyes  
of the world are on Texas,'' said state Sen. Rodney Ellis, a 
Houston Democrat. ``Everything we do now takes on national 
implications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. George W. Bush, repeating the same comment he's given for  
several weeks, said again Thursday that he ``will look at the bill 
when it makes it to my desk, if it makes it to my desk.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal to include gays in the legislation has been a major  
hurdle. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed legislation has received the backing of President  
Clinton and Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley. A 
broadening of hate crimes laws also is being considered on the 
federal level. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters of the state legislation -- named after James Byrd  
Jr., the black man dragged to his death in East Texas last summer -- 
said they have yet to give up, but they deemed the bills ``on life 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After trying for days to reach a compromise with Republicans on  
the bill to strengthen the state hate crimes law, Democrats tried 
an unusual parliamentary tactic to send it from the Criminal 
Justice Committee to the full Senate for debate. 
</P>
<P>
	That move failed Thursday, and the bill was left pending.  
</P>
<P>
	West tried next to pass a different hate crimes bill out of the  
State Affairs Committee. But the Republican chairwoman, state Sen. 
Florence Shapiro, never called for a vote on it. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had an agreement that I would hear it if he had the  
votes,'' she said. ``And he did not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both Republican-dominated committees meet again today and the  
bills could be considered. Midnight is the deadline for Senate 
committees to consider legislation, and the Legislative session as 
a whole ends May 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's current hate crimes law -- which punishes crimes  
committed with bias or prejudice as a motive -- has been criticized 
by bill supporters as too vague to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
	As passed by the House last month, a hate crime would be defined  
as one motivated by the victim's race, ethnicity, gender, 
disability, religion or sexual preference. 
</P>
<P>
	Ellis said that the major ``sticking point'' to the hate crimes  
bill was the categories of protected groups -- in particular the 
measure that would cover homosexuals.

<HEADLINE> US Aims To Punish EU in Beef Spat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States said Friday it will ask for  
stiff tariffs on $202 million worth of European products in 
retaliation for the European Union's decision to ignore a deadline 
on opening its markets to hormone-treated American beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The request to the World Trade Organization to impose 100  
percent tariffs on the products came one day after the European 
Union missed a WTO deadline to end its 10-year ban on U.S. beef. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU said it would not comply with the deadline because  
preliminary results from at least one new study suggested some of 
the meat could cause cancer, although the bulk of its research will 
not be completed until next year. The United States rejects this 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the EU's unwillingness to meet its  
international obligations leaves the U.S. with no choice,'' 
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We take this course as a last resort,'' added U.S. Trade  
Representative Charlene Barshefsky. ``The EU should meet its WTO 
obligations. ... To do anything less is to jeopardize the 
credibility and integrity of the WTO.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $202 million is the estimated amount of beef that would be  
exported annually without the ban, officials said. More than 90 
percent of American cattle producers feed hormones approved by the 
Food and Drug Administration to make cattle grow faster and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo Paemen, the EU's chief envoy to the U.S., said the EU's  
decision was based solely on scientific study. ``This does not mean 
that there is unwillingness on the part of the European Union to 
comply with its obligations in relation to the World Trade 
Organization,'' Paemen said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU would be willing to strike a compensation deal with the  
United States, which would, for instance, lower tariffs on other 
American goods coming into Europe, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe the compensation package is far preferable to  
retaliation which is trade restrictive and hurts U.S. importers and 
EU companies that have nothing to do with the beef sector,'' Paemen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and the 15-nation European Union are already  
embroiled in a dispute over trade barriers imposed on bananas 
produced by American companies. U.S. officials have targeted $191.4 
million in European products for 100-percent tariffs in that 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Glickman and Barshefsky said the U.S. would be willing to  
discuss compensation in the beef dispute as an interim step. 
</P>
<P>
	But, ``compensation is only acceptable if the EU agrees to lift  
the ban,'' Barshefsky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under WTO settlement procedures, the U.S. request for tariffs  
must be granted by June 12 unless the EU claims the amount exceeds 
the harm caused to U.S. exports. If the EU makes that claim, the 
matter will go to arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, if the U.S. request is approved, the products will be  
chosen from a preliminary list of $900 million worth of European 
products. The United States did not release the final list of $202 
million in products on Friday, leaving scores of American importers 
wondering what will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	The preliminary list, while covering predominantly agriculture  
products, contains a limited number of manufactured goods, 
including Italian moped motorcycles and hair clippers. The 
agriculture goods included canned hams from Denmark and other types 
of pork, beef and poultry, a variety of tomato products, Roquefort 
cheese, truffles, onions, chestnuts, paprika, goose liver, chewing 
gum, chocolate and mineral water. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of importers of European delicacies, such as foie gras  
and truffles, argued at a hearing last month that they were being 
caught unfairly in a trade war between the world's two largest 
trading partners. They urged U.S. officials to exempt the products 
they care about. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher tariffs would effectively double the prices and are  
designed to eliminate the goods from the U.S. market in 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
	``While retaliation is a necessary step to force EU compliance,  
the only real solution to this issue is access to the EU market for 
U.S. cattle producers,'' said George Swan, president of the 
National Cattlemen's Beef Association. ``Access is all that is 
required.''

<HEADLINE> Wheat Pulls Corn, Soybeans Down / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Wheat futures fell sharply Friday on the Chicago  
Board of Trade, dragging corn and soybeans lower as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat erased initial gains amid renewed pessimism about whether  
world demand will be strong enough to cut into ample supplies. Good 
weather in winter wheat regions this weekend may prove beneficial 
to the crop, boosting yields. Rains also were expected over the 
weekend in Chinese growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures this week found a measure of support from  
government projections that the crop will be far smaller than last 
year's. But prices also were pressured Friday by talk the active 
July contract could fall to $2.10 a bushel before it expires. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn fell in sympathy with wheat despite a lower acreage  
projection from influential forecasting firm Sparks Co. of Memphis, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
	Soybeans were slightly lower amid fears acreage will continue to  
grow, boosting what is already expected to be a bumper crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery fell 10 cents to $2.60 1/2 a bushel; July  
corn fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.21 3/4 a bushel; July oats fell 4 1/4 cents to 
$1.21 a bushel; July soybeans fell 1/2 cent to $4.69 1/4 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
amid continued optimism that the Memorial Day start of the summer 
grilling season will boost demand sharply. Pork futures moved 
sharply lower on profit-taking from recent highs this week. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle rose .50 cent to 61.90 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .92 cent to 73.67 cents a pound; June lean hogs 
fell 1.18 cents to 58.87 cents a pound; July pork bellies fell 2.82 
cents to 56.20 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Gettysburg Museum Change Advised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GETTYSBURG, Pa. (AP) -- An advisory panel recommended Friday that  
the National Park Service proceed with plans to tear down the 
Cyclorama building at Gettysburg National Military Park as part of 
a proposal to build a new visitor center and museum. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old building, which houses a circular painting of  
the Civil War battle, was determined last year to be eligible for 
listing on the National Register of Historic Places. The move 
caused a potential conflict with plans for the new center and 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at the Gettysburg park, led by Superintendent John A.  
Latschar, have said their primary goal was to protect the site of 
the 1863 battle, on which the building was constructed. Removing 
the building would help restore the conditions of a significant 
part of the battlefield, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Latschar said Friday that the recommendation by the Advisory  
Council on Historic Preservation resolves the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is, basically, the advisory council's concurrence in our  
proposal to remove the building and rehabilitate the historic 
landscape,'' Latschar said. ``The advisory council is our supreme 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Architects who wanted the Cyclorama included on the National  
Register weren't happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I find it very hard to understand that you would selectively  
take one piece of this whole tapestry and remove it and say that 
would make sense in preserving the landscape,'' said architect Dion 
Neutra, who worked on the building. ``It doesn't wash.''

<HEADLINE> Cotton Socks Cause Athletes Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Cotton socks are worse than old-fashioned for athletes -- they  
can also be harmful in some situations, a sock expert says. 
</P>
<P>
	``State of the art today is using 100 percent synthetic  
fibers,'' said podiatrist Douglas Richie Jr. of the Los Angeles 
suburb of Los Alamitos. ``Synthetic fibers are markedly different 
from cotton or wool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wearing the older fibers gives an athlete or a hiker a higher  
risk of foot troubles such as blisters and bruises, Richie and 
other experts say. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would avoid cotton socks at all costs,'' said podiatrist  
Stephen Pribut of George Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	However, an official of a company that makes cotton and  
synthetic fiber socks said that, for ordinary wear, cotton will do 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetic fibers made of such materials as polypropylene and  
Teflon are better for what socks are supposed to do, said Richie, 
who has done research on sock performance. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those functions is to keep sweat away from the foot,  
because a wet foot is more likely to blister and become infected. 
</P>
<P>
	It's like what happens to skin when you spend too long in the  
tub, Pribut said: ``Your skin gets white and a little more mushy.'' 
Twisting and shearing forces make blisters form. 
</P>
<P>
	The pressure created by activity drives sweat back into the  
outside layer of skin, a covering of protein that is the remains of 
dead skin cells. The moisture softens the protein, Pribut said. 
</P>
<P>
	Movement, such as walking or running, can tear part of the outer  
layer away from the underlying live skin cells, creating a gap that 
fills with fluid, which aching hikers and runners know as blisters. 
</P>
<P>
	In a properly made sock, however, the movement also can pump  
sweat away from the foot, Richie said. The moisture enters air 
pockets in the fabric, and stepping squeezes the sweat out, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the process breaks down if pressure permanently flattens the  
fabric, leaving no room for air pockets, Richie said. Cotton is 
more prone to flatten, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The other part of the sweat-removal process is how to get rid of  
it once it has been taken away from the foot. Synthetic fabrics do 
this better because they dry more quickly, Richie said. 
</P>
<P>
	A denser weave makes for more air pockets and less compaction.  
Better socks have more terrycloth loops in them, Richie said. A 
buyer can tell the difference in the store simply by turning the 
socks inside out. 
</P>
<P>
	Some newer socks also rely on a blister-prevention method that  
dates from the old days, combining a light liner with a heavier 
outer sock. By wearing what amounts to two pair, the shearing force 
that otherwise would fall on the sock and the skin is dissipated to 
the inner and outer sock. 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetic sports socks are far from cheap. They can run $20 or  
more, although a person can get a decent pair for $8, Pribut said. 
Cotton athletic socks have the advantage of being cheap, but mere 
price does not make them acceptable to some podiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
	Synthetics will last longer, anyway, so the cost difference  
shrinks when you factor in the cost of constantly replacing wornout 
cotton, Richie said. 
</P>
<P>
	There are other cost factors as well. Synthetic sports socks are  
thicker, so people who buy the socks may also need new shoes, said 
Debbie Lazenby, spokeswoman for Thorlo, a synthetic sports socks 
company in Statesville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most people purchase their footwear too small,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	And if you are not working up a big sweat, you can get by  
without synthetic sports socks, Richie said. ``Cotton is acceptable 
for casual wear,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of what most people use athletic socks for, which is  
just walking around, cotton is fine,'' said Kevin Angliss, 
president of Auburn Hosiery Mills in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is a sock licensee for Wilson and Converse sports  
socks in the United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	For workouts and games, Angliss agreed that synthetics would be  
better.

<HEADLINE> Blue Jays Looking To Close Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whitey Herzog used to boast about his ``bullpen  
by committee.'' Now, Toronto manager Jim Fregosi seems to be taking 
the same approach when it comes to a closer. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Graeme Lloyd and rookies Tom Davey, Roy Halladay and  
Billy Koch have saves for the Blue Jays this season. The bullpen 
also includes lefty specialist Dan Plesac. 
</P>
<P>
	Fregosi, though, is in no rush to find a relief ace.  
</P>
<P>
	``Why is everyone so anxious to put tags on people?'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Lloyd was hoping to get the job after being traded from the  
Yankees in spring training. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has pitched extremely well,'' Fregosi said. ``But he is not  
what I consider a power guy, and basically you would like to have a 
power guy as your closer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In time, Koch could emerge as the stopper. The No. 4 pick  
overall in the 1996 draft, he missed most of 1997 after 
reconstructive surgery on his elbow. 
</P>
<P>
	Koch made his major league debut this month, pitching in relief  
for the first time in his career. In his first three outings for 
the Blue Jays, he threw 5 2-3 scoreless innings, allowing one hit 
and striking out five. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I think he has the stuff to close? Yes,'' Fregosi said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Blue Jays, expected by many to win the AL wild-card spot,  
went into the weekend at a disappointing 18-18. Hitting has been no 
trouble; they're batting .287 as a team. 
</P>
<P>
	But pitching, particularly starting pitching, has been the  
surprising problem. 
</P>
<P>
	David Wells (6.00 ERA), injured Joey Hamilton (19.29) and Kelvim  
Escobar (5.23) have struggled. Former Cy Young winner Pat Hentgen 
(4.30) hoped he was back in the groove after an 8-2 win Thursday in 
Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	``Offensively, we have played super,'' Hentgen said. ``We  
haven't pitched as well as we all thought coming out of spring 
training.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WALK THIS WAY:* Last year, Raul Mondesi was a 30-30 man for Los  
Angeles -- and not the kind the Dodgers wanted to see. 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, the star outfielder hit 30 home runs. But he also walked  
only 30 times all season. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, along with hitting 13 home runs -- tied for the major  
league lead going into the weekend -- he's already walked 22 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Mondesi gives much of the kudos to teammate Gary Sheffield.  
</P>
<P>
	``We talk a lot about hitting,'' Mondesi said. ``He was telling  
me to be patient when I'm up there because if I do, I'll get a good 
pitch.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CASEY AT THE BAT ... AND ON THE PHONE:* Even before he started  
hitting over .370, Sean Casey impressed everyone he met him with 
his friendly manner. 
</P>
<P>
	So, it was just natural that when the Cincinnati Reds first  
baseman heard about a college player who had an eye injury similar 
to his own, he picked up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey tried to lift the spirits of Evansville's Anthony Molina,  
who was hit in the left eye by a warmup pitch before a game against 
Wichita State on April 23. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of the feelings I had last year came back when I was  
talking to him,'' Casey said. ``I felt like I was talking to 
myself. It sounded like exactly what I had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey was hit in the right eye by a throw from a teammate during  
pregame practice on April 2 last year. He temporarily lost vision 
in the eye and had to have a plate installed to stabilize fractures 
around the eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey's injury could have ended his career. But one year later,  
his vision in the eye is actually a little better than before the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	He read about Molina and got his phone number.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's nice to talk to somebody who's been through it because  
not many people have, you know?'' Casey said. ``It's no fun. He had 
the same exact symptoms. I told him I'd keep him in my prayers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think things happen for a reason,'' he said. ``Maybe the  
reason it happened to me was to be able to talk to kids like that, 
to be able to relate with somebody who's been through that 
experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Molina, a second baseman-catcher, had his cheekbone broken and  
has not gotten back clear vision. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey said Molina sounded discouraged when they started talking,  
but was more upbeat by the time their 15-minute conversation ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just really impressed that he would take the time to  
call me,'' Molina said. ``He just kept saying that everything in 
life happens for a reason and that the important thing is where I 
go from here.'' 
</P>
<P>
                              	----	 
</P>
<P>
	 *AROUND THE HORN:* Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter usually does  
not wear his World Series championship rings around town. But when 
he had dinner last weekend in New York with best buddy Alex 
Rodriguez of the Seattle Mariners, Jeter made sure he wore both of 
them. Rodriguez tried on both pieces of hardware. ... NL umpire 
Eric Gregg, whose weight and health have caused concern in recent 
years, missed last week while undergoing tests. He's looking 
forward to returning to work this week. ... Starting Monday, the 
Mets play an unusual stretch in which they have games out of New 
York only three times in 28 days. During that span, they have three 
off-days, and a pair of three-game road series -- at Pittsburgh and 
at Yankee Stadium. ... While duos such as Roberto Alomar and Omar 
Vizquel may get more attention, the fanciest double-play combo in 
the majors right now might belong to rookie 2B Carlos Febles and 
shortstop Rey Sanchez in Kansas City. Led by their acrobatic and 
athletic pair, the Royals were tops in the majors in DPs and are on 
a pace to turn a whopping 238, which would shatter the team record 
of 192 set in 1973. ... Former All-Star 2B Carlos Baerga is hitting 
over .300 for Triple-A Indianapolis, batting third and playing 
second base and third base. His contract gives him the right to 
negotiate with any big league team beginning this weekend, though 
the 30-year-old Baerga intends to stay with Cincinnati's top 
affiliate unless another club comes calling. ``I'd like to come up 
with the Reds because this team gave me the chance,'' he said. ... 
Talk about role reversal: Most often, major league teams that run 
into a lot of injuries call up minor leaguers to fill the gaps. But 
when aches and pains recently left Triple-A Syracuse with only 
eight position players, where did the SkyChiefs get help? From the 
parent Toronto Blue Jays, who sent pitcher Joey Hamilton, second 
baseman Homer Bush and DH Dave Hollins to Syracuse for their rehab 
assignments.

<HEADLINE>  Cleveland Indians Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- First baseman Jim Thome, surprised as anyone to  
hear that Cleveland owner Richard Jacobs is putting the Indians up 
for sale, figures one radical idea deserves another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can get about 10 players and get enough money to  
buy this team,'' Thome said Thursday night at Jacobs Field. ``We 
were talking about it coming out here, me and Mark Langston. We 
were saying, `Let's get some money and buy this thing.' It would be 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome was kidding, of course. But as Clevelanders found out  
early Thursday morning, Jacobs was not. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned the city, Jacobs put his Indians on the  
market Thursday, hoping to find someone willing to keep the team in 
town and its reputation intact as one of baseball's hottest 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put it this way: I want to have a say in passing the  
torch,'' the 73-year-old Jacobs said. ``I don't want an executor of 
mine to say, `Well, Jacobs, he has no hand from the grave, he can't 
do anything on this. Let's make up our decision, who should be the 
owner of this team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, the Indians' chairman, president, CEO and controlling  
stockholder since buying the team with his late brother, David, for 
$45 million in 1986, said he decided a few weeks ago it was the 
right time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shocking,'' said Indians fan Selwyn Powell of Cleveland.  
``I never, ever, ever thought this would happen. Not with the run 
they've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 1/2 years ago, Browns owner Art Modell moved Cleveland's  
beloved NFL franchise to Baltimore. Only now is the sports-crazed 
city recovering from that as it welcomes back the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his news conference at the ballpark that bears his  
name, Jacobs sought to reassure Indians fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry,'' he said. ``This team's not going anywhere. We  
have a lease for 15 more years. And anyway, who would want to move 
a team like this? We're in a ballpark that has sold out 308 
straight games. Moving is out of the realm of speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Mike Hargrove said he would explain the situation to the  
players before they flew to Detroit for tonight's game against the 
Tigers. He did not think the announcement would distract the team 
from its goal of trying to win its first World Series title since 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a job to do on the field,'' Hargrove said. ``We've  
got to keep our focus. And to do that you need a certain amount of 
tunnel vision, which I think we've been able to do. I don't see 
that lessening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team is in first place in the AL Central with the best  
record in baseball at 24-9 -- Cleveland's best start in its 99-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Several local candidates were among the bidders for the new  
Browns last year, and their names immediately came up as 
speculation began about who could buy the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	But even potential suitors were caught off guard by the Indians'  
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale ``is a real surprise,'' said local lawyer Larry Dolan,  
who with his brother, Charles, chairman of Cablevision Systems, 
unsuccessfully bid for the Browns. The Dolans also have tried to 
buy the Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I was certainly very interested to learn about his  
decision, it is premature to say whether or not I am a prospective 
buyer,'' Larry Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy manufacturer Thomas Murdough, who briefly allied with Jacobs  
in a Browns bid, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were eventually purchased for $530 million by  
billionaire suburban Cleveland banker Al Lerner. The Browns issued 
a statement saying they were certain Jacobs ``will make the right 
decision for the Cleveland community and the Indians fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York developer Howard Milstein, another would-be Browns and  
Redskins buyer, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the team's board of directors hired two investment  
firms, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and McDonald Investments Inc., to 
identify potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he wants any prospective owner to be ``somebody  
committed to baseball and committed to Cleveland'' and that any 
sale would not be finalized until after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He would prefer any potential owner or ownership group to be  
from the Cleveland area, and insisted that if the right offer 
didn't come along, he would take the Indians off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said his decision was not prompted by any health or  
financial problems. With the price for major sports teams 
skyrocketing -- the Redskins' price tag, pending NFL approval, is 
$800 million -- Jacobs understands that now might be the perfect 
time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Redskins can command $800 million, the Indians should  
bask in that also,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the Indians became the third pro sports team, along  
with the NHL's Florida Panthers and NBA's Boston Celtics, to offer 
stocks to the public. The club sold about four million shares at 
$15 per share, a move which raised about $60 million for Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he has turned a healthy profit from his initial  
investment in the team and that the Indians, whose net revenues in 
1998 were $144.6 million, are ``making money, very good money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's stock closed Wednesday at $9.94 but soared to $16.25  
by the end of Thursday on the strength of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who made his fortune in real estate, has kept a  
low-profile as owner, deferring to general manager John Hart. Like 
everyone else, Hart was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a personal standpoint, my reaction was one of surprise  
and a feeling of sadness,'' Hart said. ``But as Dick explained them 
to me, his reasons were good, and it made sense for him and the 
franchise.''

<HEADLINE>  Cleveland Indians Up for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- First baseman Jim Thome, surprised as anyone to  
hear that Cleveland owner Richard Jacobs is putting the Indians up 
for sale, figures one radical idea deserves another. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully we can get about 10 players and get enough money to  
buy this team,'' Thome said Thursday night at Jacobs Field. ``We 
were talking about it coming out here, me and Mark Langston. We 
were saying, `Let's get some money and buy this thing.' It would be 
great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thome was kidding, of course. But as Clevelanders found out  
early Thursday morning, Jacobs was not. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move that stunned the city, Jacobs put his Indians on the  
market Thursday, hoping to find someone willing to keep the team in 
town and its reputation intact as one of baseball's hottest 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's put it this way: I want to have a say in passing the  
torch,'' the 73-year-old Jacobs said. ``I don't want an executor of 
mine to say, `Well, Jacobs, he has no hand from the grave, he can't 
do anything on this. Let's make up our decision, who should be the 
owner of this team.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, the Indians' chairman, president, CEO and controlling  
stockholder since buying the team with his late brother, David, for 
$45 million in 1986, said he decided a few weeks ago it was the 
right time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's shocking,'' said Indians fan Selwyn Powell of Cleveland.  
``I never, ever, ever thought this would happen. Not with the run 
they've had.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just 3 1/2 years ago, Browns owner Art Modell moved Cleveland's  
beloved NFL franchise to Baltimore. Only now is the sports-crazed 
city recovering from that as it welcomes back the new Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Early in his news conference at the ballpark that bears his  
name, Jacobs sought to reassure Indians fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Don't worry,'' he said. ``This team's not going anywhere. We  
have a lease for 15 more years. And anyway, who would want to move 
a team like this? We're in a ballpark that has sold out 308 
straight games. Moving is out of the realm of speculation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manager Mike Hargrove said he would explain the situation to the  
players before they flew to Detroit for tonight's game against the 
Tigers. He did not think the announcement would distract the team 
from its goal of trying to win its first World Series title since 
1948. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a job to do on the field,'' Hargrove said. ``We've  
got to keep our focus. And to do that you need a certain amount of 
tunnel vision, which I think we've been able to do. I don't see 
that lessening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team is in first place in the AL Central with the best  
record in baseball at 24-9 -- Cleveland's best start in its 99-year 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Several local candidates were among the bidders for the new  
Browns last year, and their names immediately came up as 
speculation began about who could buy the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
	But even potential suitors were caught off guard by the Indians'  
sudden availability. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale ``is a real surprise,'' said local lawyer Larry Dolan,  
who with his brother, Charles, chairman of Cablevision Systems, 
unsuccessfully bid for the Browns. The Dolans also have tried to 
buy the Cincinnati Reds, New York Yankees and the NFL's Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
	``While I was certainly very interested to learn about his  
decision, it is premature to say whether or not I am a prospective 
buyer,'' Larry Dolan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toy manufacturer Thomas Murdough, who briefly allied with Jacobs  
in a Browns bid, did not return calls. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns were eventually purchased for $530 million by  
billionaire suburban Cleveland banker Al Lerner. The Browns issued 
a statement saying they were certain Jacobs ``will make the right 
decision for the Cleveland community and the Indians fans.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New York developer Howard Milstein, another would-be Browns and  
Redskins buyer, declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said the team's board of directors hired two investment  
firms, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and McDonald Investments Inc., to 
identify potential buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he wants any prospective owner to be ``somebody  
committed to baseball and committed to Cleveland'' and that any 
sale would not be finalized until after this season. 
</P>
<P>
	He would prefer any potential owner or ownership group to be  
from the Cleveland area, and insisted that if the right offer 
didn't come along, he would take the Indians off the market. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said his decision was not prompted by any health or  
financial problems. With the price for major sports teams 
skyrocketing -- the Redskins' price tag, pending NFL approval, is 
$800 million -- Jacobs understands that now might be the perfect 
time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the Redskins can command $800 million, the Indians should  
bask in that also,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last June, the Indians became the third pro sports team, along  
with the NHL's Florida Panthers and NBA's Boston Celtics, to offer 
stocks to the public. The club sold about four million shares at 
$15 per share, a move which raised about $60 million for Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs said he has turned a healthy profit from his initial  
investment in the team and that the Indians, whose net revenues in 
1998 were $144.6 million, are ``making money, very good money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team's stock closed Wednesday at $9.94 but soared to $16.25  
by the end of Thursday on the strength of the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs, who made his fortune in real estate, has kept a  
low-profile as owner, deferring to general manager John Hart. Like 
everyone else, Hart was caught off guard. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a personal standpoint, my reaction was one of surprise  
and a feeling of sadness,'' Hart said. ``But as Dick explained them 
to me, his reasons were good, and it made sense for him and the 
franchise.''

<HEADLINE> Owner of Sunken Tour Boat Testifies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) -- The owner of a tour boat that sank in  
Lake Hamilton, killing 13 people, testified today he was assured by 
a mechanic that the craft was sound hours before it took to the 
water. 
</P>
<P>
	Don Bridges, owner of Land and Lake Tours Inc., testified he was  
called at home the morning of May 1 by Bill Woodall, a company 
mechanic who had worked on the Miss Majestic. Its operator, 
Elizabeth Helmbrecht, had brought the boat in for repairs on April 
29. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodall ``called me Saturday morning, and said he turned it over  
to the driver,'' Bridges told the Coast Guard Marine Safety Board 
of Investigation. ``I said, `Did you get everything fixed?' and he 
said `Yes.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Bridges testified today that mechanics at the family-owned  
company often don't explain to him the nature of repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just call and say this boat is ready to go,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The boat was pulled from the water Sunday. Investigators found a  
rip in an accordian-like seal at one end of the drive shaft cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Oliver, another company mechanic, testified on Thursday  
that he safely tightened a drive shaft seal he replaced on the Miss 
Majestic less than two hours before the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I wouldn't have driven it myself, I wouldn't have put  
anyone else on it,'' Oliver said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under questioning, Oliver said that while the seal was tight, it  
might have been misaligned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's possible it was not square,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Helmbrecht gave the vessel a visual inspection before  
selecting the Miss Majestic to take 20 tourists on a $9 tour of Hot 
Springs and Lake Hamilton, Oliver said. Ms. Helmbrecht was among 
eight people who survived. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony Thursday, Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Robert  
Thompson said he found several problems with the boat's pumps. 
</P>
<P>
	In testing after the Miss Majestic was pulled from the lake  
Sunday, one shut off after 22 seconds, one pumped two gallons a 
minute when it should have pumped 12.5 and another pumped at 12 
gallons a minute when it should have worked at 18.3 gallons a 
minute, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The low rate of pumping power could have contributed to the  
sinking, he said.

<HEADLINE> Mark Martin Wins Hardee's 250 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Mark Martin outran Roush Racing teammate  
Jeff Burton over the last fifth of the rain-delayed Hardee's 250 
Busch Grand National race Friday night and Matt Kenseth took over 
the series points lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin took the lead from Burton on the 197th lap at Richmond  
International Raceway and pulled away from the defending champion 
to post his track-high fifth Busch victory on the 
three-quarter-mile oval. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who also won Busch races at Las Vegas and Texas this  
season, gained his series-record 37th career victory and third in 
this race. 
</P>
<P>
	Kenseth, who started the race 19 points behind leader Dale  
Earnhardt Jr. in the driver standings and 10 ahead of No. 3 Elton 
Sawyer, took advantage of a wreck that put both drivers off the 
track by finishing third. The solid effort moved him into the 
points lead by 84 over Earnhardt, who wound up 32nd, and by 119 
over Sawyer, who limped home in 34th place. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to race against Mark and Jeff Burton,'' Kenseth  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Todd Bodine finished fourth and Jeff Green was fifth.  
</P>
<P>
	The race, delayed 2 hours, 43 minutes at the start by rain, was  
sloppy throughout. The first caution came on the second lap when 
Lyndon Amick spun out exiting the second turn, and there were two 
yellow flags in the first 10 laps and three cars behind the wall 
after the first 32 laps. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time it was over, there had been 11 caution flags that  
slowed the race for 58 laps, and nine cars had called it a long 
night early. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last 79 laps were all run under green, and that helped  
Martin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't beat those guys on new tires,'' Martin said. ``I  
just thought if we could ever get into green flag racing we'd be 
all right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many of the less-experienced competitors, Martin and  
Burton seemed to have no trouble with the damp conditions, and the 
Winston Cup stars rewarded fans who waited as many as 12 hours with 
their late-race battle. 
</P>
<P>
	``We got beat by the best tonight,'' Burton said.  
</P>
<P>
	Martin, though, was clearly stronger under green, and he wound  
up winning by 1.111 seconds despite battling lapped traffic at the 
end. His average speed was 90.072 mph in a race that took 2 hours, 
4 minutes, 54 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry Gant had shared the track lead with four career Busch  
victories. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Grissom, who collected Earnhardt Jr. and Elliott Sadler  
when he crashed into the turn 3 wall, was transported to Memorial 
General Medical Center. There was no immediate word on his 
condition.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Forecaster Out of Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT COLLINS, Colo. (AP) -- William Gray, the researcher whose  
hurricane forecasts are relied on from the Caribbean to the Gulf 
Coast, may be out of the prediction business. 
</P>
<P>
	``My project is nearly broke. I'm having to terminate staff or  
find other funding for their salaries,'' Gray said Friday. ``I 
don't have my salary for this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billy Wagner, emergency manager for the Florida Keys, said  
Gray's departure ``would be a great loss. He's the only one giving 
us guidance on what the activity is going to be in the Atlantic 
Basin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gray, 69, used to get funding from the National Oceanic and  
Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation and the 
insurance industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Insurers stopped paying when his federally funded research  
became available for free on the Internet. NOAA has rejected his 
requests for funding for the past six years. The Federal Emergency 
Management Agency also rejected funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he is paid to teach by Colorado State University, the  
only support for his hurricane research now comes from the NSF, 
$145,000. He said that amounts to about $50,000 after expenses and 
other research. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he needs about $400,000 a year to keep his forecasts  
coming. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray said he believes his research has been rejected because he  
has publicly questioned the validity of sophisticated computer 
programs -- called numeric models -- that are becoming the dominant 
method of forecasting. The programs use mathematical formulas to 
forecast the weather, based on existing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray uses computer programs, too. One wall in his office is  
awash with calculations that would make a calculus teacher drool. 
He calls it ``our hurricane pool.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His calculations include a study of past events, but also  
conditions elsewhere, including West Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Tim Tomastik of NOAA said the decision to reject Gray's  
proposals were made by a peer review committee of fellow 
scientists, not the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	Gray's forecasts have been close to the mark during the 16 years  
he made predictions, with 1997 the major exception. He predicted 
seven hurricanes with three of them major; only three occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	For the 1999 season, Gray has predicted 14 named storms and nine  
hurricanes, four of them major.

<HEADLINE> Injury Forces Connors To Leave Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jimmy Connors, just four points from victory  
against Jose-Luis Clerc, retired with a torn abdominal muscle 
Friday in the quarterfinals of the Sprint PCS Champions seniors 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Connors was leading 6-3, 5-4 and would have been serving for the  
match when he requested trainer Bob Donatelli for the third time. 
Donatelli advised Connors to stop or face a six-month layoff if the 
injury got worse. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Connors, lying on the training table with his right  
hand on his forehead and his left hand holding an ice pack on his 
ribs, said he first felt the injury while serving in the first set. 
In the second set, his serves were slow and short. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I played a couple of long points, I had problems taking  
deep breaths,'' Connors said. ``I was OK when I was down hitting my 
groundstrokes, but on my serve I wasn't getting any pace and it 
wasn't getting any better. If we just had a returning match out 
there, I'd have been OK.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connors, who had won the tour's two previous tournaments and had  
a six-match winning streak, said he didn't try to finish the game 
to get the victory because he would have been forced to default in 
the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people deserve some tennis on the weekend,'' Connors said.  
``If I'm not going out there 100 percent, it's not right for me to 
play. I'm not like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clerc could only shrug his shoulders as he accepted the winner's  
applause leaving the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't feel so happy because I beat Connors in this way,''  
Clerc said. ``I think it's really bad for the tournament because 
everybody wants to see Jimmy Connors. It's really difficult to play 
when you see somebody in pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donatelli said Connors might be able to play in the tour's next  
event, June 8-13 in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	John McEnroe, the tournament's top seed, opens play Saturday  
against Mikael Pernfors, who beat Eddie Dibbs 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, Tim Wilkison defeated John Lloyd 6-0, 6-3 and Mats  
Wilander beat Mel Purcell 6-4, 7-6 (7-2).

<HEADLINE> Pippen Wants To Level Play  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- For Scottie Pippen, the Houston Rockets' playoff  
series with the Los Angeles Lakers has had more highs and lows than 
a roller coaster ride. 
</P>
<P>
	He came crashing down in the first two games, pointing fingers  
after the Game 1 loss and scoring just three points in Game 2 on 
0-of-7 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen finally was back on top in Game 3 with a career-best 37  
points, helping the Rockets to a 102-88 victory Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The question now is whether he can keep riding that high and  
help even the best-of-5 series at two games apiece, or is another 
fall on the horizon? Game 4 is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I've ever lost my groove,'' Pippen said Friday  
after practice. ``I was just more aggressive last night, and I plan 
on being more aggressive throughout this series. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our manhood was on the line last night,'' he added. ``Letting  
this young team come out and really dominate us the first couple of 
games, we had to come out last night and prove that we're a team 
that deserves to be in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first two games, Pippen was 5-for-20 from the field,  
including 0-for-6 from 3-point range. In Game 3, he was 12-for-27 
from the field, including 3-for-5 on 3-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers' Kobe Bryant noticed a change.  
</P>
<P>
	``He came out more aggressive and did a better job of getting  
involved in their offense,'' Bryant said. ``He started going inside 
early and built up his confidence, and then he stepped back and 
started hitting the outside shots.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryant promised Pippen wouldn't get the same chance in Game 4.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to make our adjustments and counterattack on  
Saturday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shaquille O'Neal said Bryant would make things much tougher on  
Pippen next time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kobe's coming back,'' he said. ``Scottie didn't have to play  
that much defense yesterday, but he's going to have to play defense 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 1, Bryant was guarding Pippen in the final seconds when  
Pippen lost his footing and control of the ball. The Lakers 
regained possession and went on to win 101-100. 
</P>
<P>
	After the game Pippen shifted the blame, questioning teammate  
Charles Barkley for fouling Shaquille O'Neal in the final minutes. 
Pippen then turned out a miserable Game 2 performance. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, shrugging off the earlier criticism, praised Pippen for  
turning things around in Game 3. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very proud of my team,'' said Barkley, who had 30 points  
and 23 rebounds. ``Obviously, Scottie played great, and Brent Price 
and Sam Mack did, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Game 3, O'Neal led the Lakers with 26 points and 10 rebounds,  
while Bryant and Glen Rice each had 13 points. At Friday's 
workouts, Rice complained that he should have gotten the ball more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only thing I can do is try and go to the coach and ask him  
to run more plays for me,'' he said. ``I'm not going to go out 
there and break up a play to try and get Glen Rice involved. I just 
want it to happen in the flow of the offense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal said the Lakers would simply have to get back to basics  
if they hope to lock up the series on Saturday. If the Rockets tie 
it, Game 5 would be Monday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get back to what we were doing in Los Angeles,  
which is playing inside-outside and playing smart basketball,'' 
O'Neal said. ``If we play well, we should be OK.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Says Client Is Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WAYNE, Ind. (AP) -- The lawyer for a man accused of  
murdering his brother and three other men announced his client was 
guilty -- four days before the start of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer John Nimmo made the surprise announcement  
Thursday at a pretrial hearing for Joseph Corcoran, who is still 
scheduled to stand trial Monday for the July 1997 killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're here for, what it all boils down to, is the  
sentencing phase,'' Nimmo said. ``It's going to be like an Al 
Pacino movie. I don't let them convict my client. I'm going to 
convict my client.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Corcoran, 24, is accused of shooting his brother, James  
Corcoran, 30; Robert Scott Turner, 32; Douglas A. Stillwell, 30; 
and Timothy G. Bricker, 30, because he couldn't stand to hear them 
talking about him. 
</P>
<P>
	James Corcoran had been one of his brother's fiercest defenders  
when Joseph was accused of shooting his parents to death in 1992. 
But prosecutors had only circumstantial evidence against him and he 
was acquitted after a five day trial. 
</P>
<P>
	At Thursday's hearing, Nimmo sought to prevent any of the  
victims' relatives from testifying on the grounds they would 
unfairly prejudice a jury. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Fran Gull agreed to let the relatives appear.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is going to be -- as in every murder case -- some modicum  
of emotion,'' she said. ``It's inescapable.''

<HEADLINE> Spurs' Robinson Vows Playoff Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- David Robinson says the Minnesota  
Timberwolves' season should be over Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They could come out and make it really tough. They could make  
shots, they could do a lot of things,'' the San Antonio Spurs' 
center said Friday. ``But if we play the way we're capable of 
playing, we should be able to finish the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Especially if Avery Johnson lights up the Wolves again.  
</P>
<P>
	Johnson is averaging 20.3 points in the playoff series, more  
than double his regular-season production. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, behind Johnson's 24 points on 12-of-15 shooting, took  
a 2-1 lead in the best-of-5 series with an 85-71 thumping of the 
tired Timberwolves at the Target Center on Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson bounced back from a lackadaisical first two games with  
17 points, 18 rebounds and seven assists as the top seed in the 
Western Conference regained the homecourt advantage after a Game 2 
letdown at the Alamodome. 
</P>
<P>
	But Johnson said Robinson better not count his blessings just  
yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still need more,'' Johnson said. ``I don't want you talking  
to David because he got 18 rebounds and 17 points like he played a 
great game. There's still opportunity for him to do more, and 
that's what we're going to talk about in this film session. He has 
not arrived yet in this series.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What more could Robinson possibly do?  
</P>
<P>
	``He can be even more aggressive. We've got to help him get in  
position where he can be aggressive,'' Johnson said. ``If we 
continue to make shots from the perimeter, then hopefully he'll get 
more 1-on-1 coverages inside and he can do more damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not going to happen, said Wolves coach Flip Saunders,  
who's going to continue double-teaming Robinson and Tim Duncan in 
the low post and daring Johnson to win it with jump shots. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the same strategy Saunders has employed the entire  
series, only on Thursday night, the Wolves were so slow to rotate 
``it was like our feet were in mud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Contrary to what you might think, there's no time that I walk  
in that locker room and say, `OK guys, we're going to give Avery 
Johnson open 15-foot shots,' '' Saunders said. ``I got a son that's 
in seventh grade and I know that if I give him open 15-foot shots, 
he's going to go out and make seven out of 10.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, Saunders said, was that the Wolves were slow to  
rotate Thursday night, leaving Johnson with what amounted to free 
throws worth two points apiece. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our idea was to get the ball out of Timmy's and David's hands.  
When Avery gets it, get there and contest his shots,'' Saunders 
said. ``We're not going to change what we're doing. What we're 
hoping to do is change our effectiveness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wolves forward Sam Mitchell said Johnson was so wide open,  
``that was like playing H-O-R-S-E. He won't get those looks 
tomorrow, I'll tell you that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Garnett said the Wolves are going to have to deny Johnson  
just as hard as they do Duncan and Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to readjust, control him, but at the same time do what  
we've been doing,'' Garnett said. ``You can't let one man beat you 
like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Garnett said the Wolves, who made just 28 of 80 shots Thursday  
night, have what it takes to force a Game 5 by beating the Spurs 
for a third time this year at the Target Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yeah, we do because we're one of the teams that just don't  
stop,'' he said. ``When you think we're out of it, boom, we're 
right back there, right in your face. We don't give up. We don't 
know what it is to give up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely know one thing, we're a team that's going to  
fight and we're going to fight you to the end, whether that's 
biting, scratching, poke in the eyes,'' Garnett said. ``We're going 
to do what we have to do to win.''

<HEADLINE> AP Corrects Doctors' Income Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- In a May 13 story on doctors' incomes, The  
Associated Press erroneously reported that an American Medical 
Association study said managed care contributed to a decline in 
doctors' incomes in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The AMA study said the decline was due to changes in the  
economics of health care, but did not cite managed care. Outside 
experts interviewed by the AP said managed care was a factor. 
</P>

worked an average of 48 hours a week in 1998. The correct figure is

<HEADLINE> Titans, Matthews in Four-Year Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Veteran offensive guard Bruce Matthews  
is convinced the Tennessee Titans are close to greatness and he 
wants to be around when they achieve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37-year-old Matthews agreed to a four-year contract, the  
Titans announced Thursday. Terms were not disclosed by the team, 
but The Tennessean reported it includes a $4 million signing bonus 
with base salaries of $500,000 this year, $2 million next year and 
$4.075 million in 2001 and 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The salaries for this year and next year are guaranteed,  
according to the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, an 11-time Pro Bowl selection, has spent his entire  
16-season career with the franchise, playing in a club-record 248 
games and never missing a game due to injury. He became an 
unrestricted free agent at the end of last season but indicated a 
desire to stay with the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite three straight 8-8 seasons, Matthews thinks the Titans  
are championship caliber. At a news conference Thursday, he noted 
Atlanta went to the Super Bowl last year, one season after his 
brother Clay retired. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't want that to happen to him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm gonna hang around long enough that this thing will have to  
go to the Super Bowl,'' Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews, who doesn't have an agent, negotiated directly with  
the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bruce has been in the league long enough to understand what  
the numbers are, and where he fits,'' said Floyd Reese, general 
manager of the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
	Reese said management ``badly'' wanted Matthews to finish his  
career a Titan. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this world of unrestricted free agency, it may never happen  
again,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews' 248 games ranks him 11th on the NFL's career games  
list. He can pass Jackie Slater this season for the most games 
played by an offensive lineman (259). He has started 244 games 
playing all five offensive line positions. 
</P>
<P>
	Durability is in the Matthews family genes. Clay played 19  
seasons and 278 games with the Cleveland Browns and Atlanta. His 
father, Clay Sr., played four seasons with the San Francisco 49ers 
in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-5, 305-pound Matthews played left guard last season  
but will move to center because of the loss of Mark Stepnoski, who 
signed with Dallas in the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really excited about it,'' Matthews said. ``You eliminate  
a lot of the collisions 'cause you're not pulling and doing some of 
the things you have to do at guard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Matthews said despite all the years and games he hasn't lost his  
youthful enthusiasm for the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``The thing that's changed is just sometimes getting up the next  
morning is a lot slower,'' he said. ``And my kids are almost as big 
as me.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Face Elimination Tonight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- It's time to find out if Pat Riley has another  
bit of motivational magic up his sleeve. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley's Miami Heat are on the brink of elimination tonight in  
Game 4 of their first-round series against the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everything we've worked for, everything we've talked about is  
on the brink. We've got to bring it all and play well,'' Riley said 
Thursday. ``It can't just be a maniacal effort, it's got to be a 
maniacal effort with effective offense and defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A big part of that equation will be Tim Hardaway, whose play has  
been unproductive throughout the series with the exception of his 
11 assists in Game 2. Hardaway still wasn't talking Thursday, so 
his numbers were left to speak for themselves: 6-for-32 from the 
field, 1-for-14 from 3-point range, 22 total points and one 
ejection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Evidently, things haven't been going his way thus far,''  
teammate Alonzo Mourning said, ``but I know he can turn things 
around. I've seen him turn things around, and this series is far 
from being over with.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway had a miserable night in Game 3 as the Heat lost by 24  
-- their second blowout defeat in the series. He shot just 1-for-8, 
including 0-for-5 on 3-pointers, and lost his composure by getting 
ejected early in the fourth quarter when he realized the game was a 
lost cause. 
</P>
<P>
	At practice Thursday, Hardaway refused to speak to the media and  
stood on the court shooting while his teammates tried to come up 
with explanations for his slump. 
</P>
<P>
	``Y'all keep talking about Timmy, Timmy, and Timmy's our point  
guard,'' Mourning said. ``But listen to me, we've got a lot of 
confidence in him. He knows what he has to do to get us going, and 
he's capable of doing that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tim's a competitor and a clutch player all his career, and if  
anybody can come back, he can,'' Dan Majerle said. ``Tim's our 
leader obviously, but if Tim's not doing it someone else has to do 
it. Look at everybody's numbers, except Zo's, and they're down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Heat's second-leading scorer in this series is  
Voshon Lenard, who has been limited to 23 minutes of garbage time 
in Game 1 and Game 3, but has 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Take away Lenard's 6-for-8 shooting from 3-point range, and the  
rest of the Heat are a shocking 8-for-49. At one point in Game 3, 
they were 0-for-17 from behind the arc. 
</P>
<P>
	Riley seemed to hint that Lenard might get a little more playing  
time tonight. Majerle has been taking up most of the minutes at 
shooting guard, but has been hampered by two bone spurs in his 
collarbone -- both of which are fractured. 
</P>
<P>
	Majerle has shot just 2-for-13 in the series, Keith Askins  
hasn't scored a single point, Jamal Mashburn has gone to the 
free-throw line only three times and P.J. Brown' scoring and 
rebounding numbers have dipped. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks have tried to contain Hardaway by picking him up  
defensively well above the 3-point line and by having their big men 
sprint back on defense to establish position in case Hardaway 
drives past his man in transition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hardaway's best effort of the series came in Game 2, when he had  
11 assists, but shot 1-for-5 from the field. In Game 1, he shot 
4-for-19. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Game 2, I don't think we were successful against him at  
all,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``He dominated the game 
without shooting, and I think that's what great players do. As far 
as the other games, everybody goes through tough stretches, and 
he's just gone through a tough stretch. But we never have, and 
never will, underestimate him. 
</P>
<P>
	The Knicks are trying to become just the second eighth-seeded  
playoff team in NBA history to knock off a No. 1 seed. Denver did 
it to Seattle in 1994.

<HEADLINE> American Air Faces Antitrust Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last year the airline industry chided the  
government for complaining about anti-competitive behavior but 
never taking its case to court. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Justice Department sued American Airlines for  
allegedly trying to quash competition at its Dallas-Forth Worth 
hub, the first predatory pricing case since the government 
deregulated the industry in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
	That left a question: Was it a one-shot deal or a sign of things  
to come? 
</P>
<P>
	The department's antitrust chief, Assistant Attorney General  
Joel I. Klein, said at a news conference that his staff is 
investigating other airlines, but a high-level Transportation 
Department source said the most developed case was against 
American. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see any other complaint imminent,'' said the source,  
speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside analysts were uncertain.  
</P>
<P>
	``I would assume there will be a lot of shoes dropping,'' said  
Darryl Jenkins, director of the aviation institute at George 
Washington University. 
</P>
<P>
	A private antitrust lawyer, Marc Schecter, noted the  
government's lawsuit emphasized that American dominates the 
Dallas-Fort Worth hub, with a 70 percent share of passenger 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	Schecter predicted that Justice Department attorneys would be  
looking at hubs where one airline is overwhelmingly dominant to see 
how such airlines responded to any competition. 
</P>
<P>
	In a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Wichita, Kan., the  
department charged that American repeatedly tried to drive small, 
start-up airlines out of the DFW airport by saturating their routes 
with additional flights and cutting fares. After the competitors 
withdrew or drastically reduced their service, American 
re-established high fares and reduced its service, the government 
alleged. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said American increased its prices  
between Dallas-Fort Worth and Wichita by 50 percent after it forced 
Vanguard Airlines, a lower-cost competitor, out of that route. 
American was accused of using similar tactics with Sun Jet on 
flights to Long Beach, Calif., and with Western Pacific on flights 
to Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
	``American adopted a predatory responsive policy. ... American  
knew this strategy would be costly and pursued it only in order to 
drive out the new carriers, so it could return to its monopoly 
pricing,'' Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline responded with a statement saying the allegations  
were unwarranted. 
</P>
<P>
	It added: ``American Airlines will resolutely challenge the  
government's case. The company is confident that the court will see 
the government's action as an ill-considered attempt to fashion new 
law -- to pick winners and losers in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deregulation advocates say it has brought lower fares and more  
service to airline passengers. The chief criticism comes from 
smaller communities that are served by only one major carrier and 
are forced to pay the going rate in and out of its hub. 
</P>
<P>
	In April 1998, the Transportation Department said it planned to  
crack down on airlines that engage in practices aimed solely at 
driving start-up carriers out of business. The guidelines included 
three triggers: when a major carrier added more flights, sold more 
seats or offered discount fares to more customers than a start-up 
carrier could possibly serve. 
</P>
<P>
	The airlines, through their trade group, the Air Transport  
Association, complained that the proposed rules were vague. They 
also said the Justice Department had existing authority to punish 
airlines for anti-competitive practices, but had not done so even 
once since deregulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Jenkins, of George Washington University, complained that ``the  
government's trying to have a class of protected businesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added: ``If the Justice Department prevails on this, it will  
have the most chilling and devastating effect on American business, 
because you will no longer be able to match a competitor's price.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Terry Trippler, an airfare analyst, said consumers are partly to  
blame, because they often clamor for a discount carrier but then 
patronize a major airline when it offers matching service in 
response to a start-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know why the consumers don't support the start-up for  
long?'' Trippler asked. ``They want their frequent flier miles. So, 
can we really blame all of this on American? I don't think so.''

<HEADLINE> Nortel To Cut 1,000 Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Nortel Networks, Canada's largest  
telecommunications company, is selling plants and cutting 1,000 
jobs as part of a restructuring plan intended to make the company 
more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	The job cuts and other measures announced Thursday were part of  
a retrenchment program the company originally revealed in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting this year, Nortel will contract out all but its most  
complex printed circuit board assembly, most of its 
electro-mechanical subsystems manufacturing and a significant part 
of its repair business. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 employees will be affected -- half the workers Nortel  
estimated in January could lose their jobs by the changes. About 
3,000 workers are expected to be hired by the contract 
manufacturers who buy the divested plants, while 1,000 jobs will be 
cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Layoffs are expected to be minimal because of normal attrition,  
retirement, and relocation to other Nortel plants. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize that some of the decisions we're making today are  
painful for those who will be leaving the company,'' said Chahram 
Bolouri, vice-president of global operations. ``We are committed to 
working with those employees and their communities to minimize the 
impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The moves come after Nortel acquired Bay Networks, a California  
networking company, last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	In Canada, Nortel is selling plants and repair centres in  
Brockville, Ont., northern Toronto and Mississauga, Ont. and the 
electro-mechanical assembly operations in Calgary and the Montreal 
area.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Leaves Okla. Town in Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STROUD, Okla. (AP) -- Turnpike billboards promise shopping just  
ahead. But when cars cruise within sight of the Tanger Factory 
Outlet Center, roadside signs flash a warning: Keep moving. 
</P>
<P>
	No shoppers can stop at this mall. No clerk can work in its  
tangled mess of metal. No cash registers ring to ease the debts 
looming over City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	Tornadoes spared lives here May 3 but left this isolated city of  
about 3,000 ``in a world of hurt'' when it wiped out all 53 mall 
stores and 18 other businesses, City Manager Earl Burson said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we're going to be affected by is in the long term, not  
the short term,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The warning signs urge any gawkers who might slow down on the  
lonely stretch of Interstate 44, halfway between Tulsa and Oklahoma 
City, to move on rather than stare at the mall. The storm tore off 
the mall's signature red roof and stripped walls to their studs. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for Greensboro, N.C.-based Tanger Factory Outlet  
Centers said the company intends to rebuild the shopping center but 
is still assessing the situation. ``I'm not really sure if we can 
say anything more from that,'' spokeswoman Carrie Warren said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Burson said the city also has no guarantee that another major  
employer, SYGMA Network, will rebuild its damaged food-distribution 
truck terminal. 
</P>
<P>
	SYGMA has shifted most of its 165 workers to locations in other  
states, Burson said. Many of the mall's 325 employees are searching 
for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our concern is if these people find jobs in Tulsa, can we keep  
them in Stroud?'' Burson said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the city 65 miles northeast of Oklahoma City also has  
immediate worries. The mall supplied two-thirds of Stroud's income, 
bringing in about $150,000 a month in sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Stroud has taken on loans to start an industrial park and build  
a new water treatment plant. With other debts, its monthly loan 
payments are more than $70,000, Burson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're turning to our state. We're turning to the federal  
government,'' he said. ``We've asked, `Please help.' But we don't 
know what they're going to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Chris Hodge's office supply store, the pinch is already  
evident from the loss of SYGMA and other business customers. 
</P>
<P>
	She sees ripple effects. Her daughter, a mall employee, can't  
afford to pay her babysitter without work. 
</P>
<P>
	``The babysitter can't come into the store,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The storm also closed Stroud's hospital, destroyed houses and  
wiped away mobile homes. Ms. Hodge said she is fortunate, 
especially considering the massive and deadly destruction from 
tornadoes in and near Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the economic uncertainty unnerves her.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's really scary right now,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Jazz Backcourt Not the Same  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Utah Jazz coach Jerry Sloan says the  
flagrant foul that knocked down John Stockton in the opening 
seconds of Game 2 of their playoff series against Sacramento still 
is affecting the veteran point guard. 
</P>
<P>
	A day after Stockton went 1-for-9 from the field and scored just  
five points in Utah's 84-81 overtime loss to Sacramento in Game 3, 
Sloan said Stockton has not fully recovered from the foul. 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton said Thursday he's feeling fine and has no lingering  
effects from the foul by Chris Webber, who lowered his shoulder and 
dropped Stockton to the court. But Sloan has his doubts. 
</P>
<P>
	``John Stockton's not the same person after he got hit.  
Physically,'' the coach said Thursday as the Jazz began practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's venerable backcourt of Stockton and Jeff Hornacek, which  
has led the Jazz to two straight NBA Finals, is looking just plain 
old against Sacramento's young tandem of Jason Williams and Tariq 
Abdul-Wahad. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams and Abdul-Wahad, appearing in their first playoff  
series, outplayed and outscored their counterparts as the Kings 
defeated the Jazz on Wednesday night to take a 2-1 lead in the 
best-of-5 series. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did a great job defensively on our backcourt,'' Sloan  
said. ``They are bigger, stronger and, obviously, younger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings, who won a home playoff game for the first time since  
moving to Sacramento in 1985, can wrap up the first-round series 
with a victory at home tonight. After losing by 30 points in Game 
1, the Kings have won two straight. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams had 12 points, six assists and matched his career high  
with eight rebounds Wednesday night, while Abdul-Wahad had six 
points and helped hold Hornacek to four points on 1-of-6 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``At some point, when we started losing games, we knew it (age)  
was going to become an issue,'' Hornacek said. ``Right now, they're 
freewheeling it. We had the opportunity in Game 2 to knock their 
confidence down, and we didn't do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stockton has 2,082 points in 150 playoff games and Hornacek has  
1,871 points in 122. Williams and Abdul-Wahad each has played in 
three playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't deny facts. We are older than them,'' Stockton said.  
``But is it a factor in the game? I don't think so. I certainly 
don't feel that. I think we just couldn't get a shot to fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Kings, not surprisingly, tried to avoid playing the age card  
Thursday and instead focused on the ability of veterans such as 
Stockton, Hornacek and Karl Malone to find ways to rebound from 
playoff deficits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would never count out Stockton, Malone and Hornacek. They  
scare me to death,'' Sacramento coach Rick Adelman said, adding he 
doesn't believe Stockton has been affected by Webber's flagrant 
foul. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't believe it bothered him. He's too tough,'' the Kings  
coach said. ``Whenever he gets knocked down, he gets up. I think 
he's going to get up (Friday) night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams also sees no sign of Webber's hit changing Stockton.  
</P>
<P>
	``He's still the same Stockton to me, he's still a great  
player,'' the Kings' rookie point guard said. ``Maybe he's 
different toward Web, but he's the same toward me.''

<HEADLINE> Rain Makes Pontiac 400 One-Day Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- It's a good thing Winston Cup drivers like  
Richmond International Raceway, because they'll have a long day 
here today. 
</P>
<P>
	A steady rain that lasted until about 3:30 p.m. washed out  
first-round qualifying Friday, forcing NASCAR officials to 
reschedule time trials Saturday afternoon, about seven hours before 
the Pontiac 400 begins. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost universally, drivers look forward to coming to Richmond's  
three-quarter-mile, D-shaped oval. They say it allows for 
traditional short-track racing with side-by-side duels, and it 
holds rubber better than most layouts because of a sealer applied 
to the track before each weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``Richmond allows more finesse because it's a wider track than  
most small tracks,'' Derrike Cope said. ``You can find a secondary 
lane. It's easier to find your way around someone without having to 
shove their car aside.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a twice-a-year stop on stock car racing's premier circuit,  
most veterans have at least one memory from RIR that brings them a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess Richmond has been pretty good to me and I've been  
pretty good to Richmond,'' said Ernie Irvan, who made his Winston 
Cup debut at RIR in 1987 on the old layout and has two victories 
and two poles on the new one. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had four big days at the track, five if you count my  
first Winston Cup race. I'm looking for another big day'' in the 
race Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Dale Jarrett was viewed as a superspeedway specialist with  
problems on tracks of less than a mile until 1997, when he won the 
second race on Bristol's .533-mile oval and followed with his only 
RIR triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	Jarrett almost had another victory in the spring race last June,  
but was bumped off the lead by Terry Labonte going through the 
fourth turn with two laps to go and wound up second. Still, he 
likes the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a number of opportunities'' to win, he said. ``The  
night we actually won the race, that was one we didn't expect. We 
had other times that we thought we were better and didn't win the 
race, so you never know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Points leader Jeff Burton, a native of South Boston, Va., about  
100 miles southwest of the track, knows winning at Richmond. He was 
to race as the defending champion Friday night in the Hardee's 250 
Busch Grand National race, and last fall outran Jeff Gordon in the 
Exide 400 Winston Cup event. 
</P>
<P>
	That race, in which Gordon tailed Burton for the last five laps,  
was considered by many the most exciting event of the season. 
Burton said having a handle on the track's wear and tear helps a 
lot as the race winds down. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the sealer gets worn out on the bottom groove, you try to  
find it somewhere else,'' he said of the sticky asphalt coating. 
``Everywhere else you try to stay out of the sealer. Here you try 
to stay in it.''

<HEADLINE> Columbine Student To Leave Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A student who suffered a massive shotgun wound to  
his jaw in the Columbine High School shootings said Friday that he 
was headed outside to smoke a cigarette with friends when the two 
gunmen opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, Lance Kirklin thought it was a senior prank.  
</P>
<P>
	He said he saw two ``shadows'' firing before he slipped out of  
consciousness. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was right outside in the commons area. I think that we were  
the first ones shot,'' Kirklin said. ``The two kids who were the 
shooters, I didn't know them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kirklin, 16, who almost died in the attack, met reporters at  
Denver Health Medical Center for the first time since the April 20 
shootings, which left 15 dead and 23 wounded. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirklin doesn't remember details of the shootings.  
</P>
<P>
	He suffered multiple injuries: A pointblank gunshot blast  
shattered his jaw. A bullet severed an artery in his leg. He also 
was hit by three other bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	He has had several operations, including a skin and bone graft  
from his leg to temporarily fill the hole in his jaw. Dozens of 
doctors and physical therapists have worked on him. His hospital 
bill is already close to $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors said Kirklin likely will be released from the hospital  
``within the week,'' but his recovery is not over. 
</P>
<P>
	Throat doctor Stephen Batuello said Kirklin probably will need  
at least six more operations on his face to help permanently close 
the ``crater'' left by the shotgun blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Batuello said Kirklin suffered extensive damage in his jaw and a  
tiny hole left by the tissue replacement has not yet sealed. 
Consequently, Kirklin has to be fed by a tube. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirklin said he can't wait for the hole to close because he  
wants to drink apple juice. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a hole in my face so it just drips out,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Kirklin was with friends Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves when  
the shooting began. Rohrbough, 15, was killed. Graves, also 15, was 
shot in the back and has been undergoing physical therapy for a 
spinal cord injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirklin said he wants to let the Columbine community know that  
he feels good. 
</P>
<P>
	He had a special message for his Graves: ``I know it's hard, but  
you just got to push yourself and work hard to get back to 
normal.''

<HEADLINE> WNBA's Sparks May Change Arenas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Sparks president Johnny  
Buss said Thursday there's about a 70 percent chance the WNBA team 
will move to the Staples Center in 2001, despite his preference to 
remain at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's certainly where the league is pushing us,'' Buss told  
reporters as the team conducted its media day at the Forum. ``I 
would be very happy to stay here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss said his father, Jerry, who owns the Forum and NBA's Los  
Angeles Lakers, wants the team to remain there because of its need 
for tenants after the departure of the Lakers and NHL's Los Angeles 
Kings to the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	A move to the Staples Center would also likely increase the  
expenses for the Sparks. 
</P>
<P>
	The WNBA has written to Jerry Buss seeking to begin discussions  
over ``the eventuality of us moving to Staples,'' Johnny Buss said. 
</P>
<P>
	The league's initial desire was to have the Sparks begin the  
2000 season at the Forum and complete it at the Staples Center 
after the conclusion of the Democratic National Convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I could do that to my fans,'' Buss said. ``I  
don't think the WNBA is going to force us to split our season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buss was uncertain how strongly his father would fight a move to  
the Staples Center, but the younger Buss ruled out a legal 
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to get in a legal battle with the NBA about  
who's going to play where,'' Buss said. ``We want to what's good 
for the league. If it's good for the league in 2001 to play at the 
Staples Center, we will be considering it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All 12 WNBA teams are operated by NBA teams and required to play  
in the same arenas. However, Buss said he and the WNBA, ``had a 
prior agreement'' to allow the Sparks to remain at the Forum as 
long as his family continued to own the building.

<HEADLINE> Reporter Lied About Cancer, AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP) -- A reporter who was fired after  
acknowledging she lied in a series of columns about dying of 
cancer, claiming she did so to avoid the stigma of having AIDS, now 
says she's never been treated for AIDS, either. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview published today by the newspaper that fired her,  
33-year-old Kim Stacy said she began making up stories about her 
health several years ago so she could make friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Messenger-Inquirer fired Ms. Stacy on Monday after she told  
editors that she did not have cancer and had never been treated for 
it. She said at the time she was being treated for AIDS but did not 
want to reveal that. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Ms. Stacy told the newspaper that to the best of  
her knowledge, she has never had any symptoms of AIDS-related 
illnesses and was never disagnosed with AIDS or treated for it. She 
said she was tested for AIDS for the first time Thursday. Results 
were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	In a story earlier this week, Ms. Stacy was asked how would  
readers know that she's telling the truth about having AIDS. ``I 
don't have an answer for you all,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Her columns on cancer, one of which was distributed by The  
Associated Press in Kentucky, described trips to Vanderbilt 
University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn., where she said she 
was being treated. She said Thursday the trips to Vanderbilt never 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy said she began lying about her health shortly after  
moving in 1995 from Grundy, Va., to Pikeville, in eastern Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know where the idea came from,'' she said in today's  
Messenger-Inquirer. ``At the time I was having trouble with my 
blood sugar and going to the doctor a lot, and everybody was real 
nice to me, real concerned. It seemed like to me they really made 
an effort to be friends with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In late 1995, she told co-workers at the Appalachian  
News-Express in Pikeville she had cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't remember thinking and planning that,'' she said. ``One  
day I walked in and just told them'' that she had stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy said she has had stomach problems but attributes them  
to stress. ``Sometimes I have night-sweats, and occasionally I have 
a rash around my neck and on my chest,'' she told the Owensboro 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy's father, Monroe Stacy, told the Messenger-Inquirer  
that she is diabetic. He said her mother, Pauline, died of 
complications of diabetes in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Stacy joined the Messenger-Inquirer in April 1998. Several  
months later, she told co-workers she had had stomach cancer in the 
past and that it had returned. Later, she said her stomach cancer 
again had gone into remission after chemotherapy.

<HEADLINE> DNA To Verify Fate of Extinct Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Advances in genetic technology will allow  
scientists to determine whether a fish already declared extinct is 
still alive after all, a government scientist said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue pike, once Lake Erie's most popular catch, was declared  
extinct in 1983, having been virtually wiped out by the late 1950s 
because of over-fishing. But a close relative, the walleye, is 
still around. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, a blue-colored fish closely resembling the blue pike  
started appearing in smaller lakes in Canada. The U.S. government 
will use genetic testing to determine whether those specimens are 
truly the blue pike, or whether they are a grayish form of the 
walleye, or perhaps a hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an intriguing question,'' said Mary Burnham-Curtis, a  
fishery biologist at the U.S. Geological Survey's Great Lakes 
Science Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have long suspected a link between the blue pike and  
the walleye and in fact generally classify the two as subsets of 
the same species. The main difference appears to be in color, which 
could result either from genetics or environmental factors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Burnham-Curtis said genetic techniques developed within the  
past decade would help determine the cause and extent of the 
differences and help scientists identify the newly collected 
specimens. 
</P>
<P>
	Preliminary DNA tests will be completed within four months, with  
additional analysis conducted for at least eight months more, Ms. 
Burnham-Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Genetic samples from blue pike museum samples will be compared  
with current and museum samples from the new fish, the walleye and 
a third relative, the sauger. 
</P>
<P>
	The blue pike test results will go to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife  
Service, which would have to determine whether to reverse its 
extinction declaration, something that has never been done. If that 
happens, wildlife officials would have to decide whether to 
reintroduce the species to the original Great Lakes habitats. 
</P>
<P>
	A reintroduction of the species could be worth hundreds of  
millions of dollars a year for the sport-fishing industry.

<HEADLINE> `Midsummer' Tests Fans Love of Bard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shakespeare is hotter than ever in Hollywood.  
Now the Bard faces two new celebrity challenges: opening a movie in 
the shadow of ``Star Wars'' -- and selling spaghetti sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	``William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream'' opens today  
with a big release schedule, big stars, big soundtrack and a big 
marketing campaign that includes a promotional deal with Classico 
Pasta Sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	All that isn't big is the movie's budget -- $14 million -- a  
bargain considering the top name talent in Michelle Pfeiffer, Kevin 
Kline, Rupert Everett and Calista Flockhart, who all worked cheaply 
for a chance to flex their acting muscles. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, filming one of Shakespeare's plays largely as written is  
far from a sure bet for a studio. The two bigger successes are the 
Kenneth Branagh-directed ``Much Ado About Nothing'' in 1993 and 
``Hamlet,'' starring Mel Gibson, in 1990. And each only barely 
topped $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
	What's more, Fox Searchlight Pictures is releasing ``Midsummer''  
just days before the opening of the heavily hyped ``Star Wars'' 
prequel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a risk,'' acknowledges Lindsay Law, president of Fox  
Searchlight Pictures, which is releasing the movie on 1,000 screens 
-- 150 more than its biggest success to date, ``The Full Monty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If no one shows up, I'm in trouble,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	But then, this film has some advantages, particularly timing,  
thanks to ``Shakespeare in Love,'' which won seven Oscars and 
grossed more than $94 million in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare in Love,'' a fictional portrait of the playwright,  
drew only some scenes and language from his works. But it served as 
a perfect introduction to the power of his writing and helped 
adjust the ear to the high language that so often throws off modern 
movie-goers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shakespeare is no longer some onerous name at the top of a  
curriculum that kids look at and say, 'I've got to read this?''' 
Kline said. ``He's now this attractive young English guy who falls 
madly in love with Gwyneth Paltrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Getting Flockhart for her first big movie role was one of the  
many casting coups for director-writer-co-producer Michael Hoffman. 
It was luck: She was signed to play lovelorn Helena before the 
success of ``Ally McBeal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the cast -- including Pfeiffer as the fairy queen  
Tatania, Everett as the fairy king Oberon, Stanley Tucci as Puck, 
Anna Friel as Hermia and Christian Bale as Demetrius -- worked for 
low wages to keep the project on budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's Shakespeare,'' Hoffman said. ``It ends up being the  
ultimate challenge and the ultimate reward for the actor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The relatively low budget means that Searchlight doesn't need  
``Shakespeare in Love'' numbers to break even. In addition, the 
studio has hedged its bets by striking promotional deals, a common 
practice for big-studio movies but almost unheard-of for a 
specialty film. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Factor created a line of ``Midsummer'' cosmetics, then  
pushed it with a national advertising campaign. Classico Pasta 
Sauce is sponsoring a sweepstakes promotion and putting out a 
cookbook ``inspired by the film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the film's soundtrack, featuring performances by opera  
stars, debuted in the Top 10 on the classical charts. 
</P>
<P>
	All that's left is the movie, which opens on a relatively slow  
weekend as most of Hollywood takes cover before next Wednesday's 
invasion of ``The Phantom Menace,'' being released by Searchlight's 
parent company, 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very good date for us,'' Law said. ``There's not  
anything opening over the weekend, and the entire country can't fit 
into 'Star Wars' the first week. Parents can drop their kids off at 
'Star Wars' and come into our theaters.''

<HEADLINE> Stocks Plunge; Dow Ends Down 193.87 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks plunged today, sending the Dow Jones  
industrial average down more than 193 points, after a government 
report of a steep rise in consumer prices renewed inflation worries 
and sent bond prices sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the 0.7 percent rise in consumer prices caught the  
market by surprise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow fell 193.87 to 10,913.32, more than erasing a  
106.82-point gain Thursday that gave the blue chips a new closing 
high of 11,107.19. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators ended sharply lower as well. The  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 29.76 to 1,337.80, while the 
Nasdaq composite index fell 54.14 to 2,527.86. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said the April jump in the Labor Department's consumer  
price index, although the largest gain in nearly nine years, could 
be explained away by a stunning 15 percent rise in gasoline prices. 
</P>
<P>
	More disturbing to investors was that core consumer prices,  
which do not include food and energy, rose 0.4 percent, much more 
than economists had predicted. And the data were especially jarring 
following Thursday's wholesale-price report, which suggested 
inflation was subdued. 
</P>
<P>
	``The CPI is usually not out of line with that number,'' Barry  
Hyman, senior equity analyst at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. 
</P>
<P>
	The CPI report led to a drop of more than two points in the  
price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond, pushing yields to 
5.92 percent, the highest level in nearly a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market is perfectly comfortable as long as bond  
yields are below 6 percent,'' said Hyman. ``But as the yield is 
nearing 6 percent, it won't be so comfortable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The increase in the CPI revived concerns that the Federal  
Reserve will at least consider an interest rate hike when its Open 
Market Committee meets next Tuesday. The Fed tightens rates when 
central bankers believe that the economy is growing too fast and 
posing the danger of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher interest rates often push stocks lower because they raise  
corporate borrowing costs and cut into earnings, as well as crimp 
consumer spending. 
</P>
<P>
	The higher bond rates pushed stocks of banking and financial  
companies lower. Chase Manhattan fell 4 15/16 to 79 1/16. Merrill 
Lynch dropped 5 1/2 to 80 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	And IBM, which contributed to Thursday's new Dow record with a  
stunning 20-point advance, slid 6 3/4 to 239 1/4 as investors locked in 
their gains. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is just a textbook day,'' said Bryan Piskorowski, market  
analyst at Prudential Securities. ``You've got inflationary news, 
bonds fall out of bed, tech stocks get hit, financials get hit, but 
there is some rotation into cyclicals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Farr, an investment banker with Miller &AMP; Washington in  
Washington, D.C., called the market's reaction to Friday's numbers 
``silly'' and ``emotional.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farr noted that the Dow Jones industrials have risen more than  
3,000 points since early October and climbed 1,000 points from 
10,000 to 11,000 in just 24 days in April. 
</P>
<P>
	He added, ``this is an emotional reaction, not a rational  
reaction, from a market that is more inclined than not to pull 
back. If you are among those who characterize the advance as 
irrational, then the pullbacks ought to be just as irrational. But 
you can't complain if you're enjoying the ride up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 869.18 
million shares, down from Thursday's pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index fell 12.90 to 638.45, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index fell 11.58 to 788.81. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.71 to 443.13. 
</P>
<P>
	In foreign markets, the Nikkei average in Tokyo fell 0.24. Stock  
markets in Europe ended sharply lower, with the DAX in Frankfurt 
losing 1.42 percent, the FT-SE 100 index in London dropping 2.42 
percent, and the CAC in Paris down 2.08 percent.

<HEADLINE> Industry Applauds Pollution Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As the Clinton administration ponders its next  
move, industry groups are applauding and environmentalists are 
decrying a federal appeals court decision that blocks new 
regulations on curtailing smog and soot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a big victory, one of the biggest,'' said Robin Conrad,  
senior vice president for litigation at the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the  
District of Columbia blocked the Environmental Protection Agency on 
Friday from enforcing tough new air standards requiring reduced 
levels of ozone and microscopic soot in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	The July 1997 regulations were among the most contentious ever  
issued by the Clinton administration. The EPA insists the tougher 
standards are needed to protect people with respiratory ailments, 
the elderly and children from the adverse health affects of dirty 
air. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration is ``deeply disappointed'' at the court  
ruling, said White House press secretary Joe Lockhart. The EPA said 
it will recommend that the Justice Department appeal the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	The court, with one of the three judges dissenting, said the EPA  
had overreached in issuing the new standards, interpreting the 1990 
Clean Air Act ``so loosely'' as to be unconstitutional. The court 
told the EPA to rework the regulations or go to Congress to change 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
	Environmentalists were stunned by the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	David Hawkins of the Natural Resources Defense Council called it  
``a direct assault on the principle of health-based air quality 
protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bad day for public health and a good day for big  
polluters,'' said John Garrison, managing director of the American 
Lung Association. ``The decision is a terrible step backward for 
public health protection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Industry had launched an all-out assault on the regulation,  
arguing it was too costly and ill-conceived. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel vindicated,'' beamed Jan Amundson, general counsel of  
the National Association of Manufacturers, one of the many industry 
groups that had joined the suit, challenging the regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Others included the American Trucking Associations, American  
Petroleum Institute and groups representing small businesses and 
the auto and chemical industries. Three states -- Ohio, Michigan and 
West Virginia -- also joined the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The revised air standards limited ozone, an essential part of  
smog, to 0.08 parts per million, instead of 0.12 parts per million 
under the old requirement. And for the first time they required 
that states regulate microscopic particulates, or soot, from power 
plants, cars and other sources down to 2.5 microns, or 28 times 
smaller than the width of a human hair. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court rejected claims by the industry groups that  
the regulations were based on incomplete and poor science, or that 
the EPA should have taken costs into account. But two of the three 
judges concluded the EPA set the new pollution level arbitrarily 
without clear ``principles'' to support them. 
</P>
<P>
	That, in effect, amounted to ``unconstitutional delegations of  
legislative power'' on the part of the EPA, wrote Judges Douglas H. 
Ginsburg and Stephen F. Williams. Judge David S. Tatel, in a strong 
dissent on this key point, argued the EPA had in fact used 
``reasonable explanations'' for setting the standards. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA by law must set health standards for air quality to  
ensure that public health is adequately protected. EPA 
Administrator Carol Browner argued in 1996 that the standard for 
ozone, or smog, and microscopic particulates from burning fuel and 
other sources had to be strengthened to protect certain population 
groups such as children, the elderly and people with respiratory 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency first proposed the tougher standards in November  
1996, triggering an intense lobbying campaign by industry against 
the rules. They were finally issued in July 1997, with Vice 
President Al Gore calling them ``the most significant steps in a 
generation to protect the American people, especially our children, 
from air pollution.''

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- North Korea says it will return remains  
thought to be those of six American soldiers killed nearly 50 years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains were to be carried across the demilitarized zone  
between North Korea and South Korea today. 
</P>
<P>
	They were discovered within the last month by a joint U.S.-North  
Korean team searching along the Chong Chon River, 100 miles north 
of Pyongyang, a Pentagon statement said. The area was the site of 
battles in November 1950 between the U.S. Eighth Army and Chinese 
communist forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The recovery was the first joint search effort this year and the  
10th since such collaborations began in 1996. In all, the joint 
searches have yielded 35 sets of remains believed to be U.S. 
soldiers. Three have been identified. 
</P>

	More than 8,200 Americans are missing in action from the Korean  
War.

<HEADLINE> Sears To Pay Child Labor Fine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. has agreed to pay a $325,000  
penalty to settle allegations it violated child labor laws by 
letting teen-agers operate heavy machinery or work too many hours. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Labor Department investigation found 227 children were  
working at Sears in violation of child labor law, department 
spokeswoman Susan King said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to paying the fine, the department store company  
agreed to audit its more than 800 major stores for problems each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, 16- and 17-year-olds were found loading and  
operating power-driven paper balers, a machine that flattens 
cardboard boxes, or operating freight elevators or forklifts, King 
said. Under federal law, children are not permitted to operate this 
sort of hazardous equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few cases, some 15-year-old workers were working more hours  
than permitted under law, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, the nation's largest department store and second-largest  
retailer, will pay a $325,000 fine, King said. Sears did not admit 
to any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very, very important that our young people have  
constructive early work experience, but it is equally important 
that their jobs are safe,'' Labor Secretary Alexis Herman said. ``I 
quite frankly hope that this case will send the signal to other 
employers so that we don't have more cases like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Child labor laws have become a pet issue for Herman and are  
particularly topical given that the tightest labor market in three 
decades has the retail, food service and farm segments scrambling 
to find workers. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, the company has 11,150 workers under age 18. The  
1998 Labor Department investigation in 23 states involved 71 of 
Sears' stores, King said. Violations were found in 44 stores. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears spokeswoman Jan Drummond had no comment on the charges  
leveled but said the company hopes to use the agreement to improve 
working conditions for teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity to be a model in the retail industry in  
making an attractive and safe workplace for teen-agers,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Labor Department initiated the investigation because Sears  
is such a large company and because 60 percent of teen-age workers 
work in retail, King said. She said the investigation and the 
settlement are important in the department's effort to enforce 
child labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sears is the American pie of retail stores,'' she said. ``It's  
not Susan's 5 and 10 or Susan's Dress Shop. It's Sears.''

<HEADLINE> Drug Maker Wants Lawsuits Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A generic drug maker accused of conspiring to  
raise prices for two popular tranquilizers believes the government 
overstepped its authority in bringing the case to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Mylan Laboratories Inc. asked a federal judge Thursday to  
dismiss the federal antitrust lawsuits filed by the Federal Trade 
Commission, 31 states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Mylan argued that the remedies sought exceeded those  
permitted by law and that the commission's authority to bring 
antitrust matters to court is limited. 
</P>
<P>
	Mylan and other defendants said monetary awards must come  
through criminal cases brought by the Justice Department, not civil 
cases filed by the FTC. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make no mistake about it, the commission's case is  
unprecedented and threatens to rewrite how the commission does its 
business,'' said Mylan attorney John K. Carroll. ``The commission's 
role is fundamentally a forward-looking role and not one to punish 
and fashion liability.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Thomas F. Hogan said he would rule later. A  
trial, if any, is not expected until at least mid-2000 and may be 
consolidated with some of the roughly two dozen lawsuits filed by 
hospitals, insurers and other private parties. 
</P>
<P>
	Mylan is accused of cutting off competition through an exclusive  
deal with a key supplier. The government says prices of lorazepam 
and clorazepate rose by more than 25 times, almost single-handedly 
distorting a government measurement of wholesale inflation in May 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pittsburgh-based drug company has denied all charges. Also  
named as defendants are the supplier and its U.S. distributor. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC normally uses the courts for consumer fraud cases and  
handles antitrust matters internally using administrative judges. 
Officials have said the $120 million sought makes the lawsuit the 
largest antitrust case brought by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	But commission attorney Melvin H. Orlans said no law prevents  
the commission from bringing a case as long as it is not a 
technical one that would require the expertise of administrative 
judges. The Mylan case does not fall under that exemption, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mylan reached a deal in late 1997 to be the exclusive buyer of  
active ingredients made by Profarmaco S.R.L. of Milan, Italy. Other 
makers of those ingredients cannot supply adequate quantities to 
Mylan's competitors, essentially shutting them out, the government 
argues. 
</P>
<P>
	Mylan has said the exclusive deal was designed to guarantee an  
uninterrupted source of ingredients and the generic drugs still 
cost much less than brand-name versions. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission seeks at least $120 million for refunds to  
consumers. The states' lawsuit does not specify a price tag but 
seeks refunds for their agencies' purchases and other direct and 
indirect damages, as well as a deterrent against future deals. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors each year issue more than 18 million prescriptions for  
lorazepam, a generic version of Ativan, for treating anxiety, 
tension, agitation and insomnia. More than 3 million prescriptions 
for clorazepate are issued a year. Clorazepate, the generic version 
of Tranxene, is used to treat anxiety and hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	The states that filed the complaint are Alaska, Arkansas,  
California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, 
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New 
Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, 
Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Tennessee, Utah, 
Vermont, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Mullin Still Shooting After 14 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Chris Mullin is playing less and his scoring  
is down. Never fast to begin with, he's also lost a step or two -- 
or three. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there are those nagging injuries to his hands and feet,  
sure to catch up with a player who's fought through the sharp 
elbows and knees of picks for 14 seasons as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
	But here he is, a 35-year-old throwback with his crewcut and  
trademark deadeye shot, helping to lead the Indiana Pacers as they 
vie for their first NBA championship. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you look back over your career and how you want it to  
wind down, what type of people you want to be surrounded by, the 
atmosphere you want to play in, right now everything is right in 
place,'' Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
	After 836 games with Golden State, the former St. John's star  
uprooted his family in 1997 hoping for a shot at the title with 
Pacers coach Larry Bird. 
</P>
<P>
	A gym rat even before he became a high school and college star  
in New York City, Mullin has started every game for Indiana the 
past two seasons and won teammates' admiration for his talent and 
dedication. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a scientist to the game of basketball,'' said Mark  
Jackson, also a teammate at St. John's. ``He hasn't changed a bit 
since the first time I met him in New York. He's usually the first 
one in the gym and the last one out. He's a worker and a great 
friend, an example of what type of role model an NBA player should 
be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Life hasn't always gone smoothly for Mullin, the seventh overall  
draft pick in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
	He missed 22 games during the 1987-88 season while in alcohol  
rehab. Injuries, including a bum heel, a torn thumb ligament and a 
torn finger ligament, have sidelined him for 157 games. He often 
submerges both feet in buckets of ice after games. 
</P>
<P>
	``You exist in the NBA day-by-day,'' he said. ``It's not  
something where you say, `I want to do this for 15-20 years.' You 
just do it. You have to have a game plan, be dedicated and 
committed. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back, if you said I was going to play 14-15 years in  
the NBA, I'd might have looked at you like you were crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The five-time All-Star also probably never thought he'd amass  
these regular-season totals: 17,554 points, 3,494 assists, 3,917 
rebounds and 1,486 steals. 
</P>
<P>
	Mullin, who missed the playoffs in seven of his 12 years with  
Golden State, helped Indiana reach the seventh game of the Eastern 
Conference finals last year before losing to Michael Jordan and the 
Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	This season, the Pacers look like the team to beat in the East.  
They swept the Milwaukee Bucks on Thursday night in the first round 
of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Making the playoffs is great, but we want to win them this  
year, not just a series or two,'' Mullin said. 
</P>
<P>
	After leaving the Warriors, Mullin settled down in the  
Indianapolis suburb of Carmel and had to adjust to a slower pace of 
life. He admits apprehension over moving his wife, Liz, and three 
young sons, but he is enjoying the change. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, he had a special incentive to help the Pacers sweep the  
Bucks: It allowed him to return home to attend a son's Little 
League game on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Keeping busy when I'm not on the court is no problem. Hockey,  
Little League, soccer, we've got tons of things going on,'' he 
said. ``We've achieved that balance that we all strive for. I don't 
know if we ever attain it, but when you get somewhere close to it, 
you have a good feeling and that's how we are as a family.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milwaukee coach George Karl didn't need the playoffs to  
appreciate what Mullin does for a team. He saw plenty of it as 
Seattle's coach, dealing with Mullin as a Western Conference 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love him. He's the ultimate professional. He's a hard worker  
on the court, has great knowledge of the game and the way it should 
be played and goes out and uses that knowledge to help his team and 
create problems for the opponent,'' Karl said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The big difference I see in him over the years is that he's  
working harder on defense, trying to stop the man he's on. In the 
past he had to play so many minutes that he sometimes saved his 
energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullin, who scored a career-low 10.1 points a game this season,  
hit eight of 19 3-point shots while scoring a total of 34 points 
against Milwaukee. Bird played him an average of about 18 minutes 
in the three games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't move like I used to, and neither does Chris,'' said  
Bird, the ex-Boston Celtics great who played with Mullin on Dream 
Team I at the 1992 Olympics. ``That doesn't mean he isn't of less 
value to his team. He's of great value to us. His shooting ability 
opens up the court, his passing ability keeps the offense moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mullin smiles when asked about slowing down. At least he hasn't  
stopped playing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to make up for it by staying in condition, practicing my  
skills and working to improve where I can,'' he said. ``I don't 
know how much longer I'll be able to keep going, but as long as I 
feel I am contributing rather than hurting my team I'll want to 
keep going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And with a player as good as Mullin, that could be awhile.  
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Committee To Receive Timber Papers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House Resources Committee, after issuing a  
subpoena, will receive hundreds of additional government documents 
regarding a 1994 timber contract cancellation in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department agreed to hand over the documents  
following a meeting Thursday between Attorney General Janet Reno 
and Rep. Don Young, R-Alaska, the committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee officials agreed to keep the documents confidential  
and to consult with the Justice Department should the committee 
later wish to make them public. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a good sign that future negotiations with the  
Department of Justice will proceed more cooperatively,'' Young said 
in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Young has been sharply critical of the contract cancellation in  
the Tongass National Forest, which idled 1,000 timber and mill 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he wants to find out why the Agriculture Department took  
the action, whether it was legal, and if it was politically 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Pulp Corp.'s 50-year contract, issued in 1957, was  
terminated after the Japanese-owned company closed its old pulp 
plant in Sitka, Alaska. The contract required that such a plant be 
in continuous operation. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska Pulp sued the government for $1.6 billion in 1995,  
asserting that the contract cancellation amounted to a breach of 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Committee has already received tens of thousands of  
documents for an investigation it began more than a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice officials worried that disclosing another 67 paper  
documents and hundreds of computer files Young wanted -- some 
containing legal advice -- would hurt their defense against a 
lawsuit pending in the U.S. Court of Claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Young contended that the Clinton administration's concerns were  
just an excuse ``to hide embarrassing documents about bad decisions 
or possible violations of federal law.'' The committee voted April 
28 to order Justice officials to turn over the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	The subpoena drew protest from Democrats, who contended Young  
was misusing Congress' investigative powers to give Alaska Pulp an 
advantage in the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Young made it clear to Reno that he is interested in  
decisions about the contract cancellation, not the lawsuit, said 
Duane Gibson, a committee lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokeswoman Chris Watney said the agreement  
protects government legal interests and respects the committee's 
oversight role. ``We are pleased,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> For Charities, Use Heart Plus Head / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Americans are opening their hearts, and their  
wallets, to help victims of the fighting in Kosovo, the recent U.S. 
tornadoes, and the Colorado school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	While consumer groups applaud such generosity, noting that  
solicitations have been increasing lately, they caution donors to 
be careful with their contributions and wary of scam artists who 
may try to profit from the suffering of others. 
</P>
<P>
	No major cases of fraud have been reported recently, according  
to several groups contacted, but some watchdog organizations are 
issuing precautionary notices warning of some of the tactics that 
may be used. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're never going to hear of them until the sheriff drags  
them out of town,'' said Daniel Langan, a spokesman for National 
Charities Information Bureau, based in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	When responding to an appeal, individuals should ask for as much  
detail as possible about what services a charity intends to 
provide, long-term or immediate, and how it intends to reach its 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Donors will also want to know how much of their contributions  
actually go to charitable purposes, vs. administrative costs. Most 
consumer groups recommend at least 60 cents out of each dollar 
spent be used for specific programs. 
</P>
<P>
	They suggest asking for a copy of a group's annual report and  
any other pertinent financial information. Even newly established 
organizations should have written material available describing 
their programs, anticipated expenditures, and how they will carry 
out activities. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internal Revenue Service and many states require most  
charities to file financial documents to maintain their tax-exempt 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	``When in doubt, check it out,'' said Bennett Weiner, vice  
president of the Council of Better Business Bureau's Philanthropic 
Advisory Service. He suggests individuals check with their local 
BBB or with their state attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
	The vast majority of charities are reputable. But occasionally  
individuals will come across a group that isn't. 
</P>
<P>
	Scams come in many forms. There are the bogus phone  
solicitations with the sole intent of gaining illegal access to an 
individual's credit card number, the offers to send a someone to a 
home to pick up a donation for a made-up charity, or the bogus 
door-to-door appeals looking for small change and bills. Often 
times, the culprits will use a name similar to that of an 
established charity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Subsequent to any disaster you will see rather questionable  
appeals emerge,'' said Weiner. ``One of the common ones is the use 
of excessive pressure and the need for immediate assistance over 
the telephone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ann Kaplan, editor of Giving U.S.A., a publication of the  
American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel, recommends 
individuals stick with well-known charities for now as they support 
the latest relief efforts in the Balkans and in areas hard hit by 
the recent tornadoes. 
</P>
<P>
	There are lists of charities in newspapers, she noted, and  
finding one to support is really a matter of personal preference. 
Individuals will want to align themselves with groups involved in 
causes or with philosophical beliefs with which they feel 
comfortable, Kaplan added. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCIB is one of several groups that evaluates charities which  
solicit from the general public, and it has comprised a list on its 
Web site (www.give.org/refugeerelief.cfm) of 13 charities actively 
involved in relief efforts in the Balkans that meet all its 
criteria for effective operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the others: The American Institute of Philanthropy in  
Bethesda, Md., (www.charitywatch.org) lists 15 Kosovo relief 
charities that received top ratings for assisting Kosovo refugees. 
The Council of Better Business Bureaus in Arlington, Va., 
(www.bbb.org) has reports on several charities reviewed by its 
Philanthropic Advisory Service.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Maryland and Kentucky, which posted big gains in  
fourth-grade reading scores, would have shown no improvement if 
they had not excluded more special-education students from the 
national test, federal education researchers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other states with the biggest improvements -- Connecticut,  
Louisiana and South Carolina -- would have shown more modest gains. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 reading scores of fourth-grade students -- the only  
grade level available for state-by-state comparison -- increased 
from 1994 scores in several states, including those that suffered 
political fallout over previous poor showings. 
</P>
<P>
	The report Friday, presented to the board that conducts the  
voluntary national tests, theoretically puts some states close to 
where they started. The states with the largest score gains -- 
Connecticut, Louisiana and South Carolina -- all would have had 
lower average scores had special-education students been included. 
Kentucky and Maryland's scores would have remained steady. 
Minnesota's scores improved under the model because it excluded 
fewer special-ed students. 
</P>
<P>
	At least 18 of the 36 participating states left out more special  
education students from the 1998 testing sample than from the 1994 
group. Of those states, 15 posted gains in the average score. But 
just five states showed changes significant enough to concern 
reviewers. 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky pulled out 10 percent of students selected for its 1998  
sample, compared with 4 percent in 1994. It improved its average 
reading scores by 6 points, on a 500-point scale. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland pulled 9 percent of students in 1998 compared with 7  
percent of sample students in 1994. Its average score improved by 5 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	And Connecticut, the nation's highest-scoring state, removed 10  
percent of the students selected to participate, compared with 6 
percent in 1994. Its average score improved by 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana pulled 13 percent in 1998, up from 6 percent in 1994.  
Its average improved by 7 points. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina in 1998 excluded 12 percent of its sample and 7  
percent in 1994. The state reported a 7 point rise in its average 
score. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials cautioned that the report was based on a model  
analysis of how excluded students would have performed. Changes are 
stated in terms of less or more ``statistical significance,'' 
rather than specific percentage points, and therefore can't be used 
to adjust state scores or rankings. 
</P>
<P>
	``The results are what they are,'' said Pascal D. Forgione Jr.,  
chief of the Education Department's statistical branch, told the 
board, which met at the Loews Hotel here to examine the tests it 
gives. ``We need to do more analysis before any conclusions can be 
drawn.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the model used the most conservative estimate of how  
special-needs kids would have done, ``short of giving them all 
zeros.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Wilmer Cody, chief of Kentucky's Education Department and  
test board member, challenged the report, saying many special-needs 
children are in mainstream classrooms and might not necessarily do 
much worse on the tests. 
</P>
<P>
	``Trying to analyze this by generalizing is going to leave us  
without understanding what is taking place,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Because many states used the gains to tout success of their  
reforms, the validity and integrity of the national voluntary test 
has been scrutinized more closely. 
</P>
<P>
	The board said it would seek specific data on the excluded  
students, but did not say how it would factor that information into 
the current test score averages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will be working ... to ensure that we don't have an  
exclusion rate that would cloud results in the future,'' Louisiana 
schools chief Cecil Picard said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Until 1998, many special-needs students took the national test.  
Then federal law required that special-needs students get special 
help on any test comparing their results with others. The testing 
board responded by having states exclude those students from the 
national sample. 
</P>
<P>
	The test, called the National Assessment of Educational  
Progress, and its board were established by Congress. The test is 
given roughly every two years to a nationwide sample of children in 
three grade levels in core subjects like math and reading. The 
voluntary test is generally the only way to compare student 
progress nationwide, because states' tests vary. 
</P>
<P>
	A congressional hearing on the tests is scheduled for May 27.

<HEADLINE> Ex-VA Nurse Accused in Fourth Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mass. (AP) -- A former Veterans Affairs nurse  
already accused of murdering three patients was charged today with 
killing a fourth, and federal prosecutors said they would seek the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristen Gilbert, 31, was charged in November with killing three  
patients with a lethal dose of drugs and attempting to kill two at 
the Department of Veterans Affairs hospital in Northampton. She 
pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
	With the charges filed today, she faces four murder charges and  
a third attempted murder count. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have not publicly stated a motive in the case.  
</P>
<P>
	Gilbert is accused of giving the patients fatal doses of  
epinephrine, which can overstimulate the heart. 
</P>
<P>
	The new indictment names Stanley Jagodowski, 66, a retired truck  
driver who died on Aug. 22, 1995. She was already accused of 
killing Henry Hudon, 35; Kenneth Cutting, 41; and Edward Skwira, 
69. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the event of a conviction, a sentence of death is  
justified, and ... the government will seek the death penalty,'' 
Assistant U.S. Attorney William M. Welch said in a court document. 
</P>
<P>
	A staffer at the office of Gilbert's lawyer, Harry Miles, said  
he would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	From January 1995 until February 1996, a total of 37 patients --  
an unusually high number -- died on Gilbert's ward while she was on 
duty, according to federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	She was sentenced in April 1998 to a 15-month prison sentence  
for phoning in bomb threats to the hospital after she came under 
suspicion. 
</P>
<P>
	At least eight wrongful death claims have been filed against the  
hospital, seeking to link patient deaths to Gilbert.

<HEADLINE> Skins' Westbrook Talking to Media </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Michael Westbrook is talking to reporters  
again. That doesn't mean he likes what they do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't trust the media,'' the Washington Redskins receiver  
said Thursday. ``A group of people making their living off the 
unhappiness of other people. It just saddens me that a lot of you 
all live like that. It makes you happy to get a good article on 
making somebody else sad. I just don't find that humane.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook was giving his first full news conference since his  
bloody attack on teammate Stephen Davis 19 months ago. As he has 
been throughout his whole career, Westbrook was full of 
contradictions that made him as difficult to read as ever. 
</P>
<P>
	He spoke of being more mature, then called a local writer a  
``nerd'' for writing negative columns. He compared his attack on 
Davis to a ``hockey fight'' and said he didn't need counseling for 
it, but wouldn't explain how it happened. 
</P>
<P>
	He also blamed injuries, the quarterbacks, the offensive line --  
everything except his only ability -- for his disappointing four 
seasons in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think anybody can check me. Can I get open? What kind  
of question is that?'' he said. ``The offensive line hasn't been 
healthy. I haven't been healthy. The quarterbacks didn't know if 
they wanted to play quarterback or not. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that I've done the best that I can do on the field  
when the opportunity has presented itself. ... If I can just play 
16 games. Judge me on 16 games, 16 healthy games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since he was selected No. 4 overall in the 1995 draft, Westbrook  
has been suspended twice, fined twice and benched three times for 
various infractions on and off the field. He has missed 16 games 
due to injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The most infamous moment came when he started punching Davis on  
the sideline during a practice on Aug. 19, 1997. The Redskins fined 
Westbrook $50,000, suspended him for one exhibition game, told him 
to apologize and ordered him to undergo counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hockey players have fights every day, all day,'' Westbrook  
said. ``What did I need counseling for? Because I had a fight? 
</P>
<P>
	``It was more so to please the public. I don't think anything  
was mentally wrong with me, and I'm the still the great friend to 
my friends and great family member to my family members and a 
respectable human being to people that just walk past me every 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook said he stopped talking to reporters because he felt  
the matter was blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fight itself shouldn't have happened,'' he said. ``After  
it happened, I don't think the media should have ran with it the 
way it did. It sold papers, but it made my fans and family 
miserable, and I thought that was a bigger price to pay than the 
$50,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Westbrook would not say what provoked him to hit Davis, who  
threw no punches but took several and was left face down with a 
bloody nose. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's strictly between me and Stephen,'' Westbrook said. ``We  
had a fight, and it was for a reason. I apologized to him. We sat 
down and talked since, and we're really good friends now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Westbrook was enjoying his best season -- 44 catches,  
736 yards -- before suffering a neck injury Dec. 6 against San 
Diego. He had surgery in January and is expected to recover fully. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old receiver said he decided to open up partly  
because he's now the senior member of the receiving corps and wants 
to set an example for the younger players. Other than an appearance 
on teammate Brian Mitchell's talk show on WTEM-AM last season and 
an interview on WJLA-TV earlier this week, he had stayed virtually 
silent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm just tired of playing the little childish games that you  
all have been playing with me and I've been playing with you,'' 
Westbrook said. ``It's time for all of us to grow up. It's time to 
be more mature.''

<HEADLINE> Peace Corps Bill Sent to Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate has approved and sent to President  
Clinton an administration-supported bill to expand the size of the 
Peace Corps by nearly 50 percent over the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, passed by voice vote Wednesday night without  
debate, would authorize a rise in the number of Peace Corps 
volunteers from 6,700 now to 10,000 in year 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Representatives passed the bill 326-90 in March.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, who requested the expansion, was expected to sign the  
measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Peace Corps Director Mark Gearan called the congressional  
approval ``a strong declaration of support for the work of our 
volunteers in 78 countries around the world, as well as the legacy 
of the 150,000 volunteers who have joined the Peace Corps since 
1961.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gearan said in a statement that the legislation would allow for  
continued growth of the Crisis Corps, in which former volunteers 
return to their region of service for up to six months to respond 
to natural disasters and humanitarian crises.

<HEADLINE> White House Hacker Indicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A teen-ager identified as a computer hacker  
whose name appeared on the vandalized White House Internet site is 
facing charges he broke into another government computer. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury indicted Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of  
computer intrusion. Burns, reportedly known on the Internet as 
``Zyklon,'' was accused of breaking into a computer between August 
1998 and January 1999 in northern Virginia that is used by the U.S. 
Information Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zyklon'' was one of a dozen names listed on the hacked version  
of the White House Web site, which was altered overnight Sunday for 
a few minutes before government computers automatically detected 
the intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment returned Thursday also accuses Burns of breaking  
into two other computers, one owned by LaserNet of Fairfax, Va., 
and the other by Issue Dynamics Inc. of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Sam Simon of Issue Dynamics said he was cooperating with the  
FBI. 
</P>
<P>
	``We firmly believe that computer criminals need to be  
identified, prosecuted and caught, and we're pleased that the FBI 
is not treating this as a minor matter,'' Simon said. ``It wasn't 
an insignificant incident. It was a very concentrated, serious 
effort over a period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Burns was not charged in the attack on the White House  
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The opening page of the White House site was altered briefly to  
show a black Web page with the names of two hacker organizations 
claiming responsibility, along with messages, ``Your box was 
own3d'' and ``Stop all the war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The page also included the phrase, ``following peeps get some  
shouts,'' and listed a dozen names, including ``Zyklon.''

<HEADLINE> Crashes Or No, Tour Buses Still Hot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- When Bill Rodgers heard the awful news, that  
22 people had died in a tour-bus crash in New Orleans, he said a 
``little prayer for God's guidance,'' then climbed back on his bus 
to Branson. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't help but give it some consideration because we come  
to Branson twice a year on the bus,'' the 87-year-old retired 
policeman from Fort Smith, Ark., said Thursday as he waited for his 
wife to pick up a few munchies at the Mountain Man Nut and Fruit 
Company for the ride back home. 
</P>
<P>
	He and 41 other riders, mostly old friends and acquaintances,  
had been on the road when they learned of the Mother's Day crash in 
New Orleans. Most of them had been so busy shopping and taking in 
as many as three shows a day that they hadn't heard there had been 
another crash on Wednesday, this one injuring 15 people near 
California's Yosemite National Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I don't think it's something that will keep us from  
coming,'' Rodgers said of the two accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something that's certainly regrettable,'' he continued,  
``And we all realize it's something that could happen every trip.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But then he smiled and added: ``We just say a little prayer for  
God's guidance and get on the bus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While people's fear of flying inevitably rises after a plane  
crash, bus crashes don't appear to have the same effect. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think just in terms of people's imagery about the situation,  
it is much more terrifying to think about falling out of the sky,'' 
said Linda Welsh, a psychologist and director of the Agoraphobia 
and Anxiety Treatment Center in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., near 
Philadelphia. ``With a plane crash, they imagine a total loss of 
life ... where with a bus accident there's a sense that people do 
survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bus accidents were terrible tragedies, riders said this  
week. And, yes, tragedy could strike anyone any time; even on a 
beautiful, sun-splashed day in Branson. But, they added, if you 
stayed home every time a bus veered off a highway, a plane crashed 
or a train jumped the tracks, you'd never go anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us are widows, and for us it's the only way to go. Or  
else we just don't go,'' said Juanita Puckett as she waited for her 
bus by Branson's Star Walk of Fame, where hand prints of local 
entertainers like Jim Stafford, Tony Orlando and Barbara Fairchild 
are encased in cement. 
</P>
<P>
	And it wasn't just Midwesterners who seemed fearless. Anecdotal  
reports from the Gulf Coast and Atlantic City, N.J., indicated that 
there was no drop in bus ridership at other resorts cities. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, a spokeswoman for Houston-based Coach USA, which  
provides motorcoach charter, tour and sightseeing services, said 
she hadn't heard of any cancellations this week because of the 
crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Margie Garner admitted she couldn't help but think about  
the New Orleans disaster this week when the accelerator on her bus 
gave out and it rolled to a stop near a steep ravine. 
</P>
<P>
	``I did think about it when I looked down into that ravine and  
realized how high up we were and thought what it would be like if 
our bus went off the road,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But,'' she quickly added, ``it's safer than driving our car.''  
</P>
<P>
	Federal statistics would seem to back her up. They show that an  
average of six people die in motorcoach crashes in a given year, 
while 22,000 died in car crashes in 1997. That same year, 49 people 
died in accidents involving U.S. commercial airlines. In addition, 
there were 40 air taxi fatalities, and 646 died in private planes. 
</P>
<P>
	Welsh said buses are less scary to anxious passengers because  
one can always get off, while there is no exit from a plane once 
the door is closed. ``It comes down to a control issue,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	And taking the bus is more than just a way to get there for Mrs.  
Garner, 67, and her 70-year-old husband, James. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of the 6.7 million tourists who came to Branson last  
year, the Garners are retired, and traveling to places in big, 
comfortable, high-rise buses staffed with social directors is a way 
of life for them and their friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 10,000 buses dropped tourists off here last year, said  
Branson spokesman Jerry Adams, helping give this mountaintop city 
famous for its dozens of music theaters the ranking as one of 
America's top motorcoach destinations, according to the National 
Tour Association. 
</P>
<P>
	And this week in Branson was no different from any other in  
mid-May, according to Ed Michel, president of Ozark Mountain 
Sightseeing, one of the area's largest operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this point we've had no statements from anybody, no  
comments, no calls, nobody even getting on the bus talking about 
it,'' he said of the crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	With the beginning of Branson's peak season still two weeks  
away, he estimated there were 60 tour buses arriving in town on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, they appeared to be everywhere. Five were parked behind  
Yakov Smirnoff's theater for an afternoon show. Three more were up 
the street at Mickey Gilley's, with two more parked across the 
street in front of the Osmond Family Theatre. All the while, a 
constant parade of them moved up and down the street.

<HEADLINE> Global Crossing May Buy U S West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Baby Bell phone company U S West Inc. is  
close to an agreement to merge with Global Crossing Ltd., a 
telecommunications upstart that's on an acquisition streak, 
according to people familiar with the situation. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, being structured as a stock swap, would create a  
company with $17 billion in annual sales and a stock market value 
of $65 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West, based in Denver, brings to the table local phone  
customers in 14 western and midwestern states, a wireless phone 
service, and a high-speed Internet access business. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing, headquartered in Bermuda, brings a local and  
long-distance phone business and a vast undersea fiber optic cable 
network. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some real value to both sides,'' said Rex Mitchell, an  
industry analyst for NationsBanc Montgomery Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, which could be announced as soon as Monday, would be  
set up as union of equals, with each company owning a 50 percent 
interest, according to a person familiar with the details. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company, which would keep the Global Crossing name,  
would have two separate stocks: one to track the performance of the 
high-growth Internet and data assets, the other stock for the 
traditional telephone assets. Investors will be able to choose 
which stock they want to hold. 
</P>
<P>
	This would be Global Crossing's third deal in as many months. In  
April, it agreed to pay $885 million for the undersea cable 
operations of the British telecommunications company Cable &AMP; 
Wireless. In March, Global Crossing signed an contract to acquire 
Frontier Corp., a phone company based in Rochester, N.Y., for about 
$11 billion in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	Global Crossing was started two years ago by Gary Winnick, a Los  
Angeles financier who once worked with junk bond purveyor Michael 
Milken and now serves as co-chairman. Global Crossing, which went 
public last August, has seen its stock price increase five-fold to 
over $60 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The man behind the buying spree is Robert Annuziata, Global  
Crossing's chief executive officer, who is trying to build a 
communications empire to rival the one he left: AT&AMP;T Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Annuziata, however, would share the power and the top title of  
the new company with Solomon Trujillo, chief executive of U S West, 
a source said. 
</P>
<P>
	Their merger plans still face several challenges.  
</P>
<P>
	U S West, a product of the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, is prohibited  
from offering long-distance service in its local phone territory 
until it gives up its monopoly in that area. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal also may require the support of Frontier shareholders,  
who could pose obstacles. Global Crossing is issuing new shares of 
stock to buy Frontier. If it issues still more shares to merge with 
U S West, the value the shares being given to Frontier investors 
will be diluted. 
</P>
<P>
	However, as a long distance provider, Frontier also stands to  
gain from a link-up with U S West because the combination should 
ultimately be able to offer customers local, long-distance and 
wireless phone services. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the challenges, Annuziata is expected to push hard to  
get U S West. The company is the nation's largest provider of 
high-speed Internet access over digital subscriber lines, known as 
DSL, a fledgling service that works over regular telephone wires. 
There were about 50,000 DSL subscribers in the country last year, 
and about 60 percent of those were U S West customers. 
</P>
<P>
	DSL is considered the most worthy rival to the cable television  
wires that AT&AMP;T is using to build a multimedia network for TV, 
phone and Internet service. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, AT&AMP;T agreed to pay $58 billion to acquire MediaOne  
Group, the nation's fourth largest cable company and formerly a 
sister company of U S West. That deal included an alliance with 
Comcast, the No. 3 cable company. Along with AT&AMP;T's pending 
alliance with Time Warner and its recent purchase of 
Tele-Communications Inc., AT&AMP;T will have access to the four largest 
cable systems in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a polarization in the industry,'' said Christine  
Heckart, vice president at TeleChoice Inc., a consulting company. 
``At one end will be the global super-carriers. ... At the other 
end will be a highly fragmented community of niche players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U S West declined to comment. Calls to Global Crossing were not  
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors, responded quickly to the news, bidding up the price  
of U S West shares by $2.25 to $62.25 amid a broad selloff on the 
New York Stock Exchange. Global Crossing's Nasdaq-listed stock was 
off 62 1/2 cents at $59.37 1/2.

<HEADLINE> Prozac Infomercial Hitting Airwaves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Midnight couch potatoes take heart:  
Television's glut of half-hour ads for food dehydrators, countertop 
broilers and exercise videos will soon be joined by an infomercial 
about Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	Eli Lilly and Co. has created a 30-minute program on the world's  
top-selling antidepressant. It will air on TV stations and cable 
channels in the middle of the night and on weekends, time slots 
when more depressed people are expected to be slouched in front of 
the tube. 
</P>
<P>
	Millions of Americans pay about $60 a month for Prozac, which  
treats depression, bulimia, obsessive-compulsive disorder and other 
ills. Its side effects include sexual dysfunction and 
sleeplessness. 
</P>
<P>
	The infomercial, which begins airing Monday, is aimed mostly at  
women, with all but two patients featured being female. It includes 
shaky camera shots of people who are presumably depressed and 
testimonials from people who have benefited from Prozac. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really gives us an opportunity to tell people about a  
disease that really goes under-reported or undertreated,'' said the 
infomercial's host, Freda Lewis-Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The drug generates nearly $3 billion in annual sales for  
Indianapolis-based Lilly.

<HEADLINE> Gun Issue Tricky for GOP Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The abrupt shift on gun control by  
congressional Republicans underscores the difficulty facing GOP 
presidential candidates tackling the tricky issue in the wake of 
the Colorado school shootings. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Rifle Association, an old GOP ally, appeared to win  
a major victory Wednesday when the Senate rejected a Democratic 
measure requiring background checks of firearms sales at gun shows. 
The Senate passed a measure by Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, to make 
the checks voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
	Party leaders retreated under pressure Thursday from  
rank-and-file Republicans, including presidential candidate John 
McCain of Arizona. He and several other senators said they were 
unhappy with Wednesday's vote, even though they had voted in favor 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a realization that there was a loophole that had to  
be closed,'' McCain said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate voted 48-47 Friday to approve a measure establishing  
a system of background checks for all buyers of firearms at gun 
shows, overriding criticism from Democrats and the White House that 
new loopholes will give criminals access to firearms. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an overly burdensome requirement in the face of  
the tragic shootings at Columbine,'' McCain said after the vote 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The congressional change-of-course reflects a growing sentiment  
in Washington that voters want new limits on guns. Several party 
officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said private polling 
conducted after last month's shooting at Columbine High School in 
Colorado reveals strong support for gun control, even among 
Republican primary voters. 
</P>
<P>
	That is a marked shift from the past.  
</P>
<P>
	Some of that polling has been conducted for Elizabeth Dole, the  
former American Red Cross leader who ranks second in most GOP 
presidential polls. In a series of high-profile announcements, Mrs. 
Dole opposed concealed-weapons laws and supported bans on assault 
weapons and armor-piercing bullets. 
</P>
<P>
	Her advisers are betting that the issue will help her build a  
base of female voters and pull moderate Democrats into GOP 
primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	An added bonus: The against-the-grain stances drew attention to  
her candidacy just as her campaign appeared stalled, aides say 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for Democrats and Republicans to put  
consensus before confrontation so we can get tough on crime,'' Mrs. 
Dole said Friday during a campaign swing through Iowa. That means 
``instant background checks should be required wherever guns are 
commercially sold,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to help the police fight crime,'' she said. ``I do not  
see a reason for a family to have an assault weapon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The early GOP favorite, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, is harder to  
pin down. 
</P>
<P>
	He expressed support for background checks in Texas, but did so  
only after a bill to that effect died in the state legislature. The 
governor later explained that he never endorsed the bill, which he 
said had many flaws, and urged Congress to address the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman said Thursday that Bush would not have supported the  
Democratic gun show measure defeated in the Senate. Bush believes 
the bill would have imposed too many regulations and given too much 
power to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, spokesman 
David Beckwith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush favored the Craig proposal, though he would prefer the  
checks be mandatory, Beckwith said. Hours later, the GOP-led Senate 
reversed course and seemed to adopt Bush's position. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think it should be required that any vendor ... should have  
access to (the federal database) and required to use it,'' Beckwith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lamar Alexander, competing with Bush and Dole for moderate GOP  
voters, said shortly after the Colorado shooting that future 
massacres ``will not be stopped by more laws coming out of 
Washington.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a subtle shift, the former Tennessee governor took no  
position on the bill Thursday but spokesman Steve Schmidt said, 
``Federal gun control legislation is something that Gov. Alexander 
is not opposed to, to keep guns out of the hands of people who 
shouldn't have them: Criminals, the insane and children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative businessman Steve Forbes said he would have  
supported Craig's measure, but called it a ``quick fix'' and said 
the solution to mounting violence is ``reshaping our culture.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rest of the GOP candidates oppose any new  
restrictions on guns. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Vice President Dan Quayle and conservative activist Gary  
Bauer said they support voluntary, not mandatory, background checks 
at gun shows. Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire opposed even the 
Craig measure, and was among a small group of Republican senators 
who voted against an attempt to stiffen it on the floor on Friday.

<HEADLINE> O'Donnell Making Tony Appearance </HEADLINE>

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Rosie O'Donnell was too busy to host this year's  
Tony Awards. But a guest appearance? That she can manage. 
</P>
<P>
	The talk show host, who was the host for the ceremony the past  
two years, is scheduled to appear on the live June 6 broadcast 
along with Julie Andrews, Carol Burnett, Kevin Spacey, Jason 
Robards, Brian Dennehy, Scott Wolf and Stockard Channing. 
</P>
<P>
	``There will be several host-presenters, some of whom will be  
paired based on their theatrical ties, rather than a single star,'' 
Walter Miller, the show's executive producer, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The 53rd annual ceremony will be televised by CBS. O'Donnell was  
credited with improving the Tony show's ratings as host, but she 
declined to take the job for the third straight year.

<HEADLINE> Mother, 3 Kids Found Dead in Tenn. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A woman who suffered hallucinations and  
thought everyone was out to get her shot her three children to 
death, then killed herself. 
</P>
<P>
	The bodies of the children, ages 4, 5 and 7, were found on a bed  
Thursday evening. Their mother, 28-year-old Tonya Avery, lay dead 
on the floor nearby. All four had been killed with shotgun blasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Avery left a suicide note telling Danny Patterson, her  
boyfriend and father of the two girls, ``that she and the children 
loved him,'' police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The note gave no reason for the killings, but police said  
investigators were told Ms. Avery had ``exhibited recent signs of 
paranoia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert Davis, Ms. Avery's father, said she had been exhibiting  
signs of mental illness in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
	``She just started seeing and hearing things and everything, and  
thought that everybody was against her and thought that she was 
going to die,'' he said. ``I just never thought it would come to 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to the home when a neighbor noticed that the  
home was unusually quiet and its front porch light had been on all 
day.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Party Must Choose Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- For 70 years, Mexico's ruling party had  
little difficulty in choosing a presidential candidate. The 
president picked someone, the party rubber-stamped the choice and 
the nominee always won, usually by a landslide. 
</P>
<P>
	But electoral victories are no longer guaranteed, and President  
Ernesto Zedillo has repeatedly said he won't designate a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the leadership of the Institutional Revolutionary  
Party will announce how the party, known as the PRI, will choose 
its nominee for the July 2000 elections. That could be a pivotal 
moment in determining the party's candidate -- and maybe the next 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``The rules of the game are going to clearly indicate who has  
the advantage in the game,'' said independent Sen. Adolfo Aguilar 
Zinser. 
</P>
<P>
	Party president Jose Antonio Gonzalez Fernandez has said the PRI  
is committed to a democratic, grassroots selection process. 
</P>
<P>
	But some believe the rules -- including who can vote and how  
campaigns can be conducted -- could be rigged to benefit Zedillo's 
favorites and prevent old-style populist politicians, such as 
Tabasco Gov. Roberto Madrazo, from getting the nomination. Madrazo 
has been aggressively campaigning and doing well in opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Zedillo, who is prohibited by law from running for re-election,  
is seen as favoring a candidate likely to continue his fiscally 
conservative economic policies -- most likely Interior Secretary 
Francisco Labastida. 
</P>
<P>
	If the rules are seen as biased toward Zedillo's candidate, that  
could worsen divisions within the party, undermining its chances of 
beating back what could be its strongest opposition challenge ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential candidate who may be the best hope for unifying  
the party is Veracruz Gov. Miguel Aleman, the son of a former 
president. Aleman has said he wants to see what the party announces 
Monday before deciding whether to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Few expect Zedillo to stay out of the selection process  
entirely. He was seen as pulling strings to assure the selection of 
Gonzalez Fernandez, his former labor secretary, as head of the 
party, a position that will have great influence in the selection 
of the PRI candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	He has also said that not naming the candidate doesn't mean  
staying out of the process. 
</P>
<P>
	At a ceremony in March, he said, ``I have the full right and all  
the moral and political authority to give my opinion about the 
characteristics of the process in which our party will select our 
candidate.''

<HEADLINE> 1 Dead in Mich. Truck Accident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- A 16-year-old who got his driver's  
license three days ago lost control and crashed a pickup truck 
packed with classmates, killing one and injuring 13, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver and his passengers, ranging in age from 14 to 16,  
were freshman at Dearborn Edsel Ford High School in suburban 
Detroit, said police Chief Ronald Deziel. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver had halted at a stop sign Thursday, then rapidly  
accelerated before making a quick turn that caused the truck to 
turn on its side, Deziel said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the injured suffered broken bones, the chief said. All  
were released from a hospital by Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Bailey, a 15-year-old rider in the truck's bed, landed in  
the street and was fatally run over by the vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just tipped over and then everyone was flying everywhere,''  
said passenger Wesley Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, who was not injured, was questioned by police and  
then released into the custody of his parents. It has not been 
determined what charges he will face, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``At a minimum, he will be charged with reckless driving,''  
Deziel said.

	RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Sheik Abdul-Aziz bin Baz, Saudi  
Arabia's top cleric, whose rulings ranged from sanctioning Viagra 
for Muslim men to banning short veils for women, died Thursday of 
cancer. He was in his 80s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Baz, head of the Council of Senior Islamic Scholars, was a  
highly influential scholar whose pronouncements reflected the 
official point of view and often carried the weight of law. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago on Bin Baz's advice, the government banned the  
import and production of veils that failed to completely cover a 
woman's face. Women in Saudi Arabia generally don't appear in 
public without a black cloak and a head scarf.

anti-impotence drug Viagra if it does not contain any intoxicating 
substances.

cancer. She was 47. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Chabola was special events coordinator for the Los Angeles

	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Sir Ian Fraser, a pioneer in  
using penicillin to treat battle wounds during World War II, died 
Tuesday at age 98. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser was serving with the Royal Army Medical Corps in West  
Africa in 1942 when he was sent to Algiers to take charge of a 
research team testing a new drug, penicillin. He carried out his 
research in a hospital but soon took it to the battlefield where 
the drug could be tested as soon as casualties occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	Fraser followed British troops ashore on the invasion of  
Sicily's beaches and operated aboard a ship continuously for 48 
hours, saving many lives. He served until 1946, when he returned to 
Belfast. 
</P>
<P>
	He served as a senior consulting surgeon at the Royal Victoria  
Hospital, Belfast, and the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick

</P>
<P>
	She was also a columnist for Newsweek magazine since 1974.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Greenfield voiced opinions on the great turmoils and  
scandals of her time, up through Clinton's impeachment. She said 
she tried not to lose sight of the humanity of the fallen. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, the Post, for all its groundbreaking coverage of  
Watergate, editorialized in favor of President Nixon's pardon -- 
``to the disgust of most of our friends,'' she said -- when she was 
deputy editor of the editorial page, a position she held from 1970 
to 1979. She became editor of the page in 1979.

</P>
<P>
	Originally known as the ``Sunshine Girl'' of artists' models,  
Sally Payne came to Hollywood under contract to appear in Republic

</P>
<P>
	She made her debut in a bit part as a tourist in the 1934 film  
``Hollywood Hobbies.'' By 1940, before moving into a series of 
westerns, she had appeared as a maid in ``No, No, Nanette'' and as 
Lucy Endover in ``La Conga Nights.'' 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Gene Sarazen, the elegant, knickers-wearing  
``Squire'' of golf in the 1920s and '30s who invented the sand 
wedge club and was one of only four men to win all four of the 
sport's major championships, died Thursday of pneumonia. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen won the PGA Championship three times, the U.S. Open  
twice and the Masters and British Open once each. Only Sarazen, 
Nicklaus, Ben Hogan and Gary Player won all four majors at least 
once in their careers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's best year was 1932, when he won the British Open with  
a then-record 283 and captured the U.S. Open by shooting a 
final-round 66. 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the 1932 British Open was made possible in part  
by his invention of the sand wedge, the wide-angled club 
particularly useful in smashing balls out of sand traps. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's greatest acclaim came from a 235-yard 4-wood shot he  
made at the Masters in 1935. Trailing Craig Wood by three strokes 
with just four holes remaining, Sarazen holed the shot for a 
double-eagle 2 -- the rarest score in golf. The shot tied Wood in 
regulation and Sarazen won in a playoff. It also elevated the 
status of the previously obscure Masters. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, born Eugenio Saraceni, won the 1954 PGA Seniors title  
and in 1973, at age 71, made a hole-in-one during the first round 
of the British Open. It was his last tournament.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Thomas, a jazz singer known for his  
ululating style, died Saturday of heart failure as a result of 
leukemia. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas developed his wordless yodeling style -- which he later  
called ``soularphone'' -- in the late 1960s when he performed with 
musician Pharoah Sanders. His elastic throat articulation was 
compared to African pygmy and American Indian singing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Sanders, Thomas helped develop ``kosmigroov,'' a type  
of spiritual African-tinged soul-jazz exemplified in recordings 
like ``The Creator Has a Master Plan'' (1969) and 
``Hum-Allah-Hum-Allah-Hum Allah'' (1970). 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Illinois, Thomas moved to New York in 1958 and worked as  
a straight blues-jazz singer. By the mid-1960s he was performing 
with Count Basie and Mary Lou Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in his career he recorded albums for the Flying Dutchman  
label, and spent two years with the band Santana. In recent years, 
he often sang at the Lenox Lounge in Harlem.

<HEADLINE> China Promises To Protect Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MACAU (AP) -- China is committed to curbing deflation, but that  
will not come at the expense of a stable currency, China's central 
bank chief said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have solid ground to safeguard the stability'' of the  
Chinese yuan, Dai Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of 
China, told a banking conference in Macau. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that China had $146.7 billion in foreign exchange  
reserves and has only a small amount of short-term foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	The yuan, fixed at 8.28 to the dollar, has been stable for two  
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail prices in China are falling fast as the economy slows  
down from the double-digit growth of a few years ago. The retail 
price index -- China's benchmark for inflation -- was down 3.5 
percent in April compared with the same month a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank tried to pump more money into the economy by  
cutting interest rates three times in 1998. It also cut the reserve 
ratio -- the percentage of deposits banks are required to hold in 
cash -- to 8 percent from 13 percent, Dai noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai gave no indication when or if the central bank would ease  
rates this year. 
</P>

saying: ``We will continue our opening up policy and won't change 
our basic policy to open to the outside world.''

<HEADLINE>  Golf Great Gene Sarazen Dies at 97  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The golf ball and the 4-wood he used for the ``shot heard 'round  
the world'' are in a trophy case at Augusta National. The sand 
wedge he invented can be found in the bag of touring professionals 
and casual golfers alike. 
</P>
<P>
	Gene Sarazen meant more to golf than becoming the first player  
to win all four majors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a career that stretched from Harry Vardon to Jack Nicklaus  
and included such victims as Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen, Sarazen 
was the very essence of the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you discuss or research the history of golf, the name  
Gene Sarazen is unavoidable,'' Nicklaus said. ``He was the 
cornerstone of the game we all enjoy today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen, the knickered ``Squire'' whose elegant style defined  
the game, died Thursday at age 97 in Naples, Fla., from 
complications of pneumonia, said his lawyer, John Cardillo. He had 
been hospitalized for several days. 
</P>
<P>
	``He will be remembered for as long as the game is played,''  
Byron Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though he lived for nearly a century, his death was  
surprising. He remained active while living in an oceanfront 
condominium in Marco Island, Fla. Since 1981, he returned to the 
Masters -- the major he put on the map -- to join Nelson and Sam 
Snead in hitting the ceremonial first tee shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gene told me the year he was 90 that he was never going to go  
back,'' Nelson said. ``He was 97 this year, and he was still doing 
it. It's kind of like an old fire horse. He was ready to go, all 
the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was ready when he burst onto the scene in 1922 to win the  
U.S. Open, a former caddie who was inspired by Francis Ouimet 
winning the Open nine years earlier. He won the second of his seven 
majors later that year in the PGA Championship. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what he thought about Tiger Woods winning the Masters at  
age 21, Sarazen quipped, ``I won two majors when I was 20.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added his third a year later when he repeated as PGA champion  
with a 38-hole victory over Hagen, his biggest rival. There were 
seven major championships in all -- the PGA three times, the U.S. 
Open twice and the Masters and British Open once. 
</P>
<P>
	Only Ben Hogan, Gary Player and Nicklaus have managed to win the  
career Grand Slam -- the Masters, U.S. Open, British Open and PGA. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for Sarazen, the Masters may have never been a major.  
</P>
<P>
	It was called the Augusta National Invitation Tournament in 1935  
when Sarazen made his debut. He trailed Craig Wood by three strokes 
with four holes to go when Jones came out to the 15th fairway to 
watch the end. 
</P>
<P>
	His caddie wanted Sarazen to hit a 3-wood over the pond from 235  
yards away to the par-5, but Sarazen insisted on a 4-wood. It hit 
the pin and dropped for a double-eagle 2, the rarest shot in golf. 
He tied Wood in regulation and beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nowadays, wherever I go, people say, `That's the man who got  
the double eagle.' Actually, it was just a piece of luck,'' Sarazen 
once said. ``They forget the championships I won.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a spectacular shot, the one everybody talks about, but  
I take my greatest pride in having won the U.S. and British Opens 
in the same year, 1932.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stopped playing golf in 1973, but went out in fashion with a  
hole-in-one at the famous Postage Stamp hole at Royal Troon in the 
British Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``The game has lost one of its great heroes,'' PGA Tour  
commissioner Tim Finchem said. ``Gene Sarazen dedicated his life to 
golf and became one of the game's legendary figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Mark O'Meara returned to Augusta National this spring as  
the defending champion, he saw his name on the same locker with 
Sarazen in the Champions Room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought that was the greatest thing,'' O'Meara said. ``He  
was class personified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen's best year was 1932, when he won the British Open with  
a then-record 283 and captured the U.S. Open by shooting a 
final-round 66. Jones called Sarazen's late charge, ``the finest 
competitive round ever played.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His victory in the 1932 British Open at the Prince's course in  
England was made possible by another Sarazen legacy -- the sand 
wedge. 
</P>
<P>
	``I invented it in 1931 and I showed it at the British Open in  
1932,'' Sarazen said in 1997. ``I had it hidden because I was 
afraid they were going to ban it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now it's found in every player's bag.  
</P>
<P>
	``It probably should have been called the Sarazen wedge,''  
Arnold Palmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eugenio Saraceni was born Feb. 27, 1902, in Harrison, N.Y., near  
New York City, the son of an Italian immigrant carpenter who never 
understood golf and saw his son play only once -- at the PGA 
Championship in Pelham, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said his father watched from a highway while he played  
the 10th hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a 40-foot putt and missed it,'' Sarazen recalled last  
year. ``That night he said, `You mean to say they pay you fellows 
to play that game and you couldn't put that thing in the hole?' I 
said, `Did you ever try it?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen starting caddying as an 8-year-old, walking four miles  
to the nearest club and playing whenever he could. He set his 
sights on becoming a professional, against all odds. 
</P>
<P>
	``In those days, only brokers and bankers played golf,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	He won his first tournament and $20. He made a hole-in-one, and  
the next day his name was in the papers. He hated it. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looked too much like a violin player. I changed it to Gene  
Sarazen,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen nearly died during a flu epidemic in 1918. After  
recovering, he bought a $15 steamship ticket from New York to 
Florida and settled in Sebring, where he unloaded brick in a 
freight yard while polishing his game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen said there was an easy explanation for why he remained a  
good player for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good golf is simply a matter of hitting good shots  
consistently,'' he said. ``And a player can do this for many years 
after he has passed his physical peak if his swing is fundamentally 
correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the PGA Tour established its Lifetime Achievement Award in  
1996, Sarazen was its first recipient. 
</P>
<P>
	Sarazen lived the last years of his life on Marco Island, Fla.  
His wife of 62 years -- Mary Catherine -- died in 1986. He is 
survived by two children, Mary Ann, of Marco Island, and Gene Jr. 
of Delray Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral Mass will be held at the San Marco Roman Catholic  
Church in Marco Island at 10 a.m. Monday.

<HEADLINE> Sears Accused of Child Labor Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Labor Department investigation found 227  
children were working at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. in violation of child 
labor law. The giant retailer has agreed to pay a fine and audit 
its stores for problems each year. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, teen-agers were operating heavy machinery, which  
is prohibited by labor law, said Labor Department spokeswoman Susan 
King. There were a few instances of teens working too many hours, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The results of the investigation and the settlement were to be  
announced later today by Labor Secretary Alexis Herman. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears, the nation's largest department store and second-largest  
retailer, will pay a $325,000 fine to settle the allegations, King 
said. Under the agreement reached this week, the company also 
agreed to conduct annual audits of its 845 ``full-line'' stores and 
step up training of managers, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, the company has 11,150 workers under age 18.  
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 Labor Department investigation in 23 states involved 71  
of the nation's 825 stores, King said. Violations were found in 44 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
	In most cases, 16- and 17-year-olds were found loading and  
operating power-driven paper balers, a machine that flattens 
cardboard boxes, or operating freight elevators or fork lifts. 
</P>
<P>
	Under federal law, children are not permitted to operate this  
sort of hazardous equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In a few cases, some 15-year-old workers were working more hours  
than permitted under law, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, Sears does not admit to any of the  
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sears spokeswoman Jan Drummond had no comment on the charges  
leveled but said the company hopes to use the agreement to improve 
working conditions for teens. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an opportunity to be a model in the retail industry in  
making an attractive and safe workplace for teen-agers,'' she said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	King said the department was pleased by Sears' response when  
they were presented with the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``When brought this information, they were willing to do a very  
comprehensive agreement,'' King said. ``They can do more than we 
can do alone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that the department has only 1,000 investigators  
nationwide to monitor laws including child labor, minimum wage and 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	``To get 845 stores self-audited every year is, for us, a real  
extention of the ability to protect kids,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The company also agreed to give information on labor law to  
parents of all workers under 18 and to step up training of every 
store manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Labor initiated the investigation because Sears is such a large  
company and because 60 percent of teen-age workers work in retail, 
King said. 
</P>
<P>
	She added that the investigation and the agreement to be  
announced today are important in the department's effort to enforce 
child labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sears is the American pie of retail stores,'' she said. ``It's  
not Susan's 5 and 10 or Susan's Dress Shop. It's Sears.''

<HEADLINE> Berkshire Sees Drop in Earnings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Smaller gains from investments and lower  
earnings from insurance resulted in a 25 percent decline in first 
quarter net profit at Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the holding company 
of veteran investor Warren Buffet. 
</P>
<P>
	Net earnings in the three months ended March 31 were $541  
million, or $356 per class-A share, compared to $722 million, or 
$582 per share, in the same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the decline in net earnings came from a drop in realized  
investment gains to $247 million from $470 million. But the company 
cautioned in a statement that such gains can fluctuate 
significantly without impacting underlying operations. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's first quarter includes the results of General Re,  
the largest reinsurer in the United States and third-largest in the 
world. Berkshire acquired General Re, based in Stamford, Conn., in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	General Re's first-quarter earnings from operations, before  
accounting charges, were $151 million compared to $250 million. 
That decline is due to significant underwriting losses in both its 
international property and casualty business and is life and health 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's largest operation, car insurer GEICO, broke even  
from underwriting in 1999's first quarter compared to a pretax 
profit of $61 million in the year-ago period, an anticipated lapse 
given the last two years' rate reductions and increases in 
advertising expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were announced after the close of stock trading  
Friday. Berkshire's Class A shares, the highest priced on the New 
York Stock Exchange, fell $2,300 to $74,300. The ``Baby Berkshire'' 
Class B shares, the second most expensive on the NYSE, were down 50 
cents at $2,398 each.

<HEADLINE> Reeve Still Unable To Walk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Christopher Reeve believes he will someday  
walk again, but said recent video that showed his legs moving 
during therapy shouldn't be misconstrued. 
</P>
<P>
	The paralyzed actor-director was videotaped May 1 at the  
University of California at Los Angeles, suspended in a harness 
while researchers moved his feet and legs in a walking motion on a 
treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
	The video was shared with TV stations. Some media reported or  
gave the impression that he is now able to walk, Reeve said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, this is not the case. I am completely paralyzed  
from the rib cage down,'' he said Thursday. ``However, I am 
participating in a cutting-edge therapy which is part of my overall 
exercise program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeve, who played Superman in four movies from 1978 to 1987, has

<HEADLINE> Blazers Await Jazz or Kings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The Portland Trail Blazers have a few days  
to rest -- and to keep tabs on the Sacramento-Utah series. 
</P>
<P>
	It's been a remarkable week for the Blazers, who went from  
underachievers to undefeated in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Just last Friday, the Blazers were in a sour mood after losing  
four of their last five regular-season games, including a 
momentum-crushing 28-point blowout against the Los Angeles Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, on the eve of Game 1 of their first-round series  
against Phoenix, the Blazers impatiently answered questions about 
whether they could regain their stride against the surging Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers emphatically erased those doubts with a 3-0 sweep,  
completed with Wednesday night's 103-93 comeback victory in 
Phoenix. Portland ended a six-year string of first-round exits. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a really good feeling,'' said forward Brian Grant, who  
like other Blazers played in his first winning playoff series. 
``Walt Williams and I may have been jumping around extra hard on 
the sidelines because we were in Sacramento together. We've both 
been down some rough roads. Now, to make it to the second round -- 
we're not saying it's like a championship or anything, but it's 
just a big relief to make it to the second round.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Grant recovered from a painful bone bruise in his left knee to  
have a terrific series: He averaged 19.3 points and 9.3 rebounds 
and made 71.9 percent of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
	After a physical, emotionally draining Game 3, the Blazers  
arrived back in Portland on Thursday and took the rest of the day 
off. They were scheduled to practice today, but a hot topic surely 
will be the stunning collapse of the Utah Jazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's improbable 84-81 overtime loss in Sacramento on Wednesday  
night gave the Blazers hope for opening the second round at the 
Rose Garden. Should the Jazz lose the series, Portland would have 
homecourt advantage against the Kings, who were 0-4 against the 
Blazers this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland's Isaiah Rider was listed as day to day on Thursday  
after spraining his right knee in the third quarter Wednesday. 
Rider was said to be walking fine, however, and indicated he would 
be ready for the next round. 
</P>
<P>
	Rider was hurt when he dove for a loose ball and the Suns' Tom  
Gugliotta fell into his right knee. Rider came back and, although 
he contributed little on the court, urged his teammates on loudly 
and waved a towel from the sideline. After the game, he even 
compared himself to Willis Reed and his famed hobbling entrance for 
the New York Knicks in the 1970 finals.

	The Blazers came very close to losing their cool several times  
during the game.

	When Rider was fouled hard by Danny Manning late in the second  
quarter, he briefly confronted Manning, but then walked away.

	Williams, however, left the bench area to defend Rider, an act  
that usually carries an automatic one-game suspension. Williams was 
not suspended Thursday, and a league official said the incident was 
still being looked at.

	Portland has gotten into trouble all season for outbursts and  
tantrums directed at officials, and Wednesday night was no 
different. Rasheed Wallace, whose protests have been characterized 
by wide-eyed, open-jawed looks and flailing arms, was particularly 
animated after one call. There also was a brief altercation behind 
the Blazers bench involving seldom-used and injured rookie guard 
Bonzi Wells and a Phoenix security guard.

	``Guys have to understand that you can't react to everything  
that happens,'' point guard Damon Stoudamire told The Oregonian. 
``It just magnifies everything. It just makes it worse. Wherever we 
play in the second round, it's going to be the same thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Portland's emotion and energy carried it through  
with a 24-10 run to end the game and the series. And that kind of 
intensity -- in measured doses -- will be needed if the Blazers are 
to advance to the Western Conference finals and beyond.

	``I didn't come here to get into the second round. I came here  
because I felt this team had the best opportunity to win a world 
championship,'' said Greg Anthony, who signed as a free agent 
following the lockout. ``So far, I feel real happy about my 
decision.''
