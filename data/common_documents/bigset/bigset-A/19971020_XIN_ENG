<HEADLINE> Conference on Egyptian-Sudanese Ties to be Convened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Arrangements are under way for
the convocation of a conference on Egyptian-Sudanese ties in Cairo
on December 17-19, the Middle East News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The conference, to be organized by the Wadi al Neel (Nile
Valley) Society, will discuss ways to improve future
Egyptian-Sudanese relations to serve the best interests of the
peoples of the Nile Valley.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian-Sudanese ties have been strained since Omar al-Bashir
took power as Sudanese president in 1989 and some Sudanese
opposition leaders frequent Cairo which hosts a large Sudanese
community. The two countries also have disputes on the quotas of
the Nile river water.
</P>
<P>
Sobhi Abdul Hakim, head of the Wadi al Neel Society from the
Egyptian side, said that the conference, the first of its kind,
will cover the relationship between the two countries, ways to
iron out all differences and promote bilateral ties, and the
problem in south Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Hakim said that invitations to take part in this event have
already been sent out to several Egyptian ministers and prominent
Egyptian and Sudanese figures as well as Sudanese expatriates.
</P>
<P>
Wadi al Neel Society, which was founded in 1996 to boost
relations between the peoples of the two countries, is co-chaired
by Hakim from Egypt and deputy leader of the Sudanese Unionist
party Ahmed al Sayed Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Egypt and Sudan worsened in 1995 when
Cairo accused Khartoum of supporting the attempt to assassinate
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Addis Ababa. Sudan has denied
any role in the attack.
</P>
<P>
A dispute over a desert triangle along their border since
Sudan's independence in 1956 has added to the tension.
</P>
<P>
Recently, both governments said they want to repair relations
with the other.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Consider Digital Technologies in Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The European recording
industry, represented by the International Federation of the
Phonographic Industry (IFPI), has lately called for copyright
legislation to take into account new digital technologies.
</P>
<P>
Industry representatives had a meeting recently with the
European Commissioner for the internal market, Mario Monti, whose
services are putting the final touches on a draft EU directive
aiming to harmonize copyright protection in the information
society.
</P>
<P>
They expressed their concerns at the meeting with whether the
directive, scheduled to be unveiled in November, will allow record
producers use of encryption technologies and give the industry
exclusive rights for the control of commercial uses of musical
works.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also were worried whether the directive
would remain a genuine "copyright directive" in the long run,
according to European Politics, a bi-weekly magazine published in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Three of the six major recording companies in the world are
European -- BMB, EMI Music and Polygram. The European recording
industry employs 300,000 people. It accounts for 60 percent of the
world market for retail sales of records, out of a world market
estimated to be worth 40 billion U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ross, Netanyahu Meet on Advancing Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu met here this afternoon with visiting
U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross to discuss ways to advance the
Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here this morning to begin a new bid to push
forward the peace process that was revived early this month after
a seven-month freeze as a result of the intense U.S. mediation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before their meeting, Ross said it was
important to "work intensively" to advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Top on the agenda of Ross' visit is to try to bridge the
differences between Israel and the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) over the PNA call for Israel's halt to settlement
activities and Israel's demand for tougher PNA fight against
Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu made it clear that only if the PNA takes real
actions to fight terror that the peace progress would move
forward.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Netanyahu held consulations separately with
Foreign Minister David Levy and Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai. Levy also met with heads of Israeli teams to the
joint Israeli-Palestinian Steering Committee in charge of the
peace negotiations to coordinate their positions.
</P>
<P>
Israel is insisting that the PNA should do more to fight
Islamic militant organizations and their infrastructure. But the
PNA is calling for a halt to Israel's settlement activities in
order to achieve progress in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Marwan Kanafani, spokesman for PNA President Yasser Arafat,
charged today the Israeli government for using the security issue
as a pretext to avoid implementing the signed agreements. He
described the current peace process as being in "a deepening and
widening impasse."
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan rejected
Kanafani's charges, saying that security is the foundation of
the peace process, without which the peace process can go
nowhere.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that we will be able to get some satisfaction now on
the Israeli demand, which is supported by the American demand,
that the Palestinian Authority crack down on terror
infrastructure, which for the time being we have seen very
little," he told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent actions taken by the PNA to shut down
several institutions run by the militant Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) which launched recent wave of suicide attacks in
Jerusalem, Bar-Illan dismissed them as only a show-off, saying
"it is hardly a war against terrorism."
</P>
<P>
He added that during Ross' visit, the two sides will discuss
the definition of the American proposal for a "time-out" of
Israeli settlement activities and the Israeli call for moving
forward to the final-status talks by bypassing the interim
stage.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to hold a meeting with Arafat late this
evening after meeting with Netanyahu. He is to attend the
ceremony held Monday in Tel Aviv by former Israeli prime
minister Shimon Peres to mark the opening of the Peres Center
for Peace aimed at promoting Middle East peace through mainly
economic projects.
</P>
<P>
A number of former world leaders and leading businessmen will
attend the ceremony, including former U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher who was the leading mediator in helping
seal the previous Israeli-Palestinian peace deals.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his meeting with Ross, Netanyahu met in his office
with Christopher to discuss the current situation of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, upon his arrival Saturday, said the
U.S. government is very concerned about the lack of progress in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said he and President Bill Clinton and incumbent Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright have been in constant contacts over
the issues concerning the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"I know President Clinton is deeply concerned about the peace
process here. He calls me to talk about it from time to time,"
he said upon his arrival. "And Secretary Albright and I are
regularly on the telephone on this subject."

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Malawi Seek to Consolidate Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks today with Malawian President Bakili Muluzi immediately
after the latter arrived here on a three-day state visit in a bid
to promote cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian delegation, including ministers of foreign
affairs, tourism, and public works, held talks with the Egyptian
side on the sidelines of Mubarak-Muluzi summit, that tackled
regional, African and international issues as well as means of
promoting bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, who visited the southern
African republic last August, told reporters after the talks that
the two sides exchanged views on building solid bilateral economic
relationship.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that preparations were under way for an agreement
on protecting investment and evading dual taxation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi was scheduled to meet with Egyptian Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali today with a
view of embarking on joint agricultural ventures, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian president would also examine with the Egyptian
side the prospects of cooperation in the fields of water
resources, health and housing, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that the Egyptian Federation of Industries and the
Malawian Federation of Chambers of Industry would sign their first
protocol of joint economic cooperation today.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Goes into Second Stage of Economic Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Georgian president Eduard
Shevardnadze announced on Sunday that Georgia is entering the
second stage of its economic reform, which will conclude by the
year 2000, the Interfax news service reported from Tbilisi,
Georgian capital.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an enlarged Cabinet meeting, Shevardnadze said the
purpose of the reform is to raise living standards, eradicating
poverty, reduce unemployment to a minimum and stimulate
investment.
</P>
<P>
To realize this task gross domestic product (GDP) per capital
must grow from 8 percent to 10 percent a year with the national
budget deficit to be under 3 percent of GDP, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The reform envisages ways and means to maintain the country's
food sufficiency, support and upgrade industries and speed up the
privatization of major businesses.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze noted the special attention in the guidelines is
paid to improving the country's balance of payment. The guidelines
provide for making exports grow 8-9 percent faster than imports,
boosting tax budget revenues by 15-16 percent against GDP, and
further improving financial and banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
The socially targeted reform envisages the creation of new
jobs and indexation of citizens' deposits and investments in
cooperative housing construction and other projects.
</P>
<P>
The reform also provides for fundamentally changing the system
of state power in Georgia, the Georgian president said.

<HEADLINE> FBI not to Include Philadephia's Crime Data </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The FBI, citing problems
with city police measurement of crime statistics, is deleting
numbers from Philadelphia for the last 18 months from its national
crime surveys.
</P>
<P>
The FBI decided to discard the statistics after meeting with
police officials, who have promised to submit corrected numbers to
the FBI's Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) program.
</P>
<P>
"We would suggest... that those numbers should not be relied
upon, and they know that," The Associated Press quoted Harlin
McEwan, an FBI specialist in crime reporting, as saying. "It was a
joint decision. Clearly, we aren't going to use numbers that
aren't accurate."
</P>
<P>
Police expect to give revised numbers to the FBI by next spring
-- in time for the release of national crime figures for 1997, but
too late for next month's release of data from the first half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The department's flawed counts were noticed in September, after
a hearing on policing methods convened four state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
At that hearing, Mayor Edward G. Rendell presented figures
showing that crime dropped in Philadelphia by 17 percent in the
first half of 1997, compared to the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Analysis of his numbers showed that police counting methods did
not conform to UCR guidelines. Instead of reporting crimes that
actually occurred in a given period, police were counting the
crimes as they logged them into their records.
</P>
<P>
A time lag developed because police were often behind in
processing reports. Crime reports often take months to process,
and about one in five crimes logged in a given year in
Philadelphia actually happened in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia has been counting crimes as they are logged for
about 30 years. This year is not the first time a city has been
pulled from the FBI's numbers.

MOSCOW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
met with visiting Canadian Premier Jean Chretian at the
president's country residence Rus on Sunday, the Russian mass
medium reported.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged view on the prospects for development
of Russian-Canadian cooperation in the economic and political
spheres as well as on the international scene.
</P>
<P>
Both Yeltsin and Chretian expressed the viewpoint that a new
substantial impetus should be given to the trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted Canadian Ambassador to Russia
Anne leacy as saying today that economic stability in Russia can
be seen from the fact that Russia has started repaying debts to
banks in line with the London agreement, and that the ruble's
exchange rate is stable.
</P>
<P>
According to the ambassador, Chretian will discuss with the
Russian officials the reform of the United Nations and Canada's
application for membership in the U.N. Security Council, of which
Russia is a permanent member.
</P>
<P>
Canada and Russia also plan to sign an agreement on cooperation
in the legal sphere, she said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Northern Iraqi Party Demands Pull-out of Rival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kurdistan Democratic Party
(KDP), a major northern Iraqi party, warned today that the
just-reached cease-fire in northern Iraq would be short-lived if
its rival forces do not withdraw from certain areas.
</P>
<P>
A KDP-controlled radio monitored here said that the KDP will
comply with the latest cease-fire only if the the Patriotic Union
of Kurdistan (PUK) forces get out of the positions captured over
the past several days.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Iranian PUK and KDP, allegedly backed by Ankara and
Baghdad, have been fighting each other for the control of
northern Iraq following the 1990 Gulf War. Their clashes
intensified since last week.
</P>
<P>
The KDP radio said that the PUK forces attacked the KDP
positions in Balek region Saturday. The PUK, however, denied the
charges, saying they had stopped offensive even before the start
of the Friday cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire was reached between the two warring parties
after Turkey, the United States and Britain, three sponsors of the
Ankara peace process, issued a statement calling for immediate
halt of their fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara process, designed to end the armed conflicts in
northern Iraq, was launched in the Turkish capital since early
last year with three rounds of talks being held so far.
</P>
<P>
In the Friday statement, Turkey, the United States and Britain
had accused the PUK of provoking the latest clashes with the KDP.

<HEADLINE> GCC Fails to Agree on Single Customs Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states have failed again to agree on a unified tariff,
forcing them to delay the creation of a common market and the
signing of a free trade pact with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Though they have classified some 95 percent of over 1,200
imported products to be taxed so far, the classification of the
remaining vital ones such as steel and petrochemicals was
hampered, the United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s Wam news agency
reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that during a one-day meeting in Doha, Qatar Saturday,
the GCC foreign ministers decided to defer the matter until a
further study by the GCC secretariat in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia next
year.
</P>
<P>
As part of long-standing plans to create a common Gulf market,
the customs project has eluded the GCC states for more than a
decade due to differences on the level of the tariff.
</P>
<P>
It has also prevent the Gulf countries from inking a free
trade pact with the EU, the GCC's main trade partner who
considers the single GCC tariff as a prerequisite for the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Custom duties in the members countries of the GCC, which groups
the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Oman, are widely
diversified, ranging from the lowest 4 percent to the highest
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich UAE imposes the lowest tariff in the 16-year-old
Gulf alliance although it has quadrupled duties on most imported
goods to 4 percent in the past years.
</P>
<P>
Bahrain, which has little crude reserves, levies 20 percent on
the bulk of imports as its income heavily relies on taxes.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia also has a 20 percent duty on selective items to
protect its burgeoning national industries such as petrochemicals
and steel casting.

<HEADLINE> Sassou's Militia Pursues Defeated Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Forces loyal to Congo's rebel
leader Denis Sassou Nguesso are continuing to pursue government
troops into the bush surrounding the capital, which fell to the
rebels last week, said a report reaching here from Brazzabville
today.
</P>
<P>
About 100 of President Pascal Lissouba's defeated fighters had
fled to Matoumbou, which is about 70 km (45 miles) west of the
capital Brazzaville, said Willy Matsanga, Commander of Sassou's
cobra militia.
</P>
<P>
According to Matsanga, 30 of Lissouba's troops were killed in
fighting at Matoumbou on Saturday while the remaining 70 were
scattered into the bush. The cobras lost three dead, he said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted western diplomats in Kinshasa, capital of
neighbouring Democratic Republic of the Congo, as saying that
Lissouba himself had left his hideout in south Congo.
</P>
<P>
The western diplomats said it was unclear where Lissouba had
gone from his southern stronghold of Dolisie where he had been
holed up since his forces were routed in Brazzaville last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But they sA3z$ft probably crossed into Angolan territory
controlled by the former rebel group, UNITA, whose fighters are
believed to have helped Lissouba in a four-month civil war
pitting his forces against Sassou's cobra militia.
</P>
<P>
The government army and allied militia were driven from
Brazzaville on Tuesday after a week-long onslaught by the cobras
who fought a four-month war with Lissouba troops.
</P>
<P>
Routed government soldiers and militia have fled both into the
neighbouring Congo (K), and into areas surrounding Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to pursue them till the last," Matsanga
said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted neighbouring Kinshasa government officials
as reporting that many of Lissouba's troops had fled across the
River Congo which divides the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Around one thousand crossed down river from Brazzaville into
Bas-Zaire province. They are being disarmed," a senior government
source said in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The official said other defeated troops had slipped into
civilian dress and were hiding among thousands of other Congolese
who have sought refuge in Kinshasa since the civil war broke out
in Brazzaville in june.
</P>
<P>
Matsanga said lissouba's routed troops had lost all of their
heavy weapons and would be controlled altogether within three or
four days.

Brazzaville on Tuesday after a week-long onslaught by the cobras
who fought a four-month war with Lissouba troops.
</P>
<P>
Routed government soldiers and militia have fled both into the
neighbouring Congo (K), and into areas surrounding Brazzaville.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to pursue them till the last," Matsanga
said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted neighbouring Kinshasa government officials
as reporting that many of Lissouba's troops had fled across the
River Congo which divides the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Around one thousand crossed down river from Brazzaville into
Bas-Zaire province. They are being disarmed," a senior government
source said in Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The official said other defeated troops had slipped into
civilian dress and were hiding among thousands of other Congolese
who have sought refuge in Kinshasa since the civil war broke out
in Brazzaville in june.
</P>
<P>
Matsanga said lissouba's routed troops had lost all of their
heavy weapons and would be controlled altogether within three or
four days.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 19 (Xinhua) --The Tanzanian government
and air company officials have shown interest in Chinese-made
aircraft which made a stopover here today for display.
</P>
<P>
Commenting a Y7H-500 cargo aircraft and a K-8 trainer aircraft
which visited Dar es Salaam as one leg of an air show in Africa,
Vincent F. Mrisho, Principal Secretary of the Tanzanian Ministry
of Defense, said the Chinese-made planes present good performance
and reasonable prices suited to the needs of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Mrisho, after taking a careful look of the aircraft, told the
Chinese ambassador Zhang Hongxi who also attended the exhibition
that Tanzania hopes to strengthen cooperation with China in the
aviation field.
</P>
<P>
Two Chinese-made aircraft, which have stayed at the Dar es
Salaam airport for nearly two hours, also aroused the interest of
officials from Air Tanzania and Zanzibar's transportation
departments.
</P>
<P>
The two aircraft, together with a Y7-100 passenger plane which
stays in Nairobi at present, have performed stunt flying or
staged exhibitions in Egypt, Zimbabwe, Zambia, Mozambique since
September 15. The air show will continue to be held in Kenya,
Ethiopia and other African countries till the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
"It has been China's largest air show abroad," said An
Xiaohang, Vice-Director of the Department of Flight Test under
the Aviation Industries of China.
</P>
<P>
The trip, mainly sponsored by China National Aero-technology
Import and Export Corporation (CATIC) to promote sales, is
scheduled to travel some 13,000 kilometers in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It has been uneasy for aircraft to make long-distance flight
in Africa, as we have to overcome the difficulties of cloudiness,
rains, freeze and unstable air currents," said He Fukang,
Vice-President of China Nanchang Aircraft Manufacturing Company.
</P>
<P>
Despite the difficulties, the pilot of the K-8 trainer
aircraft, Hu Guanghuai, said he has been very successful in the
stunts flying.
</P>
<P>
Si Yanxuan, chief representative of CATIC Tanzania office,
said the air show may help Africans shake off the outmoded
conception that China can only make bicycles.
</P>
<P>
"It will be conducive to us to explore the African aircraft
market," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong SAR Chief to Renew Trade Ties with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee-Hwa, the chief
executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(HKSAR), arrived here today on a trip aimed at renewing trade ties
with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
During his brief stay, Tung is scheduled to brief senior
officials of the European Commission, the executive body of the
15-nation union, the European Parliament and Belgium about the
smooth transition that demonstrates Hong Kong people's pride in
returning to China and their confidence in "Hong Kong people
administering Hong Kong" under the "one country, two systems"
principle.
</P>
<P>
It is the first official visit by Tung after he started serving
as the HKSAR chief. Tung is to meet European Commission President
Jacques Santer, Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan, European
Parliament Vice-President David Martin and Belgian Prime Minister
Jean-Luc Dehaene.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR chief executive is also to attend the first plenary
session of the European Union/Hong Kong and Hong Kong/European
Union business cooperation committees.
</P>
<P>
Accompanying Tung on his trip that also took him to Malaysia,
Singapore, the United States and Japan, is the HKSAR trade and
industry secretary.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is not only a major trading partner of the European
Communities. European economic activities in Hong Kong are also
considerable. Of the 2,068 companies which have established
regional offices in Hong Kong, 597 (or 29 percent) have EU-based
parent companies.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume totaled 21.358 billion ECUs in 1995, with the EU
enjoying a surplus of 8.008 billion ECUs.
</P>
<P>
The HKSAR chief is scheduled to leave Brussels for London early
on Tuesday before winding up his six-nation tour on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cameroon's Biya Takes 60 Percent of Votes in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, October 19 (Xinhua) - Cameroon's imcubent President
Paul Biya had taken 60 percent of the votes cast in last week's
presidential elections, with 83 percent of constituencies
counted, Radio Cameroon reported today.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting from last Sunday's poll had been completed in 48
of the 58 constituencies in the country, it said.
</P>
<P>
But the 10 constituencies where ballots had yet to be
counted were mainly in the remote north and east of the country,
where the opposition is strong, said the radio.
</P>
<P>
Officials said it could take up to two weeks for final
results to be announced, but under the electoral law a winner
must be proclaimed by October 27.
</P>
<P>
Biya, in power since 1992, is widely expected to win
re-election against seven minor opponents.
</P>
<P>
"The turnout in the october 12 presidential elections was 80.58
percent nationwide," Minister of State in charge of Territorial
Administration Gilbert Andze Tsoungui told a news conference. He
said turnout ranged from 84 percent in rural areas to 76 percent
in towns.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition which refused to put up candidates
against Biya in the elections and urged
voters to stay at home has accused the Biya administration of
massaging the figures.
</P>
<P>
As most of the foreign organisations that usually monitor
elections in Africa stayed away from the poll, there was no
independent confirmation of the figures.
</P>
<P>
The election passed off peacefully despite the boycott which
had raised fears of violence in the country, a volatile mix of
francophone and English-speaking regions.
</P>
<P>
Many cameroonians say they still fear a flareup of unrest if
the final poll and turnout figures are seen by the opposition as
a blatant falsehood.
</P>
<P>
The opposition accused the government which organises
elections through the Interior Ministry of rigging the voter
registration. Only about three million from a population of 14
million were registereed to vote, down from six million in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It also accused Biya of rigging all elections since the
advent of multi-party politics in the early 1990s and declared
an "active boycott" after the president refused to install an
independent elections authority.
</P>
<P>
Biya, 64, took over from independence President Ahmadou Ahidjo
in 1982. A francophone, he won 1984 and 1988 elections as sole
candidate. He narrowly beat chief opposition leader John Fru Ndi,
an anglophone, in multi-party elections in 1992.

GENEVA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Challenge to the international
community in human rights is greater than ever although human
rights are receiving greater international recognition, said
Mary Robinson, United Nations high commissioner for human rights,
here today.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 61st session of the Committee on Human Rights,
Robinson stressed that what has been achieved in human rights
should not "obscure the underlying reality of massive and
widespread violations of human rights and the intense human
suffering which marks our era."
</P>
<P>
The new high commissioner repeated her vow to take a balanced
and broad approach which would emphasize civil and political
rights, economic, social and cultural rights, and the right to
development as well as women's and children's rights.
</P>
<P>
She also told the meeting that UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
was deeply and personally interested in human rights, and attached
great importance to them in the context of his overall
responsibilities in promoting peace and security.
</P>
<P>
During the week-long meeting, the 18-member panel of experts

<HEADLINE> Manila to Continue Peace Talks With Rebels: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos said today
that the Philippine government will continue its ongoing peace
talks with the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
operating in southern Mindanao island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Davao, a city in western Mindanao,
Ramos said the peace process in Mindanao is a continuing effort
leading to development in the war-battered region.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' statement came days after the MILF threatened to suspend
its peace talks with the government if the government continues to
mass troops near its headquarters, Camp Abubakar, in central
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The Army's Sixth Infantry Division reportedly augmented its
forces in the areas near the MILF's headquarters in the wake of a
suicide attack on the division's headquarters, Camp Siongco, in
Maguindanao province, on October 14.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, two suspected Muslim extremists, one
Pakistani and one Saudi Arabian, entered the camp, and shot dead
three soldiers before they themselves were killed. The MILF has
strongly denied involvement in the attack.
</P>
<P>
Local television reports said today the MILF has put its
fighters on full alert against any likely offensive by the
government troops.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway faction of the larger Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF), is currently the largest anti-government
force in the country, with an estimated membership of 12,000.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the extremist Abu Sayyaf group are the two
remaining Muslim rebel forces still fighting the government
troops.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF signed a comprehensive peace agreement with the
government in September 1996.

<HEADLINE> More Cities to Issue Weekly Air Quality Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-one additional Chinese
cities will issue weekly air quality reports by the end of 1997,
bringing the total to 35 cities, according to the State Bureau of
Environmental Protection (SBEP).
</P>
<P>
The cities will include Hohhot, Harbin and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen cities started issuing weekly media reports in May to
inform the public about air pollution levels and atmospheric
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The reports not only help local governments adopt strong
measures to control air pollution, but also enhance environmental
awareness and enable the general public to supervise related
government efforts," according to a senior official from the SBEP.
</P>
<P>
By June 1998, 46 Chinese cities, including all municipalities,
provincial capitals, economic zones, open coastal cities and
famous tourism cities, will issue weekly reports.
</P>
<P>
In addition, various key cities will issue daily air quality
reports beginning in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Attend MENA Conference, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan said today it will attend
the fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA) economic
conference scheduled for next month in Doha, capital of Qatar,
despite boycott by some Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordan will send a high-level delegation to the annual
conference and the team will be named within days, Jordanian
Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez Tarawneh was quoted in Radio
Jordan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon, Syria, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as
well as the Palestinian National Authority have threatened to
boycott the conference, which will be attended by Israel, in
protest against Israel's hard-line policy which caused the
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Other Arab countries adopt a wait-and-see stance and condition
their attendance on improvement of Israel's policy.
</P>
<P>
The Doha gathering is not an Israeli conference and Israel
will attend it just like any other countries, said Tarawneh.
</P>
<P>
Jordan considers it as an international forum which will
greatly benefit all the participants, especially those from the
private sector, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Qatar has invited 92 countries and organizations to the
November 16 to 18 conference and expects some 2,500 foreign
participants.
</P>
<P>
The conference is the fourth after those held in Casablanca,
Amman and Cairo. It will be held under the title of creating a new
partnership of trade and economic development between the public
and private sectors beyond the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
While preparations for the Doha meeting are going on, the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations have been restarted after
eight months' deadlock.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing and Hong Kong are
economically complimentary and should strengthen mutually
beneficial economic cooperation, according to Vice-Premier Qian
Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark today during an address at a seminar
scheduled to run for the next two days.
</P>
<P>
Qian noted the broad prospects for cooperation between China's
interior area and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"Increasing contacts and accelerating the process of mutual
development will be extremely significant for promoting the
interior Area's reform and opening efforts...and to Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability," said Qian.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Mayor Jia Qinglin pledged to make greater efforts to
improve his city's legal system and increase efficiency for the
benefit of Hong Kong investors.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of August show that Beijing had
approved the establishment of 5,266 Hong Kong-funded
enterprises. Hong Kong investments of 10.56 billion US dollars
accounts for 40 percent of the city's total overseas investments.

<HEADLINE> Experts Calls for Curtailed Use of Antimicrobials in Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Health experts have warned that
excessive use of antimicrobials, especially as growth promoters in
animals destined for human consumption, presents a growing risk to
human health and should be reduced.
</P>
<P>
Antimicrobials are vital medicines to treat human infections
but their effectiveness is threatened by overuse and in
appropriate use which contribute to the growing resistance of
bacteria, according to a press release issued here today by the
Geneva-based World Health Organization (WHO).
</P>
<P>
Around 70 health experts from the fields of both human and
animal health met on October 13-17 in Berlin, Germany, at the
Collaborating Center for Research and Training in Food Hygiene and
Zoonoses co-sponsored by WHO and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
Public health consequences from the excessive use of
antimicrobials in livestock production include the emergence of
resistant microbes which can then be transferred to humans through
the food chain, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Resistant strains of four bacteria that cause disease in humans
have been transmitted from animals to humans and shown to have
consequences from human health. They are Salmonella,
Campylobacter, Enterococci, and E. coli.
</P>
<P>
"Although only a small proportion of infected people require
antibiotic treatment, in these patients the options are severely
limited by resistance," the experts concluded. Direct evidence
that antibiotic use in food-producing animals results in resistant
salmonella infections in humans was presented at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Healthy practices in animal husbandry reduce the need for
antibiotics, the experts stressed, and antibiotics should never be
used as a substitute for inadequate hygiene.
</P>
<P>
A decrease in use of antibiotics as growth promoters does not
need to entail reduced productivity in animals and thereby
economic losses to the food producer nor increased prices for
consumer, the experts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It will not necessarily result in the increased use of other
drugs in the place of antibiotics, they said. Research on
alternative methods to improve animal growth and feed efficiency
was recommended.
</P>
<P>
To address the potential medical problems related to the use of
fluoroquinolones in food animals, WHO will host a meeting in
February at its Regional Office for the Americas (PAHO) in
Washington, USA, on this topic.

Afghan Islamic Taliban militia and their rivals near Kunduz,
around 280 km north of the Afghan capital of Kabul, Afghan sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban fighters captured at least nine posts from the
opposition troops in the Bangi area close to Kunduz city after
"successful operations" mounted on Sunday, the sources in
Peshawar, northwestern Pakistan, quoted a Taliban spokesman as
saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the anti-Taliban northern alliance immediately refuted
the Taliban's claim, saying the territory lost to the militia was
recaptured in a counter attack later in the day, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
A large Taliban force had retreated to Kunduz after setbacks in
their recent attempt to seize the opposition stronghold of
Mazar-e-Sharif, 300 km north of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The anti-Taliban alliance consists of forces led by
ethnic-Uzbek warlord Abdul Malik, Afghanistan's former military
chief Ahmad Masood and the Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat.
</P>
<P>
The alliance has been battling the hard-line Taliban militia in
northern, central and western Afghanistan since the Taliban seized
the capital of Kabul last September.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, who now control about two-thirds of the Afghan
territory, have vowed to impose a strict Islamic rule in the
war-torn country.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Arab
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) has denied the blame of
industrialized nations' media on oil and gas for environment
problems around the globe.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly bulletin issued today, the Kuwait-based OAPEC
criticized the western media for its stress on the role of oil and

revenues of oil and gas, to coordinate stands to defend their
interests as developing states.

Libya, Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates, turned
out an average of 17.2 million barrels of crude oil each day in
1996, accounting for 26 percent of the world production. Its oil
exports amounted to 33 percent of the world total in 1994.

The Arab organization said that the world is suffering from
other environmental problems of water shortages, lack of sewage
systems, desertification and sea pollution.

of the population of the developing countries had no access to
safe water while some 2.8 billion people had no sewage systems.

<HEADLINE> EU Executives, Hong Kong Leader Discuss Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The chief executives of the
European Commission today exchanged views with their equivalent
from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China
on how to boost trade ties.
</P>
<P>
During separate meetings with HKSAR Chief Executive Tung
Chee-Hwa, EC President Jacques Santer and Vice-President Sir Leon
Brittan talked about such issues as customs cooperation and
visa-free access.
</P>
<P>
Brittan told a press briefing afterwards that it was no
coincidence that Tung met the European Commission ahead of meeting
the European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
The commission is the executive body of the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
The consolidation of concrete EU-Hong Kong relations and the
links through the business community are appropriate, said the EC
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed the possibility of an agreement on customs
cooperation between Hong Kong and the European Union," Brittan
said, "And in the course of discussion, we established a
foundation for what I believe can be rapid progress in detailed
negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The EC vice-president believed that it is important to reach
agreements of this kind in that they will be beneficial to both
Hong Kong and the EU and they will demonstrate the exercise by
Hong Kong of the competence granted to it by the Sino-British
Joint Declaration and the Hong Kong Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore possible to tell everybody that the system
under which the policy of one country, two systems is firmly in
place that has a much greater conviction of Hong Kong actually
entering into and concluding agreements."
</P>
<P>
Brittan and Tung also discussed Hong Kong's role in the World
Trade Organization and Hong Kong's interest in the successful
negotiation of China's accession into the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"We have a common interest," said Brittan who has just returned
from a China trip during which he discussed accession issues with
Chinese officials.

matters relating to customs duties, levies, duties and charges
imposed in connection with imports and exports, a statement by the
Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI)

</P>
<P>
In addition, the two countries discussed issues related to APEC
including preparations for the next APEC meeting in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Australia was the tenth largest source of foreign
direct investment (FDI) for Malaysia and 17 projects were approved

<HEADLINE> Kids in Shanghai Dreams of Stardom in Swimming Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- With eyebrows knotted on his
genius face, an eight-year-old kid waited anxiously outside for a
ticket to the last-day swimming competition at the Eighth National
Games Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
For almost one hour, his worker father fished out cashes in
hand for any extra ticket from the passers-by, but all his efforts
became vain in return, and Chen Jianing was denied his simple
request.
</P>
<P>
"He is a second-grader in primary school and a crazy fan for
swimming," said the father.
</P>
<P>
"He has cried for a look at the competitions and I had no way
but to meet his needs as I led him to the swimming pool when he
was still too young to remember anything."
</P>
<P>
Chen felt lonely at the denial of his request, but he was not
alone as many a kids were prevented from sitting in the stands of
the swimming stadium as they arrived too late for any tickets
left.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jiayin, 12, cycled 40 minutes to the pool with his mother
from a distant northern district, but her enthusiasm evolved into
deep sadness as all the tickets were sold out days ago.
</P>
<P>
"Jumping to the pool at an age of six, he loves swimming to
death," said the saddened mother, "we lived far away from here and
we would not come over for a sports meet if it was not an
off-day."
</P>
<P>
The mother's words moved the guard but he dared not to let them
in for security reason as the stadium was already in full capacity
these days.
</P>
<P>
Zou, a fifth-grader in a primary school, was too sad to utter a
word with tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
"We hope every fan can have the chance to watch the top-notch
competition. But we have no choice, there are too many people and
most of them are children," he explained.
</P>
<P>
During the first few days, the kids have been granted their
freedom to get into the stadium, but the decision had to be
scrapped one day when a boy child cried long enough before he was
finally led to his father who failed to secure a ticket for
himself, the guard explained.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the majority of the children were lucky enough to watch
their swimming idols together with their parents, and they cheered
in high pitch just like celebrating a spring festival.
</P>
<P>
Eight-year-old Qiu Junhuang watched the swimming competitions
twice during the fortnight Games, and the girl showed no shyness
in revealing her secret in gigles.
</P>
<P>
"I like Wang Wei most, and I want to be a second Le Jingyi in
the future."
</P>
<P>
Wang Wei bagged five gold medals for Shanghai in the men's
events while Le Jingyi, world record holder in 50m and 100m
freestyles, remains the best local woman swimmer although she won
only one single title in the Games.
</P>
<P>
But Wang and Le are only two of the star-studded Shanghai
swimming team that has won the lion's share of 15 out of 32 golds
at stake.
</P>
<P>
As more kids are embedding their swimming dreams, including
Chen Jianing and Zou Jiayin, Shanghai is tipped to become the
cradle for future world and Olympic swimming champions in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Helps Indigenous People Enter Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Key players in the tourism
industry has put together an initial 200 million Zimbabwe Dollars
(16 million U.S. Dollars) revolving fund to help indigenous
people enter the fast expanding and lucrative tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
This will give the Zimbabwe's indigenization program a
much-needed boost by the government, through the Zimbabwe Tourism
Authority (ZTA).
</P>
<P>
ZTA Chairman Isdore Gwashure said at the weekend the revolving
fund is expected to be launched before the end of this year,
bringing hope to many indigenous people who have long been
hampered from entering the tourism industry by lack of capital.
</P>
<P>
''The 200 million will be the initial capital base and we hope
that with time, the fund will grow and become self-sustaining,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in tourism in Zimbabwe has shown significant growth
over the past few years and indications are that there is even
greater potential for the future.
</P>
<P>
A few indigenous buziness people have made inroads into the
sector but mainly as tour operators and travel agents.
</P>
<P>
Gwashure is also chief executive of the country's largest
hotel chain group, Zimbabwe Sun Hotels, which recently announced
a 1.2 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (96 million US Dollars) investment
package that will include joint ventures with indigenous people
in the hotel, safari and resort divisions.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Zimbabwe iIvestment Center show that over
480 million Zimbabwe Dollars (38.4 million US Dollars) were
invested in the local tourism industry during the first half of
this year in 24 projects which created nearly 900 new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Forecasts from the ZTA indicate that the number of visitors to
Zimbabwe is likely to increase by about 16.9 percent from 1.6
million last year to 1.9 million visitors this year.
</P>
<P>
Tourism receipts from this traffic were expected to reach 3.4
billion Zimbabwe Dollars or 270 million US Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't to Restore People's Confidence in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said here today that the government is determined to restore the
people's confidence in the rupiah (the national currency).
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks when meeting with Italian Prime
Minister Romano Prodi who arrived here today on a two-day official
visit to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia is facing a monetary crisis, but its economic
foundation is strong enough to face such a turmoil," Minister/
State Secretary Moerdiono quoted the president as saying at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two leaders discussed bilateral
relations, particularly economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
"President Soeharto explained the monetary upheaval (to the
guest). He said the important thing is the effort to restore (the
people's) confidence in the rupiah," said Moerdiono.
</P>
<P>
The value of Indonesia's rupiah has dropped by about 50 percent
against the US dollar since the beginning of this year, making the
currency the worst hit in the monetary crisis in Southeast Asian
nations.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister and his entourage will leave for the
Philippines on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Wholesale Drops Slightly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The wholesale trade in Canada
fell 0.6 percent to 23.9 billion Canadian dollars (17.2 billion
U.S. dollars) in August, Statistics Canada said today.
</P>
<P>
Wholesales were down in six of the 11 trade groups, which
accounted for 61 percent of total sales, the statistics agency
said.
</P>
<P>
Wholesales of industries directly linked to the housing sector
reported the largest declines in the month, which could be
partially related to the slowdown of the residential building.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, wholesalers of motor vehicles and parts
continued to rise, which reflects a 2.8 percent rise in the sale
of new motor.
</P>
<P>
In August, inventories kept by Canadian wholesalers increased
0.7 percent to 34.4 billion Canadian dollars (24.7 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
After reaching a historic low of 1.40 in May this year, the
inventories-to-sales ratio has been climbing, to 1.42 in June and
July and 1.44 in August.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990-1991 recession, wholesalers have kept on average
about six weeks of supply, which is the equivalent of a 1.50
ratio, the agency said.

<HEADLINE> Massive Deforestation Blamed in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is losing an estimated
70,000 hectares of forest each year to agricultural activities
and the situation is likely to worsen because of increased land
hunger, ''the herald'' reported today.
</P>
<P>
Enos Shumba, manager of the Forestry Commission's Research and
Development Division, said at the weekend the rate of
deforestation was higher than the rate at which new forests were
being established.
</P>
<P>
He said, "there are several afforestation programs going on in
the country but poverty in our rural areas continues to force
people to cut down trees for fuel and agricultural purposes.''
</P>
<P>
Each rural household is estimated to use three tons of
firewood a year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides losing trees to agriculture and fuel, he reviewed that
there had been a marked increase in the number of people selling
wood carvings along the roads.
</P>
<P>
Shumba noted that the forestry commission recently introduced
a number of programs aimed at helping communities protect and
manage their own forests.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the afforestation programs have been highly
successful in some areas but there was still need for aggressive
educational campaigns.

<HEADLINE> US Seeks Mutually Beneficial Relations with Pakistan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Visiting US Under Secretary
of State Thomas Pickering said here today his country seeks to
establish mutually beneficial relations with Pakistan as part of
the renewed focus on South Asia policy of the US government.
</P>
<P>
Pickering, who is on his three-day visit to Pakistan, said this
when holding talks with Pakistani Foreign Secretary Shamshad
Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the meeting, Pickering and
Shamshad exchanged views on wide-ranging regional and
international issues including Kashmir and Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
During the two-and-a-half hour meeting, the two sides stressed
that Pakistan-US relations should move away from the single item
agenda of the past and that the two countries should broaden and
deepen their cooperation in different areas.
</P>
<P>
Pickering said the importance that the US attached to the
region was evident from the number of high-level visits which will
lead to that of President Bill Clinton early next year.
</P>
<P>
He laid particular emphasis on economic collaboration between
the United States and Pakistan and welcomed the economic reforms
launched by the Pakistani government led by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Shamshad told Pickering that Pakistan seeks durable peace and
stability in South Asia and briefed him on the status of the
Pakistani-Indian dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The two officials also reviewed the situation in Afghanistan
and agreed that there was an urgent need to bring durable peace to
Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Accepts EU Proposal on Code of Conduct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today accepted a proposal
put forward by European Union (EU) peace envoy Miguel Moratinos
that Israel and the PNA adopt a code of conduct to restore
confidence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat agreed to the proposal during his meeting in the West
Bank city of Ramallah with Moratinos, who is working to advance
the just-renewed Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos described the code of conduct as a framework for the
final-status talks. The code calls for safeguarding all that has
been achieved in the peace process and for introducing
confidence-building measures to bolster the fight against
terrorism and refrain from activities harmful to progress.
</P>
<P>
The code demands the establishment of a permanent security
committee which will consist of Israelis and Palestinians and
could include EU and United States representatives if Israel
and the PNA agreed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the Arafat-Moratinos meeting, Arafat's adviser
Nabil Abu Rudeinah said that the PNA now is waiting for the
Israeli government's response to the EU proposal.
</P>
<P>
The Moratinos' proposal, which was approved by EU foreign
ministers early this month, even won support of Farouk Kadoumy,
head of the Political Department of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), who opposes the Oslo accords.
</P>
<P>
In late September, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy spoke
favorably about the proposed code of conduct. Levy, who is in
charge of negotiations with the PNA, strongly supports the
continuation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy will travel to Washington later this month to continue the
ongoing negotiations conducted by nine joint committees on
issues, including the opening of safe passages between Gaza Strip
and West Bank, opening of Gaza airport and seaport, and release of
Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Palestinian peace talks has resumed since October
7 after a seven-month deadlock caused by Israel's building of a
settlement in the disputed East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the peace process could not advance if the
mutual trust and confidence, which were destroyed since the
hardline Likud government took power in Israel in June last year,
will not be restored.

<HEADLINE> pSteps to Raise Farm Output in Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea's farm ministry
would provide farmers with irrigation schemes, fertilizers and
seeds with good yield and resistance to drought and diseases to
raise agricultural production of the country.
</P>
<P>
The remarks of Eritrean Minister of Agriculture Arefaine Berhe
were carried in the latest issue of weekly English newspaper
''Eritrean Profile'' reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting recently in Asmara, the minister said,
during the period 1992-1996, a total of 97 dams, and several
micro-dams, terracing, retaining walls, water holes, arterial
roads have been completed and 60 million tree seedlings planted.
</P>
<P>
''Although a lot was done to reactivate agriculture in the
country, result has not been very satisfactory,'' the minister
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that agricultural output was only 92,000 tons in
1996, compared to 130,000 tons in 1995 and 260,000 tons in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the main reason, apart from drought, is that
while 80 percent of people are peasants, they are at present
using 10 percent of the arable land which covers 65 percent of
eritrea's land surface.
</P>
<P>
''Hence, the expansion of agirculture is imperative,'' he
noted.
</P>
<P>
On the decrease of agricultural production, the minister said
the main problem is that a farming system in tune with the
peculiar rainfall condition of the country has not yet been
introduced.
</P>
<P>
He told his audience that his ministry is ready with programs
that will focus on the practice of soil and water conservation on
individual farmlands.
</P>
<P>
He added that ''if every farmer learns to conserve every drop
of rain that falls on its field, no one will feel threatened in
the event that the rains skip a week or two.''

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Hezbollah Denies Military Support From Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Hezbollah Secretary-
General Hassan Nasrullah today denied any military assistance from
Iran.
</P>
<P>
Nasrullah said in a press conference here this afternoon that
Iran offers his organization with only political and humanitarian
support.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question, Hassan said "We are only using guerrilla-
type weapons in the struggle against Israelis."
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to get weapons from Iran or Syria because
Lebanon has fought 20 years of war and weapons are there," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Some Middle East strategists believe that Iran used to offer
100 million U.S. dollars worth of military supplies to Hezbollah
annually. But it has reduced to one third because of economic
hardship at home.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a guerrilla
war in south Lebanon to oust Israeli troops from the
1,100-square-kilometer security zone set up by Israel in 1985 to
prevent cross-border attack.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah secretary-general has been in Iran for about 10
days to seek political and military support, well-informed sources
said.
</P>
<P>
He was received by Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei,
President Mohammad Khatami, former president Hashemi Rafsanjani
and Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Nasrullah admitted that Iran helps Hezbollah politically and
financially, adding that Iran is helping them establish hospitals
and implement agricultural and reconstruction projects.
</P>
<P>
"That is not something secret. The Iranian government has
branches in South Lebanon. Anybody can see these signs there," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that the resistance movement of the Lebanese combatants against the
Israeli regime will continue unabated and
the Middle East peace process has reached deadlock.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Parliament Calls for Foreign Aid to Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's parliamentary
chief today made a formal appeal for international financial aid
to help cover the cost of the country's general elections.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim, chairman of the National Assembly of Cambodia, called
for "friendly nations" to provide "generous financial support"
needed for the elections currently scheduled for May 1998.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was contained in a statement released here on behalf
of the national legislature, which entered its second week of
debate today in preparing to consider the electoral law.
</P>
<P>
The proposed law, Chea Sim said, is expected to pass the
legislature soon and will make it clear that Cambodia's national
sovereignty has to be preserved in the election process.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign observers are welcome to monitor the
elections, with the United Nations special representative to
Cambodia working as a coordinator among them, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sim's statement, on the parliament's behalf, came at a
time amid reports that some foreign countries, or organizations,
had attached conditions to assisting the elections.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly asked the Cambodian government to allow the
safe return of ex-First Prime Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh
and his supporters for joining the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The prince was ousted by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen in July
on a number of allegations, including negotiating with the
outlawed Khmer Rouge guerrilla faction.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian officials acknowledged that the general elections
would cost at least 21 million U.S. dollars, but the government
could afford only 30-40 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The 60-70 percent gap left, the officials said, could only be
filled with external financing.
</P>
<P>
With the much needed international assistance yet to be
secured, analysts here are uncertain whether the elections could
proceed as scheduled.

</P>
<P>
China invested 908.2 billion yuan in fixed assets during the

</P>
<P>
Chinese consumers now have a wider range of choices thanks to
amply market supplies, said Qiu.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales of consumer goods for the Jan.-Sept. period grew
by some 10 percent to slightly under 1,915.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Qiu noted that sales in the urban market grew faster than sales
in the rural market.

Lingering problems affecting the Chinese economy, including the
low level efficiency of the industrial sector, the increasing debt
of state-owned enterprises and rising unemployment, are far
from being completely solved, said Qiu.
</P>
<P>
The country must adhere to a macro-control policy based on
"appropriately tight" financial management over the coming months,
Qiu said, adding that China should accelerate enterprise reform,
while at the same time substantially improving the quality of
economic operations.

<HEADLINE> Experts Seek to Beef up Africa's Peace Effort </HEADLINE>

<P>
HARARE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- African military experts began
meeting in Harare today to enhance the organization of African
Unity's (OAU) peace-keeping capacity in the light of continuing
conflicts in some parts of the continent.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, preceding this weekend's OAU chiefs of defense
staff conference, would make recommendations for the
establishment of a contingency force that would react to
peace-keeping needs.
</P>
<P>
The OAU acting director of the political department Sam Ibok
told a news conference that the force would operate within
various national establishments.
</P>
<P>
"We are not coming up with a pan-African force, but we want an
establishment that will have a standardized training of
peace-keeping forces in the different countries,'' said Ibok.
</P>
<P>
he pointed our that a problem in conflict prevention and
management in Africa was the accountability of the continent's
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is how to hold our leaders responsible and
accountable to the declarations and conventions that are
signed,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
The more active role which the OAU was seeking in
peace-keeping would not crowd out the united nations, which Ibok
said still remained the custodian of peace around the world.
</P>
<P>
The three-day experts meeting will focus on doctrine,
training, command, communications, logistics and funding.
</P>
<P>
"We, at the OAU, have now come to the conclusion that it is
possible for Africans to act, and act decisively to avert
catastrophe on the continent, if only we could muster the
necessary political will,'' Ibok told the opening session of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Trouble spots in Africa include Burundi, the two Congos,
Sierra Leone and the Comoros, he said.

BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China's gross domestic product
(GDP) for the first three quarters of 1997 surpassed 5,115.2 billion
yuan (616.29 billion US dollars), up nine percent on the previous
year's period in terms of constant prices, according to the State
Statistical Bureau (SSB) today.
</P>
<P>
SSB Spokesman Qiu Xiaohua told reporters attending the press
conference that sound growth indicates full realization of the
central government's macro-control targets for the year, and
provides a solid foundation for an economic upsurge in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that the total output for this year's early
rice hit 45.78 million tons, up 4.5 percent on the 1996 harvest.
</P>
<P>
Qiu attributed the achievements to the efforts of governments
at all levels to enhance the farmers' enthusiasm for farm
production and reduce the adverse effects of natural
disasters. The efforts have ensured the steady growth of
agriculture, including the animal husbandry and fisheries sectors.
</P>
<P>
State-owned enterprises recorded value-added of 833.9 billion
yuan for the first three quarters, up 7.4 percent on the 1996
period, with the value-added of collective industrial enterprises
growing by 11.1 percent to 438.7 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Qiu went on to say that enterprises earned profits of 87
billion yuan during the first eight months of the year, up 32.4
percent from the 1996 period, with the profits of state-owned
enterprises rising by 72.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ample market supply was accompanied by a 1.3 percent rise in
retail prices compared to last year's period. with consumer prices
increasing by 3.4 percent. Qui said the aforementioned factors
greatly benefited the country's further reform and steady
development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the country's financial revenues for the
first three quarter grew by 24.7 percent on the 1996 period, with
financial expenditures growing by 17.9 percent, or 6.8 percentage
points lower than the growth rate for revenues.

regional currency turmoil, the Singapore economy will grow at six
to seven percent as projected.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to business leaders from Singapore and France after
the third plenary meeting of the France-Singapore Business

currencies," he said, adding that Singapore is "well-geared to
face the challenges and opportunities ahead."

The minister also noted that among the emerging economies of
the world, "the ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations)
countries are the fastest-growing and the most dynamic," with
their growth rates averaging seven percent over the past decade,
well above the world average.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN, which groups Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, the
Philippines, Singapore, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar, is an
association of 500 million people with a combined gross national

badly hit recently, their overall fundamentals remain sound," the

experience, adjust their policies and after some time, resume
their high rates of growth.

<HEADLINE> 10 Die of Heavy Rains in S. Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The rainy season of Bay
region in southern Somalia has set in, posing hazards to human
and animal lives, reports from southern Somalia said today.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Mohamed Nur Sheikh Hassan, a militia officer from the
Rahanwein community in bay region, said 10 people have died due
to the heavy rains in the past four days, and seven of them died
in the areas surrounding Habal Barbar village, nearly 90 km
southwest of Baidoa town.
</P>
<P>
Sources said the rain waters have also severely affected the
villages of Ufurow, Korombood and Duray, all in Bay region where
inhabitants fled to nearby relatively safer areas.
</P>
<P>
The sources also said that as many as 285 houses, mainly huts
and make-shift ones, were washed away during the rains which did
not let out for the past three days in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Elders from the region told Xinhua in a VHF radio interview
today that the rain waters had not only destroyed houses, but
their underground food stores as well.
</P>
<P>
One of the elders, Mr Abdullahi Kulow, told Xinhua that more
than 3,000 quintals of maize and sorghum had been swept away,
where many shops, business and food stores were submerged in
water as well.
</P>
<P>
Mr Kulow said that four herds of cattle and goats were also
washed away.
</P>
<P>
Rain waters are also rushing toward many other towns and
villages in middle and lower Jubba regions. Reports from the
towns of Hagar, Afmadow, Du'aale and Sakow said the rains have
also destroyed a number of houses and flooded thousands of
hectares of farmland which have just been planted to crops.
</P>
<P>
The local authorities have appealed both to international and
local aid agencies to give them a helping hand by providing food,
tents and medicine since, according to them, malaria is at its
height in these wet land.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Hassan said unless these people receive immediate
humanitarian assistance, their lives are in danger of both
diseases and famine.

<HEADLINE> Interior Chinese Firms Expected to Play Bigger Role in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Interior Chinese firms will be
an important force in the economic development of Hong Kong, an
official of the Hong Kong Chinese Enterprises Association said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Interior Chinese firms are playing an increasingly vital role
in the Hong Kong economy, Gu Yongjiang, president of the
association, said at a seminar on economic cooperation between
Beijing and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,800 interior Chinese firms have been approved to
have a presence in Hong Kong, with their combined assets valued at
over 42.5 billion US dollars by September 1996, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, capital investment in Hong Kong by
interior Chinese firms ranks next only to that by British firms.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of China Group, for example, accounts for 22 percent
of the asset value of the banking system of Hong Kong and its loan
portfolio makes up a quarter of the total.
</P>
<P>
Interior insurance companies account for 21 percent of annual
insurance premiums in Hong Kong while inland trade firms make up
22 percent of Hong Kong's yearly trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dozens of interior Chinese firms have listed on the
Stock Exchange of Hong Kong, with their market capitalization
standing at more than 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
Gu noted that, as in the past, the interior Chinese firms will
continue to play the role of the intermediary for economic
cooperation between Hong Kong and the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, interior firms will be most reliable force in
maintaining long-term prosperity and economic stability in Hong
Kong, he added.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the interior Chinese firms will not seek
privileges in Hong Kong and will instead participate in the
economic activities of Hong Kong under the principle of equality
and market competition, Gu Yongjiang said.

<HEADLINE> Australia Monitors Developments in Thailand: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Australian Treasurer Peter
Costello today said Australia was closely monitoring developments
in Thailand and "we urge the Thai authorities to continue to
cooperate with the International Monetary Fund (IMF)."
</P>
<P>
He warned Thailand that scrapping a planned increase in oil tax
could jeopardize Australia's 1.4 billion Australian dollar (1.02
billion US dollar) contribution to an international economic
rescue package.
</P>
<P>
Costello said he was concerned by reports that the Thai
authorities had abandoned plans for the increase in oil excise
which would provide 1 billion Australian dollars (735 million US
dollars) towards the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
Costello said "Australia's contribution is firmly linked to the
IMF program and disbursements are conditional on the Thai
authorities meeting the IMF conditions."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Awaits Jiang Zemin Visit: US Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton is "very
much looking forward" to the forthcoming visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin later this month, according to
U.S. ambassador to China James Sasser.
</P>
<P>
During today's interview with Xinhua, Sasser pointed to the
"great importance" of Jiang's U.S. visit, the first by a Chinese
head of state in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
Sasser said that Clinton hopes and believes that Jiang's visit
will help "rekindle the affection and respect of the American
people for China". "President Clinton respects and thinks
President Jiang is an extremely capable leader, a man of the
world", said Sasser.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who assumed office in February 1996, attributed
the visit to "a series of diplomatic steps", including a constant
stream of high-level visits between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sasser said the visit, together with a reciprocal visit to
China by Clinton next year, will serve "better relations and
understanding" between the two governments and the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
He said Jiang will receive the highest level of protocol of
honor during the U.S. tour.
</P>
<P>
Sasser said the Sino-U.S. relationship has improved greatly
since the early 1970s, and noted that the two sides are working to
ensure a "mutually beneficial" relationship.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton Administration has "embarked on a program of
constructive engagement with China, with related efforts improving
relations based on mutual respect and mutual benefit", said Sasser.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leadership has welcomed the policy, and improved
relations can be seen in the realm of diplomacy, economics, the
military and tourism, according to Sasser.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Ambassador addressed bilateral economic relations by
noting that the two countries are "engaged in the process of
expanding economic contacts, and bilateral trade continues to
grow".
</P>
<P>
He said "the two countries are major trade partners", with the
U.S. being China's second largest trade partner in terms of
exports from the latter. He also noted that China ranks as one of
the top seven trade partners of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The economies of the two nations are, at least to a certain
extent, complementary, rather than competitive, said Sasser,
adding that the principal problem in bilateral trade relations
centers on the U.S. trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. feels that one particularly effective way to deal
with the problem is for China to become a member of the World
Trade Organization (WTO)," according to Sasser.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the big Chinese trade mission to the U.S. is
expected to spend some four billion U.S. dollars to purchase
U.S. goods.
</P>
<P>
Discussing China's important role in regional and international
affairs, and Sasser said the nation "is once again emerging as one
of the world's leading nations."
</P>
<P>
He pointed to the fact that China, historically a major world
power, is now a member of the United Nations Security Council, and
a signatory to many important international treaties.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and China should engage in "extensive cooperation"
related to regional and international issues, Sasser said.
</P>
<P>
Sasser addressed the Taiwan issue by stressing: "Our policy,
which has remained relatively unchanged since the early 1970s, is
governed by the three joint communiques signed between the
U.S. and China. Our view is that there is only one China, and
disputes and controversies between Taiwan and the mainland should
be solved peacefully by the Chinese themselves."
</P>
<P>
Sasser said the goal of the U.S.-Japan Security Agreement,
which basically covers the region around Japan, is to clarify
relations between Japan and the United States.

<HEADLINE> SFOR to be Reduced to 12,000 Next Year: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The international SFOR
stabilization force in Bosnia would be reduced from the current
strength of 36,000 to 12,000 by June next year, the German weekly
news magazine Der Spiegal reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted unidentified NATO sources as saying that SFOR would
then be renamed DFOR, or Deterrence Force, after the withdrawal of
mainly United States troops.
</P>
<P>
Most of the American units quitting SFOR would move to Hungary
and Germany as a part of rapid reaction force, said Der Spiegal.
</P>
<P>
It also reported that the NATO sources believed the reduced
force in Bosnia would still be strong enough to maintain peace
there.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Chief Republican tax writer in Congress will push this
week to curtail the legal presumption that the taxpayer is always
guilty in Federal tax disputes, introducing a powerful but
divisive new issue into fast-moving efforts to overhaul the
Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
-- The nation's health authorities are increasingly concerned
about a poultry contaminant that can be as debilitating, if not
deadly, as salmonela. Researchers say that the contaminant, the
campylobacter bacterium, infects a larger percentage of chickens
than they had realized and that antibiotics used to treat people
sickened by infected poultry appeared to be losing their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Threatened with deep troop cuts and a shrinking role as the
nation's backup combat force, the Army National Guard is engaged
in a bruising political war with Army leaders over the relevance
of its 370,000 reservists and their claim on dwindling military
resources.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's attorney general decided Sunday to seek the
extradition of Samuel Sheinbein, beginning the legal process that
could return the 17-year-old to Montgomery County to stand trial
for a gruesome killing.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Congress returns to face an end-of-session push to pass
appropriations bills. Six measures remain, and temporary
authority to keep all government departments open expires
Thursday. Another stopgap measure is expected to pass by then as
Congress presses to adjourn in early November. Clinton's
line-item veto has added a wrinkle to this year's process. On
Friday, he cut several items from an energy and water bill, saying
"unwarranted corporate subsidies" are targets.
</P>
<P>
USA Today:
</P>
<P>
-- Federal Maritime Commission meets today to discuss next step
after postponing plan to deny Japanese cargo ships access to U.S.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Calls for Tripartite Meeting on Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi Foreign Ministry
called on Turkey and Syria to hold an urgent meeting with Iraq to
set a time ceiling for determining the water quotas of Tigris and
Euphrates rivers.
</P>
<P>
Both of the two rivers originate in Turkey and pass through
Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the Arab League General Secretariat the Iraqi
Foreign Ministry said the recent statements of the Turkish
President Sulaiman Demirel were "inaccurate".
</P>
<P>
Demirel told the Egyptian daily "Al-Ahram" recently that Iraq
and Syria insist on equitable distribution of the water quotas
with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has not raised such a proposal during the
Turkish-Syrian-Iraqi meetings on water quotas", the message noted.
</P>
<P>
Under the minute of the joint Iraqi-Turkish commission on
economic and technical cooperation signed on November 5, 1980, a
technical ad hoc committee on water was set up and its mission was
to submit reports to the governments of the two countries over
two-year term renewable for one year only, the ministry added.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Foreign Ministry made clear that Iraq proposed to
Syria the setting up of new technical committees as part of what
it called "the three-stage plan" provided the committees be
divided into more ad hoc committees and leave the aim of the joint
technical committee on water distribution.
</P>
<P>
The problem of the reasonable water distribution of Tigris and
Euphrates among Turkey, Syria and Iraq has not been resolved since
long as Syria and Iraq demand a bigger quota of water while Turkey
refused to do so.

<HEADLINE> African States Urged to Develop by Self-reliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A senior Rwandan official said
Africa countries has the potential of developing on its own
because it still has a lot of untapped resources, according to
Zambia News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made by Anastase Gasana, Rwanda's Minister of
Foreign Affairs while opening the third session of the Joint
Permanent Commission between Zambia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Gasana urged African countries on the continent to develop by
their own resources.
</P>
<P>
At present, most of the underdeveloped countries in the world
identified by the united nations are on the African continent
which is rich in natural resources but has featured poverty,
famine and illness.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Gasana also called on Africans to maintain
values of justice to avoid conflicts on the continent which has
hindered its social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
The 1994 genocide in Rwanda which had claimed hundreds of
thousands of people's lives as a result of bloody ethnic
conflicts could have been avoided if the values of justice had
been respected, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gasana who is heading a government delegation including
Rwanda's Defense Minister and several other senior officials
arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Gasana will discuss with his Zambian
counterpart Lawrence Shimba the means to increase the bilateral
trade between Zambia and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Retirement Issue Puzzles Chinese Swimming Circle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- As the Chinese National Games
is nearing to its close, the retirement issue of "veterans"
resurfaced again to puzzle the Chinese swimming circle amid hopes
and concerns.
</P>
<P>
Among those would-be retirees are world record holder He Cihong
in the women's 100-meter backstrok, and Yuan Yuan who won the
national title in the women's 200-meter breaststroke in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunpeng, former head coach of the Chinese national team,
said that "the swimmers of other countries usually reached their
peaks at the age around 25, but our Chinese swimmers retired in an
early age."
</P>
<P>
"It's a waste of manpower as a batch of swimmers retire every
four years," lamented Zhou Ming, deputy head coach of the Chinese
national squad.
</P>
<P>
Those wished to retire prior to the Games included 22-year-old
Le Jingyi, world record holder in both the women's 50m and 100m
freestyles, Jiang Chenji, 22, who made the breakthrough for the
Chinese men swimmers by finishing fourth in Atlanta, and
19-year-old Chen Yingjuan who took the 200-meter backstroke title
by clocking the second-best time at the national games days ago.
</P>
<P>
Although many blamed the system for early retirement of the
athletes, Chen Yunpeng had a different explanation, saying that
"those retirees were weak mentally against challenges from the
youngesters after their successes."
</P>
<P>
In the Barcelona Games, the Chinese "five flowers" of Yang
Wenyi, Zhuang Yong, Lin Li, Qian Hong and Wang Xiaohong, awarded
China four gold medals with big splashes in the world.
</P>
<P>
Most of them retired later at the age of 22 or 23, and Lin Li
was the last to bid farewell to the pool as she still competed in
the Atlanta Olympic Games at the age of 26.
</P>
<P>
Lin Li failed to show up in the pool at the National Games,
saying "it's a right choice not to compete this time, because I
was under too much pressure."
</P>
<P>
Nowsdays, the Chinese swimming officials urged those "veterans"
to stay in the national squad as their experiences still play a
morale-boosting role for the young stars at least.
</P>
<P>
Both Le Jingyi and Jiang Chenji were the first to pay heed to
the calls, declaring at the National Games that they will compete
in the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Wu Yi, Chinese Minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, expressed her hope here today
that China and Germany will strengthen technological and
financial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has paid great attention to Sino-German
cooperation which has promoted the development of the economic
ties and trade between the two countries, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
Wu made the remarks during a meeting with Carl-Dieter Sprange,
German minister of foreign economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
She noted that enhancing cooperation will benefit both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Technological cooperation between the two countries has
played an important role in upgrading China's technology and
promoting development of the Chinese economy, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
China and Germany have conducted technological cooperation in
the sectors of coal, petroleum, environmental protection, power,
machine-building, aviation, agriculture, forestry and
railways. China, the largest recipient country of German
assistance, has received financial support totalling 1.12 billion
German Deutsche Marks.
</P>
<P>
Germany has also trained over 10,000 technicians for China.
</P>
<P>
On financial cooperation, Wu said it will
help more German firms enter the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Germany has pledged to provide China with 3.33 billion Deutsche
Marks in financial cooperation fund. The bulk of the fund will be
in the form of soft loans and the remaining 423 million Deutsche
marks is gratis donations.
</P>
<P>
Sprange said that technological and financial cooperation
between the two countries has enabled German businesses to enter
the Chinese market. He noted that the German government hopes to
strengthen cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Wu and Sprange signed an agreement on
financial cooperation between the two governments in the 1997
fiscal year. Under the agreement, the German government will
provide 180 million Deutsche Marks to China during the period.
</P>
<P>
A separate agreement calls for Germany to provide gratis
funding of five million Deutsche Marks for feasibility studies
related to the electrification of the Harbin-Dalian railway in
northeast China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's intrusions into Iraq
and its repeated infringements on Iraqi sovereignty not only
violated international laws but also contradicted bilateral
agreements, the Iraqi official daily Al-Thawrah said today.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's actions in northern Iraq will also harm the joint

</P>
<P>
It noted that practical evidence and tangible testimonies prove
that Turkey is still acting in an irresponsible and unjustifiable
way against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is well-known that the U.S. administration pushes Turkey to
make the moves and practices that are harmful to Turkey's own
interests, security and future, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
On October 13, Turkish warplanes bombed its outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) rebels based in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, around 15,000 Turkish troops, backed by air
and artillery fire, launched a cross-border incursion in northern
Iraq in a bid to destroy newly-built PKK camps in the area.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has frequently launched cross-border operations
aimed at wiping out the PKK militants in northern Iraq over which
Baghdad had lost control since the 1991 Gulf war.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 experts from China and
the US gathered in Beijing today to probe solutions for
technological and engineering problems confronting medium- to
large-sized state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending the Third Sino-US Technology and Engineering
Conference, which opened today, will also discuss how to use
foreign and domestic resources to promote technological innovation
and creativity needed to strengthen the competitiveness of said
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Discussions will also touch on 10-odd specialized sectors
ranging from telecommunications, microelectronics, computer
hardware and software to telecommunications and energy.
</P>
<P>
Experts from abroad have already conducted extensive research
related to 44 large enterprises in 14 provinces and cities.
</P>
<P>
State Councillor Li Guixian addressed the opening ceremony and
cited the fact that topics of discussion will mainly focus on
large Chinese enterprises and groups. He said the direct focus
will ensure the constructiveness of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
Li emphasized that China encourages foreign experts and Chinese
experts living abroad to contribute to construction of the country
in order to effectively close the gap between China and developed
countries in the fields of technology and economics.
</P>
<P>
The conference will provide an excellent venue for Chinese
experts from both at home and abroad to exchange views, said Li.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Denies Attack on S. Leone's Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force (ECOMOG) which is enforcing an international embargo on
Sierra Leone's military junta has denied alleged bombardment of
civilian targets in the country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu said here
Sunday that his force limited its operations to hitting selected
military targets as a way of enforcing the embargo.
</P>
<P>
"We only act in self defense and if and when we take action it
is to neutralize targets from where the illegal regime attacks
our positions or surveillance planes," he said, quoted by the
Pan-African News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It was reported earlier that ECOMOG jets last Thursday bombed
the telecommunication installations and radio and television
stations in the Sierra Leonean capital of Freetown, killing
dozens of people and injuring more others, including civilians.
</P>
<P>
But Malu dismissed the allegations, saying the Major Johnny
Koroma-led regime should take all responsibility for using its
helicopter gunship to attack ECOMOG which is "carrying out the
legitimate duty of enforcing the embargo" approved by the United
Nations and the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS).
</P>
<P>
"The illegal regime has remained hostile and engages in false
propaganda," said Malu, who also dismissed the claim by the junta
that it had captured hundreds of ECOMOG troops.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG had the capacity to "flush out the junta within weeks,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS started sanctions and embargo on the junta after
dialogue for peaceful settlement of the crisis triggered off by
the May 25 coup that toppled the legitimate government broke down
in July.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council also ordered oil and arms embargo on
the junta early this month.
</P>
<P>
According to Malu, the effects of the sanctions "are already
being felt and in the next two months the impact would bite even
harder".
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS has announced a combination of three measures toward
resolving the crisis in Sierra Leone, that is dialogue, sanctions
and the use of force.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the negotiation between ECOWAS and the
junta is expected to resume on Wednesday in Conakry, capital of
Guinea.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Improve Sanitation Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans have been called upon
to improve their sanitation situation so as to make a better
living condition, "the New Vision" daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in the Kampala Sanitation Declaration
(1997) signed by the country's district leaders in conjunction
with the local government and health officials here on October
17.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Uganda's declining sanitation situation, the
10-point declaration urged local authorities to lead by example
and commit themselves to implementing the provisions of the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also emphasizes organization of sanitation
promotion at district level, devising a multi-sectoral approach
with close coordination between ministries, and ensuring that
women, youth and the disabled are adequately represented at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, there will also be a national
sanitation day each year to promote sanitation and assess the
progress of sanitation improvement.
</P>
<P>
It said, the nation, district, sub-county and urban
authorities will develop a comprehensive sanitation policy,
operational guidelines and pass necessary legislation to upgrade
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also provides that private sector and
non-governmental organizations will be involved in the
development, production and dissemination of appropriate
sanitation materials.
</P>
<P>
Due to protracted civil strife in Uganda, sanitation situation
has been declining during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
At present only 47.3 percent out of every 10 homes in the
country have latrines. The situation is even grimmer in the
northern part of the country where only four out of 10 homes have
a latrine.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda 50 percent of out-patient cases are sanitation
related and the country spends 22 million U.S. Dollars on their
treatment. Furthermore, some 10 million Dollars more are lost in
wasted work days.

<HEADLINE> Privatization Talks on Zambia's Copper Mines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Economics Association of
Zambia (EAZ) has described as "alarming" the negotiations on the
privatization of Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
The Post today quoted EAZ chairman Moses Banda as suggesting
that the government ZCCM negotiating team unbundle the ZCCM
packages further to get better rewards.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspaper, Banda accused bidders of
conspiring to bring down the value of the mines by forming
consortiums to bid for the ZCCM assets.
</P>
<P>
"When the unbundled packages were offered for sale, some
mining houses formed consortiums to bid for the jewels of the
packages. The bidding companies decided on this model so as to
limit competition on the market and hence increase their
bargaining position.
</P>
<P>
"However, they would like to make us believe that they are
colluding in order to mobilize the required resources to invest
in the mines," he said.
</P>
<P>
Banda said it was time to "change the goal posts" and unbundle
ZCCM into much smaller units.
</P>
<P>
The Post also quoted the country's mines minister Christon
Tembo as saying that the government will monitor all private
investors in the mining industry to make sure that they comply
with investment requirements.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM, Zambia's major foreign exchange earner, is in the
process of privatization as a government effor to revive the
ailing copper mine industry.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Raises Fund for Extinct Rhino </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Rhino Fund Uganda has
raised about 10,000 U.S. Dollars for the extinct rhinos in the
country during a five-team rafting expedition down River Nile,
said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
"The money will go to set up a breeding program, then when we
have a good breeding ground we will introduce the rhinos into the
parks,'' Ray Victurine, the fund's co-founder, was quoted by the
report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 14-kilometer rafting expedition that started from the
Bujagali Falls, 80 km east of Kampala, took place on October 19.
</P>
<P>
It was sponsored by the local daily ''the New Vision'', Crane
Bank, Gold Star Insurance, Gold Trust Bank and Windsor Lake
Victoria Hotel. They paid for the rafts.
</P>
<P>
Additional money came from individual donations and pledges.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Wasike, Uganda Wildlife authority board member said,
"the return of the rhino to Uganda will increase the number of
tourist attractions in the country, making the country easily
marketable as a tourist destination."
</P>
<P>
At present, Uganda's major tourist attractions include the
gorilla tracking in Bwindi impenetrable forest and Mgahinga
national parks in western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Other wildlife attractions are in the Murchison Falls National
Park, Queen Elizabeth National Park, MT. Elgon National Park.
</P>
<P>

war. Uganda was one of five countries in the world that was home
to rhinos especially the northern white rhino that numbered 100
in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Two species of rhinos lived previously in the north of the
Nile area in Uganda. The black rhino in Murchison Falls
(northwestern Uganda) and Kidepo Valley (northeastern Uganda)
national parks and the northern white rhino in Ajia Wildlife

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A child protection and
care coordinating office has been inaugurated on the premise of
the Addis Ababa regional police commission, a report from the
Ethiopian News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the office Saturday, Legesse Tegegn,
representative of the Federal Police Commission said the police
is among the responsible government agencies charged with the
task of ensuring the rights and welfare of children enshrined in
the U.N. convention as wold as the constitution of the Federal
Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Legesse pointed out that some researches conducted in the
country indicate that criminal offenses perpetrated against
children are growing at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
As children are immature both physically and mentally to guard
themselves against various kinds of abuses, the police should
give priority to protect them in their daily activity of
maintaining peace and security of the general public, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the effort of the police alone could not
bring about the desired result. He called on governmental
organizations, non-governmental organizations and the public at
large to cooperate with the police to enable them to carry out
their duties effectively.
</P>
<P>
The newly established child protection and care coordinating
office has three branch offices and two reception rooms for
juvenile delinquents.

BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's

It is the smallest price increase margin since the start of
1990s, when China entered the latest round of economic growth.

Meanwhile, the consumer prices went up by 1.8 percent on an

</P>
<P>
The Levy-Mazen meeting was arranged after Ross met with
Arafat Sunday evening in the West Bank city Ramallah. Before
presiding over the meeting in Laromme Hotel, Ross held second
meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Ross expressed limited optimism about the peace process.
Speaking after he met Arafat, Ross stressed once again that it
is very important for the parties to "work in a more
intensive way" in order to achieve progress.
</P>
<P>
Ross is trying to bridge the huge gap between the two
sides over the PNA demand for a halt to Israeli settlement
expansion and the Israeli demand for a tougher PNA fight
against terrorism and the terror infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat, who also attended
the Levy-Mazen meeting, said Ross was disappointed with the lack
of progress in the committee-level peace talks.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the U.S. supports PNA's demand for a halt
to Israeli settlement expansion, adding both the PNA and Israel
are interested in putting the peace process back on track so
to restore confidence and credibility through implementing singed
accords.
</P>
<P>
Ross reportedly tried to persuade Israel to agree to a
"time-out" of its settlement activities. However, Israel insists
that its security concern should be the focus of Ross's new
mission.
</P>
<P>
"The interim issues, such as the (Gaza) airport, seaport
and safe passages are subjected to Israel's security control. That
is the only thing and main thing that we are discussing. If
the Palestinians agree to render their control (on terrorism),
then I think we can move very quickly on all these issues,"
Netanyahu said after meeting Ross late Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The issue of settlement expansion has been the leading
obstacle in advancing the peace process that was revived early
the month after a seven-month freeze caused by Israel's building
of a settlement in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The nine joint committees have been meeting to negotiate
issues on the opening of safe passages for Palestinians between
Gaza Strip and West Bank, Gaza airport and seaport, and
release of Palestinian detainees.
</P>
<P>
Responding to reports that Israel might agree to a halt
to the settlement activities, Levy said today that only
necessary minimum settlement construction would continue, indicating
that Israel is willing to make certain concession on the
settlement issue.
</P>
<P>
But two rightist lawmakers, who are residing in settlements
in the West Bank, said that Netanyahu had promised them that
there would be no halt to settlement construction.
</P>
<P>
Zvi Hendel and Hanan Porat, both from the rightwing National
Religious Party, met with Netanyahu Sunday night demanding a
clarification that the government is ready accept a time-out of
settlements. They said Netanyahu assured them that the settlement
construction would continue.
</P>
<P>
This afternoon, Ross is also scheduled to meet with Israeli
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and President Ezer Weizman
before attending the ceremony in Tel Aviv held by former Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres to mark the opening of the Peres
Center for Peace aimed at promoting Middle East peace through
mainly economic projects.
</P>
<P>
A number of political and business leaders will attend the
ceremony, including former U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher and Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.

<HEADLINE> HK Airport Authority Commissions Artworks for Passenger Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Airport Authority of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has commissioned two big
artworks for the passenger terminal at the new airport at Chek Lap
Kok, which is expected to be put into use next Spring.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the Airport Authority told Xinhua today that
Australian sculptor Michel Santry was selected to design a large
suspended sculpture to be hung in the massive public atrium of the
Arrival Hall, while local architect Tao Ho will create a hanging
piece for the West Hall.
</P>
<P>
The Arrival Hall and the West Hall are the two most impressive
areas of the passenger terminal.
</P>
<P>
The atrium of the Arrival Hall is part of the large area
linking the entrance lobbies to the Check-in Hall and comprises a
triple height space of cathedral-like proportions -- 25 meters
high, 36 meters wide and 320 meters long. This is the only part of
the building where departing passengers can mix with arriving
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The West Hall is the second focal point in the passenger
terminal and is both the last point of departure and the first
point of arrival for passengers traveling on airlines using the
southwest and northwest concourses.
</P>
<P>
The area, in which Tao's sculpture will hang, is 36 meters
square and almost 30 meters high. The backdrop of the hall is a
multi-story height glass wall with stunning views westwards across
the airport platform towards Macao.
</P>
<P>
Santry, whose work is well represented in Hong Kong, Beijing,
London, Hamburg, Saudi Arabia and Australia, has designed a very
large but lightweight suspended sculpture that will run the length
of the Arrival Hall atrium.
</P>
<P>
It will be based on the idea of wings and sails, with their
natural associations with the airport and Hong Kong's harbor, and
constructed of lightweight stainless steel tubing, yacht rigging
and sail cloth. Because of its large size, the work will comprise
three sections, each a mixture of Western and Asian icons.
</P>
<P>
The work will be a series of highly colorful flowing images,
with as its centerpiece a group of floating shapes inspired by the
flying figures pained in China's world-famous Dunhuang grottoes on
the Silk Road more than 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tao's hanging sculpture for the West Hall of the passenger
terminal, entitled "A Synergy of Dynamic Energy," consists of an
array of 18 Icosahedra (three-dimensional geometric forms with 20
planar surfaces) made of rainbow colored aluminum tubes joined
together by stainless steel tension wires.
</P>
<P>
The complex form symbolizes the dynamic interaction of the 18
districts of Hong Kong and the ingenuity of its people.

<HEADLINE> Macao Tourism to Target Asian-Pacific Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Macao will try to woo more
tourists from the Asian-Pacific region next year, tourism officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The tourism department has set its tourism market for 1998 as
on Hong Kong, Taiwan, China's inland areas, Japan, the Republic of
Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand, officials said in a
recent seminar.
</P>
<P>
Those places have been the main source of tourists for Macao.
Air links have been established between Macao and those
destinations over the past years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the tourism department will also try its best to
host more international conventions and exhibitions to help
increase tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
A pillar industry in Macao, tourism suffered a setback this
year with the number of tourists dropping 12.5 percent in the
first eight months from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that the decline was due to an "exaggerated
media coverage of Macao interior (security) problems", the
devaluation of currency in southeast Asian nations and the drop of
tourists to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Joao Manuel Autunes, director of the Macao Tourist Office, said
at the seminar that his office plans to invite foreign media and
organizations to help promote Macao as a "safe place to travel"
and a "place with unique culture."
</P>
<P>
Tourism income accounts for some 40 percent of the gross
national product (GNP) of Macao. The industry employs 30 percent
of Macao's labor force.
</P>
<P>
A total of 8.15 million travelers arrived in Macao last year,
compared with only 410,000 residents. Macao also hosted some 700
international and regional conventions and exhibitions last year.

<HEADLINE> Uttar Pradesh Government in India Demanded to Dismiss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 20 (XINHUA) -- The Congress and the United
Front have demanded dismissal of the Bharatiya Janata Party
(BJP)-led government in Uttar Pradesh (UP), the most populous
state in the country, following withdrawal of support by the
Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), local press reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The 29-day-old government political drama in UP reached a
climax Sunday with the BSP withdrawing support to the Kalyan
Singh-led coalition government for its alleged anti-dalits (the
low caste in India) policy. UP Governor Romesh Bhandari has asked
Chief Minister Kalyan Singh to prove his majority on the floor of
the State Assembly on October 21.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Sitaram Kesri described the development in
UP as a constitutional crisis and asked the central government to
explore the possibility of the formation of a non-BJP government
in the state. He said that the BJP could resort to horse-trading
and defection to remain in power. He ruled out Congress support to
the BSP.
</P>
<P>
Most of the United Front constituents have expressed
apprehension there could be massive horse-trading if the chief
minister would remain in office. They have demanded immediate
dismissal of the BJP government in the UP.
</P>
<P>
The 175-member BJP in the 425-member State Assembly will
require the support of 38 more legislators to prove majority of
its government on October 21 when the chief minister has been
asked to prove his strength on the floor of the House. At a press
briefing here Sunday, BJP spokesperson Xashwant Sinha refused to
answer questions on where the minority government of the Kalyan
Singh would get its additional support from. "We have no intention
to indulge in horse-trading," he said.
</P>
<P>
The BJP appeared to have two options in mind: one is to bank on
splits in other parties to get the majority in the house. The
second option is to try and reach an understanding with certain
groups or members that they either abstain or stay away from the
confidence motion.

</P>
<P>
This was announced by Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
while addressing a public meeting Sunday on the occasion of the

have already been completed.
</P>
<P>

5.7 billion taka (about 130 million dollars) with financial
assistance from the World Bank.

Anatoly Solovyov and Pavel Vinogradov began the space walk at

</P>
<P>
They want to connect the cables to a working computer on the
Kristall module, which was not affected by the collision.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the Kristall's computer will keep the Spektr's
solar panels in the best possible alignment with the sun, thereby
soaking up more energy and providing additional power to the space
station.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Improve Sanitation Condition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Ugandans have been called upon
to improve their sanitation situation so as to make a better
living condition, "the New Vision" daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in the Kampala Sanitation Declaration
(1997) signed by the country's district leaders in conjunction
with the local government and health officials here on October
17.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Uganda's declining sanitation situation, the
10-point declaration urged local authorities to lead by example
and commit themselves to implementing the provisions of the
declaration.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also emphasizes organization of sanitation
promotion at district level, devising a multi-sectoral approach
with close coordination between ministries, and ensuring that
women, youth and the disabled are adequately represented at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
According to the declaration, there will also be a national
sanitation day each year to promote sanitation and assess the
progress of sanitation improvement.
</P>
<P>
It said, the nation, district, sub-county and urban
authorities will develop a comprehensive sanitation policy,
operational guidelines and pass necessary legislation to upgrade
sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The declaration also provides that private sector and
non-governmental organizations will be involved in the
development, production and dissemination of appropriate
sanitation materials.
</P>
<P>
Due to protracted civil strife in Uganda, sanitation situation
has been declining during the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
At present only 47.3 percent out of every 10 homes in the
country have latrines. The situation is even grimmer in the
northern part of the country where only four out of 10 homes have
a latrine.
</P>
<P>
In Uganda 50 percent of out-patient cases are sanitation
related and the country spends 22 million U.S. Dollars on their
treatment. Furthermore, some 10 million Dollars more are lost in

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Inland Jiangxi Province of
China is promoting eight attractions and 14 new routes in a bid to
attract tourists.
</P>
<P>
The activities, including five international festivals and
three designed for domestic tourists, will support the national
theme for tourism next year -- the " '98 City and Country Tour,"
said Xiang Guanglin, deputy director of Jiangxi Provincial Tourism
Bureau, at a meeting on Jiangxi tourism held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Overseas tourists may attend the Plum Blossom Festival to be
held in Ganzhou in January, the Mount Lushan International Tourism
Festival in June, a cultural festival on the Song Dynasty
(960-1127 A.D.) in Ganzhou in September, an international
porcelain festival in the renowned "porcelain capital" of
Jingdezhen in October and a folklore festival in the Taoist Longhu
Mountains, also in October.
</P>
<P>
The activities mainly designed for domestic tourists will
include a tour to the Jinggang Mountain, a cradle of the Chinese
revolution; climbing up the Taoist Sanqing Mountain; and a tour
to Dongjiang River, where water has been diverted to alleviate
Hong Kong's water shortage.
</P>
<P>
The new routes will lead tourists to the summer resort of Mt
Lushan, Jingdezhen, Mt Jinggang, Mt Longhu and Poyang Lake,
China's largest fresh water lake. These routes are designed to
combine sightseeing, tours of historical sites, folklore, holiday
resorts and special interests, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi's tourism has long been hindered by poor transportation
facitlities and inadequate information. Opening of the
Beijing-Kowloon Railway has opened up new opportunities, Xiang
said.
</P>
<P>
The north-south trunk line, more than 2,000 kilometers long,

<HEADLINE> AIDS Kills 4 Medical Workers in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) - Four Nigerian medical personnel
have died of AIDS allegedly contracted from their patients over
the past three years, according to the Nigerian Medical
Association (NMA).
</P>
<P>
The association also warned on Sunday that it would hand off
patients unless adequate preventive measures were put in place by
the authorities, press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
However, NMA refused to disclose the names of the victims,
including two doctors, one laboratory technologists and a nurse.
They all in one of the foremost hospitals in Lagos.
</P>
<P>
Their deaths came one after the other in the last three years,
said Rotimi Ola, chairman of the Lagos state branch of NMA.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the deaths on the alleged failure of the government
to implement the universal precautionary standards advocated by
the World Health Organization aimed at preventing the
transmission of disease from patients to health workers.
</P>
<P>
"Health workers including doctors will avoid treating AIDS
patients if the casualty rate of health workers who contract the
disease at work continues to rise and if government fails to
provide the universal precaution facilities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the National AIDS/STDs Control Program Center
alerted that about five million Nigerians may have been infected
with the human immune virus (HIV), with the prospects of the
infection developing into the dreaded AIDS.
</P>
<P>
According to the center, a survey on ante-natal patients
between 1995 and 1996 showed that 4.4 percent of the patients had
contracted the HIV. That would be about five million Nigerians if
translated into the nation's population figure.
</P>
<P>
The percentage indicated an increase from the 1991-92 and
1993-94 figure of 1.8 and 3.4 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has been under pressure to release the
official figure of AIDS patients and related data.

<HEADLINE> Namibia, Botswana Discuss Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Officials of Namibia and
Botswana are meeting to discuss another border dispute between
the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Radio Namibia said today that Botswana is claiming another
island on its border with Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The Botswana claim is over Situngu island on the Linyanti
river on its north-eastern border with Namibia.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the move came when members of the Botswana
Defense Force ordered farmers to leave a cattle post and their
cultivated land on Situngu island in Namibia's Caprivi region.
</P>
<P>
Officials of the two sides are gathering facts about the
incident and recommend a solution.
</P>
<P>
Namibian delegation head Patrick Likando was quoted as saying
the meeting has agreed to resolve the issue as soon as possible,
and the border dispute will only involve their respective
governments if the officials fail to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
Namibia and Botswana have referred another border dispute over
Kasikili island to the International Court in Hague for
arbitration.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Military Chiefs to Re-construct Liberian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Military chiefs of west African
countries are in consultation over the restructuring of the armed
forces of Liberia (AFL) despite Liberia's willingness to do the
job by itself.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Chief of Defense Staff Major-General Abdulsalam
Abubakar is now leading the initiative of his counterparts in the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) for the
effort, according to local media reports today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria is the current chairman of the 16-member sub-regional
organization ECOWAS.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring and training of the Liberian army are to be
carried out by the ECOWAS peace-keeping force (ECOMOG), according
to the 1996 revised Abuja peace accord which brought to an end of
Liberia's seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
But early this month, Liberian President Charles Taylor said
he would soon begin recruiting able-bodied Liberians for training
to strengthen national security, arguing the restructuring of the
army lied within his constitutional authority.
</P>
<P>
"We will wait for no one to restructure the AFL because it is
in my constitutional responsibility to do so," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the statement, ECOMOG Force Commander Major-General Victor
Malu said on Sunday he still had no reason to believe that the
Liberian leader would deviate from the ECOWAS accord on the armed
forces restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"It is even in the interest of the Liberian government that
ECOMOG completes its work because of the problem associated with
the disbanded and tribalized armed forces," Malu added.
</P>
<P>
On the alleged frictions between ECOMOG and the Taylor
government, Malu said that the peace-keepers' mandate in Liberia
was very clear.
</P>
<P>
"Ours is to support the elected and legitimate government in
the maintenance of peace and security," Malu said, adding that
after the war, Liberians should be assisted in reconciliation and
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Under the Abuja peace accord, ECOMOG will remain in Liberia
for six months after the elected government took office on August
2 to restructure and train the AFL, expected to involve some
4,000 policemen and 5,000-strong army.
</P>
<P>
The job did not begin as scheduled for some reasons and ECOMOG
is expected to extend its stay in the country to one year.

<HEADLINE> Valuable Cultural Relics Returned to Tibet Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-six pieces of valuable
cultural relics have been returned to the newly built Tibet Museum
in the Tibet Autonomous Region of China.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 the Public Security Bureau of the Tibet Autonomous Region
arrested a cultural relics peddler and confiscated 36 artifacts at
his house. Experts who examined the artifacts said they are
grade-one and grade-two cultural relics of the State.
</P>
<P>
Specialists expressed surprise that so many rare cultural
relics had been returned. "It is unbelievable, some cultural
relics cannot be found in Tibet now," according to the director of
the Cultural Relics Bureau of the region.
</P>
<P>
The most valuable relic is the statue of the ninth Garmaba
Living Buddha in the Curbo Monastery, which has a history of
hundreds of years. The 17th Garmaba Living Buddha said, "I am very
happy that our monastery's treasure is eventually found; the
police are our monastery's real protectors."
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, the public security agencies
have cracked down on robbery, smuggling and trafficking in
cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Australia Assists Bougainville Peace Process: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government is
"acting very constructively, very patiently and very responsibly"
in trying to assist the Bougainville peace process in Papua New
Guinea, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer told parliament
today.
</P>
<P>
He played down the prospects of a quick resolution to the
decade-old conflict despite the current ceasefire. He stressed
that the peace process was evolutionary and should not be hurried.
</P>
<P>
He said Australia was continuing to support peace talks in any
way it could, including providing transport to the Burnham
conference in New Zealand which agreed on the ceasefire on October
10.
</P>
<P>
"So far the Burnham talks have led to the truce between the
parties to the Bougainville conflict and that I think is a very
important confidence building measure," Downer said in answer to a
question.
</P>
<P>
"There is a mood of hope and dialogue and we will continue to
encourage that," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government had made an effort to build lines of
communication directly with key players rather than through the
Port Moresby government, with contacts made in both the
Bougainville Revolutionary Army and the Bougainville Transitional
Government.
</P>
<P>
"The talks in Burnham are part of what I describe as an
evolutionary process and I don't think it is wise to push the
Bougainville peace process too fast," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a dreadful, long-standing conflict in our immediate
vicinity and we want it resolved in a peaceful way", he added.

<HEADLINE> Re-Employment Project Provides Jobs for Four Million Laid-Off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing a press conference today in Beijing, Qiu said that
China now has eight million jobless people in urban areas. Six
million of them formerly worked for defunct or indebted
State-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The country's unemployment rate is nearly 4 percent, still a
"controllable size" for the government in its ongoing economic
reform, Qiu said.
</P>
<P>
During the January-July period, 282 State-owned firms had gone
bankrupt in the 111 cities chosen for enterprise reform, and 501
merged into companies. A total of 1.13 million workers were
reassigned to other jobs.
</P>
<P>
Qiu attributed the low unemployment rate to the living
standard guarantee implemented in 206 Chinese cities and 454
counties. This system ensures that those laid off will receive
monthly stipends to sustain a living.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
defied weekend doomsaying today and ended only marginally lower on
the 10-year anniversary of its blackest day.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index closed 6.2 points lower at 2639.4
after a surprisingly strong mid-morning had it in positive
territory for much of the day.
</P>
<P>
"To be only down six today was quite a good effort," Henderson
Charlton Jones broker Brett O'Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
O'Donovan said the market opened around 20 points lower, which
was right in line with expectations after Wall Street fell Friday,
but soon strengthened as bargain hunters moved in on the majors in
particular.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index lost 2.3 points to 1290.6 while the all
industrial index fell 10.9 points to 4352.0.
</P>
<P>
The major resource stocks in particular enjoyed good support
from mid-morning despite little movement in commodity prices
overnight.
</P>
<P>
Bellwether BHP Co. Ltd. ended 6.9 cents higher at 15.15
Australian dollars, much stronger than its low of 14.801
Australian dollars after Managing Director John Prescott said at
the weekend that its profits might be affected by Asia's currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Other strongly performing majors were mining company WMC, up 11
cents at 5.89 Australian dollars, mining giant Rio Tinto, 25 cents
stronger at 19.86 Australian dollars, and MIM which closed three
cents higher at 1.59 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Leading oil and gas stocks slipped, however, as Woodside ended
30.9 cents down at 12.41 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Industrial stocks were led down by News Corp. which lost three
cents to 6.72 Australian dollars. Its preferred shares slipped two
cents to 6.07 Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Brambles defied the downward trend ending up 53 cents at 26.45
Australian dollars, and Lend Lease gained 20 cents to 29.80
Australian dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foster's Brewing Group ended steady at 2.77 Australian dollars
after the company announced at its annual meeting that it had
invested 56 million U.S. dollars in two breweries in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Banking stocks had a mixed day with the index gaining a
marginal 1.9 points to 5330.1.

Commonwealth lost 13 cents to 16.66 Australian dollars and Westpac
eased 2.2 cents to 8.638 Australian dollars.

higher at 324.65 U.S. dollars per ounce after trading as high as
325.00 U.S. dollars today.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Unemployment Rate 9.1 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Iran's unemployment rate stood
at 9.1 percent in 1996 as 1.4 million people are jobless in the
country, local English-language Iran Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
This was two percentage points down from the figure in 1991,
which was 11.1 percent posted by the Center of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The report said half of the jobless people were university
graduates aged between 20 and 29 and there has been a great gap
between job opportunities and the number of job seekers.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate in some western provinces exceeded 18 percent,
more than double the average rate in other parts of the country,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The high unemployment rate has led to high crime rate in the
country. The government has to toughen crackdown on thefts and
robberies, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Specialists said that the highly fluid nature of Iran's labor
market and the large size of the informal service sector makes
virtually impossible accurate estimate of employment levels in the
country.

<P>
BONN, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The wage gap between the western

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Ask WWII Rivals to Clear Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will ask World War II
rivals to help clear millions of landmines they planted in its
desert during their battle for control of North Africa, the
Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kamel Amer, governor of the northwestern province of Matrouh,
said after a memorial service on Sunday marking the anniversary of
the Battle of el-Alamein that Egypt wants to rid its northern
coast of mines for development projects.
</P>
<P>
"We will coordinate with the Egyptian Foreign Ministry to form
a plan to be joined by all the countries which had an active role
in the Battle of el-Alamein to remove 16 million mines planted by
the Allied and Axis forces in this area," Amer said.
</P>
<P>
The Allied forces led by then British General Bernard
Montgomery launched a huge offensive against Italian and German
forces under General Erwin Rommel on October 23, 1942 at
el-Alamein, about 300 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Allies suffered 13,5000 dead and wounded while nearly
60,000 German and Italian troops were killed, wounded or captured
in the battle that smashed the Nazi dream of seizing the Suez
Canal and drove Rommel's forces out of Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Consuls and military attaches of 45 countries that took part in
the World War II were present at the memorial service for the
soliders and victims.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, ceremonies to honor the dead of both sides have
rotated among the British, Italian and German memorials in the
former battle field, always on the Sunday nearest to October 23,
the date of the start of the climactic battle in 1942.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N.-affiliated Economic Commission of Africa,
Egypt tops world countries in terms of mines on its land, totaling
23 million but is reckoned the least vulnerable to problems
emanating from the existence of such explosive materials.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. organ attributed this to the fact that such mines were
planted at a profound depth in unpopulated areas in the desert,
which entirely lessens the possibility of their explosion.
</P>
<P>
The millions of mines in Egypt mostly spread across the Western
Desert, the important battle fields during World War II and Sinai,
the scene for several Arab-Israeli conflicts.
</P>
<P>
But there have been sporadic reports in Egypt about casualties
from stepping on landmines.

<HEADLINE> Crop-Breeding Research Gets Boost in China's Sichuan Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A fund for developing new crop
species has been set up in Sichuan Province of southwest China,
according to a senior official from the Provincial Science and
Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Ten million yuan has been invested in the fund and the first
batch of 50 development projects has been approved.
</P>
<P>
The Sichuan provincial government this year allocated
1.2 percent of its seed sales to the fund. The move emphasizes
Sichuan's commitment to crop breeding.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the province's investment in crop-breeding research
topped 6.5 million yuan and 500 people have been employed in the
work.
</P>
<P>
The province leads the country in crop-breeding techniques, the
official said, with 200 varieties produced in recent years.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Science and Technology
Commission of Sichuan Province, the province has 90 percent of its
cultivated land planted with fine seeds. It has more than 66
million hectares of arable land, which added 16.3 billion
kilograms to the land's annual grain yield.
</P>
<P>
Scientific crop breeding has greatly improved the province's
grain output, said the commission official. Sichuan harvested 4.7
million tons of grain in 1996, 1.24 million tons more than that in
1995.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Violence Against Women to Begin in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 130 activists from South
Asia will meet here Tuesday on how to end violence against women
and girls, according to a press release available here today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will focus on solutions to end gender violence and
on how to multiply these solutions through mutual and
complementary actions, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
A region-wide movement against gender violence, with men as
well as women involved, will benefit the children, women and men,
and it can help break the cycle of violence learned from
generation to generation within the patriarchy, said Dr. Ruth
Finney Hayward, Deputy Director of the United Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) Regional Office.
</P>
<P>
"Unless and until such violence is eliminated, it is difficult
to take seriously any claim that women are empowered or that the
rights of girls and women are respected and protected," she added.
</P>
<P>
A Kathmandu Commitment will be adopted at the end of the
four-day meeting to specify action plans for ending violence
against women and girls in South Asia, a major social evil in this
region, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is organized by the UNICEF Regional Office for
South Asia with support from other U.N. organizations and
non-governmental organizations.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Peso Seen to Stabilize in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine peso is seen to
stabilize in the last quarter of this year owing to inflows of
foreign currency remittances from overseas Filipino workers in the
Christmas season, economic analysts said today.
</P>
<P>
Usually, more than 6 million overseas Filipino workers will
send billions of U.S. dollars of remittances home during the
Yuletide season, which is expected to help ease the current
currency crisis, they said.
</P>
<P>
But the problem right now is that the local financial market is
still faced by a slowdown in the backdoor inflows of foreign
exchange which was believed to have dried out as a result of the
region-wide currency crisis, said Matthew Sutherland, senior vice
president of Manila-based Asia Equities Securities.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign investors are hesitant to pour their money into
the market due to the apprehension of how long the peso would
stabilize.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors are yet on a wait-and-see attitude as to the
outcome of the coming elections in May 1998 which could stir
political uncertainties in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
But he believed that the further the peso falls to where it
should go, the better for the economy because this weakness is
likely to be translated into competitiveness of the local
currency.
</P>
<P>
As far as Southeast Asia, including the Philippines, is
concerned, it has lost its competitiveness in the last decade or
so to neighboring countries like China and India, Sutherland said.
</P>
<P>
To address the currency turbulence that grips the region, he
said it is better to just allow the peso to seek its own level in
order to regain the lost currency competitiveness, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As soon as this happens, the country will begin to attract new
foreign investments that will boost the manufacturing and export
sectors," Sutherland predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine peso, which once plunged to 35.40 pesos against
the U.S. dollar early this month, has managed to stabilize in the
last week at the official currency market.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the average exchange rate was pegged at 33.85
pesos to one dollar, down 28.2 percent from the rate of 26.40
pesos per dollar registered before the floatation of the peso on
July 11.
</P>
<P>
Philippine monetary authorities were forced to allow the peso
to fluctuate within a wider band, or a de facto devaluation of the
currency, nine days after the floatation of the Thai baht.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Intensifies Security in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military has
intensified security in southern Mindanao island following
reported movements of the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) forces in some areas of Maguindanao province.
</P>
<P>
Capt. Noel Detoyato, spokesperson of the Army's Sixth Infantry
Division, said today that his unit has increased its troops in the
towns of Buldon, Barira and Matanog in Maguindanao to ensure the
safety of the residents and properties in the area.
</P>
<P>
The division also set up strategic checkpoints along a highway
in Mindanao to strengthen check of undocumented foreigners and
other suspicious characters.
</P>
<P>
The move came after last week's foreign terrorists' attack at
Camp Siongco, the division's headquarters located near the town of
Datu Odin Sinsuat, Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
During the suicide attack last Tuesday, two suspected Muslim
extremists, one Pakistani and one Saudi Arabian, shot dead three
soldiers before they themselves were killed.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato denied allegations of Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman
for military affairs, that the army is building up its forces in
the area in preparation for a massive attack at the MILF's Camp
Abubakar, the rebels' biggest enclave in central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Murad threatened to abandon the ongoing peace talks with the
government if the military pursues troop deployment near the camp.
</P>
<P>
Detoyato said the MILF should have "nothing to worry about" the
deployment of government troops and the setting up of checkpoints
because it is all part of a measure to avoid a repeat of the
suicide attack.
</P>
<P>
Both the MILF and another Muslim rebel group, the extremist Abu
Sayyaf, have denied involvement in the attack.

<HEADLINE> Major Expansion under Way at Northeast China Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 14 (Xinhua) -- Jinzhou Port, on the Bohai Sea
in northeast China's Liaoning province, expects to handle an
annual capacity of more than 20 million tons of cargo by the year
2005.
</P>
<P>
A 50,000-dwt (dead weight tons) oil berth has been put into
operation, bringing the port's current capacity to 5.5 million
tons, local sources say.
</P>
<P>
The port is speeding up construction of the next phase
involving 13 production berths of 15,000-dwt to 35,000-dwt, with
an estimated investment of 2.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Work is scheduled for completion in 2005. The funds will partly
come from the stock markets, on which the Jinzhou Port group will
be listed.
</P>
<P>
Construction will begin soon on the No. 5 cargo berth with
a handling capacity of 600,000 tons per year.
</P>
<P>
Jinzhou Port, which opened for service in 1990, is a local
government-funded outlet. It has been approved by the State
Council to open as a state level commercial port. In 1993,
the port took the lead to go public.
</P>
<P>
Its 1996 handling volume doubled that of the previous year, and
the growth rate ranked first among China's ports.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Ease Conditions on Trade with Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan is planning to ease trade
insurance conditions for Russia to promote bilateral trade between
the two countries, a leading Japanese newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Japanese companies' export contracts with
Russian partners will be covered by Japan's official insurance if
a Russian private bank agrees to guarantee payments in case that
the Russian traders fail to pay, said the Yomiuri Shimbun.
</P>
<P>
The current Japanese rule requires the Russian government to
make guarantees.
</P>
<P>
Japan also plans to lower premiums on insurance for trade with
Russia, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Japan has earmarked 2.9 billion U.S. dollars to insure Japanese
exports of oil, energy and other equipment to Russia since the
1991 disintegration of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
But only 1.1 billion dollars were used, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The new Japanese plan will be announced when Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto meets Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on November 1-2 in Krasnoyarsk, east Siberia.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Taxi Drivers Cannot Decline Fares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Taxi drivers in the Chinese
capital will have to think twice before saying "No" to passengers
when a regulation for taxi drivers takes effect in Beijing on
January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The regulation passed last Thursday by the Standing Committee of
the 10th People's Congress of Beijing Municipality orders that
available taxi drivers must accept passengers and not offer
excuses to reject fares.
</P>
<P>
Those who disobey the rules will be fined up to 2,000 yuan
(about 125 to 250 U.S. dollars) and lose their business licenses
for up to three months. In extreme cases, drivers could be
permanently disqualified.
</P>
<P>
The number of taxis in Beijing had increased to 64,400 by the
end of 1996, and 82,000 people are employed in the taxi business,
both ranking first in China, according to Li Zhencheng, director
of the Beijing Taxi Administration.
</P>
<P>
Taxis transport 650 million passengers each year, Li said,
making up about 15 percent of the total transportation volume of
the public traffic in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Taxis have become an essential part of the city life," Li
said. "We hope the regulation will improve services."

YINCHUAN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Quality inter-province roads,
optical-fiber cables, frequant air flights and new bridges
spanning the Yellow River all have one thing in common: they
link the outside world with the minority-inhabited Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
It is a far cry now from the 1980s when the region remained
underdeveloped because of its inland location and poor
communications.
</P>
<P>
To improve the situation for the region's 5.2 million people,
the Chinese government has been committed to revamping area's
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia's roads were extended by an annual average of 330
kilometers for six consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
A road network with regional capital Yinchuan at its hub has
been expanded with 13 state and provincial trunk roads and another
100 administered by county or township governments, said Chen
Minqiu, director of the region's transport department. Chen said
the region's roads now cover at least 8,700 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The local government also built an 83-kilometer high-speed
expressway, the largest investment of its kind in the region, and
two others are under construction, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Six new bridges above the Yellow River, which winds through
Ningxia, also have improved access to the region.
</P>
<P>
"We are ushering in a new era by building these roads," Chen
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- About three quarters of Chinese
parents affirm the role of educational testing, but believe
reforms are needed in the examination system, according to a
survey of 1,500 families.
</P>
<P>
Conducted in China's five cities -- Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Xiamen and Chongqing -- the survey showed that only 12
percent of the parents completely support the current system.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the current system cited the psychological pressure
on students and the narrow range of knowledge tested by the
examinations, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
Among those questioned, more than 300 say their children are
near-sighted. Parents attributed the vision problems to the
examinations.
</P>
<P>
However, less than 10 percent of the parents think the
disadvantages of the examination outweigh the advantages. Parents
recognize the role that the examination plays in the evaluation
process.
</P>
<P>
Parents between the age of 35 and 44 were the most supportive
of the current system, while most of those under 25 were
critical. Also, those with higher education levels tended to be
more critical of the system.

<HEADLINE> Japan Gains Trade Surplus in April-September Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Japan gained a global merchandise
trade surplus of 5,101.8 billion yen (about 42.9 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first half of fiscal 1997 starting from
April, or 75.9 percent up than that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise, the first in four and a half years, was attributed to
slower import growth stemming from sluggish domestic demand and
robust exports amid the yen's weakness against the dollar, the
Finance Ministry said in a preliminary report today.
</P>
<P>
The exports increased by 15.6 percent to 25,287.1 billion yen
(about 212.5 billion dollars) in the April-September period,
boosted by strong exports of automobiles and computers, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
A weaker yen makes dollar-denominated Japanese exports more
competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Imports in the same period amounted to 20,185.2 billion yen
(about 169.6 billion dollars), with their growth limited to 6.4
percent amid weak domestic demand following the consumption tax
hike, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan's politically sensitive trade surplus with the United
States swelled by 55.3 percent to 2,423.6 billion yen (about 20.4
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The country's surplus with the European Union totaled 1,145.7
billion yen (about 9.6 billion dollars), up by 110.9 percent,
while that with Asian nations rose by 26.4 percent to 3,335.4
billion yen (about 28 billion dollars), posing the first increase
in two years.
</P>
<P>
The half-year results mainly reflected the effects of the April
1 consumption tax hike from three to five percent, which has
dampened personal spending at home and encouraged companies to
sell goods abroad, an official from the Finance Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry "does not rule out the possibility that Japan's
trade surplus will expand over the short term," he added.

<P>
KUNMING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Yunnan
Province has allocated one billion yuan for the expansion of the
Kunming Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Kunming Airport, which completed its first phase of
expansion in 1990, is a State category-A airport, which means it
is capable of accommodating large passenger airliners such as
Boeing 747s. The airport is equipped with modern technology
consistent with international standards.
</P>
<P>
However, the expanded airport cannot meet the needs for the
province's opening up to the outside and the growth of its
tourism industry. Last year, the airport handled
more than 4 million passengers, ranking sixth in China. That
number is expected to grow at a yearly rate of 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
The airport expansion work will be completed by the end of
1997. The work includes a passenger terminal with a floor space of
74,000 square meters, a 120,000-square-meter apircraft parking
apron, a 20,000-square-meter cargo transport center and a 50,000-
square-meter parking lot, according to Liu Jing, vice-governor of
Yunnan and director of the project.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the airport would be capable of handling 10 billion
passengers annually when the expansion is completed.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that the provincial and city governments plan to
invest another one billion yuan or more for roads and a water-supply
system, as well as urban greening and environmental protection
efforts.
</P>
<P>
As part of the construction, a sign will be built to greet
the '99 Gardening Exposition in Kunming. Liu, also in charge of
the exposition, said the Chinese government values the opportunity
to host such a world-level exposition. Chinese Premier Li Peng has
sent invitation letters to leaders of 162 countries.

SINGAPORE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's worst ever oil
spill, resulting from the collision between two tankers last
Wednesday night, may cost about 100 million U.S. dollars, local
newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
The oil spill clean-up operations, the damage to vessels,
Singapore government claims and other claims can cost up to no
more than 100 million dollars, the Business Times' Shipping Times
quoted insurance industry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Thai-registered very large crude carrier Orapin Global and
the Cyprus-flagged Evoikos, which was carrying 120,000 tons of
fuel oil, collided in the Singapore Straits last Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
An estimated total of 25,000 tons of oil from Evoikos was spilt
into the sea off southern Singapore after the collision, causing
the worst ever oil spill pollution in Singapore's history.
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times today quoted shipping sources as saying that
human error could have been the cause of the collision. The matter
is still being investigated and the Maritime and Port Authority of
Singapore (MPA) has not come up with its comment on the cause of
the collision.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, an MPA spokesman told the Shipping Times that
is was too early to assess the extent of the damage caused by the
oil spill.
</P>
<P>
An MPA statement Sunday night said that the clean-up operation
is still continuing and has entered the next phase where the
emphasis is on the recovery of oil. A total of 45 anti-pollution
craft have been deployed for skimming, collecting oil from the sea
and laying of booms.

KUALA LUMPUR, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia today proposed
the establishment of a permanent forum for nine ASEAN members to
facilitate strategies to deal with rural development and poverty
eradication in meeting related challenges of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Such a forum would enable member countries to exchange
expertise and experiences consistently in relation to rural
development and poverty eradication, Malaysian Rural Development
Minister Annuar Musa told reporters today after opening the
inaugural ASEAN Senior Officials Meeting on Rural Development and
Poverty Eradication in Subang Jaya near here.
</P>

Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Annuar said, "Almost all ASEAN members, maybe except Singapore,
are still facing the same problem on the matter although of
different magnitude."
</P>
<P>
He said the two-day senior officials meeting would discuss at
length the Malaysian proposal, hoping a consensus could be
reached.
</P>
<P>
He sad Malaysia also hoped the meeting could reach consensus on
adopting an action plan on rural development and poverty
eradication, which he said would include efforts in research,
technology and training of human resources towards rural
development and eradicating poverty using locally available
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that Singapore, which had been very
supportive of the whole idea from the very start, would have a
prominent role especially in human resource training.
</P>
<P>
He said that ASEAN member countries could exchange experiences
in how they reduced bureaucracy which hindered effective rural
development and poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials meeting attended by some 100 senior
officials from all ASEAN countries and Cambodia is in preparation

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Grows Rice on Shore Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A new variety of rice, Haifeng,
is selling well on the Shanghai market because it matures weeks
earlier than other varieties.
</P>
<P>
The rice comes from the Haifeng Farm, built on shore land in
outlying areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, faces a pressing
problem to find new land for farming while accommodating rapid
urbanization. The farm began reclaiming shore land three years ago,
spending 80 million yuan developing 4,000 hectares of farmland,
with an annual production capacity of 27 million kilograms of
rice. A modern rice plantation is taking shape on the shore land as
a result.
</P>
<P>
Consumers say the new rice variety is of high quality, which
producers attribute to the clean water, soil, and fresh air, as
well as improved seeds.
</P>
<P>
China Greenfood Development Center has listed the Haifeng rice
variety as an acceptable food throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai plans to produce 2 billion kilograms of grain annually
by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> China's Financial Situation Relatively Stable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China's retail and consumer
prices have slightly increased while its financial situation is
relatively stable over the past nine months.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Xiaohua, spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau, said
that at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
According to Qiu, the retail prices only increased by 1.3
percent over the same period of last year because of the ample
market supply, while the consumer prices rose by 3.4 percent, a
factor beneficial for the country's further reform and steady
development.
</P>
<P>
Qiu said that in the first three quarters, domestic revenue has
increased by 24.7 percent over the same period of 1996, with the
expenditure up by 17.9 percent, 6.8 percentage points lower than
the growth rate of revenue.
</P>
<P>
But the growth rate of bank deposits and loans slowed down. Qiu
said that over the past nine months, the increase in deposits
reached 886.4 billion yuan (about 110 billion US dollars), or
234.1 billion yuan (about 29 billion US dollars) less than the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase in loans reached 635.3 billion yuan (about 79
billion US dollars), or 1.9 billion yuan (about 0.2 billion US
dollars) less than the same period of 1996, said Qiu.

<HEADLINE> Women Swimmers Mature to Bear Torch for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China embraced a new swimming
era when two world records and 11 Asian marks cracked at the
Eighth National Games, signaling the advent of young stars to
carry forward the torch from the veterans.
</P>
<P>
The most prolific star was 16-year-old Chen Yan, who bagged
home four individual gold medals by bettering two world records.
</P>
<P>
The teenager excited herself and the fans in the women's 400m
individual medley by clocking four minutes and 34.79 seconds,
breaking the 15-year-old record of 4:36.10 set up in 1982 when
Chen was only a one-year-old baby girl.
</P>
<P>
The native swimmer of Liaoning province, savored her second
feat by breaking another world mark of 2:11.65 in the 200m
individual medley in 2:11.27, which was eventually won by Wu
Yanyan of Guangxi, a hopeful from the Zhuang minority populace.
</P>
<P>
But it was a long way for Chen before she celebrated her
stardom here. Chen caught the spotlight in the national trials
for the Atlanta Games with four golds in five events, but suffered
her slump when she failed to make any of the finals in her three
events in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Her strong comeback in the National Games rippled the swimming
pool and she was secretly cherishing the foresight of hoisting the
national colors by proving her prowess and stamina in the world
arena.
</P>
<P>
"I sincerely hope that I can do better in the coming World
Swimming Championships in Perth. For it, I will resume training
as soon as possible after the Games," said the teenager.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yunpeng, former head coach of the Chinese national team,
praised her as a promising swimmer with great potentials, saying
"if she can prove herself to the world in Perth, she is surely to
be one of the most glittering super stars."
</P>
<P>
Wu Yanyan, 19, captured the gold in the women's 200m individual
medley with a world record time of 2:09.72, a juicy fruit
nourished in 12-year hard training.
</P>
<P>
"She has swum three million meters in the pool this year,"
coach Wu Jicai chatted about Wu Yanyan who clocked her personal
best in 1996 with the year's fastest of 2:12.87.
</P>
<P>
The onslaught of the youngesters was so strong that they even
shadowed the aurae of the veterans who made China a swimming giant
in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Le Jingyi, who set the world records in both 50m and 100m
freestyles at the Rome World Swimming Championships in 1994, had
to make do with one individual title from the 100m event.
</P>
<P>
Le, the lone swimming champion for China in Atlanta, was beaten
in her 50-meter speciality by a 19-year-old star Shan Ying.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the 22-year-old still hoped to challenge herself, saying
"her aim is to compete in the Sydney Olympic Games in 2000."
</P>
<P>
He Cihong, another veteran with the 100m backstroke world
record in her name, failed to recover from a slump after the 1994
Swimming Worlds by crashing in the 100m backstroke and taking home
barely a silver in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
Overtaking her status as a backstroke queen was Zhen Yingjuan
of Guangdong province.
</P>
<P>
Butterfly specialist Liu Limin, who ended China's swimming
drought at the World University Games in Fukuoka, Japan in 1995,
protracted her bad span in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
She even failed to enter the 100m butterfly finals by finishing
fourth in the heats for the biggest upset at the Games, and missed
her last chance in the 200m event with a distance fourth place.
</P>
<P>
To evaluate the great performances of the women swimmers in the
Games, a top official of the Chinese national swimming team warned
both the young and veterans against pre-mature conceit and the
tough challenges ahead in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Our women swimmers really had the morale-boosting performances
in the Games. But all these feats were achieved at home, the tough
atmosphere in international meets are quite different," said Lin
Senlin, head of the national team.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Ming, deputy head coach of the national team, echoed Lin's
point, saying "if they can keep their forms at the coming World
Championships in Perth, these women swimmers can then be
recognized as the matured stars with promising prospects."
</P>
<P>
While the women swimmers keep the image of China as a swimming
power, their men peers also made impressive progresses in the
Games by beating five Asian records.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese men swimmers remain vulnerable as their
times still lagged far behind the world records, even against the
Asian marks, many of them were still held by the Japanese and the
South Koreans.

<HEADLINE> India Needs Two Mega Ports: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 20 (Xinhua)-- India needs two mega ports if
it has to match other major ports like Rotterdam and Singapore,
The Hindustan Times quoted a recent study as saying here today.
</P>
<P>
These two ports handle more traffic than the 11 major ports in
India put together.
</P>
<P>
The new ports should be located in the west and east coasts as
the present ports in the country are lacking facilities to handle
the traffic. Ships presently have to wait for long periods in the
channel for berthing.
</P>
<P>
A paper on "Potential problems and strategies for port
development" by R. Ramakrishnan, senior manager for port planning
and development of Jawaharlal Nehru Port, was presented at a
national seminar on Infrastructure Development here recently, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The productivity in loading and unloading was very low and the
waiting period for ships in the channel was considerably high
compared with other international ports, the study said.
</P>
<P>
Giving figures for the traffic handled by India's 11 major
ports compared with international ports in 1995, Ramakrishnan
said in his paper that the total for Indian ports was 215 million
tons while Rotterdam alone handled 288 million tons and Singapore
274 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The customs procedures need to be made more user friendly as
this was leading to main line vessels skipping Indian ports and
calling at Sri Lanka, Dubai and Singapore with feeder vessels
operating to Indian ports, he said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's External Trade Increases in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's total trade
increased 11.7 percent in September at current prices on a
three-month moving average basis, with growth recorded in both
exports and imports, the Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB)
said today.
</P>
<P>
It said that exports grew 8.8 percent and imports increased
11.7 percent, while non-oil domestic exports rose 9.4 percent. But
oil exports growth declined 2.5 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the TDB said, non-oil domestic exports
increased 15.8 percent, following a moderate growth of 5.5
percent in August. This is the fourth consecutive month of
positive growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
As non-oil domestic exports increased to reach 8.5 billion
Singapore dollars (about 5.48 billion U.S. dollars), the TDB said
exports to the United States, the European Union and Hong Kong
achieved double-digit growth of 10.7 percent, 12.6 percent and 20
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In September, re-exports recorded an increase of 10.5 percent
to reach a total of 7.3 billion Singapore dollars (about 4.71
billion U.S. dollars). The increase was mainly in re-exports of
integrated circuits, computer parts, and peripherals, disk drives,
and other electronics products.
</P>
<P>
Imports increased 14.6 percent, amounting to 17.4 billion
Singapore dollars (about 11.23 billion U.S. dollars). The growth
was reflected in increases of imports of integrated circuits,
computer parts and peripherals, disk drives, semiconductors and
parts, and other electronics products, the TDB said.

<HEADLINE> NZ Stocks Finish Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand share market
drifted lower today in very thin trading value.
</P>
<P>
The fall was caused partly by stocks going ex-dividend, and
partly by the caution among small investors who remembered the
share market crash 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The NZSE40 index ended 11 points lower at 2563 with a turnover
of only 28 million NZ dollars (18 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The leaders were mixed. Telecom shares rose 4 cents to 824
cents, and Lion Nathan gained 2 cents to 397 cents. But Fletcher
Energy lost 22 cents to 763 cents, Brierley Investment eased 1
cent to 133 cents and Air New Zealand dipped 12 cents to 273
cents.

<P>
Carter Holt Harvey remained stable at 350 cents.

<HEADLINE> Thai Finance Firms Take Back More Unpaid Cars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Finance firms in Thailand have
taken back more than 10,000 cars in the past few months as car
owners are unable to pay their monthly installments, local
newspaper "the Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand only 20 percent of car buyers can afford cash
payments, while the rest 80 percent depend on finance companies
for loans, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Thailand has ordered finance firms to take back
cars if their owners fail to pay two months' installments, as a
means to discourage spending on luxury goods at a time of economic
slump.
</P>
<P>
In the past, repossessing of cars normally took place when
monthly installments were delayed for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy slump has left an estimated 100,000
people, both white and blue-collar employees, jobless this year.
And wage cuts have left many car owners unable to pay
installments.
</P>
<P>
The cars taken back are either auctioned or resold at lower
prices to generate cash flow.
</P>
<P>
To increase sales, finance companies often do not require
buyers of repossessed cars for down payment, but the purchases are
subject to a higher interest rate.

In the previous round of voting on October 5, none of the eight
candidates received more than half the votes, but Djukanovic and
Bulatovic got the most votes.
</P>

Bulatovic's campaign manager reportedly told an independent
Belgrade radio station that he had lost "by several thousand

<HEADLINE> State-owned Enterprises Privatized in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh government has
been privatizing the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and the
foreign investors could purchase them, well-informed sources from
the country's Privatization Board (PB) said today.
</P>
<P>
PB Chairman Kazi Zafrullah called upon foreign investors to
come forward to invest in the country while addressing a group of
British businessmen in Dhaka recently, according to a PB press
release.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the firm determination and commitment of the
government about privatizing SOEs, Kazi Zafrullah said
privatization is the political agenda of the present government.
</P>
<P>
In the present-day context of free market economy,
privatization is a compelling necessity for a country like
Bangladesh as the government could hardly bear any further losses
by SOEs, the PB chief stated.
</P>
<P>
The public sector enterprises in Bangladesh are incurring an
average annual loss of 25 billion taka (about 568 million U.S.
dollars), according to recent report by a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The PB chief stated that the government has recently
reorganized the board by appointing six parliament members as
members of the board in bid to strengthen the privatization body.
</P>
<P>
The PB chairman opined that the organized labor unions, the
bureaucracy with vested interest and the politicians are
responsible for the slow pace in disinvesting state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
To overcome the difficulties in privatization, the board has
recently initiated mass awareness program, the PB chief stated,
adding that a draft law has also been prepared for giving greater
authority to the Board and the draft law would be placed before
the parliament for approval shortly.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet to Resign to Make Way for Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 20 (Xinhua) -- All 48 members in the Thai
Cabinet will tender their resignations by Tuesday to make way for
the prime minister to form a new cabinet, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made late last night following a meeting
of leaders or top executives of the six coalition parties. Prime
Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, foreseeing a pressure for him to
resign, did not show up at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The mass resignation would leave all the powers in the hands of
the prime minister in the reshuffle, although there was pressure
from the meeting that Chavalit should not remain as prime minister
given the present economic problems and confidence crisis.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the coalition leaders signed a declaration
vowing that they would stick together.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of Chavalit's New Aspiration Party Sanoh
Thienthong, who was present at the meeting, said afterwards that
the prime minister would use politicians from the six coalition
partners and that there would be no opposition parties brought in
the large-scale reshuffle, especially of the economic ministries.
</P>
<P>
Chatichai Choonhavan, leader of the Chart Pattana Party, the
second largest in the coalition government, will consult with the
prime minister "to find knowledgeable and capable people to fill
these posts (the economic ministries) in such a way that there
will be no political limitations", Sanoh was quoted as telling
local reporters last night.
</P>
<P>
Because of economic and financial slump and confidence crisis,
pressure to force Prime Minister Chavalit to step down has come
not only from some of the coalition parties and the opposition,
but also from the business circle and some political groups.
</P>
<P>
A number of demonstrations have been planned for this week to
exercise pressure on the prime minister to quit.

<HEADLINE> DuPont Strengthens Footholds in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The US chemical giant DuPont
has found a huge market and partners who share its vision in
China, and its long-term strategy also fits well with China's
industrial development blueprint, according to DuPont China's
General Manager Paul Wong.
</P>
<P>
Since setting up its first office in Beijing in 1984, it has
invested in three wholely-owned enterprises, eight joint ventures,
and four representative offices in seven coastal cities. Its
investment in the country exceeds 300 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
DuPont has undergone portfolio adjustment in the past few years
and focuses on its core business: energy and chemicals. These
industries also get top priority for development from the Chinese
Government.
</P>
<P>
In his office overlooking the busiest street in Beijing, Wong
told Xinhua that the time is ripe for DuPont to expand its
operations in China. DuPont has the largest polyester film
production line of in the country in Guangdong province, and a
state-of-the-art fiber factory in Shanghai that will account for
four percent of the world's output of spandex after it starts
production in 1998. Most of DuPont's products will go directly to
the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Sources at DuPont said the company will increase investment in
China to one billion US dollars by the year 2000, and the company
will provide products and technology that China needs while using
the country's vigor for its own growth in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Wong believes that DuPont has brought more than just products to
China. "We have trained a large number of outstanding business
managers for China," he notes.
</P>
<P>
DuPont offers training for its 1,100 employees in China, and
introduced its company culture into the country by shaping its
employees' work style with the theme of "safety, ethics,
environment, and people."
</P>
<P>
Scholarships are also provided for the best universities in
China, and thousands of Chinese students have been the
beneficiaries of these.
</P>
<P>
DuPont has put funds into local institutes for research and
development projects and has transferred over ten patents on
technology to China for 18 science and production projects.
</P>
<P>
Wong said that no matter what happens to the two countries's
relation, DuPont is committed to the China market. He said that
the United States and China are like partners in a long journey,
and it is natural for them to have disputes sometimes.
</P>
<P>
He is delighted to see that there is a growing awareness in the
United States that, as two big countries, the US and China should
seek common points while putting aside differences, so as to
maintain long-term stable co-operation.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Jiang Zemin's visit to the US later this
month will help mutual understanding and enhance trust between the two
countries and promote bilateral economic and trade co-operation.

<HEADLINE> Ford Expands China Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Marco Polo visited China more
than 700 years ago and discovered that when on business becoming
part of a country was much more rewarding than simply visiting a
country.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Company, today, has discovered that becoming
involved in building vehicles in China is much more rewarding than
simply selling vehicles in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ford's No.1 priority in China for 1997 is to successfully
participate in the joint development of light commercial vehicles
known as China Transit. Ford will join Jiangling Motors Company
(JMC) in Jiangxi province to produce the vehicles, according to
Vaughn Koshkarian, vice-president of Ford Motor Company and
president of Ford Motor (China) Limited.
</P>
<P>
He said Ford increased its equity share in JMC from 20 percent
to 30 percent in March this year, with the company investing more
than 50 million US dollars in an effort to develop nine-seat and
12-seat vehicles.
</P>
<P>
China Transit will feature JMC's power train technology
combined with technology developed by Ford European Transit.
</P>
<P>
Production is scheduled to begin in December this year, said
Koshkarian, adding that about 60 percent of the vehicle's parts will be
initially manufactured in China, with future plans calling all
parts and components to be produced in the country.
</P>
<P>
Ford established its Office of China Affairs in November 1978
and has since invested over 350 million US dollars to establish
five joint ventures in the country.
</P>
<P>
Koshkarian said years of effort have enabled China to
dramatically improve its investment environment. He noted that the
continuous improvement and development of Sino-US relations has
greatly strengthened Ford's confidence in China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that sound relations between the two nations
will create even more good opportunities and will greatly
improve the environment for bilateral trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign investors are also interested in investing in
China's central and western regions, and noted that Ford and
Chinese companies are actively discussing investment posibilities
in those areas.
</P>
<P>
Ford and China's State Science and Technology Commission
jointly produced China's first methanol-fuel vehicle in 1996. He
said the joint effort with Datong Motors Company showed that China
has made great progress in developing vehicles using alternative
fuel.
</P>
<P>
Koshkarian recalled Ford's development in China and noted the
great potential for the future development of China's automotive
industry. He said Ford is fully committed to expanding cooperation
with China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that expanded cooperation will not only promote Ford's
development, but will also provide an opportunity for the company
to participate in China's modernization strive.

<HEADLINE> China Suspends Urea Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- China plans to suspend imports
of ureas due to a glut in the domestic fertilizer market, China
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, China has become the largest urea
importer in the world as its crop yield has seen sustained
increases.
</P>
<P>
For the first half of this year, 2.6 million tons of urea were
imported, aggravating the overcapacity of fertilizer
supply. Because of their low prices, plus exemptions of value-added
taxes on the imports, domestic fertilizer suppliers have been hit
seriously.
</P>
<P>
The nation's 11 large nitrogen producers recently made an
urgent appeal to the state authorities in charge of adjusting
relevant policies to retain the viability of their operations.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Chemical Industry has set the goal of meeting
the domestic demand for nitrogenous fertilizers.
</P>
<P>
However, the price of urea in the international market has
dropped dramatically because of sharp reductions in China's
imports for the first half of this year.

1998-2003 presidency, and thanked the group and the people for it.
</P>
<P>
However, Soeharto urged Golkar to ensure that the people really

<HEADLINE> New Office Space Threatens Beijing Mart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's office market is
threatened by an explosion in the amount of new office space,
which is expected to reach 2.5 million square meters by the end of
the year, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Property agents predict that Beijing's office vacancy level
will soar to 35 percent this year, resulting in softening sales
and rental markets as new buildings come on stream.
</P>
<P>
Prices of grade-A office buildings in Beijing average at 3,000
US dollars per square meter, and rent at 35 US dollars per square
meter a month, and some decrease to less than 25 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Some overseas developers adopted another strategy to shift from
office building to apartment and residential housing development.
</P>
<P>
Overseas developers are encouraged to invest in residential
housing which share preferential policies such as decrease of the
land transfer fee, according to Bai Yunsheng, the investment
division chief of the Beijing Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of the year, about 257,000 square meters of
new office space became available, including the newly completed
towers, like Bright China Chang'an Building, Full Link Plaza and
the Henderson Center.
</P>
<P>
Most office-building developers are starting to offer
attractive rents and renovation allowances as a letting incentive.
</P>
<P>
The emergence of new office buildings is beginning to have an
influence on traditional prime offices, which still shoulder the
pressure form the current slump.
</P>
<P>
"The price plunge is in anticipation of Beijing's market
entering a saturation period. However, it can't keep up for long,"
said a senior manager of Scitech Tower.
</P>
<P>
A report from C. Y. Leung Research Co. Ltd said that since
prevailing market rents are already very competitive in terms of
absolute value, further moderation is extremely unlikely. The
present trough is expected to level out in the second half of this
year.

PRAGUE, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The total output of Skoda is
expected to reach 340,000 units this year, up more than 30 percent
over last year, sources from the Czech Skoda car factory said.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months, the car output amounted to
258,000 units, representing an increase of 32.4 percent compared
with the same period of last year, and nearly equal to the total

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sales volume of Skoda set a record of 162,000
units during the first six months of this year, most of which were
sold to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
The Skoda factory has a history of 100 years. The cars it
manufactured are welcomed with low prices and fine quality.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, it became a joint venture with the German Volkswagen
Automobile Corporation. At present, Skoda's supply falls far short
of demand.

<HEADLINE> International Meeting on El Nino to Open in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- An international meeting will be
held from November 6 to 9 in Manila to explore ways to mitigate
the effects of the El Nino phenomenon currently sweeping the
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
This was announced Sunday by Senator Heherson Alvarez, founding
chairman of the Earth Savers Movement and a main convenor of the
international meeting, according to today's local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino conference, coinciding with the Asia-Pacific
Clean-up the World meeting, will focus on the global preparations
for El Nino, including steps to counter flooding and drought.
</P>
<P>
"The experience of other countries in relation to El Nino with
resources and expertise from all sectors in our country will be
pooled in a coordinated comprehensive communications program to
mitigate the impact of extreme drought," said Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
Some 100 delegates from 20 countries participating in the
Clean-up the World program will join local experts in exploring
information and action plans against El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino weather phenomenon is caused by the warming of
Pacific waters off South America, and is widely blamed for such
abnormal climatic activities as prolonged dry spells, warm winters
and heavy flooding.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, which occurs in the Pacific basin every two to nine
years, is predicted by weathermen to strike the Philippines and
other Southeast Asian countries late this year and will last until
the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some El Nino-related phenomena, including delayed onset of
rainy season and weak monsoon activity, have been recorded in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has increased its budget allocations
for water conservation projects to provide against a possible long
spell of drought caused by El Nino.
</P>
<P>
The worst El Nino-related drought in the country happened in
1982-1983, which affected the entire Philippines and resulted in a
serious food shortage in the country.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Build Two New Special Economic Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, October 19 (Xinhua) -- The Polish government has
decided to build two new special hi-tech economic zones, namely,
the Modlin and Krakow special economic zones, the Polish Press
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Modlin Special Economic Zone, covering an area of 1,256
hectares, is located in northern Poland and will provide 8,600 job
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
It will be dedicated to the development of such industries as
electronics, chemistry, sophisticated instrument, aviation,
mechanics, automobile and food processing.
</P>
<P>
The Krakow Special Economic Zone that covers an area of 66.5
hectares is designed to establish link between institutes of
higher learning and industries and is expected to provide about
10,000 job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The priority of development in the Krakow economic zone
includes vacuum technology, energy and material saving,
communications, posts and telecommunications, health care,
non-traditional energy, medicine, biotechnology and biogenetic
engineering.
</P>
<P>
Investors with investment up to the required amount will
receive duty-free treatment in the first six years and pay only
half of the tax in the second six years.
</P>
<P>
Polish Parliament passed the Special Economic Zone Law in
October 1994. The first zone was established in September 1995,
followed by the building of another 15 zones.
</P>
<P>
The special economic zones have helped absorb both domestic and
foreign funds, advance industrial restructuring and economic
development and improve employment in the related regions.

ROME, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Some passengers coming from a
number of European countries will be exempt from passport checks
beginning Sunday in an effort to speed up the creation of a
border-free Europe.
</P>
<P>
The exemption, also called the "Schengen Revolution," will be
in effect at Rome and Milan's international airports for
passengers from Italy, Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, France, Spain
and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
These countries have been adhering to the "Schengen Accord," a
pact signed by most EU countries in 1985, which provides for the
removal of border controls between EU member states.
</P>
<P>
From Sunday (Oct. 26), the passengers traveling to any of the
"Schengen" nations can go via special passport-check-free routes
to ten gates reserved for "Schengen" flights.
</P>
<P>
However, the passengers will still have to go through
metal-detectors.
</P>
<P>
Those arriving at the airports from the "Schengen" Area will go
through a customs-free route, directly to their baggage.
</P>
<P>
Those in-transit passengers who arrive on "Schengen" flights
but come from other parts of the world, will await their outgoing
flights in a specially reserved area.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 20 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide medicine storage
and supply network will soon be established - preparing China for
natural disasters, epidemics and other emergencies, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The State Pharmaceutical Administration (SPA) recently released
a circular asking local governments to support the founding of
medicine storage facilities in accord with their local
conditions. The administration also invited experts to compile a
list of medicines to be included in the network, said Wang
Chunlei, a SPA division chief in charge of medicine.
</P>
<P>
A national meeting will be held at the end of the year to
discuss details for managing the network and exchange experiences
in disaster and emergency rescue, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
The action is in response to the State Council's call to reform
the medical storage and supply sector, better preparing the nation
for disasters and emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The State Council issued the call in July, when it was
discovered shrinking medical storage supplies can no longer
satisfy the nation's needs when disasters and emergencies occur.
</P>
<P>
Wang blamed the situation on the rapid population growth and
increase of such natural disasters as flooding, drought and
earthquakes.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Balance of Payments Deficit Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 20 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) deficit has narrowed down to 1.8 billion U.S.
dollars as of end-August this year after surging to 2.3 billion
dollars as of end-July, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The latest BOP deficit estimate was based on a net
international reserves (NIR) level of 8.3 billion dollars, said
the reports, citing data released recently by the Central Bank of
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The net international reserves are the central bank's gross
foreign exchange holdings less its short-term foreign exchange
liabilities.
</P>
<P>
The BOP, a system of accounts that covers a particular period
and records the flow of real resources between a country and the
rest of world, is estimated based on a change in the NIR.
</P>
<P>
The central bank did not explain why the BOP deficit as of
end-August shrank. But the reports quoted some economic analysts
as saying the decline could be due to possible increase in medium
and long-term loans.
</P>
<P>
The analysts also said that part of the reason could be the
recovery of investments with the easing of negative market
sentiment, following the central bank's decision to allow the
float of the Philippine peso in July.
</P>
<P>
The 1.8 billion dollars BOP deficit for the first eight months
was a dismal figure compared with the 4.02 billion dollars BOP
surplus registered during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Still, the latest BOP figure was better compared with the BOP
deficit target of 2.5 billion dollars set by the central bank for
the period.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has completely reversed the targeted BOP for
1997 from a surplus of 2.9 billion dollars to a deficit of 2
billion dollars, taking into account the capital flight from the
country due to the current currency crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 19 (Xinhua)-- Hundreds of Filipinos who
fought for the United States more than 50 years ago have filed a
lawsuit seeking equal compensation as American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed by 220 Filipino veterans who are in their
70s and living in the United States, is the latest in a series
of efforts to win their equal rights.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, some Filipino old soldiers have
held protests and hunger strikes to draw attention from the
public as well as concerned authorities in Los Angeles and
other cities, demanding full benefits and back pay for their
contribution to and sacrifice for U.S. victory over Japan during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
The Filipinos faced the same dangers as American soldiers and
are entitled to equal compensations as "conscripted soldiers" in
the U.S. Army, according to the lawsuit filed Friday.

ADDIS ABABA, October 19 (Xinhua) -- A child protection and
care coordinating office has been inaugurated on the premise of
the Addis Ababa regional police commission, a report from the
Ethiopian News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the office on Saturday, Legesse Tegegn,
representative of the Federal Police Commission said the police
is among the responsible government agencies charged with the
task of ensuring the rights and welfare of children enshrined in
the United Nations Convention as well as the Constitution of the
Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
Legesse pointed out that some researches conducted in the
country indicate that criminal offenses perpetrated against
children are growing at an alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
As children are immature both physically and mentally to guard
themselves against various kinds of abuses, the police should
give priority to protect children in their daily activity of
maintaining peace and security of the general public, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the effort of the police alone could not
bring about the desired result. He called on governmental
organizations, non-governmental organizations and the public at
large to cooperate with the police to enable them carry out their
duties effectively.
</P>
<P>
The newly established child protection and care coordinating
office has three offices and two reception rooms for juvenile
delinquents.

<HEADLINE> Greeks Stage Roadblocks to Protest Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Villagers in northern Greece
today staged roadblocks along the national highway to protest
against the Greek government's plan to merge local communities.
</P>
<P>
Villagers from Drymos, near Pierias, closed off the
Thessaloniki-Kilkis road for nearly two hours today with tractors
and heavy farm machinery while villagers in the prefecture of
Thessaly blocked the same road at Velestinou.
</P>
<P>
Under the Capodistrias plan, named after independent Greece's
first governor, Ioannis Capodistrias, most local communities will
be absorbed into the largest nearby council while the total number
of councils themselves will be reduced to 1,033 from 5,775 today.
</P>
<P>
Since the announcement of the plan which was tabled in the
Greek Parliament earlier this month, villagers across the country
have staged similar roadblocks to voice their opposition against
the government plan.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition party, New Democracy, has said that the
party was firmly opposed to the merger plan, but was not in favor
of the roadblocks staged by villagers.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Government Not Back-Pedal on Medicine Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, October 19 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister said today
that his government would not change its pricing policy for
medicines which aims at rationalizing health spending and ensuring
better and cheaper health care for the Greeks.
</P>
<P>
"We will not yield on our pharmaceuticals policy, because we
want cheap medicines and only in this way can we ensure the health
of the people, Simitis said in Grevena while touring western
Macedonia in the northern part of Greece.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of the decision that had taken to
adjust prices on medicines, saying that this calculated to save
money and contain the phenomenon of excessive use of medication.
</P>
<P>
Simitis criticized those who oppose such a policy, saying that
opposition to the policy came from those thinking only of vast
profits. Fair business practice and the interests of the Greek
people were not foremost in their minds, he added.
</P>
<P>
Pharmaceutical companies in the country have criticized a
recent government decision to cut healthcare costs by 80 billion
drachmas (about 287.2 million U.S. dollars) through the reduction
of profits margins in the industry.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government has announced earlier this month that
price of 4,075 drugs would be reduced by an average of 19 percent
while another 1,934 drugs' prices would increase by an average of
14 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pharmacists have declared an indefinite strike on October 31 to
demonstrate their opposition to the government decision.
