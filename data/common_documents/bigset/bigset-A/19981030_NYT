MALONE WANTED KENNEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
was forced to hire Davey Johnson as manager by President Bob
Graziano, according to three sources with ties to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Malone's choice was Kevin Kennedy, but Graziano insisted on
Johnson, who was named manager a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graziano felt the team needed a high-profile manager with a
proven record and went with Johnson,'' said one source. ``Believe
me, the job was Kennedy's until Graziano intervened.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson won the World Series with the New York Mets in 1986. His
managerial record is 985-727 and his .575 winning percentage is
tops among active managers.
</P>
<P>
   The sources all said former Dodgers general manager Tom Lasorda
also was in favor of Kennedy, a Dodgers minor-league manager from
1984 through '91 and San Fernando Valley native who wanted to
return to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Graziano and Malone couldn't be reached for comment on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   During his interview with Kennedy, Graziano reportedly spent
most of it probing the one-time manager of the Boston Red Sox and
Texas Rangers about his lifestyle when he was a Dodgers employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin was a little wild when he was younger and Graziano was
more interested in that than he was in Kevin's baseball knowledge
and leadership skills,'' said another source. ``Graziano still
listens to Charlie Blaney (recently ousted Dodgers minor-league
chief), who didn't like Kennedy.''

AUTUMN LEAFLETS OF A LABOR PROTEST  
 SURGERY INSTEAD OF DISCOVERY  
 BROADCAST NOTES  
 HAPPY BIRTHDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New-York Historical Society's white-columned
museum on Central Park West is not a happy place. Union workers,
complaining that their contract expired 20 months ago, have been
handing leaflets to big-name guests arriving for events.
</P>
<P>
   The workers, who object to the society's offer of a 2 percent
wage increase, were on the sidewalk on Monday evening as guests
arrived for two events, one a discussion with former Police
Commissioner WILLIAM BRATTON and Queens District Attorney RICHARD
BROWN.
</P>
<P>
   The leafleting went more smoothly than it did earlier in the
month. On Oct. 13, the executive director, BETSY GOTBAUM, got into
a shouting match after she accused the workers of trying to
``force'' a leaflet into the hands of REBA WHITE WILLIAMS, a
sponsor of the reception she was attending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was completely outrageous,'' said FRED JOHNSON, an official
of Local 2110 of the Technical, Office and Professional Union,
affiliated with the United Auto Workers. Of Mrs. Gotbaum, he said,
``She was going on that we had absolutely no right to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gotbaum said she was ``infuriated'' that the workers had
followed Mrs. Williams up the museum steps. ``I went out and said,
`You're not supposed to do that,' '' Mrs. Gotbaum said. ``They
said, `Given your husband, how could you do this?' I said, `Given
who I am, how could I not?' '' She said that she later complained
about the mention of her husband, the labor leader VICTOR GOTBAUM.
``He has nothing to do with this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Local 2110, MAIDA ROSENSTEIN, said, ``One would
assume that we would be on the same page, at least in terms of the
broad issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgery instead of Discovery
</P>
<P>
   Why wasn't TED TURNER in Cape Canaveral, Fla., for the launching
of the space shuttle Discovery on Thursday? He was in Rochester
(N.Y.) General Hospital, where he had back surgery on Wednesday to
repair a herniated disc.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the hospital, JOHN TURNER (``I'm not related,
darn''), said that Ted Turner was in satisfactory condition and
might be discharged Friday. John Turner said Ted Turner's physician
in Atlanta had referred him to the surgeon who did the operation,
DR. PAUL MAURER.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast Notes
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ SAM DONALDSON may have his hands full as the host of
the annual Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame dinner at the New
York Marriott Marquis Hotel on Nov. 9. One of the inductees is JANE
PAULEY, who was replaced as an anchor of the ``Today'' show on NBC
by one of the people who has RSVP'd, DEBORAH NORVILLE. One
broadcaster who attends the event every year said it would be the
first time the two have been in the same room since Ms. Pauley left
the ``Today'' studio in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine sponsoring the dinner, Broadcasting &AMP; Cable,
reported this week that HAROLD FURCHTGOTT-ROTH, a member of the
Federal Communications Commission, is no couch potato: He does not
own a television and does not plan to buy either a conventional
model or a $7,000-plus digital set before the FCC-mandated
changeover to high-definition television broadcasting begins on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that he does not keep an eye on what he
regulates. ``He has a television in his office,'' said his
assistant, GINGER CLARK.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Birthday
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The crowd at ALEXANDRA STYRON'S table could carry a
tune _ the filmmakers SUSANNA STYRON (her big sister), DAN ALGRANT
and GRIFFIN DUNNE were among those who sang ``Happy Birthday'' to
the 32-year-old novelist _ but the man at the next table at Bambou,
on East 14th Street, joined in. Then STEVIE WONDER sang his own
version of the song.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most astonishing moment,'' Ms. Styron said later.
``I thought, `Oh, my God, he's singing.' It was the coolest thing I
could possibly imagine having happen.''

BULLET IN KNAPSACK COULD FIGURE IN LEVIN MURDER TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A police investigator testified Thursday that she
found a .22-caliber bullet _ the same type of bullet used to kill
Jonathan Levin _ in the front pocket of a knapsack belonging to a
former student accused of killing Levin, a popular Bronx high
school teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators said that no fingerprints were found on the
bullet. Because until now there has been little direct evidence
linking the former student, Corey Arthur, 20, to the firing of the
shot that killed Levin, the discovery of the bullet could prove to
be important evidence. Earlier at the trial, a former girlfriend of
Arthur said he had confessed to her.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Arthur, who faces life in prison without parole if
convicted of first-degree murder, have admitted that he was in the
apartment of his former teacher on the night of the slaying, May
30, 1997. But they have said that Montoun Hart, 26, Arthur's
co-defendant, or other accomplices still at large committed the
murder. Hart will be tried separately on second-degree murder
charges in January.
</P>
<P>
   After the trial recessed, defense lawyers tried to cast doubt on
the discovery of the bullet in a crime laboratory by the Police
Department investigator, Mary Eng. They questioned how
investigators who first searched the backpack at the murder scene
could have missed anything as important as a bullet.
</P>
<P>
   While stopping short of suggesting that police had planted the
bullet, one defense lawyer, George Goltzer, called the sequence of
events curious. ``It's highly unusual to have a knapsack found at a
crime scene and a bullet discovered inside it two weeks later,'' he
said. ``It's not only highly unusual. It's remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, prosecutors also released a 1993 graduate school paper
written by Levin, containing a glowing description of his
relationship with Arthur. He wrote that the relationship was an
inspiration: ``So much of what I am and what I want to do in this
life, and profession, revolves around what I've established'' with
him.
</P>
<P>
   If Arthur did kill his former teacher, Levin's emotional
statements about his former student, read publicly for the first
time Thursday, suggested a new degree of cold-bloodedness to the
crime. The former teacher voluntarily let Arthur into his apartment
on the day he was killed, according to prosecutors who accuse
Arthur of taking advantage of his former teacher's good intentions.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of Levin's relationship with his accused killer is a
central to the trial. Defense lawyers have argued that Arthur was
so close to his former teacher that he would never have killed him.
But prosecutors say the relationship was not as close as defense
lawyers contend, adding that the two had grown apart by the time
the killing occurred.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Levin, the son of the Time-Warner chairman, Gerald Levin, wrote
the paper while getting a master's degree at New York University in
the fall of 1993. In the paper, he cited his relationship with
Arthur as one of the primary reasons he wanted to become a teacher
and said receiving a thank you note from Arthur was ``one of the
most moving experiences I've had in a very long time and has made
me extremely proud of what I've accomplished so far.''
</P>
<P>
   He described Arthur, then his student at William Howard Taft
High School, as a ``remarkable combination of talent and tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never met a 16-year-old who has been through and seen
what he has, and seems incredibly rough and intimidating on the
outside,'' the young teacher wrote, ``and, yet, he harbors some
positive goals and aspirations that he can share with no one,
because most of his peers would find them ridiculous.''

NOT SHOWING THIS WEEK: GATES' TAPED TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(lb) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two blocks away, on Capitol Hill, it would have
been called a filibuster. At the federal courthouse, however, it
was simply a defensive strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuing a laborious cross-examination of the second witness
in the Microsoft antitrust trial, lawyers for the company foiled
plans by the Justice Department to close the week with the
much-anticipated _ and in Microsoft's case, much-dreaded _
videotaped questioning of the company's chairman, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   The tape, a recording of Gates answering questions from
government lawyers in a pretrial deposition, has been the source of
a struggle between the two sides from the beginning. Microsoft
asked U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson to block the
playing of the tape, arguing that if government lawyers wanted the
court to hear from Gates, they should call him as one of their 12
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled on Tuesday that antitrust laws do not limit the
use of depositions of the chief executive of the company on trial.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Thursday whether he thought that Microsoft had engaged in
a filibuster to delay the showing of the videotape, the Justice
Department's lead lawyer, David Boies, said, ``I'm not going to
second-guess Microsoft's defensive strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Boies, who on four different occasions this week had told
reporters that he planned imminently to present portions of the
Gates tape, added, ``We just didn't get to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the word ``filibuster'' was heard repeatedly in murmurs
among the politically savvy observers packed into the courtroom
Thursday as Microsoft's lead lawyer, John Warden, tried, at a
painful pace, to pick apart the testimony of David Colburn, a
senior vice president of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the murmurs were no doubt a result of sheer
disappointment. Anticipation of the Gates testimony had brought
renewed interest _ and long lines for seats _ to Jackson's
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft officials denied any effort to delay the playing of
the tape. Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman, said outside the
courthouse Thursday that when the tape was finally shown, ``You
will see a witness who won't let the government put words in his
mouth _ who won't be bullied.''

DEFENDANT REJECTS PLEA, THEN JUMPS TO HIS DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After casting a last glance at his mother, a
teen-ager accused of selling crack cocaine jumped out the window of
a packed Manhattan courtroom Thursday and fell 16 stories to his
death after a judge offered to give him a three- to six-year prison
sentence if he agreed to plead guilty in the case, officials and
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Derrick Smith, 19, rejected the plea bargain.
Then, as court officers were leading him to a holding cell behind
the courtroom, Smith, who was not handcuffed, broke free and jumped
out an open window, shaken witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought his mother was going to have a nervous breakdown,''
said John Toliaferro, 44, a legal assistant who was in court. ``She
kept saying, `That's my son, that's my son.'''
</P>
<P>
   The suicide was a jarring interruption to the daily routine at
Manhattan state Supreme Court, as lawyers, judges, jurors and even
defendants crowded the sidewalks at lunchtime below the building at
100 Centre St., which was once known as ``the Tombs'' for the
faux-Egyptian architecture of a much smaller courthouse that stood
there in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   It was supposed to have been a routine court date for Smith, who
was arrested Sept. 19 and accused of selling crack cocaine on the
corner of St. Marks Place and Second Avenue in the East Village,
according to an indictment. Since his arrest, Smith had been held
on Rikers Island because no one had paid the $2,500 bail to set him
free.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Smith was already on probation for a 1995 drug case
and that he had been arrested several times since then on charges
of selling marijuana, Justice Budd Goodman of state Supreme Court
in Manhattan revoked the offer of bail Thursday and ordered him
sent back to Rikers Island.
</P>
<P>
   Then, according to a transcript of the proceedings, he told
Smith that the plea offer, ``for today only,'' was three to six
years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's lawyer, Frank Bari, rejected the offer, setting the
wheels in motion for the case to go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Then Smith addressed the court. ``I'm 19 years old, your
honor,'' he said, according to the transcript. ``That is terrible.
That's terrible.'' Then Smith asked to represent himself. Bari, his
lawyer, advised him against this, and Goodman ordered him to submit
the next motions in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonso Wilson, 35, who was in the courtroom with a friend who
had a court date, said that Smith then turned to face his mother.
``He looked at his mother,'' he said. ``He looked very discouraged.
Their eyes met.''
</P>
<P>
   Court officers led Smith behind a glass partition that forms a
sort of corridor along the outer wall of the courtroom and leads to
an adjoining holding cell. The corridor is in view of at least part
of the courtroom. As he passed a window, witnesses said, they heard
a commotion.
</P>
<P>
   Toliaferro said that Smith's mother jumped up. ``She ran back,
behind the partition,'' he said. ``Then she saw what happened. She
saw the open window, and the court officer there alone.'' Smith's
mother, who was not identified by the authorities, was taken to a
nearby hospital and treated for trauma.

KENDRICK WINS AGAINST GRAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The changing of the left guard became almost
official Thursday, when USC coach Paul Hackett said that junior
college transfer Donta Kendrick will probably start in place of
Jason Grain.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second consecutive week Kendrick has beaten out Grain,
who started the Trojans' first six games. Kendrick tweaked his leg
in practice Thursday, but if he's OK, he should start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been more Donta's improvement (than anything else),''
Hackett said. ``I believe he's starting again.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point earlier in the season, Kendrick had fallen to third
string, but his stock has risen recently. Grain fell behind last
week with some problems during practice drills, but he will share
time with Kendrick on Saturday against Washington.
</P>
<P>
   __ It'll be wristbands: Freshman quarterback Carson Palmer
sported a wristband with about 15 plays Thursday, as USC will
probably abandon signaling most plays from the sideline against
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It actually works good. I like it,'' Palmer said. ``I think it
just speeds up the process. The more wordy plays are on the
wristband.''
</P>
<P>
   One play has 10 words on it, which meant quarterbacks coach Ken
O'Brien would previously signal in the entire 10-word play.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hackett: ``This is just going to hopefully help. We're
probably overstating it if we think it will make a heck of a lot of
difference. We need to to be more aware of the 25-second clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer appeared to take more repetitions than normal, but
Hackett said it was just to make sure both quarterbacks get a fair
chance to run all the pass plays.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fighting mad: In just his second day of practice, freshman
Jason Thomas made quite an impression. After being tackled by
defensive end Sultan Abdul-Malik, the pair got into a scuffle.
Malik repeatedly punched Thomas in the face, although Thomas was
wearing his helmet and was unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long he didn't hurt (Malik),'' Hackett joked.
</P>
<P>
   __ Williams available: Defensive tackle Aaron Williams (neck
stinger) did not practice Thursday but is expected to play.
Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed, who has been a defensive end, will
start.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mark Cusano (sore thigh) won't start but will also
play.
</P>
<P>
   __ Collins to redshirt: Darren Collins, a defensive tackle who
hurt his ankle early in training camp but has practiced the past
few weeks, will redshirt. Hackett said he wants to have Collins and
Kansas State transfer Matt Childers as juniors to provide depth
next season on the defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of redshirts, tailback Sultan McCullough has practiced
at wide receiver, but Hackett said he still envisions the ex-Muir
High star as a running back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a ton of versatility,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ DeSaussure makes comeback: Former Taft High wide receiver
Andre DeSaussure had a career-high 167 yards receiving and two
touchdowns for Washington last week against Oregon State. It was
his first start of the season. He will make his second start
Saturday. It's a big turnaround for DeSaussure, who was suspended
part of last season for violating team rules.

HUGH CAREY: OUT OF POLITICS, BUT NOT OUT OF OPINIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `p') 
(bl) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Do you want to take my pulse?'' former Gov. Hugh
Carey inquired on the other end of the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes. Carey, 79, was responding to an interview request
_ Who does he like in the Senate race? What's he been up to? Etc. _
and within minutes had reduced the situation to its essence. But as
it turned out, he was speaking in classic Carey black humor as well
as metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 14, Carey had surgery for an inflamed prostate, and on
Oct. 19 he came home. Then, earlier this week, his pulse evidently
strong, the former Democratic governor of New York held forth for
more than two hours in his Upper East Side Manhattan apartment,
hurtling from descriptions of his friendship with Gov. George
Pataki to his admiration for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to his bizarre
second marriage, to Evangeline Gouletas, who, he said, threw plates
at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was pretty good with those plates,'' Carey said. ``She had
a Mediterranean temper, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   In brief, Carey's wit is intact, and he looks good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a pretty active pulse, they tell me,'' Carey said when
he called back to insist that he had not become more politically
conservative. ``Except for the plumbing that's just been fixed,
they say I have the physique of a moderately middle-aged man.'' His
hair, which was varying shades throughout his political career, is
now a light brown, with small bits of gray. ``It's pretty close to
my natural color,'' Carey said. ``Whatever that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike former Mayor Ed Koch and former Gov. Mario Cuomo, Carey
has largely stayed out of politics since finishing his second term
in 1982. Considered brilliant by his fans, quirky by everyone else,
Carey is the governor who rescued New York City and New York state
from financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not seek a third term, or run for president, after he
married Ms. Gouletas, a real-estate developer whose third
ex-husband _ she at first said she had two _ surfaced only after
her marriage to Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Carey has opinions. He thinks the Senate race between
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer is far too close to
call, but that if ``Schumer doesn't make this, he might be in the
run for mayor. Either way, Schumer's made his mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey wouldn't say who he was voting for, but did say he differs
with Schumer on some issues, including Schumer's vote against the
ban on ``partial-birth'' abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was not overly enthusiastic about D'Amato, either, but did
say in an interview five years ago, ``I suspect if somebody drops a
watch down a culvert, he calls D'Amato and he'll get the watch
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the gubernatorial race between Pataki and City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone, Carey said that ``here you've got two very
competent men.'' His favorite is clearly Pataki, who in 1994 put
Carey on his transition team. ``I made a habit as governor of
courting former governors,'' Carey said. ``I would always make the
mansion available, or send a plane or a car to pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Cuomo, whom Carey said never invited him to the mansion,
Pataki has.
</P>
<P>
   Carey described his life as the pleasant one of a country squire
who enjoys 12 children and 15 grandchildren on some 30 acres the
family bought last year on Shelter Island. (Carey retired as

   It was Carey's idea to buy the property, which he saw was for
sale while he was laid up for spinal surgery in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was in the hospital, the kids keep coming in to check on
me, and I say, `The will is not in action yet! No will yet!'''
Carey said. The Carey Trust _ Carey said he has turned over all his

everything by caucus,'' he said. ``I'm really not the patriarch.
I'm one lonely vote. Especially since they now have control of the
loot.''

   Carey said he would have run for president in 1984 against
Ronald Reagan had he not married Ms. Gouletas, and that he looked

which he paid a high price. ``It made me look ludicrous in the eyes
of the state,'' he said. Before, he added, ``I was respected as a

worst is, I gave scandal. You do not give scandal. When I gave
scandal, I left politics.''

   Carey's first wife, Helen, died in 1974. Two of his sons died in
an automobile accident in 1969. His 36-year-old son, Paul, a member
of Securities and Exchange Commission, is recently back at work
after treatment for cancer of the endocrine system, but stays with
his father when he is in New York.

was lauded as a ``governor for hard winters,'' but in his eyes he
is a ``father for hard winters.''

   In the mornings these days, Carey takes an early walk, stops in
to chat with his old friend the doctor, Kevin Cahill, and goes to
daily Mass at St. Vincent Ferrer Church on Lexington Avenue. ``It's
a very easy half-hour in beautiful surroundings,'' Carey said.
``Not a bad way to kick your day off.'' And, he said cheerfully,
``I figure as I'm getting to the evening of my life, I'm beginning
to pack my bags for the journey.''

HUGH CAREY: OUT OF POLITICS, BUT NOT OUT OF OPINIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `a') 
(bl) 
 By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Do you want to take my pulse?'' former Gov. Hugh
Carey inquired on the other end of the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, yes. Carey, 79, was responding to an interview request
_ Who does he like in the Senate race? What's he been up to? Etc. _
and within minutes had reduced the situation to its essence. But as
it turned out, he was speaking in classic Carey black humor as well
as metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 14, Carey had surgery for an inflamed prostate, and on
Oct. 19 he came home. Then, earlier this week, his pulse evidently
strong, the former Democratic governor of New York held forth for
more than two hours in his Upper East Side Manhattan apartment,
hurtling from descriptions of his friendship with Gov. George
Pataki to his admiration for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to his bizarre
second marriage, to Evangeline Gouletas, who, he said, threw plates
at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was pretty good with those plates,'' Carey said. ``She had
a Mediterranean temper, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   In brief, Carey's wit is intact, and he looks good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a pretty active pulse, they tell me,'' Carey said when
he called back to insist that he had not become more politically
conservative. ``Except for the plumbing that's just been fixed,
they say I have the physique of a moderately middle-aged man.'' His
hair, which was varying shades throughout his political career, is
now a light brown, with small bits of gray. ``It's pretty close to
my natural color,'' Carey said. ``Whatever that is.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike former Mayor Ed Koch and former Gov. Mario Cuomo, Carey
has largely stayed out of politics since finishing his second term
in 1982. Considered brilliant by his fans, quirky by everyone else,
Carey is the governor who rescued New York City and New York state
from financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But he did not seek a third term, or run for president, after he
married Ms. Gouletas, a real-estate developer whose third
ex-husband _ she at first said she had two _ surfaced only after
her marriage to Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Carey has opinions. He thinks the Senate race between
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and Rep. Charles Schumer is far too close to
call, but that if ``Schumer doesn't make this, he might be in the
run for mayor. Either way, Schumer's made his mark.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey wouldn't say who he was voting for, but did say he differs
with Schumer on some issues, including Schumer's vote against the
ban on ``partial-birth'' abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was not overly enthusiastic about D'Amato, either, but did
say in an interview five years ago, ``I suspect if somebody drops a
watch down a culvert, he calls D'Amato and he'll get the watch
out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the gubernatorial race between Pataki and City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone, Carey said that ``here you've got two very
competent men.'' His favorite is clearly Pataki, who in 1994 put
Carey on his transition team. ``I made a habit as governor of
courting former governors,'' Carey said. ``I would always make the
mansion available, or send a plane or a car to pick them up.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Cuomo, whom Carey said never invited him to the mansion,
Pataki has.
</P>
<P>
   Carey described his life as the pleasant one of a country squire
who enjoys 12 children and 15 grandchildren on some 30 acres the
family bought last year on Shelter Island. (Carey retired as
executive vice president of W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. in 1995, and is now of
counsel to two law firms. He also serves on boards.)
</P>
<P>
   It was Carey's idea to buy the property, which he saw was for
sale while he was laid up for spinal surgery in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I was in the hospital, the kids keep coming in to check on
me, and I say, `The will is not in action yet! No will yet!'''
Carey said. The Carey Trust _ Carey said he has turned over all his
assets to his children _ eventually bought the property. ``We do
everything by caucus,'' he said. ``I'm really not the patriarch.
I'm one lonely vote. Especially since they now have control of the
loot.''
</P>
<P>

of the state,'' he said. Before, he added, ``I was respected as a
governor, I was a sole parent, I had dates with nice girls. So the
worst is, I gave scandal. You do not give scandal. When I gave
scandal, I left politics.''
</P>

FRANKS ATTACKS DODD'S VOTING RECORD IN DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: also sent in category `p')

<P>
   FARMINGTON, Conn. _ Taking a page from the bitter senatorial
battle in New York, former Rep. Gary Franks, a Republican, harshly
criticized on Thursday the voting record of Sen. Christopher Dodd,
saying the Democrat had missed 1,000 votes while in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the second debate of their campaign, Franks on several
occasions raised the issue of missed votes and attacked Dodd about
what he contended was a lack of clout in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd, on the other hand, used the debate to criticize Franks on
health care, education and civil rights. Dodd asked Franks why he
voted to cut Medicare by $600 billion and why he voted against the
Family and Medical Leave Act.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said he did not vote to cut Medicare but instead voted to
reduce future spending on the program that provides health coverage
for retired Americans. He criticized Dodd for his support for
``national health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the debate, Franks said he did not support the medical
leave act because it imposed too much regulation on companies that
already gave workers time off.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd also attacked Franks for voting against the civil rights
restoration bill and legal services for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to these issues, I take great pride in my
record,'' Dodd said. ``I am for affirmative action. I just don't
talk about these issues. When I get a chance to do something about
it, I take action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Except when you didn't show up to vote,'' Franks shot back.
``We had an opportunity to extend the Civil Rights Commission back
in 1987 and you weren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the two candidates used most of the debate to draw the
distinctions and differences between them _ beginning even before
the start of the debate over a squabble over whether Franks could
have the same riser as Dodd _ both Dodd and Franks said they
supported federal hate crime legislation and a bill to ban job
discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Dodd refused to criticize Franks for his personal finance
problems, and criticized the moderator, Steve Kotchko, for asking a
question about a threatened bank foreclosure on two of Franks'
properties.
</P>
<P>
   The debate was held at the Farmington Marriott hotel and was
sponsored by the Connecticut Broadcasters Association, but fewer
than 30 members of the association remained to watch the debate.
</P>
<P>
   And only about six members of the association stayed to watch
the ninth and final forum for the two gubernatorial candidates. But
because the forum was being taped for broadcast, Gov. John G.
Rowland and Rep. Barbara Kennelly, the Democratic challenger,
delivered their stump speeches anyway to the largely empty room.

 HAMED IS AHEAD IN THE VERBAL SPARRING  
 EXCELLENT BOUTS IN COMING WEEKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. _ If the fists fly as furiously Saturday
night as the words did here Thursday, then the 12-round
featherweight bout between Prince Naseem Hamed and Wayne McCullough
will be a slugfest. It will also be one-sided, because McCullough
is no verbal match for Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   With a look that alternated between bemused and befuddled,
McCullough listened to Hamed talk and talk and talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear he's got a secret weapon,'' said Hamed (30-0). ``About
the only secret weapon he could have is an Uzi or a machine gun.''
Hamed went on to say that he would still win even if McCullough did
have an Uzi or a machine gun.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough (22-1), quiet and solemn, is not a pushover. He won a
silver medal for Ireland in the 1992 Olympic Games at Barcelona,
Spain, and is a former World Boxing Council super bantamweight
champion. He is 28 years old and his lone loss was a 12-round
decision to Daniel Zaragoza on Jan. 11, 1997. McCullough, who lost
a title in that bout, does not have the single-punch knockout power
that Hamed has. But McCullough has a strong chin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take away Naseem's best thing, his punch, and then
what's he got?'' McCullough said. ``If he lands one punch, I want
to be able to land four or five.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough believes he will be able to get to Hamed, who throws
punches from odd angles and is often off balance. Hamed was knocked
down three times in his bout against Kevin Kelley last December.
Kelley stunned Hamed with a shot in the first round. McCullough
said Kelley did not take advantage of that shot.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough employed Kelley as a sparring partner for two weeks.
The two sparred for 50 rounds. McCullough and Kelley both live in
Las Vegas, so getting Kelley to the gym to work with him was not
difficult. Kelley also proved to be a great mimic of Hamed's flashy
style.
</P>
<P>
   Bally's Park Place Casino, the sponsor of the fight, is taking a
beating on ticket sales. The fighters did not arrive until Tuesday.
Hamed's promoters did not get him his work visa in time, and
McCullough was concerned about his $500,000 purse being paid. The
Atlantic City Convention Center has been set up for 12,000 fans. As
of Thursday, about 6,000 tickets had been sold. Tickets range in
price from $25 to $300. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Hamed made his U.S. debut last Dec. 19 at Madison Square
Garden, there were 11,954 paying customers, leading to a gate of
$822,127 _ the highest grossing featherweight card in boxing
history. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Bouts in Coming Weeks
</P>
<P>
   The last quarter of 1998 will be a bonanza for boxing fans as
nearly every weekend between now and the end of the year will have
a bout featuring high-caliber competition. Even the bouts on the
undercard will be excellent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a backlash at the network and the fan level,''
said Jay Larkin, Showtime senior vice president for sports/event
programming. ``The fans have really gotten fed up with all the
mismatches with no end in sight. And we've started demanding better
fights from the promoters.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this weekend with the Hamed-McCullough bout, boxing's
hit parade will continue through Dec. 19 when Floyd Mayweather Jr.,
the newly crowned WBC junior-lightweight champion, fights Angel
Manfredy. The undercard for that show will feature a match between
the up-and-coming heavyweights David Tua and Hasim Rahman, on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 13 Ricardo Lopez, the WBC strawweight champion, will
meet Rosendo Alvarez in a rematch in Las Vegas on Showtime. The
next night, Roy Jones Jr., who holds the World Boxing Association
and WBC light-heavyweight titles, will take on Otis Grant at 168
pounds IBF at Foxwoods Resorts Casino in Connecticut, also on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar De La Hoya will fight Ike Quartey in a welterweight
championship bout on Nov. 21 in Las Vegas on TVKO in a pay-per-view
bout. That undercard will have title defenses by Keith Mullings,
the WBC junior-middleweight champion, and Erik Morales, the WBC
super bantamweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 28 Luisito Espinosa will fight Kennedy McKinney for the
WBC featherweight title and Miguel Angel Gonzalez and Kostya Tszyu
will meet for the vacant WBC super lightweight title, both in
Corpus Christi, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 12 Arturo Gatti and Ivan Robinson will meet in a rematch
of their lightweight fight in Atlantic City, on HBO. Fernando
Vargas will challenge Yory Boy Campas for his IBF
junior-middleweight title on the undercard.
</P>
<P>
   Punch Lines &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ IMAMU MAYFIELD of New Brunswick, N.J., will defend his IBF
cruiserweight title against ARTHUR WILLIAMS (28-4-1) on Friday at
Biloxi, Miss., on ESPN2's ``Friday Night Fights.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Although Las Vegas is the favorite to land MIKE TYSON's return
bout in January, Madison Square Garden is in the mix. No opponent
has been selected yet. The Garden is the front-runner for a
possible heavyweight unification bout between EVANDER HOLYFIELD and
LENNOX LEWIS on March 13.

fare may be a West End import, in neighborhoods throughout the

work, seldom-seen plays and new translations from a wide variety of

O'MALLEY'S NFL DREAMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers were Peter O'Malley's
baseball team, but bringing the NFL back to Los Angeles would have
been his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Malley announced Wednesday he was stepping down as
Dodgers board chairman at the end of the year, few knew he was
still around, given Fox's heavy-handed first season running the
club.
</P>
<P>
   But in a week in which two different groups flew to the NFL
owner's meetings in Kansas City trying to get an expansion
franchise for Los Angeles, O'Malley added a few comments that had a
stinging resonance about what might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Although he basked in memories of Fernandomania, Kirk Gibson and
two World Series titles after replacing his father Walter as club
president in 1970, O'Malley acknowledged not bringing professional
football to Chavez Ravine was one of the reasons he sold the club.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the final chapter of O'Malley's 46 years in baseball are
getting boxed up along with the pictures of Jackie Robinson and
Sandy Koufax.
</P>
<P>
   Many thought Peter O'Malley was nothing more than a caretaker
for the empire created by his father. He mixed a great gin and
tonic and had the best pension plan in the business but never had
the hell-fire and brimstone to help shape the game.
</P>
<P>
   But the NFL, America's true national pastime? That would have
been all his.
</P>
<P>
   The money generated from pro football also would have enabled
O'Malley to keep the Dodgers. Mike Piazza could not be reached for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest in football was very keen,'' said O'Malley, who
added he is watching the Kansas City meetings very closely. ``The
deeper we looked, the clearer it became that it truly would have
worked on the property. But when we were asked not to compete with
the Coliseum, we did that. There is a saying, `You don't fight city
hall.'''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL badly wanted O'Malley, whose reputation running the
Dodgers was exemplary. It didn't want to put a new franchise in the
Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley became good friends with Carolina Panthers president
Jerry Richardson, head of the NFL expansion committee. NFL
commissioner Paul Tagliabue twice flew to L.A. to meet O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley was lining up investors, including Fox, to cover the
$500 million expansion fee.
</P>
<P>
   Plans drawn for a football stadium were staggering. It had a
walkway to Dodger Stadium near the right field line and overlooked
the downtown skyline. Monday-night football at dusk would never
have looked better.
</P>
<P>
   But after two years and a $1 million feasibility study filled
with positive data, O'Malley was told by Los Angeles mayor Richard
Riordan to throw his support toward the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were asked not to compete, that was a big
disappointment,'' O'Malley said. ``I couldn't deny that was one of
the factors (for selling).''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Coliseum group, bankrolled by Kings owners Ed Roski and
Philip Anschutz, has competition from the Hollywood crowd, headed
by former superagent Michael Ovitz. Shaquille O'Neal is involved.
So is actor Kevin Costner.
</P>
<P>
   And there was nothing Riordan could say to make them go away.
</P>
<P>
   The division could swing the expansion vote toward Houston,
which has the money in place and is ready to break ground on a
retractable-roof stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing against a great city like Houston, but if Houston gets
that expansion ballclub, the leaders of the city of Los Angeles
have to feel very badly,'' O'Malley said. ``The sports fans should
feel badly. I think we will win out over Houston. We should get
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the Dodgers lose out on pro football, the process
changed club history.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Malley went digging for NFL gold, he dispatched executive
vice president Bob Graziano to be the corporate pitbull. For almost
two years, Graziano spent nearly every waking hour trying to soothe
nervous neighbors in nearby Echo Park.
</P>
<P>
   He attended committee meetings, discussed freeway on- and off-
ramps and made assurances eight home games would not cripple the
community.
</P>
<P>
   It was during that time Graziano flew past Fred Claire in the
Dodger line of succession.
</P>
<P>
   Claire, once ripped for not being a baseball man, would have
been a better choice to immediately succeed O'Malley as club
president and help with the transition to Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Claire, O'Malley's top lieutenant for 30 years, was fired last
June along with manager Bill Russell. O'Malley has extended an
olive branch to Russell, who visited the owner's box several times
after he was fired.
</P>
<P>
   Claire and O'Malley twice had lunch after the firing, but the
relationship remains strained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know what he is doing now,'' O'Malley said.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Malley does know where he should be this week _ in Kansas
City getting a yes vote on a project that would have moved him from
behind his father's shadow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can never see myself rooting against the Dodgers,'' he said
when asked about his future.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said if the NFL comes to town.

 &HT;    Upbeat Clinton speaks at fundraisers after attending Glenn
launch
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ President Bill Clinton flew to Palm
Beach County on Thursday on the euphoria of John Glenn's shuttle
launch, hoping to buoy candidate Buddy MacKay into the governor's
mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's four-hour side trip to South Florida was aimed at
raising $600,000 from deep-pocketed Democrats in a late hour effort
to help MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did we all love John Glenn's trip back into space? Because
it was about possibilities. And that makes us all feel good. This
election is about possibilities,'' Clinton told 70 people who paid
$5,000 to $20,000 for a dinner with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was the featured guest for an 8:30 p.m. at Slim-Fast
founder S. Daniel Abraham's eighth floor penthouse in the Palm
Beach Biltmore condominium overlooking the Intracoastal Waterway.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes earlier he also spoke at a cocktail reception
downstairs in a party room for another group of 50 people who paid
$2,500 to $10,000 to pose for photographs with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip came 364 days after he last visited the county.
Like that trip, this was to make up for a trip he missed. This trip
made up for an Oct. 13 trip he cancelled to deal with budget
concerns and the Middle East talks.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force One arrived at Palm Beach International Airport at
5:35 p.m. and Clinton disembarked with MacKay and Gov. Lawton
Chiles at his side.
</P>
<P>
   A raucous group of 30 or so boosters met Clinton at the airport
and Clinton paused to chat with them for several minutes. Among
them were Palm Beach County Commission Chairman Burt Aaronson,
State Reps. Suzanne Jacobs, Lois FrankeypG9 E)YX6ey, and State
Sens. Steve Geller and Ron Klein
</P>
<P>
   Aside from boosters who could write big checks, Clinton's
biggest welcome came from schoolchildren gathered outside Palm
Beach Public School on Cocoanut Row.
</P>
<P>
   As the motorcade passed, they cheered and held up welcoming
signs that couldn't be read in the dimming twilight. Another group
of cheers came from people gathered on the sidewalk outside E.R.
Bradley's Saloon near the Biltmore.
</P>
<P>
   The diners in Abraham's marble-floored condominium were crowded
around tables of 10 for a meal of acorn squash and vegetable soup,
Chilean sea bass and white truffles and warm chocolate tart with
vanilla sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was flanked by Abraham and real estate developer Pritam
Singh. MacKay introduced the president, calling him a friend of his
and ``a great friend of Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Upbeat following the Discovery launch, Clinton said MacKay stood
up for him when Clinton first campaigned for the presidency in
Florida in 1992. ``That showed a lot of foresight, and foresight is
a quality you need in a governor,'' Clinton joked.

RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN TO CONTINUE DESPITE SHERIFF'S DEATH, MANAGER
VOWS

<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES -- Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block died
Thursday, five days &UR;  &LR; before the most difficult election of his
16-year career as head of the nation's largest Sheriff's
Department. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Block's death came at 7:52 p.m., a few hours after his condition
began to deteriorate badly. On Monday, the underwent surgery at USC
University Hospital for a blood clot deep within his brain that
doctors said has caused him to fall at his home in the suburban Los
Angeles community of West Hills hit his head on Saturday. He never
regained consciousness after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Block's challenger, former sheriff's Chief Lee Baca, had focused
on Block's age and health, saying it made him unfit for office.
Block has survived two bouts with cancer and was undergoing weekly
kidney dialysis treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Block's death Thursday prompted an outpouring of sympathy from
public officials throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday night, his campaign manager said the drive to win
Block a fifth term will continue despite his death -- a move which,
if successful, would allow county supervisors to name his successor
until 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff made clear to me last Sunday in the hospital that
he wanted the campaign to continue no matter what happened,'' said
Jay Grodin. ``Voters should vote their conscience. Our campaign
continues forward to continue his vision for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Baca, who ran a close second in the June primary, issued a
statement joining in the condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family has lost its leader,'' he said. ``Sherman Block was
a giant in the law enforcement family. His dedication and
commitment to his profession was unparalleled. Those of us that
served under Sherman Block are unlikely to experience another who
can match that commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky said acting Sheriff Jerry Harper
would be named to hold the post until after the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a tough cop but a compassionate cop (who) ``conducted
himself with integrity and honor at all times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he will be remembered for his innovation, his
willingness to reform, for managing a law enforcement agency at one
of the most difficult times to manage a law enforcement agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Block's name will still appear on the ballot. If voters elect
him, supervisors would have 20 days to name a successor. Possible
candidates include retired Los Angeles Police Department Deputy
Chief Mark Kroeker and Undersheriff Mike Graham.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the death outside the medical center, Natalie
Macias, a civilian spokeswoman for the department, said Block's
condition worsened quickly and unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``His family, including his wife Alyce, were at his side.
Sheriff Block had a sudden and rapid deterioration in his condition
late this afternoon. The cause of death was determined to be
recurrent intra-cerebral hemorrhage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1982, Block was seeking a fifth term for the
$234,016-a-year job, despite his failing health. He was the highest
paid elected official in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Harper said said the department has stable leadership to operate
through the transition period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a management team the sheriff put into place and this
is a management team that will make sure the department carries out
its mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich called Block
a ``man of honor and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not an armchair sheriff. he was involved in all
segments of the community,'' Antonovich said. ``On behalf of the
board of supervisors, I extend condolences to Alyce, the children
and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks said the 13,000 LAPD
officers and staff extended their condolences to the sheriff's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a regional leader, a national leader, and many of
the programs that he initiated will go on forever as an appropriate
legacy of what the community needs, and always needs,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Don Knabe called Block ``a man of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoughts and prayers are with the Block family,'' he said.
``Sherm Block was a man of honor, a friend and a role model to me,
and I am a better person for having known him. Whether in his
personal life, or his professional life, Sheriff Block was a hero.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. D-Calif., said in a statement: ``I
am an unabashed fan of Sheriff Sherman Block . . . the department
did have its problems, but Sheriff Block was always there to work
with the men and women of the department in a no-nonsense way.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, even as rumors about Block's health swirled
through political circles, doctors said he was regaining
``alertness'' and that he underwent his weekly kidney dialysis with
no complications.
</P>
<P>
   But a blackout was maintained on virtually all information about
his condition.

</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich called Block
a ``man of honor and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not an armchair sheriff. he was involved in all
segments of the community,'' Antonovich said. ``On behalf of the
board of supervisors, I extend condolences to Alyce, the children
and grandchildren.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Police Chief Bernard C. Parks said the 13,000 LAPD
officers and staff extended their condolences to the sheriff's
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been a regional leader, a national leader, and many of
the programs that he initiated will go on forever as an appropriate
legacy of what the community needs, and always needs,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Don Knabe called Block ``a man of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My thoughts and prayers are with the Block family,'' he said.
``Sherm Block was a man of honor, a friend and a role model to me,
and I am a better person for having known him. Whether in his
personal life, or his professional life, Sheriff Block was a hero.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein. D-Calif., said in a statement: ``I
am an unabashed fan of Sheriff Sherman Block . . . the department
did have its problems, but Sheriff Block was always there to work
with the men and women of the department in a no-nonsense way.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the week, even as rumors about Block's health swirled
through political circles, doctors said he was regaining
``alertness'' and that he underwent his weekly kidney dialysis with
no complications.
</P>
<P>
   But a blackout was maintained on virtually all information about
his condition.

`GALA PERFORMANCE': GIVING ALL FOR THE LOVE OF AN AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Antony Tudor's ``Gala Performance,'' which he created
in London in 1938, portrays three highly competitive star
ballerinas from Moscow, Milan and Paris as they prepare for and
perform in a glittering gala. Though essentially a stylized period
piece, the ballet continues to be surprisingly popular and this
year is part of American Ballet Theater's fall season.
</P>
<P>
   The company will present the piece again on Sunday afternoon at
City Center with a lead cast that came of age after the heyday of
the ballet's larger-than-life characters, who in some ways typify
national styles that no longer exist. How did the three dancers
approach the roles?
</P>
<P>
   Susan Jaffe, who plays the Italian ballerina, modeled her
portrait on Carla Fracci, an Italian prima ballerina of the 1960s
and '70s who combined a childlike innocence with a will of iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really difficult because she's not supposed to do much,''
Ms. Jaffe, who also danced the role in the mid-1980s, said of her
character. ``It is in stillness that you portray this person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course these are huge caricatures of these ballerinas. What
is funny about the Italian is her whole aura of being an angel, but
when she comes out in the prologue she hits the wardrobe woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Yan Chen will play the French ballerina. ``The Italian ballerina
is a goddess, subtle and well-balanced,'' Ms. Chen said. ``The
Russian ballerina thinks she's the cream. The French ballerina is
happy and bubbly. She throws a little fit in one scene, like a
little spoiled child, then realizes all of a sudden that everyone
is watching her. `Oh, how silly of me,' she thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   The role of the Russian ballerina is the most difficult
technically and was given to Eleena Melamed, a corps dancer, after
several principals gave up on its demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I'm petrified,'' Ms. Melamed said cheerfully. She sees
the Russian as ``a tiger going through the woods for her
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the ballerinas practice in the Prologue, the Russian
ballerina practices her bows,'' she said. ``Her eyes are always on
the audience, except when she is turning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Melamed prepared by watching videos of performances by
Leslie Browne and by long discussions with Sallie Wilson, a Tudor
expert who danced the role earlier. ``She's darling,'' Ms. Wilson
said of Ms. Melamed, ``and she's working like a demon.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson suggested that the younger dancer study Gloria
Swanson's Norma Desmond in ``Sunset Boulevard'' to understand the
Russian ballerina better. She told Ms. Chen to think of the French
ballerina as the cork in a champagne bottle. Wherever the Italian
ballerina walks, Ms. Wilson told Ms. Jaffe, she leaves a trail of
golden flowers behind, permeating the air with magic while doing
absolutely nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Temperamental dancers like the ones in the ballet are unpopular
today at Ballet Theater, Ms. Jaffe said. All three lead dancers
agree that ultimately, however, ``Gala Performance'' is about
giving one's all for audiences, which is not a bad virtue to
practice in any dance era.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're bitches,'' Ms. Melamed said, ``but they're doing
everything for the audience's love and support. That's what keeps
them going.''
</P>
<P>
   ```Gala Performance' is very difficult,'' Ms. Wilson said.
``It's about a performance within a performance 100 years ago.
Layers on layers. But the ballerinas are actually touching
characters, egos fighting to be onstage. There's a bit of the snob
to the wardrobe girl. Her feet hurt, but she is dresser to the
stars. The stage persona of the corps is fresh innocence. They're
trying to get the rich men in the audience, the ones with the
diamond stick pins, to supplement their salaries. But you have to
do it seriously to get a laugh.''

MAYBE MOZART IN A MAGICAL TALE'S MODERN PREMIERE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something a little worrying in the idea that operatic
music by Mozart has been lying around in various European libraries
without anyone taking the trouble to study it properly, let alone
perform it.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this is the conclusion that must be drawn if ``The
Philosopher's Stone,'' which is to have its first modern
performance Friday night in Boston, with another on Sunday, really
does contain numbers by Wolfgang Amadeus alongside music by other
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Musicologists disagree about the attribution. Now audiences can
decide.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart probably had a fair idea of his position among the
composers of his time, but he was certainly not averse to
collaborating. During his years in Vienna he wrote arias or
ensembles for at least five operas at the court theater, in
addition to the scores he wrote entirely himself. Generally, it
seems, he was responding to the wishes of particular singers.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Villeneuve, for example, had three new Mozart arias to
sing in two productions in the fall of 1789 that were among her
first in the imperial city. The next year she created the role of
Dorabella in ``Cosi Fan Tutte.''
</P>
<P>
   Around this time Mozart was also involved with the company run
by Emanuel Schikaneder at the Theater auf der Wieden, outside the
city center. This was the company for which Mozart wrote not only
``The Magic Flute'' but also an aria with a virtuoso part for solo
double bass. Both contributions were made in 1791, the year he
died, but could he also have written for earlier Schikaneder shows?
Could he, in particular, have contributed to ``The Philosopher's
Stone,'' staged in September 1790 with music by a number of
Schikaneder house composers?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a clear yes from David Buch, the American
musicologist who was the first to take a scholarly look at the
piece, and whose edition is being used in the Boston performances
at the New England Conservatory's Jordan Hall. Speaking recently
from his home in Iowa City, he remarked that ``all the evidence
suggests'' that Mozart wrote at least three numbers for ``The
Philosopher's Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   One of these has been known, and disputed, for a long time. It
is a duet in F between Lubano and Lubanara, the Papageno and
Papagena of this opera. As Buch points out, one of the fascinations
of ``The Philosopher's Stone,'' leaving aside all question of
Mozart's creative participation, is that it offers a context for
``The Magic Flute'' and may even change the way that work is
viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Both operas have prince and peasant heroes who are eventually
united with suitable consorts after surmounting magical trials.
Both works also show fairy-tale worlds subject to the whims of
rival powers of light and darkness, though the beneficent spirit is
a tenor role in ``The Philosopher's Stone,'' while the bass Franz
Xaver Gerl, who was to be Sarastro in ``The Magic Flute,'' was the
evil magician Eutifronte in the earlier piece. There are even
musical connections, places where Mozart in ``The Magic Flute''
quotes from ``The Philosopher's Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for Mozart's authorship is strongest for the F major
duet, of which there is a copy largely in his hand. That fact alone
is almost sufficient. If one might want to say the duet is too
simple to have been composed by Mozart (in it Lubano discovers that
his beloved is under a spell and can only meow like a cat), then it
is certainly too simple for him to have taken the trouble to copy
out _ an act that would have indicated he wanted to study it.
</P>
<P>
   Probably Mozart was working up a piece that had been drafted by
another composer, because the vocal lines and some of the string
parts were already in place when he picked up his pen, and
Mozartified the number, as he Mozartified works by Handel. The
quality of the orchestration, especially of the wind parts, seems
to justify Buch's conclusion that ``the spirit of Mozart is very
much present'' here.
</P>
<P>
   Not all earlier Mozart scholars were of the same opinion, but
then they had not seen what Buch has seen: a score of the opera
dating from close to the time of the first performance and placing
Mozart's name against not only the F major duet but two other short
numbers in the second-act finale. Buch examined this score in the
City and University Library of Hamburg in the summer of 1996, not
long after it had been returned from St. Petersburg, Russia, with
other World War II booty. His subsequent announcement that ``The
Philosopher's Stone'' might contain unknown Mozart got a lot of
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The other newly attributed segments are duets as well, the first
also for Lubano and the still-meowing Lubanara, the second for
Nadir, the Prince, and a soprano Genie who leads him on his way.
Both are pretty elementary, though, again, that is not a reason to
discount them as Mozart's; otherwise audiences might have to lose
quite a lot of Papageno's music in ``The Magic Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hamburg score is also persuasive evidence that these pieces
are genuine Mozart precisely because its attributions to him are so
modest: seven minutes or so of music in a score playing for two
hours. Publishers and impresarios of the time would have wanted to
exaggerate Mozart's contribution, and indeed a ``Philosopher's
Stone'' songbook from the era shamelessly ascribes the entire score
to him. If the Hamburg copyists were content to claim so little,
perhaps they should be believed.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the importance of ``The Philosopher's Stone'' must
lie in its qualities as an entity, not in its maybe-Mozart
fragments. After all, the presence of two or three Mozart arias has
not kept other multiple-composer operas like ``The Indiscreet
Inquirer'' or ``The Good-Hearted Grouch'' in the repertory, and in
those cases Mozart's contributions are unmistakably his and
glorious. The numbers he might have produced for ``The
Philosopher's Stone'' are certainly not of the same quality. But
the piece as a whole may reveal a lot about the theatrical
environment in which ``The Magic Flute'' came to be, and so help us
all appreciate that fully and magnificently Mozartian work the
more.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, ``The Philosopher's Stone'' may suggest,
disturbingly, that it is not so easy to distinguish mostly Mozart
(the F major duet) from possibly Mozart or even from what is
straightforwardly not Mozart. Martin Pearlman, who is to conduct
these performances by Boston Baroque, points out that the opera
shows Mozart working within a community of composers, exchanging
ideas, perhaps helping out with a few measures here or there, not
as a solitary author but as part of a team. If the piece now has a
continuing life, that will not be for Mozart's part in it but
because it is, in Pearlman's words, ``a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Kochel, Take Note
</P>
<P>
   Boston Baroque is to perform `The Philosopher's Stone'' Friday
night at 8 and on Sunday at 3 p.m. at the New England
Conservatory's Jordan Hall, 30 Gainesborough Street, Boston. Martin
Pearlman will conduct the 1790 opera, which some scholars attribute
to Mozart and colleagues. The performance will last about three
hours, including intermission. Soloists include Kurt Streit and
Paul Austin Kelly, tenors; Jane Giering-De Haan, Judith Lovat and
Sharon Baker, sopranos; Kevin Deas and Chris Pedro Trakas,
baritones, and Alan Ewing, bass. David Buch, the musicologist who
was the first to take a scholarly look at the work, will give a
preconcert talk at 6:45 Friday night and at 1:45 p.m. Sunday.
Tickets: $21 to $45. Information: (617) 484-9200.

`RETRIBUTION': BEWARE OF THE SURVIVOR WITH A GRUDGE AND A GUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's got a gun!
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous second-act firearm. Ever notice how frequently
one is drawn at the climax of an unconvincing play? Sure,
brandishing a .38 may coax an audience out of its coma: ``First of
all, when you've a gun,'' goes the line in the Sondheim musical
``Assassins,'' ``everybody pays attention.'' And yes, great theater
can be artfully strafed by gunfire. ``Three Sisters,'' ``Hedda
Gabler'' and ``The Wild Duck'' all end with offstage pistol
reports.
</P>
<P>
   But in lesser works, the sudden appearance of a weapon often is
a sign of dramatic desperation, an indication of the surrender of a
less than sublime sensibility, the kind that resorts to force when
imagination falls short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retribution'' is a case in point. Mark Shapiro's fitful drama,
at the Lamb's Theater, features Dennis Christopher as a mysterious
Holocaust survivor who insinuates himself into the life of another
former inmate of the concentration camps, a celebrated director
rehearsing a Broadway production of a Holocaust play. Christopher's
character, Carl Walkowitz, with a limp and a Middle European
accent, gets himself hired as the assistant to the director, played
by Jack Laufer, and proceeds to cause no end of mischief. He
seduces the director's movie-star wife, drives the director's Lee
Strasberg-ish mentor to a heart attack, leaks unfounded rumors to
the press about backstage anti-Semitism and . . . Uh-oh. He's got a
gun!
</P>
<P>
   Carl, it seems, has been nursing a terrible grudge against the
director since the war ended (the time is 1965), and he has chosen
a curiously complicated strategy for his revenge; the nature of his
grievance is a secret that Carl reveals to the director and his
wife at gunpoint. The play, based on the novel ``Who Shall Live,
Who Shall Die'' by Daniel Stern, a University of Houston English
professor, enmeshes its characters in a thorny moral argument
concerning the positions of authority that some Jews held over
others in the camps. And it means to raise questions about the
culpability of victims forced to make choices that spared them
while consigning others to death.
</P>
<P>
   The questions, while not novel, are certainly compelling, and
``Retribution'' is at its most persuasive when it comes at them
indirectly, as in a scene in which Carl and Laufer's character,
Judah Kramer, debate the predicament of Avram, the protagonist of
the play within a play, who becomes a Jewish capo in a camp.
Otherwise the production is toothless and unwieldy; despite the
gravity of the topic, it bogs down in the odd details. A scene at a
Jewish charity dinner is just plain peculiar; it includes a
publicity agent breathlessly rushing in to report that an
evil-minded theater columnist is skulking about and ``threatening
to disrupt the benefit,'' presumably by menacing people with his
press pass.
</P>
<P>
   The most noteworthy aspect of ``Retribution,'' directed by
Michael Unger, is the appearance by Christopher, who will be most
affectionately remembered as the Indiana bicycle racer in the movie
``Breaking Away.'' He's one of those actors who is eternally 25 in
the memory, and it's fun to watch him onstage all these years
later. You can sense his determination to make something of Carl,
but the part, and the performance, have little range, going from
dark and brooding to dark and sinister. The mechanics of the play
are of no help; they're creaky and unsuspenseful, lending a hollow
air to Christopher's creepy, Iago-like machinations.
</P>
<P>
   Laufer and the rest of the cast offer workmanlike if colorless
portrayals. Only that infernal gun hits its intended target.
</P>

ALL EYES IN BIG EAST ON UCONN SOPHOMORE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ For the first time in the 17-year history of Big
East women's basketball, a sophomore was named the preseason player
of the year Thursday. She hardly seemed thrilled by the honor, and
neither did her coach.
</P>
<P>
   At its annual day for the news media, the conference announced
that the head coaches had chosen Svetlana Abrosimova of
Connecticut. She is a 6-foot-2-inch forward (up from 6-1 last year)
who also starts for the Russian national team. Last season, she
averaged 14.4 points and a team-high 6.8 rebounds a game for
Connecticut. She is barely 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel apprehensive for her,'' said UConn coach Geno Auriemma,
``because to be that young, that far from home, to have that thrown
on her shoulders is a lot. She doesn't need to go through all this.
I'm anxious to see how it plays out.''
</P>
<P>
   What did Abrosimova think?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' she said with a smile that
seemed to say she would rather not have this burden or have to
explain it. ``It's OK I'm enjoying college basketball. I was home
this summer, and the whole summer I was looking forward to coming
back to Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Abrosimova is a key player for UConn, which reached the National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament's regional finals last
season. Its only experienced upperclassmen returning are Amy Duran,
a 5-11 senior forward/guard; Paige Sauer, a 6-5 junior center, and
Stacy Hansmeyer, a 6-1 junior power forward. UConn has five
freshmen in an exceptional recruiting class, and one of them _ 5-8
Keirsten Walters or 5-9 Sue Bird _ may start at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   Nine coaches chose UConn to win the league title again, and the
four others picked Rutgers. The key players for Rutgers are Tasha
Pointer, a 5-6 sophomore whom Rutgers Coach C.Vivian Stringer calls
the best point guard in the nation, and Tomora Young, a 5-10
shooting guard. Pointer will miss the next five to seven weeks
after arthroscopic knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Rutgers' third under Stringer, the team reached the
NCAA tournament regional semifinals. This year, she said with great
optimism, ``We can be a Final Four team.''

TEAMS PLAY WAITING GAME ON FREE AGENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Talk is cheap, so general managers continued calling
representatives of free agents Thursday, a week before they are
allowed to begin negotiating for players' services.
</P>
<P>
   No major player was among the seven who filed for free agency
Thursday: Joey Cora and Doug Jones of Cleveland, Terry Steinbach of
Minnesota, Dave Magadan of Oakland, Bobby Witt of St. Louis, Ricky
Bones of Kansas City and Tim Naehring of Boston. The free-agent
list grew to 116.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees general manager Brian Cashman said he was unable to
reach the agent for Kevin Brown but talked to the agents for Randy
Johnson and Devon White.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will at least see what it might cost to sign Johnson
or Brown, the top two pitchers on the market this off season.
White, who graduated from Park West High School in Manhattan, holds
some conditional interest for the Yankees. White, who will be 36 in
two months, plays center field, and the Yankees may need a center
fielder if Bernie Williams signs elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will not make definitive free-agency plans until
they have their organizational meeting in Tampa, Fla., next week.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said he also
continued talking with agents but declined to identify the players
he talked about. He said his primary interest was in second and
third basemen and right and left fielders. ``Most agents are just
taking temperatures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clubs can negotiate with and sign their own free agents, but
other clubs cannot initiate contract talks until Friday, Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cashman has said Williams is the Yankees' No. 1
priority, it is not clear if they will make him an offer before
other clubs can begin making their own offers.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Astros, on the other hand, plan to meet with Johnson
before next Friday. The dominating pitcher so excited the Astros
during his two-month stay with them this year that Drayton McLane
Jr., the team's owner, planned to participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, however, is not expected to commit to any team until he
sees what kind of market value he has. In the same way, the San
Diego Padres would like to re-sign Brown, but he will see what is
available before he makes a commitment. &QL;

   Singh humbled what was supposed to be a mean-spirited tract of
land with a 7-under-par 63 to take a three-stroke lead in the $4
million end to the PGA Tour's official season. The Fiji native, who
won the PGA Championship and Sprint International back-to-back in
August, tied the lowest score ever shot by the legendary Bobby
Jones at his home course. His score tied the lowest round in Tour
Championship history, although the 63s carded by Wayne Levi in '89
and '90 and by Jim Gallagher Jr. in '93 were 8-under-par totals.
</P>
<P>
   Singh also made liars out of everybody who predicted lots of
bogey tricks but no birdie treats this Halloween week.
</P>
<P>
   ``From tee to green, it's the best I've played all year,'' Singh
said. ``It was an exceptional round for anybody and one of the best
rounds I've played in my life. I never expected to shoot anything
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods might be saying the same thing. The Feline struggled.
Big-time. He finally scraped it around East Lake with a 5-over-par
75, some 12 strokes off the blistering pace Singh set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hit the ball well at all,'' Woods said. ``In fact, I
hit it all over the map. And the score showed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Did it ever. Typical of Woods' round was a double bogey on the
par-5 ninth hole, where he drove into the right rough and hit his
recovery shot into the water. He then launched his fourth shot over
the green and needed three shots to clean up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Singh was turning it into an 18-hole rout. He made
eight birdies in the first 15 holes before finally proving he was
human with a three-putt bogey on the par-3 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``My caddie asked me on No. 18 if I could believe what Vijay was
doing,'' said Justin Leonard, one of nine players to break par-70.
``I said, `What is he, 8-under?' I was joking. Then I looked on the
scoreboard, and he really was 8-under.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight-under never crossed my mind. Maybe 8 under bogey golf,
but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh shot 30 on the front nine and credited his iron play for
the sensational results. He hit three approach shots within a foot
and two more within six feet. Of his birdie putts, only one, a
15-footer on No. 9, would be considered a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Singh actually had a chance to threaten a round of 60 or perhaps
even 59 when he was staring at a 25-foot eagle putt on the par-5
15th. He missed and settled for a birdie that got him to 8-under.
</P>
<P>
   On No. 18, his 2-iron left him 40 feet short, and he missed a
five-foot comebacker for par.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a 62 in my mind,'' Singh said. ``It's always
disappointing leaving 18 with a bogey. It's a good round. But it
could have been one less.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Singh said, there were a lot of other shots he hit well _
far more than he hit poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unbelievable,'' Singh said of the day. ``I drove the
ball really long and straight. I was going into the greens with
short irons and middle irons. If you're doing that, you can go at
the flags, and the greens are putting so true that you can make
some putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Mayfair shot a 66 and was the closest to Singh. Tom Lehman
and Jim Furyk each had 3-under 67, and Jeff Sluman and Leonard were
another shot back.
</P>
<P>
   The top contenders for Player of the Year, David Duval and Mark
O'Meara, both struggled. Duval matched Woods' 75. O'Meara looked
like he was headed for a similar score but rallied with three
birdies on the last five holes to get back to 1-over 71.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara said his No. 1 asset was his experience, which
translated into patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of struggled at the start, and I was 4 over par after
11 holes,'' O'Meara said. ``But this is a long tournament. There's
no cut, and there's only 30 of us here. I started to make some
putts and played well down the stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Like everyone else, though, he marveled at Singh's play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw Vijay on the tee at No. 18, and I asked him what the
heck he was doing,'' O'Meara said. ``He said he was getting ready
for the grand slam (next year).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an incredible score on this course. But there are three
more rounds to go.''
</P>
<P>
   A fact comforting to everybody who was ambushed by Singh's
sizzler.
</P>
<P>
   On a breezy but pleasant day for golf, a lot of players
struggled. One-third of the field was lodged at 3-over 73,
including Fred Couples, Jeff Maggert, Phil Mickelson, Tom Watson
and Mark Calcavecchia, who triple-bogeyed No. 18 to account for all
his strokes over par. It was that kind of start at East Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Singh said he's taking nothing for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't easy,'' he said. ``I mean all the putts you have to
be very careful with. And I'm still worried about the rough. I'm
going to hit it in there sooner or later. And that's a good workout
trying to get out of there.''

TV SPORTS: RUNNING INTERFERENCE AGAINST THE ELEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those who will produce the New York City Marathon on Sunday
hope, as usual, for great racing and moving human interest stories.
</P>
<P>
   But their fervent wish is to avoid last year's weather nightmare
that made television screens periodically snap, crackle and pop and
then rendered crucial cameras useless as Franziska Rochat-Moser
took the lead in the women's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was as bad at the start as it was at the finish, it
would have been a disaster,'' said Gary Critchlow, the senior
production and operators manager for Trans World International,
which is producing the event.
</P>
<P>
   A ceiling of clouds as low as 100 feet off the ground made it
virtually impossible for the motorcycle-carried cameras following
the lead men's and women's packs to transmit their signals to the
five helicopters above them. The choppers dipped as low as 200
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned the helicopters would collide,'' said Brian
Williams of TWI, the marathon's producer.
</P>
<P>
   Critchlow added, ``A half hour before we went off the air, half
the monitors were blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams wondered which was more prudent: stick with the men's
race entirely as John Kagwe raced to a possible course record, or
cut intermittently to the women's race despite the continuous
breakup of the video signal.
</P>
<P>
   Williams stayed with the men's race for 14 key minutes until
transmission from the women's race cleared up in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was real frustrating because the audio from Katharine
Switzer told us it was a great race,'' Williams said, referring to
the on-course reporter for the women's race.
</P>
<P>
   The production team can't do much to avoid what happened last
year, except to pray for sun. The forecast calls for partly cloudy
skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've earned five years of good weather,'' said Paul
Bissonette, general manager of Channel 11.
</P>
<P>
   Still, TWI has mapped out every bridge and trestle over the
26.2-mile course to avoid places where the most video interference
occurs. TWI has added fixed cameras in the Bronx that are not
dependent on helicopter transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 35 cameras, eight mobile units, four motorcycles and a
pickup truck to cover the lead men's and women's packs, seven
helicopters _ two of them with cameras _ the sheer logistics and
coordination is huge,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond trying to handle weather-related woes, TWI has made other
changes from last year's broadcast. The co-anchors Al Trautwig and
Marty Liquori have left the disembodied studio inside the Channel
11 building on East 42nd Street for a new outdoor perch on Central
Park West, near Tavern on the Green.
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a camera mounted high above the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge to look down on the runners from the
starting point as they run to Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   TWI's production will be seen from 10:30-1:30, ET, on ESPN2.
Cable viewers will not see the local stories being pursued on the
Channel 11 broadcast, including the Five Borough Challenge Cup, a
race-within-a-race between selected runners from each of the city's
boroughs.
</P>
<P>
   HDTV'S Garden Party
</P>
<P>
   Madison Square Garden began its era of high-definition
television Tuesday night when it telecast the Rangers-Sabres game
in the new format, which more than doubles the resolution of
standard TV pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this season, all Rangers and Knicks home games on the
MSG Network will be produced in HDTV. Starting next season, so will
all Yankees home games on MSG and Mets home games on Fox Sports New
York. The Garden is making HDTV a big priority, including
renovating studios inside the arena and leasing a $9.8 million
mobile production truck, the only one of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the game could be seen in HDTV only on HDTV sets on
display at the Garden's Theater, and in a Nobody Beats the Wiz
store in Carle Place on Long Island. Like the Garden, Cablevision
Systems owns the 39-store Wiz chain.
</P>
<P>
   It is a no-brainer to say that watching hockey, or any sport, in
HDTV is better than traditional TV. The enhanced resolution
produces pictures that are crystal clear and wider so the viewer
receives a broadened, more vivid perspective. The format made it
easier to see plays developing and to see the blemishes on fans
sitting in the ninth row.
</P>
<P>
   It will be years before there are enough HDTV sets to see
programming at home that is shot in that format. But your friends
at Cablevision will soon offer its telecasts at the Garden's
restaurants, inside the arena's luxury suites and at the 39 Wiz
stores, where they will happily sell you a $4,000 set.
</P>
<P>
   Miscellany
</P>
<P>
   _ ESPN is aware of Joe Morgan's part in a group seeking to buy
the Oakland A's, but will not discuss his future as its lead
baseball analyst unless the deal progresses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Negotiations by MSG to sell local broadcast rights to 50 Mets
games are still ongoing, with no deadline set.
</P>
<P>
   _ Michael Wach, Channel 5's general manager, said it may be
months before he hires a two-announcer team to call Yankee games
next season.

AEROSPACE ENGINEERS LAUD GLENN'S FIRST, LATEST FEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY SHARLINE CHIANG  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Crammed nervously in front of a television in a
Rocketdyne conference room Thursday morning were the engineers who
helped put John Glenn into space -- twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched, I think, every shuttle launch and this one seems
more intense because of the passenger,'' said Vince Wheelock, 66,
of Westlake Village, who helped build and monitor the engines of
the Atlas rocket used in the Friendship 7 mission, Glenn's first.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) was during a time when there was a severe Cold War going
on and the Russians had beaten us in going up,'' he said. ``Today
we're more relaxed. We have a lot more history and experience
behind us.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind closed doors at 11 a.m. Thursday, eight other Rocketdyne
engineers in the suburban Los Angeles community of Canoga Park were
on what looked like a ``Star Trek'' set -- the Rocket Operations
Support Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in magenta swivel chairs, they monitored the Discovery
shuttle engines they helped build. Data from engine sensors beamed
to satellites and flashed across huge black walls at Rocketdyne.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Space Shuttle Main Engine division watched the
live countdown on a small TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, God, it's just too exciting, knowing that you helped these
men go up in space,'' said Natalie J. Faber, 42, a cost analyst
from Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And with Glenn aboard ``it's like reliving part of that
history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sure the place had seen plenty of other missions.
</P>
<P>
   But at Rocketdyne on Thursday, the suspense and thrill in the
air before the space shuttle Discovery took off was downright
palpable.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Glenn was going up. Again.
</P>
<P>
   And engines built by Rocketdyne would be blasting him into
space. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Making another mark in space exploration history, Glenn, 77, the
first American to orbit Earth in 1962, was hurtled along with six
other astronauts from Cape Canaveral in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Wheelock recalled how engineers on the 1962 mission were sent to
San Diego and sat on call in case of an engine problem. They were
equipped only with a table, a row of black rotary telephones and
television sets.
</P>
<P>
   At Rocketdyne on Thursday was Christopher Barr, 24, a
development engineer from Santa Monica who helped build the engines
for Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've physically touched them. . . . We put it together, we did
the design, inspection and certifying,'' Barr said. ``There is
always a lot of emotion when a rocket goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   As the final countdown neared, employees in the Rocketdyne
conference room glued their eyes to the television screen with the
intensity of fans rooting for the home team. Their players? Three
engines dubbed simply 2043, 2045 and 2048.
</P>
<P>
   When an announcement was made at T-minus five minutes that an
errant aircraft had caused a delay, the whole room groaned. Each
time the announcer checked in saying the engine sequence was on
schedule, the room broke into applause.
</P>
<P>
   When the orbiter finally blasted off, a burst of cheer was
followed by more nail-biting. Would the engines hold up? Was the
pressure right? Was the temperature too hot? Would there be a leak?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the white ship on the screen turned from pencil-size
to a peanut to a tiny dot and then disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The launch had been a success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your heart never stops beating fast. . . . I know a lot of
things have to go right at the same time,'' said William
Vietinghoff, 70, of Thousand Oaks, a retired engineer who helped
build the Atlas engines in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the crowd broke up and returned to regular duties,
Glenn was somewhere out in space above them, on his victory lap
around the world.

MALONE WANTED KENNEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (UPDATES WITH QUOTES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Davey Johnson might be the new manager of the Los
Angeles Dodgers, but Kevin Kennedy would now be holding such a
position if Kevin Malone, the new Dodgers' general manager, had his
way.
</P>
<P>
   According to three sources with ties to the team, Malone had
settled on Kennedy, but was forced to hire Johnson at the
insistence of president Bob Graziano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graziano felt the team needed a high profile manager with a
proven record, and went with Johnson,'' said one source. ``Believe
me, the job was Kennedy's until Graziano intervened.''
</P>
<P>
   The sources all said that former Dodgers' GM Tom Lasorda also
was in favor of Kennedy, a Dodger minor league manager from 1984
through '91 and San Fernando Valley native who wanted to return to
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Malone denied that Kennedy was his top choice. ``We
both felt Davey was the best choice. We were both in total
agreement. I like Kevin, Bob likes Kevin. But we felt Davey was by
far the best man for job.''
</P>
<P>
   From his room at Dodgertown, where the Dodgers are holding their
organizational meetings, Graziano said, ``Kevin (Malone) and I
worked on everything together, and even though we thought Kevin
Kennedy would have been a quality choice, Davey was our first
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Graziano is a longtime Dodgers' accountant who somehow has
managed to elevate himself to the team's top spot despite his
notable lack of baseball expertise. During his interview with
Kennedy, Graziano reportedly spent most of it probing the one-time
manager of the Boston Red Sox and Texas Rangers about his lifestyle
when he was a Dodger employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin was a little wild when he was younger, and Graziano was
more interested in that than he was in Kevin's baseball knowledge
and leadership skills,'' said another source. ``Graziano still
listens to Charlie Blaney (recently ousted Dodgers' minor league
chief), who didn't like Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Great!
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are being run by a bean counter dangling on a puppet
string being pulled by Fox Sports chiefs Chase Carey and Peter
Chernin, and I'm sure his foremost goal in life is to do whatever
it takes to preserve his lofty status.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it means listening once in a while to Charlie Blaney!
</P>
<P>
   What I find so astoundingly awful about Bob Graziano is that the
fellow actually goes around taking proud credit for firing Bill
Russell and Fred Claire and trading Mike Piazza for the brittle
Gary Sheffield and for a bunch of other guys who either can't hit,
or field, or run, or stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, Graziano hired Kevin Malone to take charge of the
Dodgers' baseball operation and to keep Graziano from continuing to
make a public fool out of himself, but, obviously, Graziano can't
help his incompetent self.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson might turn out to be just the person to ignite the
underachieving Dodgers, but his micro-managing approach has
resulted in bitter departures from the New York Mets, Cincinnati
Reds and Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Malone should have been given the opportunity to hire the
manager he wanted, but Bob Graziano felt compelled to make the
choice for him.
</P>
<P>
   With Graziano's astonishing record of success during his brief
Dodger reign, how could he not?

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stocky, bald, bearded man in tie and
shirt-sleeves recently poked his head into the doorway of the small
gym in the basement of Alumni Hall on the St. John's University
campus. For a few minutes he watched several members of the
basketball team working out in an array of gym-rat garb with a
conditioning coach.
</P>
<P>
   Then he called one of the players over to him, a senior named
Tyrone Grant. The two spoke quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make sure he takes the earring off,'' said Mike Jarvis, the
new head coach of the Red Storm. He was referring to a younger
player in the conditioning group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't wear earrings during work days,'' he told Grant, his
starting center. ``We have to pay attention to the little things,
then the big things will happen. Now that you're a captain I want
you to be really observant. If you can handle stuff like that for
me, I can handle the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, coach,'' said Grant, who had been voted captain by his
fellow players the previous week. ``I understand.'' And he returned
to his sweat, and to counsel the other player.
</P>
<P>
   The ``other stuff'' Jarvis will handle is giving his players a
sense of what they need to do if they wish to succeed once out of
school. But, unquestionably and perhaps unfortunately, the
foundation for the ``other stuff'' is to win basketball games. St.
John's opens its season on Nov. 16 against North Carolina-Asheville
in the Chase Preseason NIT at Alumni Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In the pressure of Division I hoops, a billion-dollar industry,
the goal is win first and, if time and energy permit, build
character afterward. If you do not win games, the coaches
understand, you will not be around long enough to inculcate
anything in anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But what does an earring removed or left sparkling on a left
lobe have to do with basketball?
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of companies in America would be resistant to hiring a
guy wearing an earring,'' Jarvis said. ``It's still not acceptable
to a lot of people. There's a few things in dress and demeanor that
may not be part of the mainstream, and I tell my players _ I've
been telling them for years _ that you have to do a lot of things
before you can be yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them Michael Jordan is the perfect example. It wasn't
until about the last three years _ until he became a corporation _
that he wore something as simple as an earring. But I tell them,
not when he's playing. Basketball is business, not fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get the job, and get it done, before you can ever
hope to one day take over the company and be in a position to make
the rules. When that happens, you can wear an earring or anything
else you want. I try to prepare the players for life after
basketball, through the realities of life. And I feel I can do it
through lessons learned in basketball. That's what I know. That's
my field.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis was speaking before official practice for the season
began week before last. The setting was his nicely appointed office
in Alumni Hall, in an area in which Lou Carnesecca guided the St.
John's basketball fortunes for 24 years, and where Brian Mahoney
and Fran Fraschilla had relatively brief coaching careers of four
and two seasons, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis, 53, came from George Washington University. He took over
a team that had gone 1-29 two seasons before he became head coach
there, in 1990, and in his first season took George Washington to
the Atlantic 10 final and the National Invitation Tournament. He
compiled a 152-90 record in eight seasons at George Washington,
with four visits to the NCAA tournament, reaching the Sweet 16 in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   He has never had a losing record as a coach, winning at Rindge
and Latin High School in Cambridge, Mass., and for five seasons at
Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   When Jarvis had watched the handful of St. John's players going
through strengthening drills, he noted their size. ``We're going to
be small,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be about 6-8 across the front line, with Tyrone our
center at about 6-8. We're not big, we're not fast _ I mean, we're
not slow, but I don't consider these guys to be jets, by no means _
so we have to be smart.''
</P>
<P>
   When the team's official practice sessions began on Oct. 17, the
players experienced this:
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of running and pressing and trapping,'' said Lavor
Postell, a junior who is the starting small forward. ``We didn't do
nearly as much last year because we were a bigger team. This year,
we're a lot smaller, and we understand the need for the change.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the coaching style of Jarvis, Postell added: ``He came in
with a good rep from GW, as both strong and gentle, and he's proved
a combination of both. I like the patience he's shown. We've got
these new drills, and when you mess up, he doesn't yell. He says,
`Look fellas, this is the way to do it.' Calm and cool. He's never
lost his cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant recalled one particular shot he took in a recent practice.
``I went for the follow-up rebound, but I guess not as strong as I
should have,'' he said. ``Coach Jarvis stopped practice. `You gotta
go hard, HARD, for the ball,' he told me. I wasn't embarrassed
because the way he said it was in a way that he meant to help me in
the long run. So I appreciated it.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was mentioned that his team lost two important players
from last season _ Felipe Lopez and Zendon Hamilton _ Jarvis said:
``I'm new. I haven't lost anybody. I don't know how much I'm
losing. I just concentrate on what we have.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As for a ``new'' player such as Erick Barkley, a 6-foot-1-inch
guard from Queens, Jarvis added: ``I don't think it's a secret that
we have a very fine basketball player in Erick Barkley. Obviously,
I don't consider him a freshman. He's been playing against the best
his whole life, and he spent a year in prep school. He's beyond his
years. He's just a great basketball player, no flash and glitter,
he just gets it done.''
</P>
<P>
   St. John's had a 22-10 record last season under Fraschilla, who
was more or less asked to leave after his second season there
because of behavior that made the St. John's brass apoplectic.
Fraschilla seemed to be openly seeking another job. The coaching
styles of Fraschilla and Jarvis are at opposite poles. Fraschilla
was a ranter, Jarvis is relatively reserved.
</P>
<P>
   One of the concerns of people at St. John's about Jarvis was
that he, too, might not be long for the job, even at a reported
salary of around $700,000 a year for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at George Washington for eight years and I never
recruited anyone without telling him that if another opportunity
presented itself to me, I'd have to consider it,'' Jarvis said.
``We are always trying to improve ourselves. The important thing is
to be honest with the people you're dealing with. The fact is, in
life, anything can happen. And in this business, there is no such
thing as forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis is open about his dream of one day coaching in the
National Basketball Association. He grew up in Cambridge, where, he
said, ``I was the only kid I knew of who fell asleep keeping count
of Bill Russell's rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis was interviewed in 1995 for the Celtics' coaching job by
the general manager, M.L. Carr, who eventually gave the job to M.L.
Carr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be happy to stay at St. John's forever,'' Jarvis said.
``But the only way I would ever be considered for another job is if
I made the people at St. John's happy. That is, if I did a great
job here. And that's what I intend to do.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unexpected magic happened several minutes into
``Kaleidoscope Suite,'' presented by Murray Louis and Nikolais
Dance on Wednesday night at the Joyce Theater. The curtain had
risen on a stage filled with sleek bodies in silhouetted profile in
intensely orange air, not quite human in crested helmets. As they
moved slowly through the dance, their right legs were suddenly
revealed to end in large, thin disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaleidoscope Suite,'' three dances from a piece Alwin Nikolais
created in 1956 and added to in 1986, is full of such moments of
visual wit and surprise, as is ``Nikolais Suite,'' a series of
dances from the 1950s and 1960s that followed on the program. We
have become used to visual spectacle, in a time of astonishing
advances in cinematic technology when animated ants command the
kind of attention once lavished exclusively on movie stars.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible to see the seeds of that in the two Nikolais
pieces and his 1983 ``Video Games,'' created for the Public Theater
production of ``Lenny and the Heartbreakers,'' and the 1985
``Crucible,'' both of which were included in this homage to the
choreographer, who died in 1993. The great pleasure of the imagery,
particularly in ``Kaleidoscope Suite'' and ``Nikolais Suite,'' is
the lack of attention it calls to itself. Nikolais sowed such
surprises with the nonchalance of a magician, weaving them into a
smooth flow of dance that never succumbed to the blandishments of
high drama and the classical ballet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disks'' plays deftly with our perceptions of shape and depth.
The long white pole manipulated in ``Pole'' by Alberto del Saz and
Kimberly Gibilisco, as solemnly purposeful and inscrutable as
temple dancers, divides, joins and helps to define the two as
moving bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolais' dryly funny imagination runs riot in the ``Clothes''
section of ``Kaleidoscope Suite.'' He turns his dancers from moment
to moment into swaying columns topped by brilliantly colored
lampshade hats, hunched and scurrying acrobats whose unitards might
have been designed by Picasso, and prancing creatures with
scalloped breasts and genitals, one of whom becomes a tiny diva
worthy of this near-operatic spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   How did Nikolais make the two shifting silver protoplasms ( del
Saz and Peter Kyle) glow with such strange brilliance in
``Noumenon,'' so differently abstract from Martha Graham's
emotion-driven women in stretch fabric? Small deft hands curl above
totems that soften into lush blossoms when the three dancers (Ms.
Gibilisco, Susan Pajak and Trista Redavid) recline at the end of
the excerpt from ``Vaudeville of the Elements.''
</P>
<P>
   The many-jointed, undulating arms of five men ( del Saz, Kyle,
Tyrone Baker, Dennis Johnston and Adam Klotz) suggest much while
looking, gloriously, like absolutely nothing but jointed arms in
``Mantis,'' from ``Imago.'' The suite (and the evening) ends on a
note of luscious prettiness with ``Tensile Involvement,'' a dance
of continuously changing cat's cradles of shimmering stretchy
colored ribbons.
</P>
<P>
   The transforming shapes of ``Crucible'' eventually come to seem
a little flat. And ``Blank on Blank,'' the 1987 work that completed
the program, never quite furnishes a theme for the dancers' street
clothes to relate to. But the personable, intelligent dancers, who
also included Pamela Levy-Arauz and Elizabeth Higgins, were always
a pleasure.

`DISPOSITION': A QUIRKY BALLET PLUS A WITTY SHOSTAKOVICH

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ ``Disposition,'' a quirky ballet that John Selya
has set to witty music by Dmitri Shostakovich, is the fifth work
that Selya has choreographed for American Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Led with just the right zaniness by Paloma Herrera and Giuseppe
Picone at its premiere on Wednesday night at City Center,
``Disposition'' is one of Selya's useful pieces for the company.
The whole thing does not quite add up and suggests a subplot in
search of a plot. But the choreography, more difficult in its
classical technique than first apparent, shows off some spiffy
dancing. It also opens up new aspects of the dancers' stage
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   A corps member since 1988 with a high dose of bravura in his own
performing, Selya has the advantage of working from the inside. He
knows his dancers. Thanks to him, Ms. Herrera now lightens up in a
role that she performs with unaffected charm. Picone, like a fellow
Italian, the late Marcello Mastroianni, proves that a heart throb
image does not preclude a comic talent.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Selya has yet to choreograph a truly meaningful
ballet, and ``Disposition'' is not it. The audience on Wednesday
was understandably enthusiastic about the energy on stage and
Shostakovich's wonderfully festive music, drawn from his first two
Dance Suites and first Jazz Suite.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is an uncertain tone about the ballet in its
attempt to be funny and serious at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   The fleeting allusions to other works, including ``Don Quixote''
and, more interesting, the inventive twists on standard steps,
suggest an in joke about ballet as an art form.
</P>
<P>
   Picone, entering with a mad rush to plunge into a tricky series
of turns (he faces different parts of the stage to begin each
turn), comes across as an egotistical male star. But when
partnering Ms. Herrera, who drops casually in and out of alignment,
he becomes a Pygmalion choreographer guiding what is an eccentric
Galatea.
</P>
<P>
   Coherence is not the strong suit here, but there are good
moments. Visually, Jennifer Tipton's lighting magnificently deepens
shades of red on the backdrop and sets off Selya's black and red
costumes. The cast includes Brian Reeder, Carlos Molina and four
bubbly women with curls piled high on their heads: Stella Abrera,
Anna Liceica, Anne Milewski and Gillian Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The music, vividly conducted by Ermanno Florio, is also a
delight. The galop from Dance Suite No. 1 introduces the four
women, Picone's mad whirl and the leaps of the two other men. The
witty plunks of Jazz Suite No. 1 (first movement) contrast with the
reverie of Ms. Herrera's solo. With her ponytail and black tights
under her tutu, she portrays a student. The choreography's collage
of unrelated steps includes deep plies on toe and the quotations
from ``Don Quixote'' (kick to the back of the head, slapping a hand
on the floor). When Ms. Herrera occasionally collapses into a
``wrong'' position, the word play of ``Disposition'' as a title
flashes by subliminally.
</P>
<P>
   The Pygmalion duet, to deliberately sentimental music from Dance
Suite No. 2, shows who is boss. Picone arrests Ms. Herrera's leap
in midflight and corrects her alignment. A change of pace comes
with two sections danced to the second and third movements of the
Jazz Suite. The women swivel and twist, then undulate in a section
with the less-than-tidy male soloists. Dance Suite No. 1 returns
for the last two sections. A duet, somewhat lyrical, leads Ms.
Herrera down Picone's back into an eventual embrace; a fast finale
suggests that the student has graduated. Now it is she who nudges
the ensemble into a straight line.
</P>
<P>
   Nacho Duato's ``Remanso,'' a very different ballet, also gets by
as a showcase for dancing rather than food for thought. Granados'
``Valses Poeticos,'' played in the pit by the pianist Barbara
Bilach, becomes a springboard for sheer dance power. As last year,
a bare-legged male trio puts on an athletic display, not devoid of
clarity and generalized passion. Vladimir Malakhov, Keith Roberts,
and, in a fine, forceful debut, Maxim Belotserkovsky were terrific.
</P>
<P>
   In Clark Tippet's imaginative variations on neo-classical dance,
``Bruch Violin Concerto,'' the dancing was fine as long as you
didn't look at the dancers' feet. Exceptions to the carelessness
were Ashley Tuttle, who saved the day by giving every step full
value and flourish, and Gillian Murphy, with her fierce attack in
the stylized tango. Ron Oakland was the violin soloist.  &QL;

<P>
   Same teams, different city, very different game.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 hours before, the Bruins had left the Molson Centre with
a remarkable 9-2 blowout victory over the Canadiens in the first
game of a home-and-home series. They had taken advantage of a nasty
elbowing incident to score three goals during a five-minute major
penalty to Dave Manson that gave them a six-goal lead and for all
intents and purposes ended the game halfway through.
</P>
<P>
   There were no such fireworks Thursday night as the teams battled
to a 1-1 overtime tie at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of character on that hockey club and there's a
lot of pride when you wear that sweater,'' said Bruins coach Pat
Burns, a former Habs coach. ``When things happen like (Wednesday),
I knew they were going to come out like gangbusters, and they did.
We had nothing in our favor whatsoever. It was our first game back
after a long road trip, we played (the night before), we beat a
team bad in their own building. If I pick up 3 of the 4 points in
48 hours against the Montreal Canadiens, would you expect me to be
upset? No. I'm not upset. I'm very, very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson was no factor because he was suspended for three games by
the NHL, and his victim, left wing P.J. Axelsson, was held out for
precautionary reasons when he woke up with a headache. He was
diagnosed with a slight concussion and said he hopes to be back
Saturday against Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The rematch was much closer to the vest than the first game.
There were no offensive barrages, no heavyweight bouts (only
skirmishes), and the teams played tighter defense. On Wednesday
night, the Habs didn't play any defense and the Bruins didn't
really have to.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Byron Dafoe, who faced 35 mostly harmless shots
Wednesday, had far fewer to fend off Friday night (23), but the
chances were more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   While power plays were the order of the day Wednesday _ the
Bruins went 5 for 9, their high in the past 8 1/2 years _ they had
a hard time generating anything on the man advantage in Round 2,
going 1 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fumbled on the power plays,'' said Burns. ``We could
probably have won the game, but we'll take what was given to us and
be very happy with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins were 1 for 6 in the first period, Steve Heinze
connecting as the Habs tried to grab a physical edge as a revenge
factor but wound up parading to the penalty box. Ironically, Heinze
had been told he wasn't playing because of his injured right ring
finger, which kept him out Wednesday. But when Axelsson couldn't
go, Heinze got the call.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping, but I didn't know if I could hold the stick when
I got out there,'' said Heinze. ``Fortunately, I could. It was kind
of weird. It's tough getting ready for a game you don't think
you're going to play. Actually, you go out there without any
pressure, just let it hang loose. I wasn't thinking about it all
day, so it was easy to go out there and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Don Sweeney, positioned along the far left edge of
the left faceoff circle, dished the puck down to left wing Ted
Donato behind the net. Donato relayed it out to Heinze in the left
circle, and he fired it past goalie Jocelyn Thibault at 15:32. It
was Heinze's third goal of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments before, he was smarting from the vibration off his
stick after attempting a one-timer. Center Joe Thornton made a pass
and Heinze tried to connect, but his finger, which was gashed
against New Jersey Saturday, was too painful for him to complete
the shot. However, he quickly recovered and banged in his 100th
career goal.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he hurt himself on the first attempt, Heinze
laughed. ``Oh yeah,'' he said. ``The vibration made it sting a bit.
It made it numb, and you don't feel it on the next shot, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead lasted until the final minute of the second period when
the Canadiens, who had far fewer man advantages than Boston, pulled
even on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Center Chris Taylor was bagged for closing his hand over the
puck in the right corner of the Bruins' zone at 17:37. With only
40.2 seconds left in the period, Dafoe, who had lost his stick,
tried to fend off a Habs flurry but couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Damphousse, behind the net, threaded a pass through the
crease for Brian Savage. While falling forward, Savage punched a
shot past the goalie at the left post.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe's biggest save came at 13:55 of the third when he stoned
Savage from the right circle. The Bruins nearly ended it with 6.5
seconds left in regulation when defenseman Grant Ledyard, who had a
goal and two assists Wednesday, fired a shot from deep in the right
circle that Thibault snagged with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't quite get it high enough,'' said Ledyard. ``But we
got 3 out of 4 points and we're happy with that.''

NBA UNION HAS BARGAIN HUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ The criterion was clear: Get someone who would
stare David Stern in the eye and not come down with conjunctivitis.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Players Association saw a street fight brewing two years
ago, one that has erupted into open warfare. It wanted someone to
lead the union who would see Stern as a mere antagonist rather than
the intimidating, dominating, bullying, and, in its mind, always
victorious foe.
</P>
<P>
   That someone is Billy Hunter. Prior to his hiring as the union's
executive director, he was best known for taking on members of the
Hell's Angels and Jim Jones's People's Temple. Now he's taken on an
even more sinister group in the eyes of some of his flock: the NBA
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA lockout has wiped out the month of November and, with no
settlement imminent, could soon take a chunk out of December. It's
a first for the NBA, which always has managed to play a season
relatively free of labor strife. In the minds of Stern and his
deputy, Russ Granik, that was possible because reasonable people
made reasonable decisions. In the minds of the players, it was
because Stern always got his way. They wanted that to change.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter investigated the job at the urging of former Syracuse
classmate Dave Bing. He met some of his eventual clientele during
All-Star weekend in 1996, and it was clear to him, and to them,
what the job description entailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we couldn't have David Stern ourselves, we wanted the next
best thing. We needed someone to stand up to him and battle with
him,'' said Seattle center Jim McIlvaine, one of the members of the
union's executive committee. ``We wanted a guy who could get into a
room with David Stern and duke it out _ verbally _ and for a
variety of reasons, we thought Billy could be that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   What also made Hunter attractive to the union was his
background. There wasn't a hoop in it. The two other finalists,
agent Bill Strickland and former CBA commissioner Terdema Ussery,
each had some battle scars from years in the game. Hunter was
clean, fresh, ambitious, and knew a little about underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   As an 11-year-old, he pitched in the championship game of the
1955 Little League World Series, believed to be the first
integrated team in the final. Football was his sport at Syracuse,
where he roomed with John Mackey and captained the 1964 Orangemen.
He played briefly in the NFL for Washington and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a hard worker on the field and in the classroom,''
Mackey said. ``He kept saying that he came to Syracuse not just to
score touchdowns but also to score in the classroom. He knew how
important it was. But he was a damn good football player, too. And
he won't be intimidated by the owners. If he wasn't intimidated by
all those linemen, he isn't going to be intimidated now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter had been the US Attorney in Northern California,
appointed by President Carter in 1977. He had been a defense lawyer
and an entertainment industry litigator. But basketball? He was a
fan, an observer, an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in from the outside, he had a fresh perspective,'' said
union attorney Ron Klempner, who has worked at the association for
five years under three executive directors. ``He just made it so
easy for everyone. He's straight with you. He cuts right to it.
People can warm up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, some people can. Stern has found Hunter and his minions to
be implacable almost to the point of absurdity. ``This union
membership has stymied us,'' Stern said recently. ``We've been at
this, Russ and I, for somewhere over 50 years combined. We've been
able to negotiate with every other combination of executive
directors and presidents in the history of the union.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Hunter has kept the players and agents on the same page,
a far cry from the fractured union of three years ago. He hired a
director of communications _ he needs more help, Billy _ to help
get the message out and makes his players available when possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are not dumb jocks,'' Hunter said. ``These are
sophisticated and enlightened people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter got huge numbers to show up in a solidarity showcase in
Las Vegas while at the same time telling some agents to stifle the
decertification talk for now. He got another big crowd Wednesday in
New York. Such longtime union ciphers as Michael Jordan, Karl
Malone, and David Robinson have been transformed into Eugene V.
Debs clones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done it through effective and forthright
communication,'' Strickland said. ``After Larry Fleisher (the first
union head), this is the first guy who is looking David Stern right
in the eye and not kowtowing. That's what the players have
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Hunter as a talented tailback/defensive back
at Syracuse, as well as a leader off the field, are not surprised.
Floyd Little, who took Hunter's tailback job, got a taste of what
motivated Hunter soon after Little arrived on the Syracuse campus.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule had Syracuse playing Virginia Tech. Hunter
organized a petition drive with Bing, Little, and others to
eliminate schools with no African-American players from the
Syracuse schedule. It didn't work immediately. They played the game
and Syracuse won, but barely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frightening for me,'' said Little. ``There were only a
handful of us (blacks) on campus, but Billy fought the right fight.
He's always fought the right fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight is far from over. Even after Wednesday's eight-hour
marathon bargaining session, there has been little movement. More
talks soon will be held while more games and more money will be
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The players don't like what the league is offering and say they
won't accept it. Hunter said the union is anxious but not to
interpret the anxiety as a sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   He went into this job with his eyes wide open. He hasn't come
close to blinking yet. His constituency is betting, hoping, that he
never will.

   FOXBOROUGH _ Sometimes you don't have to talk to anybody to
understand the situation. Sometimes you just have to know how to
count.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, there has been much gnashing of teeth in
New England because The Flying Elvises, also known as your New
England Patriots, have lost back-to-back games to the New York Jets
and Miami Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, we hear: How can so talented a team find itself
mired in fourth place in the AFC East as midseason approaches? How
can a team that has been labeled _ and said little to argue against
the label, we must add _ among the most talented in the AFC lose to
the Jets and Dolphins, two division rivals most people would insist
are not as talented as the Patriots?
</P>
<P>
   Well, here are the facts, folks.
</P>
<P>
   This oh so talented team is 11-10 since it opened 1997 with a
4-0 rush against a group of opponents who finished that season with
an aggregate record of 20-44.

<P>
   This oh so talented team's 10 losses have come against teams
that had an aggregate record of 112-52 in 1997-98. Its 11 victories
have come against teams that are an aggregate 82-79 in 1997-98. If
one goes back to the start of last season, the Patriots have 15
victories in their last 25 games (including playoffs). If the four
season-opening victories last year are added in, their victims have
an aggregate record of 102-123.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make them the Peter McNeeley of the NFL? Well, no. But
it doesn't make them Evander Holyfield, either. So what does this
tell us?
</P>
<P>
   It tells us it has been a mistake all along for so many to talk
so often about how talented this Patriots TEAM is, because
apparently, the TEAM is not as talented as all except the few
naysayers accused of terminal gloom and doom have argued.
</P>
<P>
   There are individual players of great skill in Foxborough.
Several, like Ben Coates, Drew Bledsoe, and Bruce Armstrong, have
been consistent Pro Bowl performers and remain among the elite. But
the TEAM has been consistent in only one thing since the Bill
Parcells-Bledsoe-Pete Carroll era began in 1993. It beats up on the
Sisters of the Lake and loses to the Monsters of the Midway.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of Carroll, the so-called elite teams have ``no
more than three or four losses'' in a season. But for the purposes
of this discussion, we were slightly kinder and included teams that
are 11-5 or better among the elite.
</P>
<P>
   What we found was an amazing consistency each year in how many
such teams exist in the NFL. From 1993, when Parcells arrived, to
the end of last season, there were 26, an average of just over five
a season. In fact, every year but last year, there were five teams
at 11-5 or better.
</P>
<P>
   Only once during that stretch has the talented TEAM known as the
New England Patriots been among them.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Patriots have met such teams with some regularity.
On average three times a season during the 1993-97 stretch, they
faced opponents who ended the year 11-5 or better. What did this
most talented TEAM do against those elite opponents?
</P>
<P>
   It went 2-14, including playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Do we begin to see a trend here?
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilding Patriots were 0-3 in 1993 against the heavy iron,
but that was predictable considering what was here when Parcells
arrived. In 1994, things were not much better. The team went 10-6
and reached the playoffs but was 1-2 against top opposition.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, it was back to the future, the Patriots going 0-3
against the best of the best. And in 1996, when they made their
playoff run without having to face such a team in the final two
months until running afoul of the Green Bay Packers in the Super
Bowl, the Patriots were 0-2 against opponents who were 11-5 or
better.
</P>
<P>
   Last year? They went 1-4 in such key games.
</P>
<P>
   This season is only half over, so a statistical breakdown like
this has less validity, but the early evidence indicates nothing
has changed. No one can know yet how a season will turn out for any
NFL team, but after seven games, these would be considered the
``elite teams'' the Patriots have faced, based on their records:
Denver (7-0) and Miami (5-2).
</P>
<P>
   Need I remind you they lost to both?
</P>
<P>
   What we seem to have here is a Charles Dickens novel in shoulder
pads. We have ``Great Expectations.'' But as good as that novel
was, it wasn't ``David Copperfield'' or ``A Tale of Two Cities,''
and as great as some Patriot players may be and as well paid as
most of them are, they are thus far Great Expectations Unfulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that a high salary does not make you a great
football player or a superior employee in any endeavor. It makes
you well off. It doesn't mean you perform when the heat is on now;
it means somebody hopes you might in the future.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it's done in pro sports today. You don't pay for
production. You pay for potential, which my father always said
means you haven't done a damn thing yet. Clearly, there is some of
that on both sides of the ball in New England and all over the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, never has so talented a team so consistently shot
itself in the foot against top opposition.
</P>
<P>
   A stupid penalty here cost you a field goal early, so at the
end, Dan Marino needs 3 points to tie the game. Hey, who knew?
</P>
<P>
   A stupid penalty there and the Denver Broncos are on their way
to 17 easy points almost before the game has begun. Stuff happens,
man!
</P>
<P>
   A dropped pass in the end zone, an overthrown ball with a
receiver running free for a sure touchdown, a block not made
downfield, an unwise use of the clock, a wasting of several
timeouts, a ``once-in-a-lifetime'' interception by a wandering nose
tackle from Pittsburgh. Bad luck, right?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who is honest about this most talented team knows this is
what has happened again and again over the past five-plus years.
Score a touchdown to get some momentum in the Super Bowl. Allow a
kick returner to go from New Orleans to New York on the next play.
These are not fictions. These are hard facts. And the hard facts
need to be faced by Carroll and the most talented team he's
coaching or they will be repeated before this year is out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are what we are,'' vice president of player personnel Bobby
Grier said. ``I've said all along, until we beat the elite teams
and play with consistency in those kind of games, you're not an
elite team. People can talk all they want about how much talent we
have. I think we do have a lot of talent. But until it's
demonstrated on the field in those games, what do you really
have?''
</P>
<P>
   You have frustrations and gray hair if you're Grier and you have
a team in the middle of the pack if you're Carroll. You have a team
whose self-image is superior to its real image. You have a team
that is very likely to spank the Indianapolis Colts Sunday and
Atlanta if the Falcons go with aged Steve DeBerg in two weeks and
Buffalo a couple of times down the road and probably even Miami
here at home.
</P>
<P>
   If one looks at both the Patriots' individual talent and track
record in recent years, it is not inconceivable to postulate that
this most talented team could run off five straight wins. If the
Patriots do, they'd be 9-3 and people again would be talking about
how they are among the most talented teams in the AFC. They would
be making reservations for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This we have seen.
</P>
<P>
   But then that most talented team will have to go to Pittsburgh,
which is struggling this year but still is 5-2 and seems to end up
11-5 nearly every season (three of the last five). Two weeks later,
that most talented team will have to host San Francisco before
ending the season in New Jersey against the hated Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this most talented TEAM can do this year what it has
failed to do since it was put together. Perhaps it will beat the
heavy iron. Perhaps it will go to Three Rivers Stadium and whip up
on the Steelers even if they are again the Steelers they used to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will host the 49ers and send them home limping, too.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   But after 5 1/2 years of watching the most talented team in the
AFC, I'll believe it when I see it.

FINALLY, A RETURN TO BACK-TO-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he first saw the schedule, Harry Sinden's eyes got big and
wide. It was a clear case of deja vu all over again.
</P>
<P>
   WED OCT 28 BOSTON AT MONTREAL
</P>
<P>
   THU OCT 29 MONTREAL AT BOSTON
</P>
<P>
   Oh boy! Sacre bleu! Honest-to-God, true back-to-back games.
Bring back the Garden. Bring back the Forum. Bring back the trains.
Bring back John Kiley. Bring back Frank Fallon. Make sure the
Canadiens get a good rate at the Hotel Madison. This is NHL hockey
as it ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   For two nights, we were all in a time warp. On Wednesday, the
Bruins went up to the Molson Centre and hammered the Canadiens,
9-2. Thursday night the aroused Canadiens fought our lads to a 1-1
standoff. They will play five times this season, and we just had
two of them within 48 hours. The games hardly could have been more
different, which should not come as a great big shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was to be expected,'' shrugged Pat Burns. ``They've got
character on that hockey club. There's a lot of pride involved when
you're wearing that sweater. I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   In case you forgot, he used to coach up there.
</P>
<P>
   Don't let anyone try to slip any jive by you implying this was a
great game, or even a good one. It was a more competitive game, but
what wouldn't be?
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens took 12 penalties, seven of them in the first
period. They were sent off for every infraction known to man, save
loitering and impersonating a Hab. The Bruins managed to score on
one of their nine power-play tries. The only Montreal goal also
came on a power play. The goaltending of Byron Dafoe and Jocelyn
Thibault was good, but there was no highlight stuff. It was not
gripping entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Burns doesn't need entertainment, however. The main concern in
his professional life is points, and he liked the arithmetic
provided by the back-to-back get-together with the Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had nothing in our favor,'' Burns observed. ``It was our
first game back after a long road trip. We beat them badly in their
building the night before. If I pick up 3 of 4 points over the
Montreal Canadiens in 24 hours, am I upset? No.''
</P>
<P>
   There used to be back-to-backs all the time in Ye Olden Days.
The NHL had them and the NBA likewise had them. Players would ride
either the train or plane together after Game 1. I well remember
some Saturday night/Sunday afternoon Knicks-Celtics sets
highlighted by an interesting scene at LaGuardia. The Knicks would
get in first class and the Celtics would get in coach. But we
digress.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins agreed that the world would be a better place if
there were more of these. ``This is how you build rivalries,'' said
Steve Heinze, who scored the Boston goal. ``It's good for hockey,
especially when you're talking about two of the Original Six. It's
absolutely a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Original Six, huh? You could never guess he's from around here.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden was front and center for the tail end of the Original Six
days, and he remembers the back-to-backs with great fondness. ``I
remember them beating us up there something like 8-2 on a Thursday,
and us turning around and beating them something like 8-0 back here
on Saturday,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like these two asked for this fortuitous scheduling.
``It was just a scheduling quirk,'' explained Nate Greenberg,
Harry's official Righthand Man. ``I used to love the
Saturday-Sunday ones. You'd love to have more of them, but it's the
reality of the '90s. It is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, this was the first true back-to-back (i.e.,
successive days) on the Bruins' regular-season schedule since Jan.
15-16, 1992, when they beat the Hartford Whalers, 4-3, the first
night in the Civic Center and beat them by an identical score 24
hours later in the Garden.
</P>
<P>
   If Burns were making out the schedule, you'd see more of them.
``Oh yeah,'' he said. ``I think it's a damn shame we don't do this
more often. How are fans going to develop a hate for a team if you
don't play them more often? If you want to develop good rivalries,
you've got to play each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins knew very well that they would have been better off
playing anyone else after what they did to the Canadiens the night
before, but they were good sports about it. ``Any win up there is a
good win,'' said Don Sweeney. ``We knew they'd come back and
respond the way they did. But 3 out of 4 points, even early in the
season, is critical.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for Back To The Future Night at the Fleet. Now I have a
question. On my way out of the building, I noticed some panes of
rectangular glass, to which an orange ring was affixed. Does
anybody know what those things are supposed to be?

LACK OF INTENSITY BOTHERS CORNERBACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Donnell Day is concerned and he doesn't mind
saying so.
</P>
<P>
   Cal State Northridge was two days from a game that can keep its
Big Sky title hopes alive, a Saturday matchup at No.23 Weber State,
and the senior cornerback didn't see an urgency on the practice
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a lot better,'' Day said after Thursday's
practice. ``We know that we're contending, but we have to work
hard. I think the two games that we were defeated kind of have the
players thinking, `Can we do it, or not?' We know we can do it, but
the morale is down somewhat and practices have been average.''
</P>
<P>
   Before CSUN (4-3, 3-2 Big Sky) lost at Sacramento State and to
Montana State in the last two weeks, everybody was upbeat. But Day
said during this week of practice, in which the hitting was
curtailed, the intensity has been lacking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's thinking about Weber, but we have to show it,''
Day said. ``I don't think we'll show it before Weber. Our team is
quiet a few days before games and then when the game starts, we get
explosive.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Mageo brothers at CSUN?: CSUN junior defensive lineman Jacob
Mageo is obviously thinking about Weber State, but he also can't
help but look toward next season.
</P>
<P>
   Mageo said his brother Jason, a 6-foot, 240-pound defensive end
at Oregon State, plans on transferring to CSUN in January. He'll
use his last year of eligibility to play with the Matadors next
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't wait to come over here,'' Jacob Mageo said. ``I think
we're both looking forward to playing on the same d-line.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Mageo is redshirting this year at Oregon State.
</P>
<P>
   __ Surprise, surprise: The Matadors were scheduled to leave
campus today at 5:45 a.m., but a surprise player didn't make the
trip. Ponciano said freshman linebacker Lewis Blanton, who moved
into a starting spot when Cos Abercrombie was injured in the second
game of the season, will remain home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not getting it done,'' Ponciano said. ``I have to bring
the guys who do the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Also not making the trip is defensive lineman Troy Loggins and
left tackle Mike Barnes. Instead, freshman Geoff Watson is expected
to make his first start.
</P>
<P>
   __ CSUN food drive: CSUN will hold a food drive prior to the
Nov.7 game against Portland State at North Campus Stadium. Any fan
contributing two or more nonperishable food items will receive one
free ticket to the game. There is a two-ticket limit. Contributions
may also be dropped off at the Daily News, at Kaiser Permanente
Hospitals, the CSUN athletic department or at North Campus Stadium.

LACROIX RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Eric Lacroix insists he wasn't run out of
Denver amid cries of nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, the 27-year-old winger spoke to the Colorado
Avalanche general manager, who also happened to be his father, and
told him he felt it would be best if he'd be traded by the
struggling franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The wish was accommodated Thursday, when Lacroix was traded to
the Kings _ with whom he broke in during the 1995 lockout season _
for center Roman Vopat and a sixth-round draft choice next year.
Lacroix is expected to be available for tonight's game against the
Tampa Bay Lightning at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough couple of days,'' said Lacroix, who has
averaged 16 goals the last three years but has no points in seven
games this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings traded Lacroix _ a hard-hitting role player _ to
Colorado two years ago for goalie Stephane Fiset. The Avalanche,
whose general manager is Pierre Lacroix, had just won the Stanley
Cup and looked like a dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   But Colorado has steadily declined, and this week, under the
headline, ``It's time for total eclipse of this son,'' a Denver
Post columnist wrote, ``Eric Lacroix has missed one start since
joining the team ... an indication of the enduring power of
nepotism.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Lacroix said, ``Of course I read the article. That guy
is a columnist. He's entitled to his opinion. That's what he's paid
for and that's what he does. Sure, it hurt. But that's part of the
business. I never had a problem with that. It's a free country. But
to say a thing like that might not hurt you, though, I'd be
lying.''
</P>
<P>
   To get Lacroix, Kings general manager Dave Taylor gave up Vopat,
22, who was scoreless in just three appearances and has a penchant
for taking foolish penalties. Vopat came to the Kings in the 1996
trade that sent Wayne Gretzky to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more an opportunity to acquire Eric Lacroix,'' Taylor
said when asked if the Kings had given up on Vopat. ``He's a good
character player. He's quite a bit like Ian Laperriere in that he's
very feisty, hard to play against, and he goes to the net real
hard. He brings a lot of elements you can never have enough of.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Fiset out: Upon returning to Los Angeles on Thursday
following their five-game Eastern trip, the Kings learned Fiset's
strained left-groin muscle will sideline him on a week-to-week
basis.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset was injured in Wednesday night's 4-0 victory over the New
Jersey Devils in the finale of the trip. It was his first game back
after straining his right-groin muscle 10 days earlier, and he was
sharp in stopping the first 23 shots he faced. His injury will mean
more playing time for Manny Legace and, perhaps, Ryan Bach.
</P>
<P>
   In other injury news, goalie Jamie Storr remains week to week
with a groin injury but might start skating in a week; center
Laperriere (partially torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left
knee) could be cleared to skate by the end of the weekend; and
center Jozef Stumpel, the team announced, has had abdominal pain to
go with his left strained hip flexor and will see a hernia
specialist today.

NHL HITS MANSON WITH 3-GAME SUSPENSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you do the crime, you'll do the time.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hockey League continued pursuing its objective to
rid the game of flagrant hits to the head Thursday by suspending
Canadiens defenseman Dave Manson for three games after he elbowed
Bruins left wing P.J. Axelsson. Manson also was fined $1,000, the
maximum allowed under the collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's 9-2 rout of the Habs, Manson wound up and
delivered a nasty blow to Axelsson's head at 6:10 of the second
period along the boards behind the Canadiens' net, sending the
sophomore forward sprawling to the ice.
</P>
<P>
   Axelsson returned to the game after resting on the bench, but
the NHL, which has been cracking down on such incidents, felt
Manson deserved to sit for three, including last night's rematch at
the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Manson delivered a flagrant elbow to Axelsson's face,'' said
Colin Campbell, the league's senior vice president and director of
hockey operations. ``Whether by elbow, stick, or otherwise, the
league will continue to punish players for deliberate blows to the
head of an opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the hit, Manson was assessed a game misconduct
and five-minute major penalty for elbowing. The Bruins scored three
power-play goals in a span of 51 seconds to boost their lead to
6-0.
</P>
<P>
   The league has not been hesitant to mete out supplementary
discipline for hits such as Manson's. A year ago by this date, the
NHL had issued three suspensions, two of which were given out in
the preseason. Manson's suspension was the 11th this season _ and
it's still October.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadiens were upset with Bruins coach Pat Burns because he
sent his top power-play unit out during a two-man advantage with
Boston riding a 7-1 lead. Coach Alain Vigneault thought Burns was
running up the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what else you call it,'' he said. ``They had a
7-1 lead and a two-man advantage and they had their No. 1
power-play unit out there. We'll remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns labeled Manson's hit a cheap shot. He and the big
defenseman were jawing at each other when Manson was banished for
the evening, but he said it was ridiculous to say he ran up the
score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why would I want to humiliate the Canadiens?'' said Burns,
their former coach. ``I just did my job. We have players with
clauses in their contracts (with scoring incentives). When you have
a two-man power play, it's just normal you'd go with your best
players. Who are they expecting me to go to? Ken Baumgartner? Jay
Henderson? Marquis Mathieu? If I would've called a timeout with a
5-0 lead, I'd understand why he'd be upset.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason Burns was angry was Manson's history of picking on
the more diminutive players, such as Axelsson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't give (the elbow) to Baumgartner,'' said Burns. ``But
P.J. Axelsson? Let's go.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson wasn't happy about the banishment but wasn't shocked,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised, but it's a bit of a joke,'' he said. ``I
watched tapes of the same incidents, and the players who were
suspended got two games. It looked a lot worse than it was. I
touched him with the back of my shoulder. I guess they made the
judgment because of my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Manson felt he was hurt by his reputation and his past brushes
with supplementary discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``they don't burn your records.''

ABRAHAM'S ARREST STARTS TO HIT HOME

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The impact of Cal State Northridge women's
basketball coach Michael Abraham's arrest was more devastating the
second day than the first, especially for the players.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's practice was cancelled. The team held a closed
practice on Wednesday.

   ``I think once (the players) were seeing it in the newspapers
and on television, it hit home,'' CSUN athletic director Paul Bubb
said. ``It's a totally different situation then.''
</P>
<P>
   Bubb and acting coach Judy Brame, the school's associate
athletic director, thought the day off would help the team cope
with events from Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brame is an experienced coach but hasn't been on the bench in 15
years. Her task is to get the team ready for the season, which
begins with an exhibition game Nov. 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I hope to do is be able to provide leadership as we make
the adjustments and the transition,'' Brame said. ``It's my
anticipation the assistant coaches will continue to do what they
have done, and they may have additional responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Abraham nor CSUN assistant coaches Frozena Jerro or
Karon Howell returned phone calls. Players continued their stand of
not making any comments.
</P>
<P>
   The public-relation nightmares that haunt CSUN surfaced again
when FBI officials announced Wednesday the arrest of Abraham. He
was indicted on charges of conspiracy to distribute and possession
with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Abraham faces a minimum 10-year sentence and a
maximum term of life in prison. Abraham, in the second year of a
two-year deal worth $67,000 annually, is on paid administrative
leave from the university. Abraham is free on bail, but Bubb said,
``I don't expect him to be on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   For the team, there are other issues, including the acceptance
of Brame. She inherits a team that went 14-14 last season and was
picked to finish second by the coaches and third by the media in
the Big Sky Conference. The polls were released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Brame has experience as having headed the program before,
and to me that was a logical choice,'' Bubb said. ``I don't see it
as a giant setback for the program. We have an individual who's
been alleged to be involved in an incident, or whatever, and he
needs to deal with that. We've got a total program that we're
continuing to move forward with.''
</P>
<P>
   Brame last coached in 1983, but she does have a wealth of
experience. She spent eight seasons as the Matadors head coach and
is the program's all-time wins leader with a 101-89 mark. She's one
of two women's basketball coaches with winning records at the
school and tops CSUN's list with a .532 winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the players understand what we've done and why we've
done it,'' Bubb said. ``I expect them to accept (Brame) right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Brame will periodically be pulled away from basketball
because of her other duties. Brame said at the request of Bubb,
she'll attend the Big Sky Conference meetings Sunday and Monday in
Ogden, Utah, and therefore won't be at practice.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the coaching duties, Brame plans on continuing in
her capacity as administrator of internal affairs. She deals with
financial aid, housing and academics as well as being the NCAA
liaison and doing compliance work with the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you end up finding is that you don't do as good a job in
any one area because you feel that you're stretched so thin,''
Brame said. ``The frustration of 1979-80, when I became an
assistant coach, I was always feeling that I should be at
administrative things and I was coaching. Or that I should be
coaching and I was at the adminitstrative meetings. That wore me
out.''

ONE MORE MESS TO CLEAN UP AT CSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A women's volleyball coach is accused of sleeping
with his players. A football player is shot at a party and the
athletic department covers it up. The women's basketball coach is
arrested at a gymnasium on campus and charged with trafficking
cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felicity,'' it is not.
</P>
<P>
   Lately at Cal State Northridge, the truth has been stranger than
any fictional television series. Even a 32-year-old writer passing
herself off as 19 would have better sense than to touch the slices
of college life that the Matadors' athletic department has been
gagging on the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   The arrest of basketball coach Michael Abraham on
drug-trafficking charges is the latest scourge on an athletic
program that has overseen measured athletic successes and
unmitigated moral failures.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing serial drama that is CSUN's quest to win a modicum
of respect has grown so old and tired it's a wonder anyone
continues to pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   The athletic facilities are an eyesore and the athletic
department a growing embarrassment to a student body that already
suffers from an inferiority complex. Sadly, a month that began with
the football team cracking the Division I-AA rankings for the first
time will be remembered for Abraham's arrest Tuesday on charges of
conspiring to distribute crack cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   As the news of Abraham's arrest fanned out over the campus, CSUN
president Blenda Wilson reacted as she is wont to do in a crisis.
The school's most visible representative made herself scarce. As
was the case last year when the school announced it was dropping
four men's sports programs, she wasn't available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, she issued a statement through a spokesperson when
asked what affect the incident would have on the perception of the
university: ``Most people recognize the difference between an
individual's alleged behavior and the entire work of the
university.''
</P>
<P>
   Her silence Wednesday in a situation that was crying out for
comment spoke loudly of the lip service paid to accountability in
the CSUN corridors of power.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of responsible authority figures, the buck stops
with the student athletes who are left to deal with the mess. To be
sure, the athletic department could use a few more like men's
basketball coach Bob Braswell, who wears his principles on his
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   It's unconscionable that an athletic director would hire a head
coach knowing the candidate was under investigation at the time for
NCAA violations. And yet that's exactly what CSUN's Bob Hiegert did
in 1995 when he lured Abraham away from Oregon State, where he was
serving as the women's basketball recruiting coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Hiegert's choice was a slap in the face of integrity and an
affront to every qualified _ but maybe not-so-well-connected
candidate _ scrambling for a Division I job. To be fair, it must be
reported that the NCAA never sanctioned Oregon State. Just the
same, if someone with even a hint of impropriety was the best man
Hiegert could find for the job, then perhaps he should have looked
at some women.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Paul Bubb replaced Hiegert, presumably because CSUN
wanted the athletic department steered toward financial solvency.
But in the sea of integrity, the department remains adrift.
</P>
<P>
   The year after Bubb took over, Matadors running back Shayne
Blakey was shot during an argument at a party. Bubb and then coach
Dave Baldwin lied to cover up the incident, glossing over Blakey's
gunshot injuries by saying he had undergone an appendectomy.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Bubb demonstrated that he regards the truth the
same way the medical profession does the appendix _ as superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson sanctioned Bubb, suspending him for five days without
pay. It's too bad there's no one to fine Wilson for her silence
Wednesday. The circumstances demanded that her voice rise above the
chaos, if only to comfort the shaken in the CSUN family.
</P>
<P>
   The women's basketball team has every reason right now to feel
like its insides have been ripped out. But time can heal at least
the surface wounds. For proof, the players need look only as far as
the women's volleyball team, which advanced to the NCAA Tournament
three years after being rocked by scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, two members of the previous year's team accused then
coach Walt Ker of sexual harrassment. Ker, who had led the Matadors
to three Division II national titles and eight conference
championships in 18 seasons, resigned shortly before a few players
came forward anonymously with stories of his coercing them into
having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Brame, an associate athletic director in charge of internal
affairs, will take over the basketball coaching duties on an
interim basis. Upon hearing of the latest incident to smear a good
university's reputation, Brame said she was ``disheartened,
disillusioned, disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   She left out disgusted.

DEVILS DEFEAT ISLANDERS, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The second period of Thursday night's game
between the New York Islanders and New Jersey Devils was delayed
when hundreds of fans littered the Nassau Coliseum ice with
squeezable foam ``stress pucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they were stressing over Zigmund Palffy's holdout. After
Thursday's developments, they were probably not alone.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the Islanders lost by 2-1 to the Devils on
Thursday night, Palffy rejected the Islanders' latest proposal,
which was made to him on Tuesday. Palffy's agent, Paul Kraus, said
that a counterproposal would be submitted to the team on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try and keep negotiating,'' Kraus said from his
Edmonton office on Thursday. Asked if he was optimistic, Kraus, who
declined to discuss the counterproposal, said: ``I don't know. My
vibes have been off lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Milbury, the Islanders' coach and general manager, returned
on Wednesday from Austria, where he met with Palffy, attempting to
persuade the 27-year-old star right wing to accept the team's
latest offer. The proposal, based on the contract signed by
Edmonton's Doug Weight, was for $7.8 million over two years. It was
loaded with incentives that could have increased the deal's value
to more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went there to explain to Ziggy how I view the situation,''
Milbury said. ``I wanted him to be able to make an informed
decision. Obviously I was talking from the organization's
standpoint, but I was as reasonably objective as I could be.''
</P>
<P>
   Milbury has said he does not want to trade Palffy because of
what he would most likely get in return. The Islanders' general
manager had discussions with Buffalo and Los Angeles recently, but
Milbury was probably offered draft picks, minor league prospects
and could-be stars, which is exactly what he has said he does not
want in exchange for Palffy, who is a three-time 40-goal scorer.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were without their top playmakers on Thursday night,
the Islanders' Palffy and the Devils' unsigned defenseman, Scott
Niedermayer. Still, the game was fast and featured many scoring
chances for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils (4-4), who rebounded nicely from Wednesday's 4-0 loss
to the Los Angeles Kings, got first-period goals from Bobby Holik
and Dave Andreychuk for an early 2-0 lead. And goalie Martin
Brodeur took it from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't spot the Devils two goals,'' Milbury said. ``They
play well with the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur, who has struggled some this season, was outstanding in
stopping 22 shots. Several of Brodeur's best saves were made in the
third period as the Islanders (4-5) pressed to even the score. The
Devils were out-shot by 23-20.
</P>
<P>
   Holik opened the scoring 3 minutes 59 seconds into the game,
beating a screened Tommy Salo. Andreychuk inadvertently knocked in
the Devils' second goal at 11:15. A pass from behind the net by
Holik deflected off defenseman Rich Pilon's stick and hit
Andreychuk, who was cutting to the net, in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was stopped 59 seconds before the end when
fans threw the foam pucks, given to them before the game, onto the
ice. The pucks came raining down after Jason Dawe scored at 19:00
for the Islanders, cutting the Devils' lead to 2-1. The situation
forced the referee, Dave Jackson, to send the players to the locker
room. The final minute of the second period was played before the
third period.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know they were fake at first,'' Dawe said. ``I
covered my face.'' &QL;

5 KEY NATIONS ENDORSE CASPIAN OIL PIPELINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK VIVIANO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    PARIS _ With a huge push from the United States, five nations
issued a joint declaration Thursday endorsing a controversial oil
pipeline from the Caspian Sea to the Mediterranean.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meeting in Ankara, the presidents of Turkey, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakstan and Uzbekistan signed an accord committing their
governments to the 1,080-mile conduit.
</P>
<P>
   It would link the Azeri capital and chief refining center, Baku,
to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, passing through Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson looked on as the
declaration was signed in the Turkish parliament. The agreement
follows years of intense competition and diplomatic maneuvering
over the route of the Main Export Pipeline (MEP) for Caspian oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most environmentally sound, economically rational
project for the export of Caspian oil,'' Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
   An American official in Central Asia told The Chronicle that the
United States is ``unwavering in its support'' for the Ceyhan
route.
</P>
<P>
   But construction is far from assured. The Azerbaijan
International Operating Consortium (AIOC), the 12-company energy
cartel that owns a lion's share of pumping rights in the region,
must agree to to pay most of the estimated $4 billion cost.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium _ which includes such U.S. giants as Exxon,
Amoco, Unocal and Pennzoil _ is expected to issue its own decision
on Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would also have to win the tacit cooperation of other
multinationals with significant investments in the region, among
them San Francisco-based Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, France's Total
and Elf, and firms from Japan, Italy, Great Britain, Australia and
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Caspian basin's energy reserves are believed by some experts
to rival those of Saudi Arabia, the largest source of oil on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Although current oil prices, the lowest in decades, have stifled
early production efforts, Caspian oil and natural gas are expected
to fuel a major share of industrial development in the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a dozen proposals, involving countries as far-flung as
China and Romania, have been submitted for the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   But the Baku-Ceyhan facility's primary competitors are expanded
versions of existing routes to the Georgian Black Sea port of
Supsa, and through Russia to the Black Sea port of Novorossisk.
</P>
<P>
   Both proposals have been fiercely opposed by Turkey, which
claims that increased shipments of oil from the Black Sea to the
Mediterranean _ which would have to transit the narrow and
freighter-packed Bosporus, cutting through the heart of populous
Istanbul _ pose enormous health and environmental dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has lobbied just as fiercely against the Baku-Ceyhan
route, which would deprive it of a multibillion-dollar windfall in
oil transport fees.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Iran and Turkmenistan, which has been the most loyal
of Moscow's former Soviet possessions, it is one of three nations
bordering the Caspian that were absent from the Ankara declaration
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Turkey warned that it will boycott all domestic
purchases of Caspian oil if the Ceyhan proposal is turned down, and
implied that it may take steps to prevent shipments elsewhere
through the Bosphorus.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Ankara-based Anatolian News Agency, Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem told U.S. envoy Richard Morningstar that
``Turkey will not allow the straits to be turned into an oil
pipeline.''
</P>
<P>
   Wherever the pipeline winds up, it will be vulnerable to
political risks.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials point out that the Russian pipeline crosses
the violence-torn, self-proclaimed republic of Chechnya. But
Russians note that the Ceyhan route runs directly through the area
where Turkey's Army is at war with Kurd separatists.
</P>
<P>
   On October 19, Georgia was rocked by the latest in a series of
attempted coups d'etat that have erupted since the country declared
its independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In a radio interview one week later, when the uprising had been
quashed, President Eduard Shevardnadze blamed the incident on
unnamed ``foreign secret services'' _ a code phrase for Russian
intelligence agents _ trying to block Georgia's pipeline bid.
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of many observers, the only route that offers both
security and low construction cost, with the lowest environmental
risk, passes through Iran to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   But unremitting American hostility to Tehran _ and unceasing
diplomatic pressure, exerted by a steady stream of high-level
delegations from Washington over the past 18 months _ has all but
ruled out any Iranian role in the transport of Caspian oil. &LR;

FIRST EVIDENCE OF NEW BRAIN CELLS IN HUMAN ADULTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Scientists have discovered new nerve cells sprouting deep
within the adult human brain, undercutting the ancient biological
dogma that dead brain cells can never be replaced.
</P>
<P>
   Neurons _ the precious functional cells of the central nervous
system _ have been thought to stop multiplying about the same time
children lose their baby teeth, then gradually die off throughout
adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems that certain regions of the brain may remain young
_ or at least able to carry on a process known as ``neurogenesis''
well into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   The research findings, published Friday in the journal Nature
Medicine, could lead to new ways to treat brain diseases and
strokes that destroy vast populations of brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   If even a few cells with the power to regenerate could be
harvested from such patients, doctors might be able to induce them
to grow in a laboratory dish and then graft them back into the
diseased area, in the same way that some burn victims can be
treated with grafts of freshly grown skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enormous potential,'' said Dr. Ben Barres, a
neurobiologist at Stanford Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The new study was done by researchers in Sweden and at the Salk
Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego. They took advantage
of a special dye, called BrdU, that had been injected into
late-stage cancer patients in order to label actively dividing
cells.
</P>
<P>
   When the patients eventually died, autopsies revealed clear
evidence of new neurons within the hippocampus, a region of the
cerebral cortex involved in learning and memory. The study subjects
were gravely ill and in their 50s and 60s (one was 72) when the
cellular rebirth was occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our study demonstrates that cell genesis occurs in human
brains and that the human brain retains the potential for
self-renewal throughout life,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The newborn cells could be a previously unknown mechanism in the
elaborate circuit-building system that the brain uses to lay down
memories. Thus, the research implies, learning new things might be
physically expanding brain capacity even in late adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   But study co-author Fred Gage of the Salk Institute noted that
there is still no evidence that the late-blooming neurons actually
assumed any functional role.
</P>
<P>
   Mature neurons typically form elaborate branches and connections
with other cells to transmit nerve impulses. The newborn cells
identified in the study formed in a primitive state from so-called
progenitor cells.
</P>
<P>
   That represents a cellular fresh start for an adult brain, but
no one knows whether that is merely a trivial vestige of childhood
or a dynamic element of the adult's neurobiology.
</P>
<P>
   The biochemical signals that trigger neurogenesis also remain a
mystery. Unlike other organs, the brain shows little tendency to
repair itself when damage occurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have done is show there are some new neurons here,''
Gage said. ``We don't know if those new neurons can become wired up
correctly.''

CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR'S RACE COULD DETERMINE WHO RULES CONGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARC SANDALOW  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The man whose job it is to oversee 435 Republican
House campaigns and preserve the GOP majority in Congress expressed
no doubt this week about his party's top priority in Tuesday's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important House race in America,'' said Rep. John
Linder, the Georgia Republican who heads the National Republican
Congressional Committee, ``is the governorship of California.''
</P>
<P>
   Linder's comments underscore an often overlooked political
reality: As California voters choose between Gray Davis and Dan
Lungren, they will be deciding a matter of national importance _
who will have the final say when the state's congressional
districts are redrawn after the 2000 census.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly one in eight members of Congress representing the
Golden State, it is no exaggeration to say that the difference
between a Davis or a Lungren victory Tuesday could determine who
controls Congress for the first decade of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Political experts believe that a partisan gerrymander, with
districts drawn to maximize the power of one party, could affect
the party affiliation of as many as a dozen seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a narrowly divided Congress, having complete control of
(the governor's seat and the Legislature) could have the effect of
changing control of the House,'' said Joe Shumate, a
Sacramento-based GOP consultant and veteran of California
redistricting wars.
</P>
<P>
   The high stakes in the California governor's race is not lost on
the national political leaders. It is why President Clinton tried
to persuade Sen. Dianne Feinstein to enter the race in January when
it looked like she would be the Democrats' most electable
candidate, and it explains why the national parties have spent
millions of dollars on the California election.
</P>
<P>
   California is the ``grand prize'' of the nation's 36 governors
races that will be settled Tuesday, according to the Democratic
Governors Association, which has contributed $570,000 to the Davis
campaign _ nearly twice as much as it gave to any other candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has also benefited from huge contributions from his
party's national headquarters, receiving $250,000 from the National
Republican Congressional Committee and at least another $250,000
from the Republican National Committee, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very important to have a Republican at the table,'' said
RNC spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats currently hold majorities in both the state Assembly
and Senate, although it is the 2000 election that will determine
who holds majorities for the next redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   The California Constitution lays out a clear process for
redrawing congressional districts, as well as state Assembly and
Senate districts, after each census. The Legislature is given the
responsibility to draw up the districts, which must be contiguous,
respect the natural divisions of cities and counties to the extent
possible, and be numbered consecutively from north to south. The
redistricting proposal requires the support of the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, with so much power at stake, the process has
degenerated into a bitterly partisan exercise in the past three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legislatures do many things well,'' said California Secretary
of State Bill Jones, who served in the Assembly during each of the
past two fights. ``But reapportionment is not one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   In California's rich history of nasty redistricting battles, the
fiercest came in 1980, when San Francisco Democratic Rep. Phil
Burton drew up a plan approved by the Democratic-controlled
Legislature and Gov. Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans charged that the boundaries were so misshapen for
partisan purposes that one Los Angeles district was contiguous only
when the tide was out. Those boundaries were ultimately rejected by
voters in a referendum and redrawn by the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The courts also took over the process in the 1970s, when the
Democratic Legislature could not agree on a plan with Governor
Ronald Reagan, and in the 1990s, when another Democratic majority
butted heads with Governor Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The matter could once again end up in court, regardless of who
wins Tuesday, but the political persuasion of the next governor is
certain to heavily influence the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redistricting is the purest form of political self-interest,''
said Shumate.
</P>
<P>
   California's influence in determining the shape of Congress
grows with each census.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1960 census, California had 38 seats in the House,
fewer than New York at the time. That number rose to 43 in the in
1970s, 45 in the '80s, 52 in the '90s, and is expected to grow from
one to five more seats by the 2002 election. The next largest
state, Texas, has 32 seats; New York now has 31.
</P>
<P>
   The state's 52-member congressional delegation consists of 29
Democrats and 23 Republicans, although the shift of several key
precincts could dramatically alter the political equation.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in Contra Costa County, where Democrat Ellen
Tauscher is campaigning vigorously to keep her seat in the 10th
Congressional District, a new boundary constructed by Republicans
might move predominantly Democratic neighborhoods in Walnut Creek
into George Miller's heavily Democratic Seventh Congressional
District and replace them with more conservative precincts to the
east.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats might decide to move Republican-leaning neighborhoods
in Orinda over to Barbara Lee's safely Democratic Ninth
Congressional District, and give Tauscher portions of heavily
Democratic Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the chance, Democrats could gain 10 seats, 11 seats,''
said Linder. ``And if they did it as cleverly as they did it with
Phil Burton . . . in 1981, they could gain a lot more.''

 &HT;    PRIVATE FIRMS POISED FOR FUTURE TAKEOVER IN SPACE
 &HT;    880&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Americans relive the past glories of a space
race through the return to orbit of astronaut legend John Glenn, a
different sort of race for space is quietly heating up.
</P>
<P>
   This time the competition is not between international
superpowers, but among a handful of scrappy startup U.S. companies
who are vying to build space planes and rockets that would fly so
cheaply that costly government vehicles would be left in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Even as NASA continues to rely on its huge and complex shuttle
system, costing $400 million to $600 million per flight, these lean
and mean space entrepreneurs are developing small, reusable
vehicles that could haul satellites and other cargo into orbit at
bargain-basement rates.
</P>
<P>
   Far from seeking subsidies, these pioneering companies have
openly spurned a government role. With minimal staffing and capital
scraped together from adventurous investors, they aim for
technologies that could ferry a satellite into orbit for 1,000 per
pound or less. That compares with the current world average of at
least $7,000 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for these economy-sized space vehicles range from the
conventional to the exotic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kistler Aerospace of Washington state, off to an early lead in
this private space race, is developing a two-stage rocket launcher
whose Russian-built engines would thrust into Earth orbit. Each of
the two stages would be equipped with parachutes and air bags so
they could be recovered and reused. Kistler already has a contract
with Loral Space &AMP; Communications for 10 flights beginning late
next year, for a total price of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two companies are experimenting with horizontal flyers that
would take off and land on an airfield. A space plane designed by
Kelly Space &AMP; Technology of San Bernardino, Calif., would be towed
as a glider by a larger aircraft to a high altitude, where it would
ignite its rocket engine, propelling it into space. Kelly has won
an $89 million contract from Motorola to carry 20 satellites into
space. Another company, Pioneer Rocketplane, proposes to use a
conventional-type plane that would take off from the ground
equipped with rocket engines that would be fueled aloft with liquid
oxygen from a tanker. Pioneer plans to begin flight-testing in 2000
at its headquarters at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the most daring technological venture, California-based
Rotary Rocket has a team of fewer than a dozen designers and
technicians working on a small, one-person ``space helicopter''
that would take off and land vertically and be propelled by
rocket-driven rotary blades at its base.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these concepts will survive to produce profits is
uncertain, but the demand for more launchers to send private
communications satellites into orbit has grown so large that
reliable and cheap launches would appear to have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has just cleared away some of the obstacles by passing
the Commercial Space Act, which for the first time allows private
companies to obtain federal licenses for reusable space vehicles.
The bill was introduced by Florida lawmakers, including Rep. Curt
Weldon, a Republican whose district includes Cape Canaveral; Sen.
Bob Graham, a Democrat, and Sen. Connie Mack, a Republican. It was
signed into law Wednesday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors hope that the new law will be a booster for private
U.S. space launchers, which have already lost business to low-cost
competitors in France, China, Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace has demand,'' said Frank DiBello, managing
director of SpaceVest Funds, a venture capital firm that
specializes in space industries. ``There's a whole raft of small to
mid-sized satellites that are going to need vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the private launch companies ``will not all
survive,'' but said companies that have ``a very down-to-earth set
of technologies'' for going to space, and that are able to cut
costs dramatically, could prosper as part of a general
commercialization of space.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his firm estimates that private enterprise, including
telecommunications and broadcasting satellites as well as launch
companies, is already spending more than governments worldwide. The
global space business is now estimated at $90 billion, DiBello
said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's administrator Daniel Goldin has told Congress that in the
next 10 years he expects the government to turn over low Earth
orbit operations to private businesses and focus the federal agency
on science and technology research.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear that this will lower NASA's federal
spending much below the current $13 billion per year, especially
with the construction of the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   But it would mean privatizing most of space transport, said Bob
Walker, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who was
among the earliest proponents of privatizing space operations. ``By
the end of the first decade of the next century, you could well
have more commercial flights to space than you have government,
including manned flights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Now president of the Wexler Group of lobbyists, Walker
represents Lockheed Martin, the aerospace giant that has its own
entry in the private space race, and the only one with federal
assistance. With a $1 billion award from NASA, the firm is
developing a reusable vehicle called the X-33 as a precursor to its
planned VentureStar, a single-stage commercial space vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   VentureStar would be about the size of the space shuttle, cost
as much as $6 billion, and take at least six more years to produce.
Even the smaller X-33 experiment has run into design problems that
have delayed its first test flights until late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see whether or not the VentureStar concept has legs next
year when they begin flying the X-33,'' Walker said. Lockheed
Martin is currently seeking $760 million in federal loan guarantees
for VentureStar, assistance that some of the smaller firms oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Walker argued that government support for such risky projects is
necessary, but nonetheless expressed confidence about the prospects
for private space transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe we are on the cusp of some breakthroughs
in some materials and some engine technology and several other
factors that will allow us to get a very, very viable vehicle early
in the next century, `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the latter part of that first decade, I fully intend to
be on one of those flights,'' he said.

 &HT;    INTERNET FIRMS SEE BELT-TIGHTENING AS IPO MARKET FADES
 &HT;    With TECH-AUSTERITY-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last spring, when Internet entrepreneurs Ross
Garber and Greg Peters were planning to take Vignette Corp. public,
they had visions of raising an amazing $30 million overnight. Their
Austin, Texas, company, they hoped, would join the ranks of such
Internet blockbusters as Yahoo! and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   But before the team could even plan a road show to advertise its
initial public offering (IPO) of stock, their Morgan Stanley
bankers brought sobering news: In only 45 days, comparable Internet
companies had lost as much as 50 percent of their valuations.
Institutional investors were balking at new offerings. In short,
the IPO window was slamming shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrenching,'' recounted Garber. ``We were so close. But
in the end, we couldn't taint the company by taking it public in
these disastrous market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vignette team has joined the legions of executives across
the country postponing or shelving plans to sell stock to the
public. In the third quarter of 1998, a record 71 IPO filings have
been withdrawn, according to Securities Data Co. Some prominent
Internet companies scratching or delaying IPOs include
barnesandnoble.com inc., Healtheon Corp., the globe.com inc.,
Internet America Inc. and CitySearch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO market is dead,'' says Gary Craft, an electronic
commerce analyst with BancBoston, Robertson, Stephens in San
Francisco. ``Internet companies are holding up better than most,
but executives need to adjust their strategies and valuations to
meet the current market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Internet entrepreneurs, the darlings of Wall Street since
1994, the coming months could be the testing period that will
separate solid cyber-concepts from fly-by-night Web ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a belt-tightening time,'' predicted Guy
Hoffman, chief executive officer of Deja News, an Austin Internet
company that plans to hold off on any public offering plans.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital _ pools of private funds invested in companies _
will continue to flow for the next 18 months, but investors may be
more selective about backing new ventures if market conditions
don't improve, economists predict. Some analysts even predict
investors will see consolidation within the Internet industry, with
weaker companies being snapped up by cash-flush firms at bargain
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to put up a Web site and get money
anymore,'' said Jesse Reyes, managing director of Venture
Economics, a New Jersey company that tracks venture capital trends.
``The strong companies will survive, but the competition for
venture money is going to get fiercer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, venture capitalists pumped an estimated $13.1 billion
into private companies nationwide. Of that money, 78 percent went
into information technology firms, mostly to more established
companies. Today, there's still plenty of money, about $5.5 billion
waiting to be invested. Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, about 25 percent, or nearly $1.5 billion, is slated for
early-stage startups. Nearly all early money _ called seed capital
_ has gone into the Internet sector in recent years because
investors are looking for astronomical returns.
</P>
<P>
   The online flea market, eBay, was the last Internet company out
of the blocks before the market soured. Its stock price soared 163
percent on the first day of trading. And since its September debut
at $18 per share, the company's stock price has quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   But with the IPO market drying up, executives such as Vignette's
Garber will be returning to venture capitalists for more money.
That could make investors wary of financing new projects until the
companies can get a product to market with their existing
investments, said Doug Carlisle, general partner with Menlo
Ventures of Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venture guys have been making money hand over fist on
these companies,'' says Mark Saul, chief executive officer of
Austin-based Acuity Corp., an Internet software firm. ``But the
heady days are over. So you're likely to see the losers float up on
the beach and die.''
</P>
<P>
   For Saul, brought in from Silicon Valley to run Acuity last
year, it's time to generate revenue. The company sells software
that makes it possible for clients to operate online customer
service operations or e-commerce businesses on the Web. Last week,
it signed its biggest deal yet, a $1 million contract with Ascend
Communications Inc., of Alameda, Calif. Saul expects the company to
turn a profit on a cash basis by December. ``We're in a good
position to ride it out, `` he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies without proven products or revenue may have more
difficulty, investors say. One example is Healtheon Corp. of Santa
Clara, Calif. The company, backed by James Clark, a founder of
Netscape Communications Corp., plans to raise $40 million from
existing investors after dropping IPO plans last week. But
according to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, it has lost $71.7 million since its inception in 1995
and expects continued losses through 1999 because the business
model is yet unproven.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry veterans such as Jimmy Treybig, founder of
Tandem Computers Inc., who advises a number of young startups, say
Internet entrepreneurs would be well-served to focus on the
fundamentals. That means coming up with a solid product, putting
together a top-notch management team and having a strategy to
introduce the product into the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these Web deals have gotten overheated,'' Treybig
said. ``But it doesn't really matter what's happening with the
times. ... You have to identify why you have an advantage, put
together a good management team and have a strategy to win.''

 &HT;    BUSH BROTHERS' FORMULA MAY BRING HISPANICS BACK TO THE GOP
 &HT;    650&AMP;add. With LATINO-VOTERS-DATA. For release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican strategists are watching the
gubernatorial campaigns of the Bush brothers in Texas and Florida
for clues on how to woo Hispanic voters in the next presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And some Democrats are worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen Republicans who just innately understand that
vote the way the Bush brothers do,'' said Celinda Lake, a leading
Democratic strategist.
</P>
<P>
   Lake, part of a team that conducts a series of ``Battleground''
election-year polls, said that if the GOP follows the lead of Jeb
and George W. Bush, Hispanics will be ``a real battleground vote''
in the 2000 presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Republican pollster Ed Goeas, Lake's ``Battleground'' poll
partner, is not as certain. He believes it may take his party a
decade to repair relations with Hispanics that have been damaged by
polarizing battles over immigration, welfare, welfare, affirmative
action and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is ... a majority of Hispanics have now come
to believe that Republicans would rather have an America that did
not include them,'' Goeas's Washington-based firm, the Tarrance
Group, concluded in a strategy paper distributed to GOP leaders and
congressional candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Tarrance Group has been studying Latino voting trends for 10
years, long before most political strategists in either party
recognized the demographic and political tidal wave that Hispanics
represent. But until recently, its advice that ``conservatism can
be compassionate without losing its conviction'' has largely been
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with the Bush brothers, however. Their campaigns are
expected to become models for a GOP strategy to win back a group of
voters who were solidly Republican in the glory days of Ronald
Reagan _ and thereby reclaim the White House.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush won only 28 percent of the Hispanic vote when he
was elected governor of Texas in 1994. But since then, he has
promoted issues of importance to Hispanics _ education and economic
opportunity, in particular _ and has stood up to anti-immigration
legislation in the GOP-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Today Bush _ who Spanish in campaign radio ads and regularly
appears in Hispanic media _ is overwhelmingly popular with all
Texans, including Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Jeb has had an easier time of it in Florida, where
most Hispanics are of Cuban descent, overwhelmingly Republican and
not as attuned to immigration issues as the Hispanics of Mexican
descent in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   In his unsuccessful campaign for governor in 1994, Jeb Bush got
71 percent of the Cuban-American vote. But he is not taking that
vote for granted this year. His campaign even has a
Spanish-language Web site.
</P>
<P>
   And on the issues, he sounds more like his brother in Texas than
himself in 1994. The hard-edged conservatism is mostly gone,
replaced with a unifying message of education and economic
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats question whether simply modeling a presidential
campaign on the Bush brothers can undo the hard feelings caused by
the GOP's treatment of Hispanic voters since 1992. It may take one
of the brothers themselves: George, who is quickly emerging as the
front-runner for the 2000 GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are Hispanic voters up for grabs this year? No, because the
Republicans are doing everything they can to make Hispanics mad,''
said Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman of the
Democratic National Committee. ``Republicans don't even want to
count them in the census. We couldn't have had a greater gift in
terms of getting the Hispanic vote than what the Republican Party's
record has been.''
</P>
<P>
   Goeas's strategy paper puts it in less harsh terms:
``Republicans should realize that ten years have passed and their
image among the Hispanic community has not improved. And it may
take that long to simply turn it around.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The trouble began in 1992 with the anti-immigrant tirades of Pat
Buchanan as he challenged incumbent George Bush for the Republican
presidential nomination. That same year, Bill Clinton, in defeating
Bush, became the first Democrat in four presidential elections to
win a majority of Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing has driven Hispanic voters into the Democratic Party
more than California Gov. Pete Wilson's championing of ballot
measures beginning in 1994 to cut off state benefits to illegal
immigrants, outlaw the state's affirmative action programs and
eliminate bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   As Wilson was waging his campaign, the Republican Party took
control of Congress and immediately began pushing a similar agenda,
including a proposal to cut benefits for illegal and legal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, however, the GOP national leadership has taken steps
to improve its standing with Hispanics. The Republican National
Committee now has a Hispanic ``outreach'' program, for example, and
congressional leaders, once advocates of ``English only''
legislation, routinely translate their weekly national broadcasts
into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP is currently fighting to prevent scientific sampling
of the population in the next census, a procedure designed to
prevent an undercount of minorities and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   A ``report card'' this month by the National Hispanic Leadership
Agenda gave House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia a ``zero''
rating in support of Hispanic issues. House Democratic Leader Dick
Gephardt of Missouri scored 75.
</P>
<P>
   And a generic congressional ballot test by the Tarrance Group
found Hispanics supporting Democrats over Republicans by a 20-point
margin, 52 percent to 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the number of Latinos registered to vote has risen
30 percent, to 6.6 million, and 75 percent of them have registered
as Democrats in states that have party registration. In California,
home to half of the nation's Hispanics, Latino registration has
grown 600,000 since 1994, to 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   However, a survey earlier this year by the Thomas Rivera Policy
Institute, a leading Hispanic research institution, found evidence
of hope that the Republican Party could recover lost ground. More
than two-thirds of Latino voters in California and more than half
in Texas and Florida told the institute's researchers that their
party affiliation is weak.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats ``should be asking how strong the Latino shift to
their party is,'' said Harry Pachon, the institute's president.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Goeas's associate, Geoff Becker, contends that Hispanics
are ``strong believers in family, church and hard work'' and hold
many of the ``same virtues and values'' as Republicans. Winning
them back will require a campaign emphasizing tax relief,
bolstering education and ``standing up against immorality in our
community,'' Becker said.

 &HT;    PRIVATE FIRMS POISED FOR FUTURE TAKEOVER IN SPACE
 &HT;    880&AMP;add. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories
for release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Americans relive the past glories of a space
race through the return to orbit of astronaut legend John Glenn, a
different sort of race for space is quietly heating up.
</P>
<P>
   This time the competition is not between international
superpowers, but among a handful of scrappy startup U.S. companies
who are vying to build space planes and rockets that would fly so
cheaply that costly government vehicles would be left in the dust.
</P>
<P>
   Even as NASA continues to rely on its huge and complex shuttle
system, costing $400 million to $600 million per flight, these lean
and mean space entrepreneurs are developing small, reusable
vehicles that could haul satellites and other cargo into orbit at
bargain-basement rates.
</P>
<P>
   Far from seeking subsidies, these pioneering companies have
openly spurned a government role. With minimal staffing and capital
scraped together from adventurous investors, they aim for
technologies that could ferry a satellite into orbit for 1,000 per
pound or less. That compares with the current world average of at
least $7,000 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for these economy-sized space vehicles range from the
conventional to the exotic.
</P>
<P>
   _ Kistler Aerospace of Washington state, off to an early lead in
this private space race, is developing a two-stage rocket launcher
whose Russian-built engines would thrust into Earth orbit. Each of
the two stages would be equipped with parachutes and air bags so
they could be recovered and reused. Kistler already has a contract
with Loral Space &AMP; Communications for 10 flights beginning late
next year, for a total price of $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two companies are experimenting with horizontal flyers that
would take off and land on an airfield. A space plane designed by
Kelly Space &AMP; Technology of San Bernardino, Calif., would be towed
as a glider by a larger aircraft to a high altitude, where it would
ignite its rocket engine, propelling it into space. Kelly has won
an $89 million contract from Motorola to carry 20 satellites into
space. Another company, Pioneer Rocketplane, proposes to use a
conventional-type plane that would take off from the ground
equipped with rocket engines that would be fueled aloft with liquid
oxygen from a tanker. Pioneer plans to begin flight-testing in 2000
at its headquarters at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the most daring technological venture, California-based
Rotary Rocket has a team of fewer than a dozen designers and
technicians working on a small, one-person ``space helicopter''
that would take off and land vertically and be propelled by
rocket-driven rotary blades at its base.
</P>
<P>
   Which of these concepts will survive to produce profits is
uncertain, but the demand for more launchers to send private
communications satellites into orbit has grown so large that
reliable and cheap launches would appear to have a bright future.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has just cleared away some of the obstacles by passing
the Commercial Space Act, which for the first time allows private
companies to obtain federal licenses for reusable space vehicles.
The bill was introduced by Florida lawmakers, including Rep. Curt
Weldon, a Republican whose district includes Cape Canaveral; Sen.
Bob Graham, a Democrat, and Sen. Connie Mack, a Republican. It was
signed into law Wednesday by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The sponsors hope that the new law will be a booster for private
U.S. space launchers, which have already lost business to low-cost
competitors in France, China, Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace has demand,'' said Frank DiBello, managing
director of SpaceVest Funds, a venture capital firm that
specializes in space industries. ``There's a whole raft of small to
mid-sized satellites that are going to need vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the private launch companies ``will not all
survive,'' but said companies that have ``a very down-to-earth set
of technologies'' for going to space, and that are able to cut
costs dramatically, could prosper as part of a general
commercialization of space.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, his firm estimates that private enterprise, including
telecommunications and broadcasting satellites as well as launch
companies, is already spending more than governments worldwide. The
global space business is now estimated at $90 billion, DiBello
said.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's administrator Daniel Goldin has told Congress that in the
next 10 years he expects the government to turn over low Earth
orbit operations to private businesses and focus the federal agency
on science and technology research.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from clear that this will lower NASA's federal
spending much below the current $13 billion per year, especially
with the construction of the international space station.
</P>
<P>
   But it would mean privatizing most of space transport, said Bob
Walker, a former Republican congressman from Pennsylvania who was
among the earliest proponents of privatizing space operations. ``By
the end of the first decade of the next century, you could well
have more commercial flights to space than you have government,
including manned flights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Now president of the Wexler Group of lobbyists, Walker
represents Lockheed Martin, the aerospace giant that has its own
entry in the private space race, and the only one with federal
assistance. With a $1 billion award from NASA, the firm is
developing a reusable vehicle called the X-33 as a precursor to its
planned VentureStar, a single-stage commercial space vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   VentureStar would be about the size of the space shuttle, cost
as much as $6 billion, and take at least six more years to produce.
Even the smaller X-33 experiment has run into design problems that
have delayed its first test flights until late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see whether or not the VentureStar concept has legs next
year when they begin flying the X-33,'' Walker said. Lockheed
Martin is currently seeking $760 million in federal loan guarantees
for VentureStar, assistance that some of the smaller firms oppose.
</P>
<P>
   Walker argued that government support for such risky projects is
necessary, but nonetheless expressed confidence about the prospects
for private space transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe we are on the cusp of some breakthroughs
in some materials and some engine technology and several other
factors that will allow us to get a very, very viable vehicle early
in the next century, `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And by the latter part of that first decade, I fully intend to
be on one of those flights,'' he said.

 &HT;    INTERNET FIRMS SEE BELT-TIGHTENING AS IPO MARKET FADES
 &HT;    With TECH-AUSTERITY-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories for release Saturday, Oct. 31.
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last spring, when Internet entrepreneurs Ross
Garber and Greg Peters were planning to take Vignette Corp. public,
they had visions of raising an amazing $30 million overnight. Their
Austin, Texas, company, they hoped, would join the ranks of such
Internet blockbusters as Yahoo! and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   But before the team could even plan a road show to advertise its
initial public offering (IPO) of stock, their Morgan Stanley
bankers brought sobering news: In only 45 days, comparable Internet
companies had lost as much as 50 percent of their valuations.
Institutional investors were balking at new offerings. In short,
the IPO window was slamming shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wrenching,'' recounted Garber. ``We were so close. But
in the end, we couldn't taint the company by taking it public in
these disastrous market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vignette team has joined the legions of executives across
the country postponing or shelving plans to sell stock to the
public. In the third quarter of 1998, a record 71 IPO filings have
been withdrawn, according to Securities Data Co. Some prominent
Internet companies scratching or delaying IPOs include
barnesandnoble.com inc., Healtheon Corp., the globe.com inc.,
Internet America Inc. and CitySearch Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IPO market is dead,'' says Gary Craft, an electronic
commerce analyst with BancBoston, Robertson, Stephens in San
Francisco. ``Internet companies are holding up better than most,
but executives need to adjust their strategies and valuations to
meet the current market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   For Internet entrepreneurs, the darlings of Wall Street since
1994, the coming months could be the testing period that will
separate solid cyber-concepts from fly-by-night Web ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a belt-tightening time,'' predicted Guy
Hoffman, chief executive officer of Deja News, an Austin Internet
company that plans to hold off on any public offering plans.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capital _ pools of private funds invested in companies _
will continue to flow for the next 18 months, but investors may be
more selective about backing new ventures if market conditions
don't improve, economists predict. Some analysts even predict
investors will see consolidation within the Internet industry, with
weaker companies being snapped up by cash-flush firms at bargain
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be able to put up a Web site and get money
anymore,'' said Jesse Reyes, managing director of Venture
Economics, a New Jersey company that tracks venture capital trends.
``The strong companies will survive, but the competition for
venture money is going to get fiercer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, venture capitalists pumped an estimated $13.1 billion
into private companies nationwide. Of that money, 78 percent went
into information technology firms, mostly to more established
companies. Today, there's still plenty of money, about $5.5 billion
waiting to be invested. Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Of that, about 25 percent, or nearly $1.5 billion, is slated for
early-stage startups. Nearly all early money _ called seed capital
_ has gone into the Internet sector in recent years because
investors are looking for astronomical returns.
</P>
<P>
   The online flea market, eBay, was the last Internet company out
of the blocks before the market soured. Its stock price soared 163
percent on the first day of trading. And since its September debut
at $18 per share, the company's stock price has quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   But with the IPO market drying up, executives such as Vignette's
Garber will be returning to venture capitalists for more money.
That could make investors wary of financing new projects until the
companies can get a product to market with their existing
investments, said Doug Carlisle, general partner with Menlo
Ventures of Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``The venture guys have been making money hand over fist on
these companies,'' says Mark Saul, chief executive officer of
Austin-based Acuity Corp., an Internet software firm. ``But the
heady days are over. So you're likely to see the losers float up on
the beach and die.''
</P>
<P>
   For Saul, brought in from Silicon Valley to run Acuity last
year, it's time to generate revenue. The company sells software
that makes it possible for clients to operate online customer
service operations or e-commerce businesses on the Web. Last week,
it signed its biggest deal yet, a $1 million contract with Ascend
Communications Inc., of Alameda, Calif. Saul expects the company to
turn a profit on a cash basis by December. ``We're in a good
position to ride it out, `` he says.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies without proven products or revenue may have more
difficulty, investors say. One example is Healtheon Corp. of Santa
Clara, Calif. The company, backed by James Clark, a founder of
Netscape Communications Corp., plans to raise $40 million from
existing investors after dropping IPO plans last week. But
according to the company's filings with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, it has lost $71.7 million since its inception in 1995
and expects continued losses through 1999 because the business
model is yet unproven.
</P>
<P>
   Computer industry veterans such as Jimmy Treybig, founder of
Tandem Computers Inc., who advises a number of young startups, say
Internet entrepreneurs would be well-served to focus on the
fundamentals. That means coming up with a solid product, putting
together a top-notch management team and having a strategy to
introduce the product into the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these Web deals have gotten overheated,'' Treybig
said. ``But it doesn't really matter what's happening with the
times. ... You have to identify why you have an advantage, put
together a good management team and have a strategy to win.''

TODAY'S PAPERS: PAGE 1 DIGEST FOR OCT. 30. 
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHUGER 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's almost a clean sweep of the papers for John Glenn _ his
last Tang go leads at USA Today, the New York Times, and the
Washington Post. USAT's front page is All Glenn All the Time and
includes a huge spectacular blastoff photo.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times gives almost half of its front page to
Glenn, but leads with the death of L.A. County Sheriff Sherman
Block (the nation's highest paid elected official) from a brain
hemorrhage in the midst of a re-election campaign where the main
issue was whether he was in good health. Only time will tell if the
LAT's reporting was insufficiently aggressive when, earlier in the
week after Block underwent emergency brain surgery, it ran a
headline saying that Block's ``survival is expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The papers see the Glenn launch, viewed by hundreds of thousands
of spectators and carried live on just about every television
station, as a magic unifying moment for the whole country.
``Captivated Nation Cheers'' is how a USAT headline puts it. The
Wall Street Journal reports that 71 percent of voters hold a
favorable view of Glenn. And both the WP and the NYT note that the
euphoria all but smothered criticisms that Glenn's presence was
merely a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   True, in a separate story, the Post does note that the mission
has marketing tie-ins (for which Glenn refused compensation) with
Kodak and with Mattel's ``John Glenn Action Pack'' _ toy figures of
the astronaut cum senator cum astronaut. And the NYT follows up
Thursday's curmudgeonly editorial describing the mission as ``a
testament more to past eminence than present value'' with today's
``Editorial Observer'' saying that even Glenn's original blastoff
wasn't that important. But otherwise, the NYT is pretty much in
step, running no fewer than six Glenn stories inside.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, even when discussing the potentially dangerous loss
during the launch of a protective metal panel, there is no mention
in any of the Glenn leads of the space program's last ``special''
astronaut, Christa McAuliffe.
</P>
<P>
   The NYT off-lead reveals that as part of the case federal
prosecutors are building against terrorists associated with Osama
bin Laden, they have filed still-secret charges against an
Egyptian-born former U.S. Army Green Beret. The ex-soldier is
alleged to have switched from being a U.S. anti-terrorist
specialist to being an anti-U.S. terrorist. The article all but
comes out and says the man was a CIA asset, in that it cites his
odd military record _ he apparently joined the U.S. Army as a
non-citizen while in his mid-30s _ and puts him in Afghanistan
during the CIA-managed anti-Soviet insurgency there.

   The LAT and NYT fronts report that Thursday, an Israeli soldier
died using his jeep to take an explosion a Palestinian suicide
bomber intended for a bus full of Israeli school children. (The
story is carried inside at the WP and USAT.) The papers say that
the event is the first real test of Yasser Arafat's determination
to honor his recent commitment to increased West Bank security. He
seems to have passed, by immediately condemning the bombing and
placing the spiritual head of Hamas, the terrorist group implicated
in the attack, under house arrest. He has also rounded up other
Hamas members.
</P>
<P>
   The political story of the week _ those Republican
Lewinsky-driven anti-Clinton ads _ continues to develop on the
front pages. The WP elaborates on a point first made by Thursday's
NYT _ that Newt Gingrich had a hands-on role in the ad campaign.
But leave it to the WSJ to observe that for all the press hoopla,
very few voters have actually seen the ads, because so far, they
have only aired in 10 states.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Shales, in his WP review of the Glenn launch television
coverage, probably speaks for many when he sees the event as a
magic opportunity to escape a relentless political scandal. Perhaps
the LAT is wryly doing the same when it quotes an Angeleno's
description of Glenn as a hero who has managed to be in the
American imagination for almost 40 years ``without a stain.''

ARTS(AT)LARGE 
 SITE FOR CELEBRATING GAY ART 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The Queer Arts Resource site and the Net Selections '98
exhibit contain strong sexual language and graphic homoerotic
imagery.) 
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Things Are Queer'' is a sequence of nine photographs by Duane
Michals in which the first and final frames are one and the same.
In this Moebius strip of images, every shift in the camera's
perspective alters the way the viewer perceives the artist's
universe.
</P>
<P>
   A visit to the Queer Arts Resource (QAR) can have a similar
effect. The two-year-old site, which on Thursday is launching its
first exhibition of Web-based art, is devoted to the works of
non-heterosexual artists. Seen in this focused context, their
pieces often gain additional meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roundabout,'' for example, is one of six Web-art projects in
the new Net Selections '98 exhibit. If this multimedia journey
through a maze of barren public spaces was viewed on its own, it
would seem to be merely a well-crafted exploration of urban
alienation.
</P>
<P>
   Because the project is included in the exhibit, though, viewers
may also wonder whether the work depicts a popular pick-up spot or
is commenting upon some aspect of an alternative lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get any overt queer content from this piece,'' said
Barry Harrison, director of QAR. ``But then queer content has
historically been coded or intended for those 'in the know.' I
think it is more suggestive than anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girlie Movies,'' part of the multiple-artist showcase
Fantasmagoria, is similarly open to divergent interpretations. The
lightly animated work could be construed as a repressed male's
monologue, but when viewed through a lesbian prism, it is reborn as
a coming-out-to-oneself saga.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the works in the Net Selections show are quite so
ambiguous. ``Positive,'' which uses a tray of brightly colored
pills as a navigation device, is a meditation on AIDS. ``In My
Fantasy,'' another Fantasmagoria entry, is an overt lesbian reverie
-- albeit one set subversively in a traditionally male environment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the featured works contain strong sexual language and
graphic homoerotic imagery (although ``Women with Beards'' is
clearly intended to be a parody of X-rated Internet sites).
</P>
<P>
   But these elements are employed for serious artistic effect, as
is made clear in the almost-scholarly remarks posted online by the
exhibit's all-star panel of jurors, including Aaron Betsky, curator
of architecture and design for the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art, and the multimedia artist Shu Lea Chang.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Harrison founded the not-for-profit site as ``an
alternative to all the sex-oriented sites and chat rooms that often
pretend to be about gay art or queer art, and are not.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I remember the first time I went surfing, a friend
and I did a search for gay art and the first thing we found was a
site called 'Men in Spandex.' I thought, what about Michelangelo,
what about da Vinci, what about Warhol?''
</P>
<P>
   Since its launch in October 1996, the site has presented nearly
two dozen shows, ranging from a collection of George Platt Lyne's
sensuous photographs of male nudes to a reexamination through gay
eyes of Gustave Caillebotte's Impressionist paintings.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibits, which are assembled by free-lance curators and
usually accompanied by brief but well-written essays, are
commissioned by a committee, a subset of QAR's 10-member board. ``I
didn't want this to be Barry's art site, and the only way to avoid
that was to give up a certain amount of control and allow other
people to make decisions,'' Harrison said.
</P>
<P>
   A former architect who has lived in New York and Chicago,
Harrison decided to launch the site after moving to San Francisco
and taking a career-planning course for creative people. But he is
driven by a political agenda, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long, long, long time, artists have been making work
that has queer content,'' he said. ``In other words, it speaks in
some way either of same-sex desire or same-sex experience. Up until
very recently, it has been routinely suppressed, ignored and
censored, either by critics and historians or by the artists
themselves. We need to let the world know what we contribute, and
this is my little corner of that very big mission.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harrison asserted that the Net Selections exhibit, which is
intended to become an annual event, signals QAR's new emphasis on
digital work from the Queer Arts Resource site -- even though the
call for submissions only resulted in a handful of entries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that queer artists have been at the forefront of all the
other arts,'' he said, ``it's reasonable to believe that they will
carry on in that tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Harrison concerned that, by concentrating on
non-heterosexual artists, their work will be relegated to a
sexual-orientation ghetto.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about the biggest, most diverse, most wonderful ghetto
in the universe,'' he said. ``Even if you just look at the QAR
site, what you get is this diverse spectrum of artistic
expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrison added: ``It doesn't show you that gay artists work like
this (in a particular style). It shows just the opposite.''

A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  By CARL S. KAPLAN 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first blush, the new nonprofit organization selected by the
Clinton administration earlier this week to take over the important
job of administering Internet domain names appears to be just
another geeky technical standards group.
</P>
<P>
   But look closer, say some legal observers, and you will see that
the newborn baby, called the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN), is actually the beginning of something
big -- a unique form of government for the global Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few weeks, these observers say, a constitutional
moment in the life of the Internet will occur as representatives of
the government and various interest groups seek to hash out the
corporation's structure and rules in an effort to give it final
shape and check its power.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the gathering in Philadelphia where the United States
Constitution was created, this process is much more informal and
decentralized.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a constitutional convention in a sense,'' said
Jonathan Zittrain, a law professor at Harvard University and
executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society,
the school's cyberspace research center. ``That's why there's such
great interest'' in ICANN and its birth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Post, a law professor at Temple University who specializes
in the legal issues of cyberspace, added: ``If there is going to be
this one entity that has a great deal of power, you'd have to say
that the process of deciding how that power will be exercised is
constitution-making. This absolutely is a critical moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Post, who wrote an article about ICANN in the November issue of
The American Lawyer, said in an interview that any organization
that controls the Internet's addressing system -- including the
assignment of domain names, like ``nytimes.com,'' and corresponding
numerical addresses -- has a potential ``choke hold'' on
cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all the talk about how difficult it is for any country to
govern the Internet because the Internet is global and
decentralized, well, this is the only place in the system that is
in some sense centrally managed and centrally controlled,'' Post
said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that ICANN could theoretically govern the Internet by
imposing certain conditions on people who wish to participate in
cyberspace. For example, he said, if it wanted to outlaw anonymity
on the Internet, ICANN could tell Internet service providers that
they could not get a domain name address unless they took steps to
make their subscribers fully identifiable. The organization could
do the same to enforce a privacy policy or other rules, Post said.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, the domain name system was supervised by the United
States government through contractual arrangements with the
Internet Assigned Numbers Authority(IANA) and Network Solutions
Inc. Over the past year or so, the government encouraged companies
and groups with an interest in the Internet's future to submit
proposals for a not-for-profit corporation that would take over
control of the Internet address system.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, Dr. Jon Postel, an Internet pioneer who ran IANA,
submitted a plan to the Secretary of Commerce for the establishment
of ICANN, based on extensive discussions with a wide range of
people and organizations. Postel died last Friday of complications
after undergoing heart surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The ICANN plan vested power over global domain name policy in a
geographically diverse board of 19 directors, to be selected by an
interim board and three technical subgroups. Critics complained
that the plan was undemocratic and dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem that we found was accountability,'' said
Diane Cabell, a Boston lawyer and member of the Boston Working
Group, a loose collection of Internet users that submitted
criticisms of the ICANN plan to the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board was not accountable to anyone because there were no
members or shareholders,'' she said. In addition, the plan does not
call for a competing organization to check the board's power, nor
is there any regulatory oversight of its activities, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Auerbach, a member of the Boston Working Group who has been
involved with the development of the Internet since 1973, said in
an interview that the ICANN proposals gave the impression of
openness and responsiveness. ``But really the power was in the
hands of a few -- half a dozen people running this thing for the
whole world,'' he said. ``That terrified me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Group and some other critics want to check ICANN's
power by requiring the organization to have members who will elect
the board and participate in annual meetings. They also want to
lessen the role of the three technical subgroups.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the government seems to be nudging but not
requiring ICANN to adopt a membership structure. In a letter sent
last week to ICANN representatives, the Commerce Department said
that although it regarded the ICANN proposal as ``a significant
step'' in the privatization of the domain name system, it also
expressed the hope that the organization would ``review and
consider the many thoughtful and constructive comments'' from
critics, including the Boston Working Group and the Open Root
Server Confederation.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the letter noted that the ICANN board, under its
proposed bylaws, is encouraged but not required to establish a
membership structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe ICANN should resolve this issue in a way that
ensures greater accountability of the board of directors to the
Internet community,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Ira C. Magaziner, the White House's Internet guru, said in an
interview that over the next few weeks the ICANN group ``is going
to work on amending their proposal'' to respond to the government's
concerns about accountability, among other things. ``If they fail
to do that, we will have to consider other alternatives,'' he said.
``But my guess is they will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been suggested that some type of membership organization
may be necessary to achieve the type of accountability everybody
wants. We don't want to dictate how this should be done, however.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Sims, a Washington-based lawyer who represents ICANN, said
his group will give ``serious consideration'' to criticisms of the
plan, but he declined to comment specifically on how the ICANN
proposal might be modified. He added that he didn't think there was
``a significant gap'' between ICANN and some critics on the
membership issue.
</P>
<P>
   Sims also said he thinks the importance of the negotiations over
ICANN's structure has been overblown. ``This is at heart an
administrative body,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Post said he thinks that some sort of membership structure for
ICANN would be better than nothing. But he fears that even this may
not be a sufficient check on the board's concentrated power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing would be to split up ICANN's power into
competing centers of power -- break it up into pieces and give it
to different institutions,'' he said. Otherwise, he said, it would
be too easy for private interests to ``capture'' the board.
</P>
<P>
   Zittrain of Harvard said that he believes fragmenting power too
much can be inefficient. ``You've got to trust somebody,'' he said.
``I think a high-profile board from a broad electoral base'' would
give those involved with the Internet good protection from possible
abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Zittrain added, however, that although he had high hopes for a
modified ICANN, he found something ironic in the birth process. The
government, he explained, believes that the task of running the
domain name system can better be handled by the private sector. At
the same time, it is helping to create an entity that resembles a
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sooner or later this thing [ICANN] will start looking and
talking like a duck, so what makes it not a government?'' he asked.

AN ADAPTER TO FILL IN THE GAPS 
</HEADLINE>
  By STEPHEN C. MILLER 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was trying to be helpful. A colleague at one of the other
newspapers owned by The New York Times Company was in town covering
the baseball playoffs. He had accidentally left the power cord for
his laptop at home. His battery was drained and he was in a panic.
Fortunately, I had a power cord that would work with his computer.
Unfortunately, it was the one to my personal laptop and it was the
only one available. Not a problem, the battery on my laptop is
fully charged and I can use it for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for him to use the cord during the game and drop it
off after the game was over. It would be easy; his hotel was just a
few blocks away. Of course, he forgot and took off for Cleveland
with my cord. His office had sent overnight a replacement cord to
his Cleveland hotel and it was waiting for him when he arrived. He
now has two cords and I had none.
</P>
<P>
   It was my turn to panic. I now have a drained battery and no A/C
cord. Actually, I have a cord; it's just that it's in Cleveland. To
compound the problem, I was leaving that day for Los Angeles. I had
planned to use the time on the plane to finish my column. The
timing was a little tricky, but if the plane wasn't late and there
was no great tie-up on the 405, I could get to my hotel and still
file my column just in time to meet deadline.
</P>
<P>
   As I was making frantic phone calls trying to find a replacement
cord, a package arrived from Port Inc. Inside was the new Universal
AC Adapter. The adapter is intended to act as a backup for the AC
adapter for a range of electronic devices, including laptops, cell
phones and battery chargers. If your power cord is lost, stolen or
in my case, loaned, the Universal AC adapter is designed to fill
the void.
</P>
<P>
   It did.
</P>
<P>
   While I might quibble over calling the product ``Universal,''
since it does not support all laptops, cell phones and battery
chargers, it does work with enough of the major brands (IBM, Compaq
and Toshiba) to make it worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a slim power adapter, it comes with a number of
adapters called Power Tips that match the connector on your
particular laptop. It also comes with a US/Canadian/Japanese outlet
plug; you can order optional plugs for other countries.
</P>
<P>
   I like the slimness of the adapter. It take up little room in
the carrying case. However, the plug fits directly into the brick,
and that means the brick will be flush with the wall. I had trouble
plugging it in one of the hotels because the outlet was close to
the floor and there was not enough room. The base of the desk came
down so far that there wasn't enough room at the top either. I had
to drag the desk from the wall. This was one of those hotels with
heavy antique furniture. I hope housekeeping has forgiven me
because I didn't move the desk back when I hurriedly packed to
catch my flight home.
</P>
<P>
   The adapter is suppose to adjust the voltage depending on the
kind of Power Tip used. I found that the unit got quite warm. It
didn't get hot enough to cause real concern, but it did move the
temperature up a notch or two.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is to use it only long enough to charge the
battery and then run the computer off the battery until it drains
completely. The adapter can spur you into conditioning the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks ago, I mentioned adapters from Global Webmasters
(now on the Web as Traveladapters.com) that managed to handle any
outlet and phone plug in the world. I had just discovered it and
had not had a chance to test it. Since I have not left the confines
of the U.S. of A. and with nothing on the horizon until next year,
I sent the adapters to a friend who was heading for Cairo, London,
Rio and Johannesburg. Being the taciturn type, his report consisted
of ``worked without any problems.'' From him this is a ringing
endorsement.

DISTANCE LEARNING TO RECEIVE SOME FEDERAL AID 
</HEADLINE>
  By PAMELA MENDELS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Students enrolled in conventional colleges and universities have
long turned to Uncle Sam to help them pay for education. Their
counterparts in many newly created virtual classrooms, however,
have not been so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Now, that is about to change, at least for some distance
learners. The catalyst is new federal legislation that establishes
a five-year program to allow selected distance learning ventures _
eventually up to 50 of them _ to participate in major federal
student aid programs.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of distance education are hoping the new program can
help boost the popularity of what they believe is a promising new
educational enterprise made possible by the Internet and other new
communications technologies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simply helps level the playing field, so just as full-time
residential students have access to that aid, the part-time
distance learner does, too,'' said Robert C. Albrecht, chief
academic officer of Western Governors University, a new distance
education venture and the only one specifically named in the law as
eligible to become one of the program participants.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who question whether virtual education can ever be
more than a pale substitute for the real thing, the project is a
worrisome development. ``It legitimizes and sanctions what I'm
calling 'digital diploma mills,''' said David F. Noble, a history
professor at York University in Toronto and a critic of many
distance learning efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The new project was one small part of a 268-page piece of
legislation known as the Higher Education Amendments of 1998, which
was signed into law by President Clinton Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, certain distance learning ventures, including
those set up by universities, will be freed from various
requirements that have prevented their students from taking part in
important federal student grant and loan programs. Among other
things, program participants may waive the ``50 percent rule,''
which excludes from financial aid eligibility both students who
take more than half their courses remotely and those enrolled in
institutions where more than half of the courses are taught by
distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year, the project is authorized to accept 15
institutions, and the legislation singles out Western Governors _ a
venture financed by public and private funds that was launched by a
group of governors from 10 Western states _ as automatically
eligible. Another 35 institutions can be selected in the third year
of the five-year program.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration, which has emerged as a strong
advocate of technology in education, considers the distance
learning program one of the centerpieces of the higher education
bill, said Maureen A. McLaughlin, a deputy assistant secretary in
the Department of Education. She said the Administration is pushing
for distance education because it believes these programs could be
a boon to those who cannot easily travel to classes. ``This is a
way to broaden and offer additional opportunities to people,''
McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Bernard Machen, the new president of the University of Utah,
who has urged greater caution about distance education, said he
nevertheless welcomed the financial aid program as an opportunity
for educators to find out more about distance learning. ``This
removes another potential barrier, so we can get these projects up
and running and see what we can develop with them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But other critics are less than happy with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   One concern stems from the origin of the 50 percent rule. It was
put into place by Congress in 1992 to prevent abuse that occurred
at certain correspondence and other for-profit schools that offered
education of questionable quality to students who later had high
default rates on their federally backed loans. Given the history,
the rule should be lifted only with caution, critics say.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin called the worries about past federal financial aid
loan abuse and fraud ``a legitimate concern,'' but said the rules
had been relaxed ``in a careful and considered way.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Terry W. Hartle, senior vice president of the
American Council on Education, an association of 1,800 two- and
four-year colleges and a supporter of the new federal project, the
limit on the number of project participants could help minimize the
possibility of abuse. ``This will give people a controlled way to
see if it can be done in a way the protects both students and
taxpayers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important, critics say they are concerned about the
quality of distance education programs, and question whether they
merit support. Mark F. Smith, associate director of government
relations for the American Association of University Professors,
which represents about 45,000 faculty members, said ways to measure
the programs' quality should have been built into the federal
project. ``Distance learning is moving so quickly that we are not
convinced there are adequate quality standards in place,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Noble is disturbed that the program lends the
imprimatur of the federal government to a form of education that he
believes is suspect. ``Essentially, it is extending the range of
government support, through student aid, to distance learning and
establishing its bona fides as higher education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin asserts, however, that part of the reason for the
project is to ensure that there are strong ``mechanisms set up to
deal with quality.'' She said distance education is important for
those who simply cannot, for whatever reason, attend a conventional
classroom. ``This is a way to encourage and offer additional
opportunities to people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Noble criticizes the program as an effort to boost
enrollment at electronic universities that have yet to gain
popularity on their own. ``What these folks are trying to do,'' he
said, ``is get the federal government to help them create a
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble added that according to one press account, Western
Governors had enrolled only 10 people in the first two weeks after
it opened for admission last month. Albrecht declined to discuss
the university's current enrollment. He said the number was small,
but also said this was intentional as the university got under way.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, any suggestion that university officials were
looking to federal financial aid to help them attract students was
wrong. The real issue, he said, was fairness, that adult learners
and others who cannot go to conventional classes should have the
same access to financial aid as residential students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The marketplace is demanding distance education for any number
of reasons now,'' Albrecht said. ``...And I think saying distance
education is somehow bad or low quality is naive.''

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especially when an important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

<P>
   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models
are the Plantronics CT-901-HS Hands-Free Cordless Telephone and
Uniden's E-Mail Phone. The CT-901-HS features a convertible headset
(headband or over-the-ear) and allows you to roam up to l00 feet
without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,
800-297-1023, $350, corded model; $450, cordless.
</P>
<P>
   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley
Systems, Inc., 888-333-0300, $15 per month plus 14.9 cents per
minute for 800/888 calls to or from anywhere in the country.
 &UR; SOFTWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether your business is fledgling or established, quality
software can streamline your day-to-day operations. ClarisWorks
Office 5.0 is an easy-to-use and remarkably affordable product
offering database, spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities,
plus a home page authoring tool and Internet connection software.
The 175 ready-made customizable documents _ newsletter layouts,
invoices, contracts _ are especially nice for small- or home-office
users. Claris/Filemaker, 800-544-8554, $79 for Windows, $99 for
Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive, and expensive, productivity suite is
Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition Version 2.0, which
includes Word 97, Excel 97 (spreadsheet), Publisher 98 (desktop
publishing), Outlook 98 (integrated E-mail) and Small Business
Financial Manager 98 (financial analysis and reporting tools).
</P>
<P>
   Two extras you'll find handy are the Direct Mail Manager, a
program for developing and managing direct mail lists, and Expedia
Streets 98, an easy way to locate key customers and integrate maps
into your marketing materials. Microsoft, 800-426-9400, $500.
</P>
<P>
   Jian Software offers a terrific set of nuts-and-bolts programs
designed to help you plan and organize your entire operation, from
working up your initial business plan to marketing and employee
management. Titles in the series include BizPlan Builder,
PublicityBuilder and BusinessBasics. This helpful software walks
you through the planning step by step and provides hundreds of
customizable templates for documents of all types. Jian Software,
800-346-5426, $50-$150.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining an upscale image on a barebones budget is easier
with Business Card, Ink &AMP; More, a program that lets you design and
print out professional-looking stationery and business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you incorporate an existing logo or dream up a new de-
sign, you'll have ample guidance and materials. DogByte
Development, 800-936-4298, $35.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.
</P>
<P>
   The program's standout features include instant access to
electronic banking and payment, custom invoices and inventory
management. Intuit, 800-4-INTUIT, $100.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Dahl's favorite timesaving tools: the Pitney Bowes
Personal Post Office Miter. This nifty device lets her download
postage by phone with a 30-second tollfree call. The meter prints
l0 envelopes per minute and holds up to $1,000 in postage _ making
trips to the post office a chore of the past. Pitney Bowes,
800-672-6937, $20 per month plus postage.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.
</P>

 By EVE GLICKSMAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Ogden Nash was on to something when he observed that progress
might have been all right once, but it has gone on for far too
long.
 &HT;    In principle, I'm all for the wonders of modern science. Where
would we be without steam engines, measles vaccines and automatic
focus?
 &HT;    But my likeness to Thoroughly Modern Millie came to a halt 10
years ago, when a computer entered my life. Since then, I've been
caught between a disk and a hard drive _ a flunky in Gary Larson's
``School for the Mechanically Declined.''
 &HT;    According to my Random House Dictionary, technophobes were
classified as a species between 1960 and 1965, a period Wonder
Bread presciently dubbed my formative years. Growing up with
pre-mainframe sensibilities, I was influenced by a generation that
reveled in self-reliance, simplicity and doing one's own thing.
 &HT;    Today marching to the sound of a different low-tech drummer is
professional blasphemy. It is no mere coincidence that ``PC'' is
the term for both personal computer and politically correct. Better
to say your laser printer is broken than to admit you don't have
one.
 &HT;    In a rare moment of Republican sympathy, I felt for George Bush
when Clintonites criticized him for promoting a technological
backwater in the White House. It's as if using electronic mail is
now a moral imperative. George Bush was that rare leader not
ashamed to admit he couldn't program his videocassette recorder.
Don't ask him to do Windows.
 &HT;    MS-DOS was not my first language, either. If the truth be told,
I would have been perfectly content to live out my days thinking a
laptop was where you sit a child and that a compatible interface
was what you hoped for on blind dates.
 &HT;    Moreover, there's something humiliating about spending thousands
of dollars on an otherworldly contraption that rejects your
commands. As Calvin Trillin once noted, what good is a
spell-checker if it can't get past words like ``wacko''?
 &HT;    Don't tell me there isn't premeditated malice in the minds of
the makers. Nothing is good to the last byte in this business. By
the time you master your hardware, count on the company coming out
with a faster, cheaper, better-than-ever model.
 &HT;    Whoever invented the term ``user friendly'' should be downloaded
and purged. These days, keeping up with the Joneses requires a
computer consultant.
 &HT;    Which raises the question: If they can make computers that can
store ``War and Peace'' in the space of a fingernail, why can't
they write a decent manual, given the thickness of a Russian novel?
 &HT;    Still, in a have and have-not society, it's better to have.
 &HT;    And it's amazing how much one has to have. Call it ``the new
dress requires the matching bag and shoe'' phenomenon. The
advertisements are written to obscure the fact that you'll need
five more peripherals to make the thing blink. You're lured into
buying one glittering gizmo ... and you end up spending twice that
on required updates and accessories. It's a conspiracy worthy of
Oliver Stone.
 &HT;    My quest to leap tall documents in a single click plods on. I
try calling some computer-literate _ now there's an oxymoron _
friends for advice before succumbing to terminal stress. Maybe you
should just buy a Mac, one friend said, maligning my
not-state-of-the-art-anymore IBM-compatible. A Zip drive might be
helpful, recommended another. I should have known better than to
seek sympathy from people who talk about upgrading with abandon.
 &HT;    Add-on is just another name for nothing left to lose. Sighing
deeply, I think back to the good old days when a bad equipment day
meant getting your hands all dirty from changing the typewriter
ribbon.
 &HT;    Progress is little more than the exchange of one nuisance for
another, it's been said.
 &HT;    Go configure.

 By ELLEN H. PARLAPIANO AND PATRICIA COBE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 c. 1998 Child magazine  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As moms with successful, home-based communications businesses,
we are often asked, ``What does it take to pull it off?''
</P>
<P>
   We've learned that working at home requires many of the skills
one naturally develops from being a mom or dad: adaptability,
patience, persistence, organization and discipline.
</P>
<P>
   A sense of humor and a talent for impromptu problem-solving
help, too _ especiallan important client calls back during
your child's playdate and you have to find a quiet place to talk,
fast, even if it's the nearest closet.
</P>
<P>
   Are you meant to earn your bread where you bake it? Our quiz can
help you figure it out.
 &UR; THE QUIZ &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   Check the phrase that best describes how you typically tackle
responsibilities:
</P>
<P>
   a) You make a written list of your top priorities, get started
on them right away and do your best to finish these tasks despite
distractions.
</P>
<P>
   b) You note what you want to accomplish but have trouble
prioritizing and wind up being overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) You list priorities but ease into big tasks by doing smaller
stuff first.
</P>
<P>
   d) You know what you must accomplish, but you can always find
something else to do _ such as get ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   The way to achieve work-at-home success, as you see it, is to:
</P>
<P>
   a) tap into your talents, passions or professional skills.
</P>
<P>
   b) join a direct-marketing company as a home-based sales rep.
</P>
<P>
   c) buy into a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   d) respond to a TV infomercial that promises you'll make a
million.
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   If you were feeling a little bit lonely while working out of
your home, you would most likely try to beat the isolation blues
by:
</P>
<P>
   a) going to lunch with another professional in your field.
</P>
<P>
   b) telephoning a work-at-home pal.
</P>
<P>
   c) going online and venting your frustrations in a work-at-home
forum.
</P>
<P>
   d) calling a home-shopping channel just to chat and then ending
up blowing a wad on a fake diamond ring.
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   You're on deadline, and a downed power line closes the schools
so your kids are home. A neighbor, who commutes to work, asks you
to watch her children for the day. You:
</P>
<P>
   a) offer to take her kids for the morning if she comes home
early and takes yours for the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   b) tell her, ``I'd like to, but it's a work day for me, too,''
and leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   c) say ``Sure,'' figuring you'll squeeze in more work time if
your kids are occupied with other children.
</P>
<P>
   d) shout, ``I have a real job, too, you know!'' and hang up the
phone.
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   How well do you handle criticism? For example, when your
mother-in-law expresses disapproval of your child-raising
techniques, you:
</P>
<P>
   a) cheerfully and confidently say, ``Thank you, I'll keep it in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   b) shrug off the criticism and continue to do things your own
way.
</P>
<P>
   c) become discouraged and start questioning your own competence.
</P>
<P>
   d) burst into tears and yell, ``I never do anything right!''
 &UR; WHAT YOUR ANSWERS MEAN &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   + 1. Tackling Tasks
</P>
<P>
   a) If you're great at knocking off to-do lists and your house
runs smoothly, you most likely have the goal-setting and
follow-through abilities to work at home.
</P>
<P>
   b) You're on the right track by listing tasks but could sabotage
productivity by setting too many goals. Short to-do lists _ with
two or three daily goals, max _ are more manageable, and the
satisfaction of meeting goals will leave you feeling empowered
rather than overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   c) If you tend to tackle menial jobs before taking on the
serious stuff, you'll have to monitor yourself closely. This form
of procrastination can keep you from getting to important,
moneymaking tasks.
</P>
<P>
   d) Fighting distraction _ be it the fridge or your toddler _ is
an ongoing battle for at-home entrepreneurs. If you can't resist
temptations, your venture is likely to fail.
</P>
<P>
   + 2. Job Choice
</P>
<P>
   a) You're in good company: Most parents pursue their
work-at-home dream by parlaying a talent or professional skill into
a home business. Service-oriented ventures are hot now, with public
relations, desktop publishing, graphic design, computer consulting
and event planning among the top choices.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to turn a favorite hobby into a profitable
service or product. If you're an avid gardener, for example, you
might consider starting a landscape-design company. Or if your
special salsa always wins raves from family and friends, you may
want to market it.
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind, however, that a product launch can require a
substantial investment _ anywhere from $10,000 to $50,000 _ to
cover manufacturing costs.
</P>
<P>
   b) Becoming a home-based sales rep for a direct-marketing firm
offers flexibility and income potential, but stick with well-known
companies that sell reliable products. Be wary of opportunities
that demand cash outlays up front or pyramid schemes that require
you to recruit salespeople before you can profit.
</P>
<P>
   Research a business by contacting the Direct Selling Association
at (202) 293-5760.
</P>
<P>
   c) Buying into a franchise is quite popular. A big drawback,
however, is the high purchase price, ranging from $5,000 to $20,000
or more. Before diving into such a big-money venture, retain an
attorney who can review contracts and negotiate for you, if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   d) Beware: An opportunity that sounds too good to be true
probably is. Chances are, such jobs _ from telemarketing to
assembling jewelry _ won't deliver what they promise. If you're
still tempted by a particular offer, check out the company with the
Federal Trade Commission at (202) 326-3128)or the Better Business
Bureau at (202) 393-8000).
</P>
<P>
   + 3. Licking Loneliness
</P>
<P>
   a) Since nothing beats face-to-face contact, lunching with
someone in your line of work is an excellent way to exchange ideas,
get leads and referrals, promote your business and get out of those
sweatpants. Conferences and other events sponsored by professional
associations are also great networking opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   b) When you can't get out, a phone call can help you feel
connected. But make sure you set a time limit before you dial, and
have an escape strategy in mind if your friend winds up talking
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   c) Socializing in cyberspace can be rewarding, but online chats
may sap too much of your work time _ and budget _ if you don't set
limits beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   d) A shopping network doesn't count as a bona-fide networking
group, so don't waste your time and money!
</P>
<P>
   + 4. Coping with Crisis
</P>
<P>
   a) Clever thinking! Dividing the day with a neighbor when
there's a child-care crisis makes it clear that you're a working
mom and provides a compromise that will help both of you in this
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   b) A courteous ``no'' gets the point across effectively, and
your neighbor will soon learn she can't take advantage of you. But
you'll still be faced with juggling your kids and your deadline the
whole day.
</P>
<P>
   c) If your children and your neighbor's kids are school age or
older, they may entertain each other, but count on interruptions.
If they're younger, don't fool yourself about getting work done,
since it's nearly impossible to supervise a playdate and a business
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   d) Flying off the handle only uses up your psychic energy and
alienates your neighbor. And it never pays to make enemies: Who
knows when you'll need to ask her for a favor, or when she'll bring
you a big new business lead?
</P>
<P>
   + 5. Rejection
</P>
<P>
   a) Criticism and rejection come with the work-at-home territory.
If you deal with these inevitable challenges by maintaining your
self-confidence and being open to new ideas, you'll be in great
shape.
</P>
<P>
   b) Not allowing criticism to get your goat is fine _ but don't
let arrogance take over. After all, your mother-in-law will always
be around to offer unsolicited advice, but a client who feels he or
she isn't being heard can walk away at any time.
</P>
<P>
   c) We all have days when we feel discouraged and are tempted to
throw in the towel, but try to bounce back quickly. Maintaining
healthy self-esteem is key to the success of any home venture.
</P>
<P>
   d) If any form of criticism moves you to tears or makes you see
red, you're too vulnerable and hotheaded to be your own boss right
now.

   Reliable equipment, the right software and strong technical
support can mean the difference between success and failure in a
small business. These are my top picks after sorting through the
wealth of high-tech help available these days, testing the
equipment, running the software and querying business owners for
their recommendations.
 &UR; COMPUTERS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the Small Business Administration, the vast
majority of small businesses use computers, and it's no surprise
that reliability, price, ease of use and technical support are the
primary considerations when purchasing a new system.
</P>
<P>
   In view of those requirements, we found the Aptiva E76 to be an
excellent choice for a small- or home-business setting. This is the
first model of the Aptiva E Series to use a speedy 300MHz Intel
Pentium II processor. This powerhouse also incorporates an 8.0GB
hard drive, 64MB RAM, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a K56 Flex modem.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent productivity package _ Lotus SmartSuite 97 _ comes
preinstalled and offers word-processing, spreadsheet and database
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, purchasers are entitled to a free one-year
membership in the Owner Privileges program, which provides
preferred technical service and product discounts. IBM,
800-426-7235, ext. 4340, $1,800, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   For companies with slightly tighter budgets, the Packard Bell
Platinum 4500 is, as one small-business owner put it, ``a workhorse
at a great price.'' Key features include a 266MHz Intel Pentium II
processor, a 6.4GB hard drive, a 24X CD-ROM drive and a 56K modem.
</P>
<P>
   The system is loaded with productivity software, including
Microsoft's Word 97, Works 4.5 and NetMeeting, plus Intuit's
Quicken Basic 98, MGI Photosuite SE and more. Packard Bell,
800-733-5858, $1,600, monitor sold separately.
</P>
<P>
   Though costly, portable computers offer the flexibility to work
where and when you choose. One particularly fine series of
portables is IBM's ThinkPad 380XD Notebooks. Top models in this
line are equipped with a 266MHz Intel Pentium processor, a 5.lGB
hard drive, 32MB RAM and a 24X CD-ROM drive.
</P>
<P>
   These machines are ready to go _ they're preloaded with
excellent productivity software, including Lotus SmartSuite. IBM,
800-426-7255, ext. 475l, $2,800-$3,900.
 &UR; PRINTERS AND ALL-IN-ONES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   High-quality printing is a must for maintaining a professional
image. The good news is you no longer need to pay a graphic
designer or incur huge printing bills to create sleek brochures
with eye-catching graphics. HP's DeskJet 890C is an excellent
small-business printer that offers brilliant photo quality _ even
on ordinary office paper _ plus faster print speeds. In fact, the
unit is currently HP's fastest inkjet. Hewlett Packard,
800-752-0900, $400.
</P>
<P>
   If you're hampered by serious space constraints, you might
consider the Sharp UX-600M all-in-one fax, copier, printer and
scanner. This unit's compact size _ 14 by 19 inches _ coupled with
its reputation for dependability, won Heidi Donato's admiration.
When Donato resigned from her position at a nationally known public
relations company in order to start her own firm _ and spend more
time with her newborn _ she did some serious research before
committing her resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot at stake when you start your own company,'' says
Donato. ``Finding the right equipment with good service and support
is essential.'' Sharp supplements its 90-day warranty with free
technical support via a tollfree consumer service line. Sharp,
800-BE-SHARP, $640.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving you space and money, the HP LaserJet 31OO
printer-fax-copier-scanner saves time _ you can print while sending
or receiving faxes, and the unit's top-quality optical character
recognition lets you scan documents directly into your word
processor _ no need for retyping! Hewlett Packard, 800-752-0900,
$700.
 &UR; COMMUNICATIONS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The latest 900MHz portable phones have terrific range and
exceptional sound clarity. Two particularly user-friendly models
are the Plantronics CT-901-HS Hands-Free Cordless Telephone and
Uniden's E-Mail Phone. The CT-901-HS features a convertible headset
(headband or over-the-ear) and allows you to roam up to l00 feet
without compromising reception. The lightweight dial pack fits in a
pocket or can be clipped onto a belt, so you're completely
unencumbered. Plantronics, 800-544-4660, $225.
</P>
<P>
   With the E-Mail Phone, you no longer need to boot up the
computer each time you want to check your electronic mailbox. An
indicator light lets you know when you've got messages. This
timesaving gadget incorporates a keyboard plus a display screen so
you can send and receive e-mail. There's also a speakerphone and an
electronic calendar, notepad and address book. Uniden,
800-297-1023, $350, corded model; $450, cordless.
</P>
<P>
   If your office receptionist consists of a tinny-sounding
answering machine, you might consider signing up for Webley, an
electronic, voice-activated personal assistant. Webley makes,
takes, forwards, holds and screens your calls, reads your E-mail to
you over the phone, schedules conference calls and more. Regardless
of how you were contacted _ e-mail, fax, phone or pager _ your
messages can be bundled and forwarded to you through one source,
streamlining and also documenting all your correspondence. Webley
Systems, Inc., 888-333-0300, $15 per month plus 14.9 cents per
minute for 800/888 calls to or from anywhere in the country.
 &UR; SOFTWARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether your business is fledgling or established, quality
software can streamline your day-to-day operations. ClarisWorks
Office 5.0 is an easy-to-use and remarkably affordable product
offering database, spreadsheet and word-processing capabilities,
plus a home page authoring tool and Internet connection software.
The 175 ready-made customizable documents _ newsletter layouts,
invoices, contracts _ are especially nice for small- or home-office
users. Claris/Filemaker, 800-544-8554, $79 for Windows, $99 for
Mac.
</P>
<P>
   A more comprehensive, and expensive, productivity suite is
Microsoft Office 97 Small Business Edition Version 2.0, which
includes Word 97, Excel 97 (spreadsheet), Publisher 98 (desktop
publishing), Outlook 98 (integrated E-mail) and Small Business
Financial Manager 98 (financial analysis and reporting tools).
</P>
<P>
   Two extras you'll find handy are the Direct Mail Manager, a
program for developing and managing direct mail lists, and Expedia
Streets 98, an easy way to locate key customers and integrate maps
into your marketing materials. Microsoft, 800-426-9400, $500.
</P>
<P>
   Jian Software offers a terrific set of nuts-and-bolts programs
designed to help you plan and organize your entire operation, from
working up your initial business plan to marketing and employee
management. Titles in the series include BizPlan Builder,
PublicityBuilder and BusinessBasics. This helpful software walks
you through the planning step by step and provides hundreds of
customizable templates for documents of all types. Jian Software,
800-346-5426, $50-$150.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining an upscale image on a barebones budget is easier
with Business Card, Ink &AMP; More, a program that lets you design and
print out professional-looking stationery and business cards.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you incorporate an existing logo or dream up a new de-
sign, you'll have ample guidance and materials. DogByte
Development, 800-936-4298, $35.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit's QuickBooks 5.0 can manage your billing, payroll and
scheduling, freeing up hours each week. When Dena Dahl took over a
portion of the private investigation company she worked for, she
created a freestanding business in the hope of carving out more
autonomy and more time with her son. When that free time wasn't
forthcoming _ and neither was the ability to hire help with
bookkeeping _ she turned to QuickBooks.
</P>
<P>
   The program's standout features include instant access to
electronic banking and payment, custom invoices and inventory
management. Intuit, 800-4-INTUIT, $100.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Dahl's favorite timesaving tools: the Pitney Bowes
Personal Post Office Miter. This nifty device lets her download
postage by phone with a 30-second tollfree call. The meter prints
l0 envelopes per minute and holds up to $1,000 in postage _ making
trips to the post office a chore of the past. Pitney Bowes,
800-672-6937, $20 per month plus postage.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From ``The Complete Idiot's Guide to Starting a Home-Based
Business,'' c.1997 Alpha Books, a division of Macmillan.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Home-based business is the fastest-growing segment in our
business community today. Ideas, products, jobs and wealth are
being created in spare bedrooms, basements, lofts and even at the
kitchen table.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home-based businesses in the past several years is
nothing short of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Only a decade ago, someone working from home might have tried to
disguise his or her work status. It wasn't considered
``professional.'' Folks working from home were often viewed as
dabblers, not serious entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   But now the growing number of home businesspeople are looked
upon with envy: They've left the rat race behind, sitting on the
beach with their laptops and answering to no one.
</P>
<P>
   The largest enterprise in the world, the U.S. government, is run
from a home office. Each day the president sits in the ultimate
home office _ the Oval Office _ and conducts affairs of state.
</P>
<P>
   But the president is far from alone in working at home. Millions
of individuals have already set up shop at home.
</P>
<P>
   Who's running these businesses? Some start working from home by
choice. Others are the victims of corporate downsizing and use what
they have _ skills from the corporate environment or home _ to
start a new career.
</P>
<P>
   Some home-based-business owners are young, with children to care
for. Others are retirees starting on second or even third careers.
</P>
<P>
   Professionals _ doctors, lawyers, accountants, architects _
continue to swell the ranks of home-based business. So too do
traditional home-based businesses such as child care, music
lessons, interior design, crafts and free-lance writing.
</P>
<P>
   New types of businesses are also being run from home.
Kitchen-table-based consultants can be found in just about every
field, including computers, marketing and public relations.
Mail-order selling, medical billing, travel booking and network
marketing of all kinds are among the newer enterprises to move into
the home office.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home business has been made possible by
technology. The personal computer, photocopier, fax, modem and, of
course, the telephone allow any Jack in a bedroom or Jill in a den
to become an entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   Home isn't only where the heart is _ it's also where the money
is. Statistics show that home-based businesses are surprisingly
successful.
</P>
<P>
   According to Entrepreneur magazine, the average annual income
from a home business is more than $50,000. More than 1.7 million
home-based businesses earn six figures or more.
</P>
<P>
   Home businesses also seem to succeed at a greater rate than
non-home businesses. Some sources put the home-business success
rate as high as 95 percent after one year. According to the same
sources, after three years 85 percent of these home businesses were
still in operation, compared with just 15 percent of non-home small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of home-based-business owners who succeed
continue to operate from home. But a number of hugely successful
enterprises had humble beginnings in a spare bedroom or garage
turned office.
</P>
<P>
   Lillian Vernon launched her catalog business from her kitchen
table. Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak began Apple Computer in the
Jobs family garage. Michael Dell started his computer company from
his college dorm room. Calvin Klein and his partner started their
apparel line in Klein's living room.
 &UR; WHY START FROM HOME? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't intend to remain there forever, home is still
a good place to get started, for several reasons:
</P>
<P>
   + You're already paying the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Starting any business costs money. But the amount you need to
launch and run a business from home is less than if you had to rent
office space. You're already paying rent or the mortgage on your
home. You're already heating and cooling it. It generally doesn't
cost you any more to use a portion of your home for business.
</P>
<P>
   Low overhead may be the prime reason why home-based businesses
are so successful.
</P>
<P>
   + Short commute.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of the big benefits of a home business. When you run
a business from home, you don't board a train, catch a bus or get
caught in gridlocked traffic to get to work. You simply get
dressed, if you want to, and go down the hall or up the stairs to
your office when you're ready to get to work.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the commute saves you both time and money.
</P>
<P>
   + Child care.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people find it difficult to leave home for work when
there are children, or elderly parents, to care for. And for some,
when the cost of day care is added to the cost of commuting,
working outside the home may make about as much sense as buying an
Edsel.
</P>
<P>
   + Flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Working from home usually gives you greater flexibility in your
schedule. You can work when it's convenient for you and take care
of your life when you want to.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the demands of your home business don't always permit
this kind of freedom. Many people find they work longer hours when
they run a home business. This is especially true when you are just
getting started.
</P>
<P>
   But generally speaking, even if you work long hours, you can
pretty much schedule your time the way you want to.
 &UR; THE PRICE YOU PAY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, even working at home in sweats and munching cookies
while you work, is perfect. There are drawbacks you should consider
before launching your own home-based business.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   You may be bringing the business public _ clients, customers, or
patients _ into your home on a regular basis. This means a certain
loss of privacy. Your family, your pets, your lifestyle _ and even
your dirty laundry _ may be visible to strangers. You have to be
comfortable with this change. If you're the private type, think
twice about giving up your office job.
</P>
<P>
   + Loss of space.
</P>
<P>
   Before you started the business, your family had the run of the
joint. Now you have to use a room or two for business. Whatever was
going on in the space now used for your office has to be pushed
into other parts of your home.
</P>
<P>
   If you convert a spare bedroom into a home office, where will
the in-laws stay when they're in town?
</P>
<P>
   + Solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I like the quiet and solitude of being alone all
day, with my interruptions limited to an occasional phone call. But
not everyone's like me.
</P>
<P>
   Being tied to your home virtually all day long may drive you
right up the wall. You may be the kind who thrives on a daily
change of scenery. You may feel as if living and working in the
same place is akin to being handcuffed in a very small closet.
</P>
<P>
   If so, you have to deal with the problem.
 &UR; CHANGE IN LIFESTYLE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When you work at home, you're never far from your business. The
work is always there.
</P>
<P>
   This change in lifestyle involves not only you but also those
near and dear to you. Your family may know very well that you're in
business, but they may continue to treat you as if you're on
24-hour call. My husband still wanders into the office from time to
time just wanting to chat.
</P>
<P>
   You need to educate the folks who live with you to the fact that
during working hours you're basically not there.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the changes you'll go through, starting your
home-based business can still be the most rewarding way to live.
And if you want to do it, you can make it happen.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Enjoy today's low gasoline prices and worldwide oil
glut, because they won't last forever, most Americans, including
energy experts, agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best analysts think we're in good shape for the next five
to 10 years, but in the long term, South Asia and East Asia will
grow out of their troubles, and their demands will start putting
pressure on global markets,'' said David Nemtzow, president of the
Alliance to Save Energy, a coalition of consumer, government,
business and labor representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtzow said that will coincide with another uncomfortable
trend: ``Existing supplies in the democratic nations, from places
like Alaska and the North Sea, will start running out and that is
going to mean OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries) is back in the driver's seat at some point in the next
10 to 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing that Asian demand will bounce back, independent
oilman Steve Layton of Spring, Texas, said U.S. production could
continue at current levels for decades -- 62 years for oil and 68
years for natural gas -- under more supportive policies on taxes,
the environment and use of public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's remaining oil and gas resources are greater than our
cumulative production from 1857(CQ) to the present,'' said Layton,
president and chief executive of Equinox Oil Co. ``Further
exploration, aided by technological innovations, may yet find large
fields that are presently unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   At the American Petroleum Institute, whose members include
several hundred oil companies of all sizes, chief economist Michael
E. Canes said he was confident the world's oil suppliers could deal
smoothly with a steady increase in demand.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem would be a random, temporary interruption that
could make the markets ``skittish'' enough to cause price spikes,
Canes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say there was a revolution in Saudi Arabia and everybody
was in arms there, and they shut in their oil fields. That's at the
cataclysmic end of the scale,'' Canes said. ``But in different
circumstances, say it's Nigeria (with much less production than
Saudi Arabia). It would depend on the market's perceptions of how
long it would take others to make up for the disruption, whether
that could be done within a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economic benefits of importing cheap oil year-in and
year-out far exceed the economic costs of occasional short-term oil
shocks, according to a study by nonpartisan analysts from the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``GAO estimates that the U.S. economy realizes hundreds of
billions of dollars in benefits annually by using relatively low
cost imported oil, rather than relying on more expensive domestic
sources of energy,'' said the report. ``By comparison, oil shocks
impose large but infrequent economic costs that, when annualized,
are estimated to cost the U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars
per year.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't count the human costs of wars to protect
foreign oil supplies, said Burl Haigwood, managing director of the
Clean Fuels Foundation, chaired by retired Air Force Gen. Lee
Butler, a strategic planner for Desert Storm, which evicted Iraqi
troops from oil-rich Kuwait in early 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The root cause of Desert Storm was the world's dependence on
Middle East oil, and the consequences of that war continue to
threaten stability in the area,'' Haigwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Oil shocks abroad disrupted the U.S. supply of oil imports for a
few months during the Suez crisis of the 1950s, the Arab oil
embargo of 1973, the revolution in Iran and Iran's war with Iraq in
1979-80, and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Most American voters are well aware of that, and it worries
them, according to a poll of 1,003 registered voters released last
month on the 25th anniversary of the Arab oil embargo by the
Sustainable Energy Coalition. The coalition's 35 consumer,
environmental and industry groups say that renewable energy and
greater efficiencies could lower dependence on oil from here or
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Answering a series of questions, 75 percent or more agreed that
U.S. dependence on foreign oil is at least a somewhat serious
threat to ``the nation's economy and people's jobs,'' ``our
standard of living'' and ``national security.''
</P>
<P>
   A smaller majority recalled personally experiencing (57 percent)
or had heard of (5 percent) the energy crises of the 1970s that
resulted in increased energy bills, long gasoline lines and the
doubling of gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   After being reminded that the United States imported about a
third of its oil in 1973, they were asked what the percentage is
today. Their estimates averaged 58 percent. Ronald H. Hinckley, who
directed the poll, said that was ``a figure fairly close to the
actual figure of 53 percent of gross imports, or 48 percent of net
imports.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that net imports will
rise to 66 percent of U.S. consumption by 2020, as U.S. consumption
grows faster than U.S. production.
</P>
<P>
   Hinckley's poll asked voters to grade ``our elected officials
for dealing with our dependence on foreign oil.'' A plurality of 48
percent picked ``C'', with 18 percent choosing ``A'' or ``B'' and
31 percent choosing ``D'' or ``F''. The rest didn't say.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtzow the advocate, Layton the oilman and Canes the economist
were more lenient graders as they discussed three improvements in
the past quarter century:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  With the demise of federal regulation of oil and gas supplies,
government-caused shortages that would complicate efforts to cope
with a foreign-caused shortage have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The federal government created the Strategic Petroleum
Reserve, which contains crude oil that can be released quickly to
make up temporarily for cut-off of foreign oil.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oil supplies have been diversified. The Middle East provides a
smaller portion of the world and U.S. oil supplies.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is why the (U.S. Energy) Department is actively engaged
in promotion of energy development in Latin America, Asia, and the
Caspian regions,'' said Robert W. Gee, assistant energy secretary
for policy and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Today, the price signals that reveal balances or imbalances in
supply and demand are sent by open, global markets, rather than by
governments or secret negotiations between oil buyers and
exporters.
</P>
<P>
   Speculators on futures markets help lower financial risks and
smooth out changes in prices, demand and supply, Nemtzow said.
``There are very creative people in the market both on Wall Street
and Main Street today,'' he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   ``A supply disruption would be reflected in higher prices,
instead of gas station lines,'' Canes said. ``Accommodations could
be made to ease the pain for people who are especially hard hit.''
</P>
<P>
   In an emergency, the president can dip into the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve, which was created after the 1994 embargo. The
SPR consists of government-owned salt caverns in Texas and
Louisiana big enough to hold about 680 million barrels of crude oil
-- just over two-thirds of the one billion barrels called for in
the original plan.
</P>
<P>
   At today's importing pace, the 558 million barrels now in the
reserve could make up for the loss of 57 days' worth of imports --
down from 78 days worth four years ago. In those four years,
imports have grown, but the amount of crude oil in the reserve has
dropped because some was sold off to pay the cost of operating the
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a Senate plan to resume filling the reserve for the
first time since 1994 was killed in budget negotiations with the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they've stopped drawing it down,'' said Canes, who
advocates a 90-day supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we used the Strategic Petroleum Reserve properly in an
emergency, we couldn't stop the damage, but we could limit it,'' he
said. ``Instead of rising 50 cents a gallon, prices might rise only
30 cents a gallon.''
</P>
<P>
   Layton, who recommends expanding the reserve and filling it with
one billion barrels of crude oil, said, ``With oil prices low, this
is the time to buy and store oil for future emergencies.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Enjoy today's low gasoline prices and worldwide oil
glut, because they won't last forever, most Americans, including
energy experts, agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best analysts think we're in good shape for the next five
to 10 years, but in the long term, South Asia and East Asia will
grow out of their troubles, and their demands will start putting
pressure on global markets,'' said David Nemtzow, president of the
Alliance to Save Energy, a coalition of consumer, government,
business and labor representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Nemtzow said that will coincide with another uncomfortable
trend: ``Existing supplies in the democratic nations, from places
like Alaska and the North Sea, will start running out and that is
going to mean OPEC (the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries) is back in the driver's seat at some point in the next
10 to 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing that Asian demand will bounce back, independent
oilman Steve Layton of Spring, Texas, said U.S. production could
continue at current levels for decades -- 62 years for oil and 68
years for natural gas -- under more supportive policies on taxes,
the environment and use of public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``America's remaining oil and gas resources are greater than our
cumulative production from 1857(CQ) to the present,'' said Layton,
president and chief executive of Equinox Oil Co. ``Further
exploration, aided by technological innovations, may yet find large
fields that are presently unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   At the American Petroleum Institute, whose members include
several hundred oil companies of all sizes, chief economist Michael
E. Canes said he was confident the world's oil suppliers could deal
smoothly with a steady increase in demand.
</P>
<P>
   A bigger problem would be a random, temporary interruption that
could make the markets ``skittish'' enough to cause price spikes,
Canes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say there was a revolution in Saudi Arabia and everybody
was in arms there, and they shut in their oil fields. That's at the
cataclysmic end of the scale,'' Canes said. ``But in different
circumstances, say it's Nigeria (with much less production than
Saudi Arabia). It would depend on the market's perceptions of how
long it would take others to make up for the disruption, whether
that could be done within a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the economic benefits of importing cheap oil year-in and
year-out far exceed the economic costs of occasional short-term oil
shocks, according to a study by nonpartisan analysts from the
General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of the U.S.
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``GAO estimates that the U.S. economy realizes hundreds of
billions of dollars in benefits annually by using relatively low
cost imported oil, rather than relying on more expensive domestic
sources of energy,'' said the report. ``By comparison, oil shocks
impose large but infrequent economic costs that, when annualized,
are estimated to cost the U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars
per year.''
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't count the human costs of wars to protect
foreign oil supplies, said Burl Haigwood, managing director of the
Clean Fuels Foundation, chaired by retired Air Force Gen. Lee
Butler, a strategic planner for Desert Storm, which evicted Iraqi
troops from oil-rich Kuwait in early 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``The root cause of Desert Storm was the world's dependence on
Middle East oil, and the consequences of that war continue to
threaten stability in the area,'' Haigwood said.

   VIGNIER, Haiti _ Barricade after barricade blocked traffic along
National Road 1, a ribbon of despair and poverty that cuts from
northwest Haiti to the capital of Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   Poor peasants in this dusty village had stacked the stones and
branches shoulder-high before dawn, and they burned tires that shot
clouds of black smoke toward the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions mounted when angry onlookers hurled rocks at police
officers who tried to disperse the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Into the air, a gunshot was fired, and the sound sent people
scattering for cover in all directions.
</P>
<P>
   It was a protest, Haitian-style, one of many that have been held
in recent weeks, staged by a disillusioned population that has
little to celebrate despite four years of democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, U.S. troops overthrew a brutal dictatorship and
restored exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power.
</P>
<P>
   But unless something gives, this country could easily tumble
into a spiral of violence and upheaval that would bring to a
screeching halt any and all efforts to shore up the embryonic
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things seem to be getting worse, and no one cares what is
happening,'' said John Ilfrin, a resident of this town located an
hour's drive from Port-au-Prince. ``We have only one phone in this
village, and no water or electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Frustration also is building in Washington, which has poured an
estimated $1 billion into this Maryland-sized country of 8 million
people since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The United States still maintains a force of some 500 soldiers
here to do humanitarian chores such as repairing roads and
operating a medical clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has requested $140 million in aid to
Haiti for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1 -- double the previous
year's amount.
</P>
<P>
   A parade of U.S. emissaries has been sent here to break the
political gridlock that has left Haiti without a working government
for 17 months, but none have made progress.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has visited Haiti twice
since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton has scheduled a visit to
Haiti in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are no signs that conditions will improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions have gone from bad to worse, and there is clearly
great desperation among the Haitian people,'' said Ken Boodhoo(CQ),
an expert on Haiti at Florida International University in Miami who
recently visited the country. ``The only reason more of them are
not headed to Florida is that many have run out of wood to build
boats.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last month(CQ), two Coast Guard cutters repatriated 462
Haitians who were caught near the Bahamas on an overcrowded wooden
freighter bound for Florida. So far this year, the Coast Guard has
intercepted 1,158 Haitians. Compared to last year, the number is
up, but the flow has slowed considerably since tens of thousands
fled a murderous regime in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But in a poll of 1,400 Haitians conducted last August by the
U.S. Embassy here, nearly three-fourths of those surveyed said they
would leave Haiti if they could.
</P>
<P>
   And nearly 40 percent believe Haitians will turn away from
democracy if conditions don't improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economic situation has never been worse,'' said Lovinsky
Pierre-Antoine, an official with Haiti's National Migration Office.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the economy has scarcely changed in four decades
that have seen the murderous tyrannies of Francois ``Papa Doc''
Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier; the
dictatorial rule of military juntas; the election, ouster and
return of Aristide; and the reign of the current president,
Aristide's hand-picked successor, Rene Preval.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is little that works in this land of idyllic
beaches and banana plants.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic lights don't function. Driver's licenses aren't
dispensed. Phone service can be out for months following a heavy
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation is evident in the faces of the beggars who claw at
the windows of any foreigner's car that tries to leave the
airport's parking lot, and in those of children who clutch tattered
clothes around bone-thin bodies as they play in the open sewers
that twist through the slums.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is at 60-plus percent, while per-capita income has
fallen to about $250 a year.
</P>
<P>
   In September, when the United Nations published its annual
``human development index,'' Haiti, already the poorest nation in
the hemisphere, had dropped to 159th in the world. It had ranked
124th only a few years ago, when Aristide was first elected to
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The continuing political deadlock poses considerable risks to
the country's fragile democracy,'' warned U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan in his latest quarterly report to the General Assembly.
``It is a serious impediment to economic development and
international assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   The origins of the current crisis go back to June 1997, when
Prime Minister Rosny Smarth resigned over allegations of rigged
elections that April, a move that has left Haiti without a
functioning government for nearly 17 months.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently the stalemate has forced parliamentary and
municipal elections scheduled for this month(CQ) to be indefinitely
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   Preval has nominated four people to replace Smarth, but the
first three were rejected by the Haitian Parliament, while his most
recent nominee, Minister of Education Jacques-Edouard Alexis, has
yet to win approval.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Preval has been unable to collect hundreds of
millions of dollars in aid, or even to get a budget approved so
that civil servants who've not gotten a salary in months might
finally receive a paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of a prime minister and a fully empowered government
has put economic (aid) and social progress on hold because
necessary legislation can't be introduced and enacted into law,''
said Mary Ellen Gilroy, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in
Port-au-Prince.
</P>
<P>
   The Parliament, unable to reach a quorum, also hasn't been able
to pass important legislation that might be used to fight rising
crime and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials now estimate that 15 percent -- about four tons a
month -- of all cocaine entering the United States transits Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political infrastructure is totally lacking,'' said Mike
Vigil, who heads the Drug Enforcement Administration's Caribbean
office in Puerto Rico. ``We have virtually no response capability
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of rising crime was recently brought home to Americans
when, on Oct. 21, five men robbed a ``Dateline NBC'' television
crew, including correspondent Lea Thompson, at gunpoint in
Port-au-Prince as a police officer looked on.
</P>
<P>
   With limited resources and limited training, Haitian officials
say it's been tough to build a capable police force with 6,000
mostly young, inexperienced members.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's true that the number of political killings may have
declined, so many cops are now being bought out by drug traffickers
that it's my impression the police force has gone to hell,'' said
Sarah DeCosse of Human Rights Watch in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Preval, widely regarded as a respectable leader, but lacking in
Aristide's charisma and ability to communicate, declined a request
from Cox News Service for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the one piece of good news here is that, somehow,
this country keeps running, seemingly on automatic pilot.
</P>
<P>
   By 6 a.m., Haitians are out on the streets hawking everything
from limes to fabric, light bulbs to Tabasco sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Luxurious houses have been constructed. Car dealerships have
been expanded. Road work has been undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the political problems, money is still being invested
in this country, and there is some real growth in many areas,''
said Alex Knowles, head of the Haitian-American Chamber of Commerce
here.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that U.S. companies such as Atlanta-based Coca-Cola
Co. have pumped money into this impoverished country.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola and its local bottler invested at least $15 million in
production and distribution systems in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some strong years there,'' said Rob Baskin, a
Coca-Cola spokesman, referring to a 74 percent increase in sales
since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the political impasse has clearly hurt the economy, which is
expected to grow by a paltry 1 percent to 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   With no immediate end to the political stalemate in sight, all
eyes now seem to be focused on presidential elections in the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide, the populist priest, is widely expected to run, and is
favored to win.
</P>
<P>
   But there also have been muted calls for Duvalier to return from
exile in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Adding even more uncertainty to the mix is the fact that a
10-year constitutional ban that has kept most key players in
Duvalier's regime from running for political office ended last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Aristide sounds and acts a lot like a presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Miami, he pledged in a speech to work for
peace in Haiti and promised to push for dual citizenship for those
who want to vote in both the United States and Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no food in our stomachs, it is hard to have peace
in our minds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His message plays well in Haiti, where ``Viv Aristide'' graffiti
is scrawled on buildings everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of whether Haiti can hold together for two more
years remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will there be violence, or will there be an uprising?'' asked
Ernest Preeg, U.S. ambassador to Haiti from 1981 to 1983. ``No one
can say, but the potential is certainly there.''

of an escort has become more dangerous. By CAROL DeMARE.

   CLOTHES-PINS (Albany, N.Y.) _ The clothespin has been a common

   JAPANESE-TOURISTS (San Francisco) _ San Francisco, long a

</P>
<P>
   TV-SHUTTLE (Undated) _ This is the way it used to be, in the
black and white and early technicolor days, when space was scary
and vital and anchors like Walter Cronkite had models of big rocket
ships on their desk. Words like ``T-minus,'' and ``gimbal'' and the
other technical jargon, we knew all that. And those moments right
after lift-off were tension conventions that knotted our stomachs.
All that flame, all that smoke. Would it be all right? By MARK

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ They were young and upwardly mobile Russians enjoying
all that the post-Soviet economy had to offer the fledgling middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   Thriving in Russia's new capitalism, Alexander and Lilia
Kazintsev spent their hard-earned rubles on stylish furnishings for
their apartment and country house, vacations abroad and a private
tutor to teach English to their nine-year-old son, Anton.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the good times have vanished.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander lost his well-paying job as a corporate marketing
director. Lilia believes her layoff as an executive headhunter is
just a matter of time. Their savings have been frozen in a Moscow
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Any hopes of a brighter future are on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of families like the Kazintsevs were the first
victims of Russia's economic meltdown in late August, when the
ruble plummeted in value and the banking system collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us who had jobs, money -- the means to travel, buy
clothes, good food and wine -- in one moment, we have lost all
these opportunities,'' said Lilia, 33.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies these days don't need marketing managers, they need
crisis managers,'' said Alexander, also 33.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both both Russian and foreign companies have been laying
people off by the hundreds. Multinational advertising giant BBDO
has laid off one-third of its staff, while Pizza Hut announced
plans earlier this week to close its two restaurants in Moscow. A
recent survey of its membership by the American Chamber of Commerce
here showed that half of its members have either laid off or
reduced salaries to workers because of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The events have sent shockwaves though Russia's middle class, a
tiny minority -- perhaps no more than several million in a country
of 147 million -- who successfully made the transformation from
communism to capitalism after the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, they live in Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and St.
Petersburg. Not the much-publicized mafia and not the ultra-rich
tycoons, Russia's middle class -- like the Kazintsevs -- consists
of the business professionals and entrepreneurs who adopted a
Western lifestyle. They bought and renovated their Soviet-built
apartments, purchased cars, frequented restaurants, joined health
clubs and sent their children to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   In good times, they earned 20 or even 200 times more than the
average Russian salary of $200 a month by taking their Soviet-style
economic and management training and conforming it to the new
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Their plight in the current economic crisis is not as dire as
the majority of poverty-stricken Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people living below the poverty line rose from
32.8 million in August to 44.4 million in September, about 30
percent of the population, according to official statistics. The
poverty line is drawn at the ruble equivalent of $32 a month.
</P>
<P>
   But more important for the country's future, the middle class
was the great hope for the staying power of democracy and reforms:
How are you going to send them back to the Soviet days after
they've seen cable TV and Disney World?
</P>
<P>
   But the material gains of recent years are indeed slipping away
and the future looks gloomy, particularly as the government
contemplates enacting Soviet-style controls on the economy to get
through the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not buy new clothes, shoes, furniture. We do not buy what
isn't necessary for living,'' said Lilia.
</P>
<P>
   For them, the hardest is explaining the setback to their little
boy, Anton. No more vacations at the beach in Turkey; no more
private lessons to learn English in the hopes of giving him an edge
in his later education.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're in the shops, we have to tell him why we cannot buy
the toy he wants. It is too expensive now,'' Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   They are not alone. By year's end, more than 200,000 of the
middle class will be unemployed in Moscow alone, according to the
city's employment center.
</P>
<P>
   A recent nationwide survey showed that of those with jobs only
18 percent of Russians are being paid regularly, and some 56
percent said they must rely on food they have grown on their own
and stockpiled to survive the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a three-piece herringbone suit, an executive's
leather briefcase by his side, Alexander scanned the want ads on a
recent afternoon and lamented the setback to his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem really isn't with money. It's not in the things I
can buy or cannot buy. The problem is that my career prospects have
crashed,'' said Alexander, who conceded he may have to consider a
job as a driver or a laborer.
</P>
<P>
   Their savings have been frozen in a Moscow bank since August,
and they hope to get by with help from family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Lilia, who was a university lecturer in philosophy before the
Soviet Union collapsed, approaches their plight with a degree of
wisdom, not anger.
</P>
<P>
   It is a stoicism shared by many Russians who have lived through
similar economic upheavals over the past decade, watching their
savings wiped out and their buying power eroded as banks fail and
inflation runs rampant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose to be angry is not a constructive emotion,'' she
said. ``It's a pity, but we have a habit of living under difficult
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first crisis for us,'' Alexander said. ``It's
just the latest crisis.''

<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti _ As Hurricane Mitch churned through the
Caribbean this week, a clearer picture is emerging of the
destruction imposed by Hurricane Georges on the hemisphere's
poorest country little more than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of cardboard homes in the squalid slums that surround
this capital city have been washed away.
</P>
<P>
   The southeastern border town of Fonds Verrettes nearly wiped
out, killing more than 100 residents.
</P>
<P>
   And in central Haiti, 20 inches of rain dumped by Georges
devastated crops in the Artibonite Valley, the breadbasket of a
nation that can't feed itself even in good times.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this country have suffered so much and so long that
it seems particularly unjustified that they have had to suffer
through this storm,'' said U.S. Agency for International
Development Administrator Brian Atwood, who visited Haiti last
month(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Georges ripped through the eastern Caribbean and the Florida
Keys in late September, pummeling island after island like a
violent enemy looking for vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   The storm killed more than 500 people and inflicted more than $5
billion in property damage before making its exit as an innocuous
fall rainstorm over Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   But hardest hit was Hispaniola, an island shared by Haiti and
the Dominican Republic, two countries ill-prepared for a natural
disaster of such magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of Georges, the Haitian government said a
combination of mudslides and flooding killed more than 200 people,
left another 332,136 homeless and killed 56,828 animals.
Agricultural damage is estimated at $300 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Port-au-Prince, Haiti's bustling capital and
home to 3 million people, wasn't affected by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But in other parts of Haiti, the country's extreme poverty put
it at the mercy of Georges even moreso than other nations ravaged
by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   The storm aggravated an already precarious economy, weak
agricultural production, and a deteriorated network of roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``In such a poor country, the economic effect is going to be
greater than it would be elsewhere,'' said Alex Knowles, head of
the Haitian-American Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the effect really won't be felt for another three or four
months,'' he said. ``That's when prices will start rising as more
food has to be imported.''
</P>
<P>
   An unfortunate by-product of the storm is a drop in attendance
at some schools by as much as 30 percent. With Georges wiping out
crops, many parents couldn't come up with the money needed to pay
for enrollment last month(CQ), the start of the new school year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another by-product, with the United States bearing the brunt
of it, will undoubtedly be increased illegal migration and drug
trafficking -- which were already growing concerns for U.S.
officials.

   ``I would think you'd see more Haitians trying to get to the
United States because of miserable conditions,'' said Ken Boodhoo,
an expert on Haiti at Florida International University in Miami.
``And, because of poor communication, I am sure the extent of the
hurricane's damage isn't even known yet.''
</P>
<P>
   According to an AID report on the hurricane, escalating prices,
increased food shortages, and widespread hunger are expected as the
traditional flow of food supplies falls far short of already low
historical levels during the next nine months to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Tempering that sentiment are U.S. observers saying the
government here responded faster, surprisingly, than the government
in the neighboring Dominican Republic, a better-developed country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bright spot in all this has been the efforts by the
Haitians themselves to provide relief and set up shelters,'' said
Phyllis Forbes, director of AID in Haiti.

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ I have set about building a wooden cabinet to
hold my cassette tapes a few weeks back. My primary motivation was
the chance to finally enjoy my little shop now that the temperature
has dipped down to tolerable levels. Lord knows I could buy a
cabinet to hold tapes for a fraction of what I'm spending on pieces
of oak and poplar. This is a middle-aged male thing, I realize,
this urge to putter around with my limited collection of carpentry
tools, radio sending forth classical music, the smell of sawdust
filling the air. It's a shame I don't have a clue to what I'm
doing, though that has never stopped me before in any aspect of my

waiting in line. The other day, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who presides over the legal fate of Microsoft Corp.,
invited a visiting group from the former Soviet republic of Moldova
to observe an afternoon session. The delegation bumped a dozen
people who had been trying for hours to get in. Of the 75 places on
the hard wooden benches, 40 are reserved for reporters. We lucky
few are guaranteed seats _ so long as we toe the line. (Glass, Cox

timing at which do-gooders excel, Human Rights Watch and The

 &HT;    I'm dangerous if given the proper tools
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have set about building a wooden cabinet to hold my cassette
tapes a few weeks back. My primary motivation was the chance to
finally enjoy my little shop now that the temperature has dipped
down to tolerable levels. Lord knows I could buy a cabinet to hold
tapes for a fraction of what I'm spending on pieces of oak and
poplar.
</P>
<P>
   This is a middle-aged male thing, I realize, this urge to putter
around with my limited collection of carpentry tools, radio sending
forth classical music, the smell of sawdust filling the air. It's a
shame I don't have a clue to what I'm doing, though that has never
stopped me before in any aspect of my life.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what I own, tool-wise: a circular saw, a cordless drill,
a hammer, wrenches, screwdrivers, etc., an orbital sander and a
router. I have owned the router for some time but haven't gotten up
the nerve to use it. Truth be told, I don't know how to use it. It
seemed like a good idea at the time, since it wasn't very expensive
and I've always wanted to rout. Or maybe it's
</P>
<P>
   route; I'm not sure what the verb form is. But routers are
necessary to doing fine carpentry, I'm told, like creating
decorative edges, grooves in wood and such. So I bought one on
sale.
</P>
<P>
   I've since discovered that one must own a router table to make
any use of a router. This keeps the router stationary while the
wood passes over it. Learning this cleared up a few matters that
had me befuddled. I would experiment with scrap pieces of wood, the
result being nothing more than a heck of a mess on the floor and
some rather bizarre pieces of wood. For the life of me, until I
learned about the table, I couldn't figure out just how one went
about using this cool-looking piece of machinery.
</P>
<P>
   I have been checking out router tables, all of which cost more
than the actual router, but haven't made the plunge yet. I am not
an impulse buyer of anything but books and music. I must
contemplate the purchase for some time. It takes me months to get
around to buying shoes, for example. I've been thinking about
buying a router for years. Since it's useless without a table, I
will have to decide soon whether to accessorize.
</P>
<P>
   I had no set of plans to go by in building my tape cabinet. I
drew
</P>
<P>
   something up on a legal pad, a rough blueprint that I've since
abandoned. I just went to the home-improvement store, bought some
wood, screws, nails and glue, and came home.
</P>
<P>
   It's been trial-and-error, and you can guess which one is
winning. What little skills I had were so rusty that it took a
while just to get back into the basics of cutting a straight board
and nailing it to another without splitting the wood or missing
altogether. Then a friend offered to loan me his table saw, after I
complained about how hard it is to cut something straight with a
circular, hand-held saw.
</P>
<P>
   This is a scary machine. Every time I use it I have visions of
having to learn to type with two or three fewer fingers. Boy, this
could really mess up my golf grip, I think, as I rip a piece of
wood, the key thought being, ``Keep your fingers away from the
blade, dummy.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. Table saws are wonderful for cutting things
straight and being able to duplicate different pieces. I was so
impressed that I tore down the first two drawers I made with the
circular saw and started over.
</P>
<P>
   The now-10-year-old daughter joins me on occasion, hammering
together pieces of scrap wood to make some type of wooden
sculpture. I've been trying to teach her proper hammering
techniques _ holding the hammer at the end, swinging smoothly but
firmly _ but she still hammers like a girl, tiny taps
</P>
<P>
   while holding it near the head. She'll learn or move on to
something else.
</P>
<P>
   Progress is slow. The drawers look OK, but I'm not happy with
the first version of the cabinet that will hold the drawers. I may
start over. I make semi-weekly trips to the home-improvement store
to buy more wood. I could have bought a tape cabinet and furnished
it with tapes for what I've spent so far, and I haven't even broken
down and bought the router table _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   This project is looked upon by my wife with great amusement. She
calls me Tim the Tool Man when I bring up the subject of the router
table, or hint that a table saw with my name on the gift tag would
look great under the Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   There is a patina of sawdust over everything in the shop, which
also doubles as a golf-cart shed and storage area, for boxes of
Christmas decorations and such. The smell of sawdust reminds me of
my maternal grandfather's shop. He was a real carpenter, could
build anything _ and did. His widow still lives in the house he
built out in the country more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If Grampa was alive, I'd be able to get routing lessons. As it
is, I'm on my own.

 &HT;    Sweet opening for new U.S. Sugar refinery
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Julie Waresh
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEWISTON, Fla. _ J. Nelson Fairbanks had a lot of folks to
thank at Thursday's unveiling of U.S. Sugar Corp.'s giant new sugar
refinery _ the first to be built in the United States in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   But the president and chief executive officer of the 67-year-old
company wasted no time in calling attention to one very important
group in the audience of more than 600.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to recognize our bankers,'' Fairbanks told the crowd
of employees, elected officials and reporters who gathered under a
tent after a tour. ``Without them, this would not be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately held U.S. Sugar won't reveal the cost of the
300,000-square-foot structure, except to say that it tops the $70
million the company spent on its citrus-processing plant that
opened in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But industry analysts say it probably cost $100 million or more
to build this computerized and highly automated refinery, which
converts raw milled sugar into the white sugar used in candy,
cookies and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The Clewiston-based company is banking on the gargantuan
investment to increase its returns in a low-margin business that
essentially has been flat for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hammock, one of about 60 smaller farmers who sell their
sugar cane to U.S. Sugar, expects the refinery to benefit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't help but think that, if U.S. Sugar is in better shape
financially, it will help the growers that sell to them,'' Hammock
said.
</P>
<P>
   To market the refined sugar, which the company will produce for
the first time this year, U.S. Sugar has joined a Minnesota-based
sugar marketing cooperative, United Sugars Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The co-op, whose other members are Midwestern beet sugar
producers, will distribute and sell U.S. Sugar's product, some of
which will be packaged under the Pillsbury Best national brand.
</P>
<P>
   The refinery has created about 150 jobs since construction began
in March 1997, and another 20 positions are expected to be filled
as the sugar harvest that began this month hits full swing.
</P>
<P>
   Primary owners of U.S. Sugar are its employees and charitable
foundations set up by the company's founder, Charles Stewart Mott.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Alcee Hastings, D-Miramar, who attended the opening
along with U.S. Rep. Mark Foley, R-West Palm Beach, said he expects
the refinery to also help create jobs outside U.S. Sugar.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is that it will cause other light industry to
consider locating here,'' he said.

SOME ENCHANTING TELEVISION ON `OLD TIMERS' DAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ This is the way it used to be, in the black and
white and early technicolor days, when space was scary and vital
and anchors like Walter Cronkite had models of big rocket ships on
their desk. Everyone, except maybe the Communists, cared and were
pulling for the same outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Words like ``T-minus,'' and ``gimbal'' and the other technical
jargon, we knew all that. And those moments right after liftoff
were tension conventions which knotted our stomachs. All that
flame, all that smoke, would it be all right?
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, it was. Shuttle Discovery blasted off _ even that
seems like an archaic expression _ 19 minutes late. Despite the
delay, much of the country paused to watch.
</P>
<P>
   In almost every respect this was a routine launch, yet still it
was enchanting television. While most shuttle liftoffs are pretty
much ignored, all the networks broke out their heavy-hitters for
this one, with CNN putting out the biggest pinch-hitter of all.
</P>
<P>
   It was the images, not the commentary, that provided the drama.
Sometimes there was just nothing to say. Then finally the rockets
fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liftoff of Discovery with a crew of six astronaut heroes and
one American legend,'' NASA launch commentator Lisa Malone said in
a monotone you'd expect to hear in an off-track betting parlor.
</P>
<P>
   The legend was John Glenn. And another legend, Cronkite, the man
America trusted when it could still trust, watched and commented
from a CNN broadcast vantage 2 miles away from the launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   Those two are why we cared again. Shuttles _ with the tragic
exception of the doomed 1986 Challenger mission _ lift off into
space with regularity, their safety numbing anxiety and interest.
</P>
<P>
   It's just not like the old days of Mercury and Gemini and
Apollo, where experimentation and providence were the only things
that got some astronauts there and back.
</P>
<P>
   Cronkite is 81 now, a little of hard of hearing, and certainly
not as quick a wit or tongue as he was anchoring the ``CBS Evening
News'' from 1962 to 1981. His insights offered were few but
welcome.
</P>
<P>
   And Glenn, the hero astronaut turned senator, is 77, no longer
the rock-cut Marine who become America's poster boy in his first
historic orbital flight in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   But we weren't looking for these guys in their prime Thursday.
This was Old Timer's Day: A smile, a wave, a few words were all we
asked for or needed.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn did his part, so did Cronkite.
</P>
<P>

CLOTHESPINS: SIMPLE BUT ESSENTIAL PART OF LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The clothespin, like the staple and paper clip,
so simple in design, has been a common convenience for more than a
century.
</P>
<P>
   The modern gas and electric clothes dryer would seem to have
made the clothespin a thing of the past. But not quite. There's
still nothing like the fresh smell of clothing and bedding just off
the clothesline.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, The Wall Street Journal noted that 900 million
peg-and-spring clip clothespins were sold in the United States
every year in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1998, the Smithsonian launched a show of
clothespins, which will run through March 1999, including 41
clothespin patent models from its collection. The first clothespin
was patented in 1832, followed by another 146 between 1852 and
1887.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Suit Janssen, curator of the exhibit, in her research
found something similar to the clothespin dating back to the
ancient Egyptians. In its history, the clothespin has been used not
only to hold wet sheets on a clotheslines, but it was also popular
for making dolls, rubber-band guns and holiday ornaments, according
to the Smithsonian.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there remain several varieties of clothespins from which
to choose, including the basic push-on friction fit with no moving
parts and the v-shaped spring clips, which are readily found in any
homewares department for under $3 a pack. Many are made from
plastic in a variety of colors, as well as the traditional pale
bleached smooth wood _ made from maple, white birch, oak and pine.
</P>
<P>
   Plastic clothespins were actually made as early as the 1940s,
when red was the color of choice, making them easy to find when
dropped in the grass. Molded acrylic clothespins in sky blue,
cherry red, avocado and mauve were also popular in the 1940s and
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   The metal used for spring-clip pins, if it rusts, can leave
unslightly marks on clothing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th century, clothespins were also called clothes pegs.
Some were made of carved walrus or whale bone with simple beading
or rings carved at the neck and bottom with the familiar ball top.
Some were slender in size, while others were fat with rubber pads
for gripping carpets and such without leaving an imprint.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 19th century, clothespins also were carved by hand,
from a single piece of wood with no iron nails to keep them from
splitting. Some of these may have featured a carved decoration or
initials. Such pins were often said to be a type of love token and
are valued today at between $30 and $45.

ABORTION CLINIC VOLUNTEERS DEFY VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL DeMARE  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ Their job is simple _ they stand in front of
a Planned Parenthood clinic and wait.
</P>
<P>
   When a car pulls up, they spring into action, hurrying to meet
the vehicle and accompany the patient into the building.
</P>
<P>
   They are Planned Parenthood escorts, volunteers available to
whisk patients past the gauntlet of demonstrators outside clinics.
</P>
<P>
   With violent episodes happening more frequently against doctors
who perform abortions, the job of an escort has become more
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Dr. Barnett Slepian, an obstetrician/gynecologist
who performed abortions, was shot dead at his home outside of
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The incident has resulted in an increased number of potential
volunteers at places like the Upper Hudson Planned Parenthood in
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since last weekend, we have seen an increase in the numbers
who want to be escorts,'' people who said ``they were outraged or
upset about what happened,'' Upper Hudson spokeswoman Blue Carreker
said.
</P>
<P>
   The callers said they had ``to make this commitment,'' Carreker
said. ``Some had been escorting before but had stopped. Some are
new.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of women's health organizations from across New York
told a news conference Thursday that the state needed to take
strong action to curb anti-abortion violence.
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Slepian demonstrates the capacity for violence of
some abortion opponents and the need to better protect patients and
workers at women's clinics in New York, the coalition of womens
groups said. Representatives of Family Planning Advocates, Planned
Parenthood of New York City and other groups called on the state
Senate to drop its longstanding opposition to a bill criminalizing
the barring of access to health care facilities where abortions are
performed.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, five escorts stood outside the Planned
Parenthood Health Services of Northeastern New York building in
Schenectady. Alongside the curb, a dozen protesters sang hymns,
chanted but mainly prayed clutching rosary beads and prayer books.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters show up ``on days they know we are performing
surgeries,'' said Linda Scharf, spokeswoman for the Schenectady
clinic. There's been no measurable impact on potential escorts
since the Slepian shooting, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators typically arrive shortly before 9 a.m. and stay
about an hour. They then retreat to their storefront building
directly across from the two-story brick Planned Parenthood
building, which has bullet-resistant glass in its front windows.
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's protest, none of the demonstrators wanted to
discuss their activities. A leader of the demonstrators who said he
was a Roman Catholic priest but declined to give his name. He
called the gathering ``a prayer group'' that hands out
anti-abortion literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every person coming to Planned Parenthood is approached by
protesters who want to give them literature,'' Scharf said. The
escorts are on hand ``to support their access. We don't want
someone frightened away.''
</P>
<P>
   She said fewer than 10 percent of the clinic's services are
abortion-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want someone frightened away from getting a pap
smear,'' she said.

   A system designed to detect gravitational waves from black holes
could soon be a surfer's best friend. Researchers at the University
of Western Australia, near Perth, say devices used in their
experiments to cut out vibrations could measure the height of waves
at sea.
</P>
<P>
   As waves head toward land, they interact with the rising
seafloor, creating tiny _ but proportional _ seismic waves, which
travel inland.
</P>
<P>
   In a test reported in Measurement Science and Technology (vol.
9, p. 1772), the UWA team measured these seismic waves on their
vibration isolator from 10 kilometers inland.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed a 92 percent agreement with wave data from a
buoy that was 40 kilometers out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Vibration isolators are used under delicate equipment in
experiments where readings would be ruined by shaking _ whether
caused by footsteps or a distant earthquake _ and are designed to
keep equipment still.
</P>
<P>
   UWA's vibration isolator is made from aluminum, and has a
30-centimeter long horizontal plate suspended from a frame by
flexible titanium hinges.
</P>
<P>
   The hinges enable the plate to remain still to about one tenth
of a nanometer when the frame is shaken. The seismic waves cause
the frame to move by a few micrometers, and an optical sensor
detects the relative motion between frame and plate. This
difference is directly proportional to the wave height.
</P>
<P>
   UWA's David Blair suggests that the devices ``could create a
system to image the ocean waves coming in all round the coast.'' He
also plans a smaller version for surfers. &QL;

ARE BEYOND HOPE 
</HEADLINE>
   RAIN FORESTS By FRED PEARCE  
 Copyright 1998 New Scientist  
 (Distributed by New York Times Syndicate)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Attempts to save most of the world's tropical rain forests are
doomed to failure and should probably be abandoned. Pressure from
farmers and loggers has meant that much of the rain forest is
already beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   This is the claim of a group of scientists who have mapped
tropical deforestation ``hot spots'' for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   `aThe pressures to remove the forests are too great to be
stopped, especially in places like Snutheast Asia,'' says Frederic
Achard of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in Ispra,
Italq, who coordinated the study. The team argues that
conservatiojists should concentrate on preserving the few areas
that are not yet under pressure, ``what one might call cool
spots.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was published this month, comes from the
research center's Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation by
Satellite, or TREES, project, which monitors deforestation in
detail from space. TREES called in 12 leading experts in tropical
forests to identify on the ground where it should focus its remote
sensing satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusions on their selected areas were dire. They claim
there is no hope of stopping deforestation by logging companies and
farmers in major rain forest regions such as Indonesia or much of
the Brazilian Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little we can do to change the politics of these
countries,'' Achard says. Parts of the rain forests of the central
Amazon Basin, Congo and New Guinea might be saved, however, and
priority should be given to identifying and protecting areas of
high biodiversity in these zones.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who helped compile the report was Tim
Whitmore, a forestry scientist at the University of Cambridge. ``We
used our collective personal knowledge of where deforestation was
happening to compile these maps,'' he says. And he agrees with the
pessimistic conclusion. ``Southeast Asia has had it. There is
little old-growth forest left there anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He named the Indonesian island of Sumatra as the hottest of the
deforestation hot spots. An island twice the size of Britain, it
has lost virtually all its lowland forests in just 25 years, along
with the animals that lived in them. A similar situation is
developing in Kalimantan, says the report. And one of the last
forested areas, the ``golden triangle'' along the Burmese-Thai
border, is now threatened by Chinese plans to open up access to its
Yunnan province by building road and rail links to the Bay of
Bengal.
</P>
<P>
   The team found that the driving forces behind deforestation
differed between regions. In Southeast Asia, most of the land is
grabbed for oil palm, coffee, rubber or commercial forest
plantations. In the Amazon, cattle farmers clear the forest for
pastures while in central Africa logging companies often dominate. &QL;

   RAIN FORESTS By FRED PEARCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Attempts to save most of the world's tropical rain forests are
doomed to failure and should probably be abandoned. Pressure from
farmers and loggers has meant that much of the rain forest is
already beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   This is the claim of a group of scientists who have mapped
tropical deforestation ``hot spots'' for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressures to remove the forests are too great to be
stopped, especially in places like Southeast Asia,'' says Frederic
Achard of the European Commission's Joint Research Centre in Ispra,
Italy, who coordinated the study. The team argues that
conservationists should concentrate on preserving the few areas
that are not yet under pressure, ``what one might call cool
spots.''
</P>
<P>
   The report, which was published this month, comes from the
research center's Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation by
Satellite, or TREES, project, which monitors deforestation in
detail from space. TREES called in 12 leading experts in tropical
forests to identify on the ground where it should focus its remote
sensing satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Their conclusions on their selected areas were dire. They claim
there is no hope of stopping deforestation by logging companies and
farmers in major rain forest regions such as Indonesia or much of
the Brazilian Amazon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is very little we can do to change the politics of these
countries,'' Achard says. Parts of the rain forests of the central
Amazon Basin, Congo and New Guinea might be saved, however, and
priority should be given to identifying and protecting areas of
high biodiversity in these zones.
</P>
<P>
   One of the people who helped compile the report was Tim
Whitmore, a forestry scientist at the University of Cambridge. ``We
used our collective personal knowledge of where deforestation was
happening to compile these maps,'' he says. And he agrees with the
pessimistic conclusion. ``Southeast Asia has had it. There is
little old-growth forest left there anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He named the Indonesian island of Sumatra as the hottest of the
deforestation hot spots. An island twice the size of Britain, it
has lost virtually all its lowland forests in just 25 years, along
with the animals that lived in them. A similar situation is
developing in Kalimantan, says the report. And one of the last
forested areas, the ``golden triangle'' along the Burmese-Thai
border, is now threatened by Chinese plans to open up access to its
Yunnan province by building road and rail links to the Bay of
Bengal.
</P>
<P>
   The team found that the driving forces behind deforestation
differed between regions. In Southeast Asia, most of the land is
grabbed for oil palm, coffee, rubber or commercial forest
plantations. In the Amazon, cattle farmers clear the forest for
pastures while in central Africa logging companies often dominate. &QL;

AMERICAN BIOTECH GIANT FACING CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Monsanto, the American biotech giant, is facing an unprecedented
wave of criticism from within the industry. Many of Monsanto's
rivals say the company is largely to blame for a consumer backlash
that could cripple the prospects for genetically engineered food in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that consumer acceptance of engineered food has
collapsed in Europe since 1997, when it emerged that Monsanto's
herbicide-resistant Roundup Ready soya beans had been shipped to
Europe mixed with ordinary soya. Consumers interpreted the move as
a ploy to force transgenic soya down European throats.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto officials have always maintained that the decision not
to segregate was made by farmers and distributors, but they admit
to misjudging the mood in Europe. Monsanto was convinced that
smooth acceptance of transgenic soya in the Unites States would be
mirrored in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The entire industry is now having to deal with the consequences
of that miscalculation. Though wary of breaking a tradition of
solidarity against opponents of genetic engineering, other
companies are distancing themselves from Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a PR mountain to climb,'' says Willy de Greef, head of
regulatory and government affairs at Novartis Seeds in Basel,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a problem if the market leader has firmly set ideas
about how to do things, which others might not agree with,'' he
adds. ``An expensive failure can be made into an asset if you've
learnt from it, but Monsanto still has some learning to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeneca, the British-based biotechnology giant, also feels
aggrieved, not least because it won applause from consumer groups
in 1996 by labeling its tomato puree as containing genetically
modified tomatoes. ``It's a matter of respect for your customer,''
says Nigel Poole, head of regulatory affairs at Zeneca Plant
Science in Bracknell, Berkshire, England.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior figure in the industry, who asked to remain
anonymous, is more blunt, accusing Monsanto of ``arrogant
stupidity.'' He adds: ``The issue with Roundup Ready soya beans is
the elimination of choice. It's not about genetic engineering, it's
an issue of 'no one's going to tell me what to eat'.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are less willing to single out Monsanto for
criticism, but those contacted by New Scientist magazine agree that
the failure to segregate Roundup Ready soya was a setback. And the
problems didn't end there, say some industry sources: A
high-profile advertising campaign from Monsanto, designed to
reassure European consumers, has if anything hardened negative
public attitudes to agricultural biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're as fed up as some others with the Yankee-Doodle language
that comes to our consumers,'' says de Greef of Novartis.
</P>
<P>
   Even some U.S. companies, insulated from the worst effects of
the European storm, are concerned. Du Pont of Wilmington, Del., is
worried about the impact of Monsanto's stance on future launches of
its products in Europe. ``It may be more difficult now,'' says a
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to their own-brand products, many of Britain's
major retailers are telling their soya suppliers to order as much
material as possible from sources outside the United States _
mainly in Argentina and Brazil _ that are guaranteed unmodified.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazil last month approved commercial plantings of Roundup
Ready soya beans, and Monsanto aims to capture 20 percent of the
Brazilian market within three years.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto argues that the company is being singled out because it
is the market leader. ``We certainly didn't intend to drop other
companies in it,'' says Monsanto spokesman Dan Verakis. ``If people
think we started the controversy, we are certainly trying to
clarify it.'' &QL;

<P>
   Autism was believed to be solely a human condition,
characterized by a limited ability to communicate and a lack of
response to others. But it seems animals can be autistic too.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists have bred long-haired albino guinea pigs with the
same neurological abnormalities seen in some autistic people. With
these defects in the cerebellum, the part of the brain responsible
for coordination, the guinea pigs developed behavioral traits
typical of autistic patients.
</P>
<P>
   The team, from the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris,
the University of Rouen and New York Medical College, placed one
altered guinea pig _ known as GS _ in a cage with a normal one and
compared their behavior and social interaction, such as sniffing,
licking and mating attempts.
</P>
<P>
   They found that the GS guinea pigs were much less inclined to
interact with the other animals, and showed a reluctance to explore
or respond to their surroundings _ all behavior that can be found
in autistic children (European Journal of Neuroscience, vol. 10, p.
2677).

EVERY ONE OF US COMES FROM THE `IRREGULAR BIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Editor's note: Bill Tammeus recently addressed an annual dinner
sponsored by a Kansas City-area nonprofit agency that operates a
sheltered workshop and provides other services for mentally
retarded and developmentally disabled persons. His stepson is
employed at the workshop. This column is adapted from that talk.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In getting to know some of you in recent years and some of your
stories _ and really getting to know my stepson Chris, who is
employed at the sheltered workshop _ I have come to a new
understanding of what it means to be ``normal.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the term normal has come to mean something
elitist, something, well, perfect. But it is impossible to be
surrounded by groups of developmentally disabled people without
gaining a visceral understanding that disability is a normal part
of life, even if we are at a loss to explain why that is. The human
species is, in fact, defined by the rule that perfection is
abnormal. None of us is perfect. We all have come from the
irregular bin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This idea that aberration is part of the norm is easily seen if
we simply look at the collections of people we call families. If
normal means perfect or nearly so, are there any normal families?
Even one? Even in the White House? Of course not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once you get past the facade that most families erect to protect
themselves from embarrassment, you find all kinds of
out-of-the-ordinary conditions _ both horrifying and funny. Pain,
it turns out, is a normal part of life. There's no way to escape
it, though, of course, Americans spend a lot of time and money
trying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So if we understand that all of us wrestle with something, we
can acknowledge that for a certain percentage of us that something
will be developmental disabilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Association on Mental Retardation says that 2.5 to
3 percent of the general population has mental retardation. Based
on the 1990 census, that would mean 6.2 million to 7.5 million
people. That level of occurrence, by the way, means mental
retardation is 12 times more common than cerebral palsy and 100
times more common than total blindness. But if we know those
figures, we also know it's normal for such people to be in our
midst. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The figures on disability seem remarkable to people who've never
given the subject much thought. For instance, the Census Bureau
reports that some 54 million Americans _ about one in five _ say
they have some kind of disability. Some 26 million of them _ about
one in 10 _ say they have a severe disability. And about 9 million
people over the age of 14 have disabilities so severe they require
personal assistance to carry out everyday activities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My point is that it's normal to expect a certain percentage of
developmentally disabled people within any general population. And
if that's true, maybe our smug definition of what's normal and what
isn't needs to expand to include such people. And our way of
treating them needs to acknowledge the fact that, in reality, they
are us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's because in every way that matters in an eternal
perspective, my stepson is as ``normal'' as I am. People with
disabilities are like those of us without such problems in that
something out of the ordinary has happened to them, too. What's
happened to them is what's happened to us _ life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does the world understand it's normal to expect people with
disabilities to be part of our society? No. The stark and
disagreeable truth is that many people think of agencies like yours
as genetic janitors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so we must pool our resources to educate everyone and to
meet the needs of the special people your agency assists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If we don't help people grasp the notion that it's normal to
have people with disabilities in our society we risk creating
exactly what too often we've allowed to be created _ second-class
citizens. And that's a condition we simply cannot allow to become
normal. &QL;

 Color slides and black and white photos of Cate Blanchett in
``Elizabeth.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS 
 Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    She's the buzz of Hollywood: suddenly a front-runner for a best
actress Oscar for her stunning portrayal as England's Queen
Elizabeth I. It's a role that every actress in Britain would have
killed for.
 &HT;    But Australia's rising star Cate Blanchett has only one thing on
her mind: Getting home to Sydney with her husband of just over a
year Andrew Upton so they can spend Christmas with their families.
 &HT;    ``I have a very small family but Andrew's is enormous,'' she
said, ``so I'm hoping for a chaotic, loud, happy family
Christmas.''
 &HT;    The 28-year-old actress has already earned rave reviews for
portraying the troubled and naive English monarch in the film which
costars fellow Aussie Geoffrey Rush, Richard Attenborough, John
Gielgud, Joseph Fiennes (brother of English actor Ralph Fiennes)
and Christopher Eccleston.
 &HT;    Since finishing Elizabeth she has worked nonstop. She is just
finishing up ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' opposite Matt Damon and
Gwyneth Paltrow in Italy for ``English Patient'' director Anthony
Minghella, as well as ``Pushing Tin,'' a black comedy about air
traffic controllers with John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton. Both
films are due out in l999.
 &HT;    There follows a movie version of Oscar Wilde's play ``An Ideal
Husband'' and next March (Oscar time in Hollywood) she's returning
to Britain to appear on the London stage in David Hare's ``Plenty''
_ which was made into a movie in l985 with Meryl Streep and Sam
Neill, with direction by Australian Fred Schepisi.
 &HT;    Looking pale but beautiful after such a hectic work schedule and
sipping iced water in a Los Angeles hotel suite, Blanchett is
buoyed by all the talk of Oscar nominations. However she admits
that getting the role of Elizabeth was something of a coup.
 &HT;    Word was that she was going to be passed over because she was
not well known internationally, despite great reviews for l997's
``Oscar and Lucinda'' opposite Ralph Fiennes. Producers were
looking for someone more famous in Britain to star in a role about
a British monarch and so she had to do a screen test for Indian
director Shekhar Kapur.
 &HT;    The movie is a spectacular costume drama set in London in the
middle of the 16th century. Elizabeth, the daughter of Henry VIII
and Anne Boleyn, is imprisoned at 16 by her half-sister Mary, but
swept onto the throne and crowned Queen of England at 23. To
survive she must sort out the machiavellian agendas on the
battlefield, in the church and in her court. Her enemies, most of
them powerful men, would appear to have the advantage, but
Elizabeth deploys whatever means necessary to keep her crown.
 &HT;    ``The main thing about getting the part was that the director
had confidence in me,'' she recalls. ``He had seen me in a trailer
of 'Oscar and Lucinda' and thought I was right for the part.
 &HT;    ``I must admit though, I was flabbergasted to get 'Oscar and
Lucinda.' And then 'Elizabeth.' I asked myself how did I find the
courage to do it. But I plunge into something and when it's done
sit back and say, my God.''
 &HT;    Blanchett grew up in Melbourne and says in her early years she
didn't yearn to be an actress. She was just 10 when her Texan
father Bob, a flamboyant advertising man, died suddenly, leaving
her mother June, a teacher, to bring up her and two siblings.
 &HT;    ``I was so fortunate that my mother was remarkable and held
things together for us. She introduced me to acting when I was 12
when she took me to see a production of 'They Shoot Horses Don't
They?' I was smitten by it.''
 &HT;    Nonetheless she started out studying economics and fine arts.
``I failed miserably at the economics and so I became sort of the
black sheep of the family,'' she laughs.
 &HT;    Unlike many Aussie actors, Blanchett didn't get her start on
Aussie soaps but learned her trade at the National Institute of
Dramatic Art in Sydney where she won plaudits on the boards in
``The Tempest,'' ``Hamlet,'' ``The Seagull'' and David Mamet's
``Oleanna.'' Her first film splash was as Susan McCarthy in Bruce
Beresford's ``Paradise Road.''
 &HT;    Just as her international movie career was taking off in June
l997 she married boyfriend Upton in a ceremony in the Blue
Mountains in New South Wales. Their home is in a Sydney beach
suburb, in a non-movie-star house which they've seen very little
of.
 &HT;    ``When I made 'Elizabeth' I saw very little daylight and had
virtually no social life,'' she says. ``I wore elaborate costumes
and very tight corsets. I had my eyebrows bleached, my eyelashes
bleached, my hairline shaved, half my hair dyed white _ so I didn't
get out much looking like that.''
 &HT;    She says her husband understands the demands her career makes on
her _ professionally and personally. ``I am very fortunate to have
a partner who is incredibly supportive of me.''
 &HT;    However she does admit she is a little torn between the demands
of a burgeoning career which could take her to the very top and her
desire to enjoy a normal life with her husband out of the
limelight.
 &HT;    For instance there's the question of a family _ to start one or
not. ``I think children are one of the few miracles left,'' she
says carefully.

   QUESTION: Here I am at age 28 with a boyfriend who says I
shouldn't get mad at him when he hollers because he grew up in a
family where everybody screamed at each other. He says his family
is more dysfunctional than mine. _ Hollywood, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Jeez! Dueling dysfunctions? I don't think you want to
go there and I definitely don't. Everybody's family _ and I do mean
everybody's _ is dysfunctional. I'm not sure where this national
obsession with blame began, but it's past time to put the
family-as-doomed-destiny thing to rest. We choose how we behave. If
you're unhappy about your boyfriend's behavior, talk with him about
it. Don't let him duck the issue by invoking the Ghost of Family
Past. The dysfunctional family blues are a variation of ``Woe is
me.'' Let's all repeat together: ``I'm in charge of my own life.
I'm responsible. I can function.''
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I feel guilty all the time. I don't spend enough time
with my kids. My wife complains that I'm cold and indifferent. My
mother, recently widowed, needs me. I'm in the really competitive
field of sales, so my free time is limited, but I try to get in a
couple of workouts each week because my dad had a bad ticker. I
can't please anyone, and when I find some time for myself, I feel
even worse. What should I do? _ Wheeling, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: First, take a deep breath here and relax. Guilt is
feeling good about feeling bad, and it's a colossal waste of time.
You've got a lot on your plate. Feeling tired and under the gun all
the time doesn't help anyone. Adding a huge dollop of guilt will
only sap more time and energy.
</P>
<P>
   Sort through your priorities and get better at scheduling. If
you block out specific time to spend with your kids and schedule
private time for you and your wife to keep the spark alive, your
loved ones won't feel they have to beg for your attention. Make
sure you budget some time for yourself _ even if that means going
grocery shopping after work without the kids.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: I'm afraid to let anyone get close to me because I've
been hurt too often. I know the right person will be patient. But
at 44, I've sure kissed a lot of frogs while looking for that
handsome, understanding prince. I'm really a good person. Why am I
still alone? _ Fort Pierce, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: Everyone over 16 feels at some point that someone's
done 'em wrong and they're probably right. But this is the time to
take some emotional risks, not wallow in self-pity. I'm not
suggesting you march down to the harbor and pick up the first
sailor you meet. I am suggesting that it's time to get out of your
own way.
</P>
<P>
   Try the ``life is a daring risk or it's nothing at all''
blueprint for a month or two. Come out of your shell a bit. This
may mean taking tango lessons or flirting at the bus stop or
knocking that chip off your shoulder. You're making all those
inattentive men the bad guys. If you're a bristly ball of anger,
everyone will stay away.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My boyfriend and I have been living together for a
year, and I want to get married. I work for him because he's trying
to get his business off the ground. We're living in his house,
which I'm helping to fix up. I love him, but I'm upset because but
every time I bring up the ``m'' word, he changes the subject. _
Stockton, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: You write ``welcome'' on your forehead and then you're
surprised when he steps on your face. Your boyfriend isn't
exploiting you. YOU are exploiting you.
</P>
<P>
   If you want your boyfriend to marry you, set a deadline and tell
him about it. If he refuses, move out and get on with your life. No
tears or cajolery. And don't even think about ``accidentally''
getting pregnant. If he wants to spend the rest of his life with
you, give him the opportunity to sort it out. If not, volunteer
with Habitat for Humanity to fix up someone else's home.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTION: My parents divorced 16 years ago when I was 3. I
always thought Dad abandoned us. I've recently gotten in touch with
him and he says Mom and her parents said they'd sic the law on him
if he didn't clear out. I don't know who's telling the truth and
who's lying. _ Salem, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   DR. JOY: A long time ago somebody said there are three sides to
every story: my side, your side and the truth. I think this person
was overly optimistic. Most of us can figure out several
``sensible'' versions to support our perspective.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to worry if one of your folks is lying. They
could both be telling the truth -- THEIR version of the truth. If
you look for your own version and leave them to do the same, you
can save a whole lot of wear and tear on your head, heart and
internal organs.

LUNGREN CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a way, I almost feel sorry for Dan Lungren.
If he were a free man _ in other words, not a politician running
for governor of California _ he could stand up whenever he felt
like it and do what has come so naturally to him for decades:
Unequivocally condemn abortion.
</P>
<P>
   With all the passion and zeal that public opinion polls allow
him to show on another issue _ the death penalty _ he could shout
out what he says he has always believed, that elective abortion is
immoral and that _ if it were in his power _ it would become
illegal tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren is not a free man. He deeply wants to become
governor. As much as anything though _ and despite Lungren's hopes
that the issue will just go away _ abortion remains one of his
trickiest obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of Californians still believes, as Lungren's
Democratic opponent, Gray Davis, does, that a woman has a right to
choose what does or does not occur in her own womb. That majority
includes some 65 to 70 percent of Republican women. So, the
attorney general (no doubt on the advice of battle-hardened
campaign consultants) has softened his lifelong, absolutist
anti-abortion rhetoric and narrowed his focus to an almost absurd
degree.
</P>
<P>
   The longer Lungren talks, the more he and his wife explain in
campaign ads that it's their ``deeply held religious and moral
convictions'' that make them anti-choice, the more the veteran
champion of the ``unborn'' comes off as disingenuous and a bit of a
sellout.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's bending and twisting started early this year when he
began to paint his anti-abortion views as inconsequential in the
big scheme of things. It really doesn't matter what his
``personal'' feelings are about abortion, he said, because the law
that legalized abortion _ Roe vs. Wade _ is a federal statute and
thus out of the domain of a state governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the state domain, Lungren chose instead to focus on a couple
of the most inflammatory and least understood aspects of abortion
law. As governor, he said, all he plans to do about abortion is to
resurrect California's overturned parental consent law and keep
taxpayers from financing abortions for the poor _ especially
late-term or partial-birth abortions.
</P>
<P>
   As a ``pro-life'' package for 1998, how reasonable and
mainstream can you get, right? Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren insults even minimal intelligence with his argument that
governors are like ineffectual functionaries with their hands tied
when it comes to abortion law.
</P>
<P>
   In nearly every state in this country, legislators and many
governors are working hard to limit a woman's control over her own
reproductive system. Dozens already have succeeded. In most states,
the reproductive rights of poor women have been so severely
curtailed, Roe vs. Wade does not exist for them.
</P>
<P>
   And how about the political momentum that governors and other
high-ranking state officials can and do affect outside the
statehouse? Was the $50,000 in leftover campaign funds that Matt
Fong _ a mere state treasurer _ donated to the far right Family
Values Coalition an ineffectual trifle? You can buy some quality
radio time or print up a lot of photos of fetuses in formaldahyde
with $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   At an anti-abortion rally, how much is a ``pro-life'' governor's
appearance worth? What if the rally is during a national convention
where everyone vows to support only anti-abortion candidates and to
work to get Roe vs. Wade overturned?
</P>
<P>
   Pushed into a defensive corner by the Davis campaign, Lungren
and his wife, Bobbi, insist that their Roman Catholicism demands
they be anti-choice. This may be the most grotesque of all of
Lungren's bending and twisting.
</P>
<P>
   If your Catholicism won't allow you to support legal abortion,
it won't allow you to be the head cheerleader for state-sanctioned
executions. Them's the rules. Yet, in answer to this obvious
contradiction in his own Catholic credo, Lungren distinguishes
between killing fetuses and convicts.
</P>
<P>
   This past spring he said: ``If you don't understand the
difference between innocent life and non-innocent life, then you
have missed a fundamental proposition of not only the teachings of
the Catholic Church, but the fundamentals of American democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Dan, but you're wrong about the Catholic Church. It
teaches redemption of the sinner along with protection of the
unborn. One of its most fundamental propositions is that all human
life is sacred, innocent or on death row.
</P>
<P>
   His desire to be governor makes Lungren want a lot of things
both ways. Too bad he can't have them.

BEWARE OF LAST-MINUTE POLLS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ If history is any guide, it'll happen before
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   We're in the home stretch of the general election. All over
America, candidates for public office are sweating. They're
exhausted, stressed out, whipped up to a state of towering
paranoia.
</P>
<P>
   The ones who are ahead are wondering what horrible dirty trick
their opponents might pull to beat them in the campaign's closing
days. The ones who are behind are wondering what horrible dirty
trick they might be able to pull to salvage their candidacies.
Meanwhile, you and I probably will be sitting home, watching
television. For a number of us, the phone will ring. On the other
end of the line will be somebody who identifies himself or herself
as a pollster. Sorry to bother you, the pollster will say; just a
few questions, please.
</P>
<P>
   At this late date in the political season, any pollster who
calls probably will be conducting what politicians call a ``push
poll.'' That's a proven technique for turning around an election at
the last minute. It works like this:
</P>
<P>
   The pollster will ask you which candidate you like in a
particular race. If you say ``Jones,'' the pollster will ask you if
you're for that candidate strongly or weakly. If you respond that
you're behind Jones in a big way, then the pollster will remind you
to get out to vote on Tuesday. You might even be asked if you need
a ride.
</P>
<P>
   If you say that you're for Jones, but only as the less loathsome
of two repelling choices, the pollster will ask you if your support
would be more vigorous if you knew that Jones loves both dogs and
cats, is kind to small children and old people, holds the
Congressional Medal of Honor and is a candidate for next year's
Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   In a push poll, things get really interesting if you say that
you're not for Jones but for his opponent, Smith. If you tell the
pollster that you're for Smith in a big way, and that nothing could
change your mind, then the pollster reminds you that election day
will be Dec. 3 and points out that plane fares are down now, so you
would be foolish not to take an immediate trip to see the Grand
Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   If you say that you're for Smith but that you'll have to hold
your nose when you vote for him, then the pollster will ask if
you're aware that Smith goes out of his way to kick cats and small
dogs, is routinely nasty to children and old people, hasn't paid a
bill on time in 17 years and wants to repeal all those silly laws
that criminalize sexual contact between adults and kids.
</P>
<P>
   If any of this happens this weekend, then you can figure that
Jones is paying for this poll. What the pollster is doing is
``pushing'' you toward a particular candidate.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy was employed with great effectiveness in suburban
Albany last year in a race for Rensselaer County executive. Neither
candidate was wildly popular with voters _ not incumbent Republican
Henry Zwack, and not county legislator Marilyn Douglas, his
Democratic challenger. Each had ``high negatives.'' Many of their
supporters were of the nose-holding variety.
</P>
<P>
   In races like that _ close contests in which an opponent's
support is only lukewarm _ politicians can employ a last-minute
push poll to turn around the election. That's what Zwack did, and
he managed to beat Douglas by a slim margin.
</P>
<P>
   So, if a pollster calls you this weekend, you should know that
the call probably isn't really about finding out what you think.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it's about pushing you to think the way a particular
candidate wants you to think before Tuesday rolls around.
</P>
<P>

THE LEGACY OF JOHN GLENN'S MISSION

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    John Glenn's historic journey into orbit at the age of 77 has
returned some of the luster to a space program sorely in need of a
little excitement. Thirty-six years after becoming the first
American to orbit the earth, Glenn is doing it again: he will
boldly go where no septuagenarian has gone before.
 &HT;    The mission has clearly raised NASA's profile at a time when it
needs to foster public support for projects like the International
Space Station.
 &HT;    Critics have taken notice, describing Glenn's flight on the
space shuttle Discovery as an obvious publicity ploy. But both
Glenn and the space agency insist that his participation in the
mission will yield scientific benefits that could improve our
understanding of the aging process.
 &HT;    The ``aging studies'' planned for the mission are actually a
series of tests that will examine how Glenn's body responds to the
rigors of space flight. Multiple organ systems will be analyzed --
evaluating everything from the electrical activity of his heart to
the status of his immune system -- to see if an ``old'' body reacts
differently than a younger one.
 &HT;    If Glenn's body shows a distinctive response, scientists hope to
discover clues that could shed light on how the body ages.
 &HT;    ``We would need to ask why aging has changed the response
pattern,'' explains Dr. Ronald White, associate director of the
National Space Biomedical Research Institute. Additional studies
would then have to be performed to explore this question.
 &HT;    But even if Glenn reacts differently than younger astronauts, no
reliable conclusions can be drawn from a study sample consisting of
only one person. White acknowledges this limitation, but he notes
that there are other approaches we could take to learn about the
aging process. This is because space travel seems to mimic the
aging process in some unexpected ways.
 &HT;    For reasons that remain unclear, space travel induces a series
of ailments surprisingly similar to some of the classic problems of
old age. For instance, both astronauts and the elderly often
experience impaired motor coordination, sleep disturbances and the
loss of muscle mass and bone. Both groups also tend to experience
problems with balance and impaired immune function.
 &HT;    As White points out, these parallels could prove useful in
helping us understand the mysteries of aging. By searching for the
cause of the problems seen in astronauts, we might learn more about
similar problems faced by the geriatric population.
 &HT;    And if the underlying mechanism for these changes is similar in
both groups, then space could serve as a unique ``laboratory'' for
the study of aging -- in effect, a space lab would accelerate
certain age-related changes, making them easier to study.
 &HT;    Though space travelers and the elderly seem to share certain
physical characteristics, there is one key difference between the
two groups: the astronauts appear to recover fully on their return
to earth. This difference might be exploited to our advantage as
well.
 &HT;    By studying how astronauts recover after space travel, we might
learn how to help the elderly recover in a similar fashion. Of
course, all of this depends on a direct link between
``age-related'' and ``space-related'' physical problems -- if the
problems of the elderly turned out to be significantly different
from the problems seen in astronauts, then space research would
probably be of limited value to the aging population.
 &HT;    This is why the aging studies planned for the Discovery flight
may yield little useful information for older Americans. Moreover,
strictly speaking, they aren't really ``aging studies'' -- they're
simply a series of tests on a single 77-year-old man to see how his
body reacts to the extraterrestrial environment. While we may learn
something about the effects of space flight on John Glenn, it seems
unlikely that we'll learn much about the aging process itself.
 &HT;    So is the Discovery mission a publicity maneuver or a geriatric
research expedition?
 &HT;    It's probably a little of both. NASA certainly has gained
enormous publicity from Glenn's participation, and his research
will probably tell us more about the elderly in space than the
elderly on the ground.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, as White observes, ``The senator has been able to
inspire hope in the elderly that they can still do extraordinary
things.''
 &HT;    In the end, this may be the most important legacy of the
Discovery mission. At the very least, Glenn's journey into space
will inspire an aging population with the knowledge that it's never
too late to do the impossible, and that the definition of ``growing
old'' is fluid indeed.

learn how to help the elderly recover in a similar fashion. Of
course, all of this depends on a direct link between
``age-related'' and ``space-related'' physical problems -- if the
problems of the elderly turned out to be significantly different
from the problems seen in astronauts, then space research would
probably be of limited value to the aging population.
 &HT;    This is why the aging studies planned for the Discovery flight
may yield little useful information for older Americans. Moreover,
strictly speaking, they aren't really ``aging studies'' -- they're
simply a series of tests on a single 77-year-old man to see how his
body reacts to the extraterrestrial environment. While we may learn
something about the effects of space flight on John Glenn, it seems
unlikely that we'll learn much about the aging process itself.
 &HT;    So is the Discovery mission a publicity maneuver or a geriatric
research expedition?
 &HT;    It's probably a little of both. NASA certainly has gained
enormous publicity from Glenn's participation, and his research
will probably tell us more about the elderly in space than the
elderly on the ground.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, as White observes, ``The senator has been able to
inspire hope in the elderly that they can still do extraordinary
things.''
 &HT;    In the end, this may be the most important legacy of the
Discovery mission. At the very least, Glenn's journey into space
will inspire an aging population with the knowledge that it's never
too late to do the impossible, and that the definition of ``growing
old'' is fluid indeed.

EVERY ONE OF US COMES FROM THE `IRREGULAR BIN' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Editor's note: Bill Tammeus recently addressed an annual dinner
sponsored by a Kansas City-area nonprofit agency that operates a
sheltered workshop and provides other services for mentally
retarded and developmentally disabled persons. His stepson is
employed at the workshop. This column is adapted from that talk.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In getting to know some of you in recent years and some of your
stories _ and really getting to know my stepson Chris, who is
employed at the sheltered workshop _ I have come to a new
understanding of what it means to be ``normal.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the term normal has come to mean something
elitist, something, well, perfect. But it is impossible to be
surrounded by groups of developmentally disabled people without
gaining a visceral understanding that disability is a normal part
of life, even if we are at a loss to explain why that is. The human
species is, in fact, defined by the rule that perfection is
abnormal. None of us is perfect. We all have come from the
irregular bin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This idea that aberration is part of the norm is easily seen if
we simply look at the collections of people we call families. If
normal means perfect or nearly so, are there any normal families?
Even one? Even in the White House? Of course not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once you get past the facade that most families erect to protect
themselves from embarrassment, you find all kinds of
out-of-the-ordinary conditions _ both horrifying and funny. Pain,
it turns out, is a normal part of life. There's no way to escape
it, though, of course, Americans spend a lot of time and money
trying. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So if we understand that all of us wrestle with something, we
can acknowledge that for a certain percentage of us that something
will be developmental disabilities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The American Association on Mental Retardation says that 2.5 to
3 percent of the general population has mental retardation. Based
on the 1990 census, that would mean 6.2 million to 7.5 million
people. That level of occurrence, by the way, means mental
retardation is 12 times more common than cerebral palsy and 100
times more common than total blindness. But if we know those
figures, we also know it's normal for such people to be in our
midst. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The figures on disability seem remarkable to people who've never
given the subject much thought. For instance, the Census Bureau
reports that some 54 million Americans _ about one in five _ say
they have some kind of disability. Some 26 million of them _ about
one in 10 _ say they have a severe disability. And about 9 million
people over the age of 14 have disabilities so severe they require
personal assistance to carry out everyday activities. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   My point is that it's normal to expect a certain percentage of
developmentally disabled people within any general population. And
if that's true, maybe our smug definition of what's normal and what
isn't needs to expand to include such people. And our way of
treating them needs to acknowledge the fact that, in reality, they
are us. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's because in every way that matters in an eternal
perspective, my stepson is as ``normal'' as I am. People with
disabilities are like those of us without such problems in that
something out of the ordinary has happened to them, too. What's
happened to them is what's happened to us _ life. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Does the world understand it's normal to expect people with
disabilities to be part of our society? No. The stark and
disagreeable truth is that many people think of agencies like yours
as genetic janitors. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so we must pool our resources to educate everyone and to
meet the needs of the special people your agency assists. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If we don't help people grasp the notion that it's normal to
have people with disabilities in our society we risk creating
exactly what too often we've allowed to be created _ second-class
citizens. And that's a condition we simply cannot allow to become
normal. &QL;

SAN FRANCISCO SEEKS TO SHORE UP JAPANESE TOURISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID ARMSTRONG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Long a favored destination for traditionally
free-spending Japanese tourists, San Francisco faces increasing
pressure to hold onto this lucrative trade.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of rival destinations like Las Vegas and the stagnant
Japanese economy, which makes travel more expensive for Japanese
consumers, are the main culprits.
</P>
<P>
   The drain of Japanese visitors is troubling for a city whose No.
1 revenue producer is tourism, at nearly $4 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese are neck and neck with the Germans as our leading
overseas visitors,'' said David Bratton, research manager for the
San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau, which targets
Japanese tourists with a Japanese-language World Wide Web site, a
newsletter and special promotions.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to Bratton, 370,000 Japanese tourists
visited the city, spending a mean of 3.7 nights here. Japanese
tourists are particularly lucrative for hoteliers, as 90.6 percent
stayed in hotels in San Francisco _ a higher portion than any other
nationality except Italians, at 90.7 percent. At $160.24 per person
per day, Japanese also spent more money than other foreign tourists
_ way ahead of the runner-up French, who spent $130 per person per
day.
</P>
<P>
   No one is pushing the panic button, but Japanese tourism is
slipping, tourism officials and merchants say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect that 1998 will see it off about 15 percent,'' said
Deborah Reinow, the vice president for tourism at the Convention
and Visitors Bureau. The weak Japanese yen and growing strength of
the promotions in Vegas are the reasons why, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, huge casinos have attracted more tourists
to Las Vegas. About 16,000 hotel rooms will be added over the next
year in the Nevada city, where the average daily hotel room rate is
$73; in San Francisco, it's $140.
</P>
<P>
   ``Las Vegas is definitely in the picture,'' Reinow said.
``They've been grabbing market share. The Japanese are very
interested in big attractions. It doesn't cost anything to get in
the lobby, and there are pirate ships going everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is transportation. More airlines fly
between Japanese cities and Los Angeles than to San Francisco.
Moreover, small Asian carriers such as Malaysian Airways offer
cheaper round-trip flights to Los Angeles International than major
carriers do to the San Francisco airport.
</P>
<P>
   That could change. All Nippon Airways is starting a daily direct
flight between Tokyo's Narita airport and San Francisco on Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   One big draw San Francisco still has is shopping, and prices on
many luxury goods are better than in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At the Chanel Boutique on Maiden Lane, director Michael Moser
said the Japanese are still coming, albeit not quite as often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in the same situation as any other luxury goods
retailer,'' Moser said. ``We have noticed a change. It's down.
Retailers are developing their local clientele.''
</P>
<P>
   The Convention and Visitors Bureau is taking steps to lure
Japanese visitors. In addition to the Web site and newsletter, the
city is being billed in Japan as the wine and food capital of the
United States, Reinow said.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau also is working to book San Francisco chefs on the
popular Japanese television show ``The Iron Chef.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japanese really value their travel,'' Reinow said. ``It's
a big part of their lives.''

JAPAN MAY BE SLIPPING OUT OF THE FIRST DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Two developments this week suggest that Japan, the
world's second largest economy since the 1970s, may be slipping
down the ladder.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the respected inter-governmental Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris predicted that the
Japanese economy will shrink by more than 2.5 percent this year and
could go on falling in 1999 and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Japan has been in a heavy slump for the past five years.
However, this is the first time it has been suggested that the
country's recession, largely brought on by property speculation and
a resultant banking collapse, is likely to have long-term
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's woes were further underlined by a government
announcement that about half of the 80 Japanese banks with overseas
operations will be asked within the next few months to close their
foreign branches.
</P>
<P>
   The move forms part of a restructuring of the badly battered
banking system. Its huge losses _ the greatest in history _ have
come fully to light only within the last month. Under the
government's plan, viable financial institutions will be
strengthened while others will be allowed to go to the wall without
the kind of rescue with public money that Japanese officials have
usually ordered in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp reduction in the number of branch banks in cities like
New York, London and Frankfurt will mark the end of an era. The
omnipresent, big-spending Japanese market dealers and business
executives with their retinue of assistants who symbolized Japan's
meteoric rise will be no more _ or at least their number will be
severely cut.
</P>
<P>
   This development has more than a picturesque side to it. The
Japanese were usually prepared to take bigger risks and invest
larger sums in western enterprises than were many of their rivals.
Often, the risks were ill-judged. Some of Japan's problems result
from the impetuosity of its investors and their lack of grasp of
western business practices. But they will be missed in many
deal-making quarters.
</P>
<P>
   If Japan does continue to slip, the United States will be the
foreign nation most concerned. Over the years, America has seen the
Japanese as rivals and, sometimes, a menace. Yet to a large extent,
U.S. economic policy has been built on the premise that Washington
and Tokyo were the two essential pillars of world trade. If all was
well with them, a stable economic future would be assured.
</P>
<P>
   Now, one of these pillars is cracking under the strain and no
one can be as confident as before about what the future holds.

GALANT STACKS UP TO MIDSIZE COMPETITION
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by CARS-GLANCE) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mitsubishi, one of the lesser-known Japanese automakers, never
has been a big player in the U.S. market, particularly in the
popular midsize-sedan class.
</P>
<P>
   But the Galant has been completely restyled for 1999 in an
attempt to challenge the market-leading Toyota Camry and Honda
Accord.
</P>
<P>
   I don't expect the Galant to overtake either one of those giants
anytime soon, but the new Galant is nevertheless a capable
competitor and an outstanding value when compared with the Japanese
and American midsize sedan offerings.
</P>
<P>
   For $17,990 (plus $435 transportation), consumers can buy the
fully equipped Galant ES model, which comes with everything you
would find on Camry or Accord models that cost at least a couple of
thousand dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   And even at this price, there are features that ordinarily are
found only on luxury cars _ such as headlights that stay on for 30
seconds after you leave the vehicle; power windows that will
operate up to 30 seconds after the ignition is turned off;
woodgrain door and dash trim; and a unique feature that lowers the
high beams and deactivates the fog lamps when the lights are first
turned on, so as not to blind oncoming drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the 1998 Galant ES, the slightly larger '99 ES
costs $450 less but adds such amenities as fog lamps,
leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote keyless entry, dual
illuminated visor vanity mirrors and a trunk cargo net.
</P>
<P>
   Included are air-conditioning, power windows/mirrors/door locks,
premium cloth seats, an AM/FM/cassette stereo with four speakers,
cruise control, rear defroster and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   For this price, the Galant comes with the base 2.4-liter,
16-valve four-cylinder engine, rated at 145 horsepower and 155
foot-pounds of torque. This is the same engine used in the previous
Galant, although retuned to boost power slightly.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of power here; don't worry that it's just a
four-cylinder engine. I drove the car for a couple of days before
opening the hood, and until that time, I thought I was driving the
optional V-6.
</P>
<P>
   For $2,000 more you can get the ES V-6 model, which adds a key
safety feature: four-wheel antilock disc brakes. This package also
gets 16-inch wheels instead of the 15-inch wheels in the
four-cylinder version.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first time Mitsubishi has offered a V-6 in the
Galant. Until now, you had to buy the premium Diamante sedan to get
a V-6. This 3.0-liter engine cranks out 195 horsepower and a hefty
205 foot-pounds of torque, more than any Japanese competitor except
the Accord V-6, which has 200 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   If you can afford it, the V-6 upgrade is worth the money just to
get the antilock brakes. But for pure value, you can't go wrong
with the four-cylinder engine. It's the second-most-powerful among
the Japanese midsize sedans with four-cylinder engines, including
the Mazda 626, Camry and Accord. Only the Nissan Altima, at 150
horsepower, is beefier.
</P>
<P>
   The V-6 engine isn't the only thing the new Galant has in common
with its more expensive Diamante sibling; the exterior styling is
similar, too. I think the car looks more like a midsize Buick than
a Japanese car, a great compliment. The ride is so smooth and the
interior so comfortable that you can easily imagine yourself in a
Buick _ even with the four-cylinder engine.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi is taking a real chance providing a car that comes so
close to the Diamante but costs thousands less. The lowest-priced
Diamante is nearly $28,000. Still, Toyota has done the same thing,
patterning the Camry after the $30,000-plus Lexus ES 300. For the
consumer, this means you can buy what is essentially a luxury car
for about $10,000 less than you would pay to get a vehicle with the
luxury name. What a value!
</P>
<P>
   Like Honda, Mazda, Nissan and Toyota, Mitsubishi builds its
midsize sedans in the United States to help keep costs down and
convince buyers that they really are buying an American car.
</P>
<P>
   Our test car came with Mitsubishi's outstanding four-speed
automatic transmission, which has a computer brain that
automatically sets the shift points to match the operator's driving
style, and also controls shifting on hills to eliminate annoying,
unnecessary up- and downshifts.
</P>
<P>
   A five-speed manual transmission is available with the
four-cylinder models only, a concession to drivers who want more
control. It will help to get the optimum power out of the smaller
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Galant comes in four trim levels, beginning with the base DE at
$16,990. Even that model comes well-equipped _ including
air-conditioning, power windows and door locks, and most other
popular features. The only factory option is the front side air
bags, which are available on all Galant models.
</P>
<P>
   The ES and ES V-6 models come next, followed by the luxury LS at
$24,250, with almost every feature of the Diamante, including V-6
engine, leather interior, power driver's seat, 190-watt premium
stereo, and 16-inch alloy wheels.
</P>
<P>
   For $24,350, you can opt for the GTZ sport model, which comes
with the V-6, a rear-deck spoiler, sport-tuned suspension, leather
inside trim, and white-faced instruments. This is Mitsubishi's
``image'' model.
</P>
<P>
   A premium package on the ES raises its price to $20,500, while
the ES V-6 with premium package is priced at $21,990. The package
adds alloy wheels, side air bags, power glass sun roof, security
system, and a universal garage-door opener. In the four-cylinder
model, the package also includes the antilock brakes that are
standard with V-6 models.
</P>
<P>
   The interior is as roomy as those of the Camry and Mazda 626,
and roomier than that of the Altima. The Accord is slightly bigger:
4 more cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the previous Galant, this car is much roomier and
slightly larger outside, too.
</P>
<P>
   The only options on our test car were a trunk-mounted CD changer
($399) and a trunk mat ($75). Total price, including
transportation, was $18,899.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy with our four-cylinder automatic was EPA rated at
21 miles per gallon in the city and 28 mpg on the highway. For the
V-6, the numbers are just slightly lower: 20 mpg city/27 highway.
</P>
<P>
   The gas tank holds 16.3 gallons.

 By THOMAS MALLON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit, some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch. The
local record store, which may have been down the street from a
segregated hotel, had yet to stock a Beatles album.
 &HT;    Had the astronaut possessed a more powerful periscope than he
did, he still could not have picked out a St. Louis arch or a World
Trade Center to serve as a guidepost below. Not even Telstar, the
early communications satellite, was in the heavens to block his
path. The capsule's progress through the skies was relayed by
teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride. When it came time for his ticker-tape parade, there
was actual ticker tape to fling through the windows.
 &HT;    Today Glenn's return to space carries enormous public-relations
value to NASA _ this is the biggest manned-space story in years.
Nonetheless, Glenn sticks resolutely to medical-research terms in
discussing his mission's origin and meaning. And his wife Annie,
who will be watching him lift off, says that ``he's always wanted
to go'' back into space.
 &HT;    Yet after a three-decade political hiatus, what requalified him
was, oddly enough, getting old. Glenn, who has long served on the
Senate's Special Committee on Aging, was in his late 60s when he
sat down one weekend with a Merck manual on geriatrics and another
book called ``Space Physiology and Medicine,'' one of whose
authors, Dr. Arnauld E. Nicogossian, is now the associate
administrator of NASA's Division of Life and Microgravity Sciences
and Applications.
 &HT;    Looking through the manual, Glenn was struck by how many of the
natural processes of aging ``right here on Earth occur to the
younger people in their 30s, 40s and early 50s up there in space.''
 &HT;    The list included cardiovascular changes, immune-system
alterations and loss of bone density and muscle mass. Geriatric
research, he realized, was his ticket back into space. The next
step was to convince NASA to reserve him a seat.
 &HT;    As it happens, by the late 1980s, NASA researchers and
representatives of the National Institute on Aging (NIA) were also
discussing what they started calling ``parallel processes.''
 &HT;    Glenn made known his interest and kept pushing the issue in
dozens of discussions with gerontologists and NASA administrators.
Finally _ after what some say was considerable lobbying on his part
_ came this January's announcement of his place on shuttle mission
STS (Space Transportation System)-95.
 &HT;    Only when you walk behind Glenn, or fix your gaze on his right
eye, slightly more hooded than the left, can you credit the idea
that this man is closer to 80 than 70. It's a good thing he is too
_ or he might not have got his assignment.
 &HT;    Story Musgrave, who retired from the astronaut corps in 1997 at
age 62 after six shuttle flights, objected to the idea of Glenn's
going even before it was official: ``I stayed with the space
program and made it my career. He left 33 years ago and went into
politics.''
 &HT;    But from the gerontological point of view, Musgrave simply isn't
old enough for this mission. ``When we talked out at NIA about
this,'' Glenn says, ``they felt that the most productive assessment
will be done on somebody between 75 and 80. And I didn't suggest
that _ they suggested that. I'm the oldest used astronaut, I
guess.''
 &HT;    At the other end of the age spectrum, skeptical and even angry
postings started appearing right after the January announcement on
a Web site used by astronaut hopefuls: ``That's completely uncool
to let him jump in line like that for STS-95. Just because you can
fly a little ol' Mercury capsule around the Earth three times,
doesn't mean you should be bumped into a prime 10-day mission.
Sheesh.''
 &HT;    Jokes began immediately (Jay Leno said there would be no space
walk on STS-95 because NASA feared Glenn might ``wander off''), and
there were some dismaying editorials. The flight assignment was
``Nostalgia in Orbit'' to The New York Times, and ``the orbital
equivalent of the Lincoln Bedroom'' to an op-ed writer in USA
Today.
 &HT;    Some biologists expressed doubt about the usefulness of whatever
data Glenn would generate, and even a few of the thumbs-ups he got
were for the idea's inspirational, not scientific, value. At most,
Glenn is establishing a starting point for further geriatric
research. He has admitted that ``one person does not a database
make.''
 &HT;    But as John Logsdon, director of the Space Policy Institute at
George Washington University, cheerfully adds, ``One person a
database starts.'' And maybe, Glenn says, this ``opens up'' things
for some of the other veterans.
 &HT;    If Glenn is the only septuagenarian to go up, even his single
shot is likely to provide a psychological lift for senior citizens.
 &HT;    ``I think it's great,'' says Bob Dole, Glenn's longtime Senate
colleague and himself a recent medical test-subject, for the
anti-impotence drug Viagra. ``I think it probably gets people out
of their chairs'' and ``shows you never get too old to do these
things.''
 &HT;    In Glenn's case, the flight returns him not so much to his prime
as to his earliest ambition. ``If World War II hadn't come along,''
Annie Glenn says, ``he was either going to be a medical doctor or
go into medical research.'' Here at last, in fate's roundabout way,
comes his chance.
 -0- 
 &HT;    The Johnson Space Center these days has the tranquil look of a
state university. Birdsong floats over its clipped lawns and boxy
midcentury buildings. Some 1960s rockets, including a Saturn, sit
off in a grassy corner like old football trophies too big for a
display case. During most of the original astronauts' missions, the
center was still under construction for space personnel being
transferred from Langley Research Center in Virginia.
 &HT;    These days, the new astronauts among whom Glenn spends time are
``about half-again smarter than we ever thought of being back
then,'' he says. ``They're better educated and they're deeper into
science.''
 &HT;    They're also more diverse than the brush-cut, all-Protestant
test pilots introduced to the country in 1959. Along with Pedro
Duque, a European Space Agency astronaut from Spain, the STS-95
crew includes Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor who four years ago
became the first Japanese woman to go into space.
 &HT;    If back in 1959, at their first news conference, Glenn did all
he could to stand out among the Original Seven astronauts _
famously raising two hands when a reporter asked which of the men
thought they would safely return to Earth _ 40 years later he is
doing his best to blend in. Except for an occasional lapse, he's
``John,'' not ``Senator Glenn,'' to the rest of the crew.
 &HT;    Two of Glenn's crewmates are doctors, and one of these is a
specialist in emergency medicine. But that's not, they all insist,
from any anxiety about an older-than-usual astronaut's being on
board. Glenn points out that Mukai was assigned to STS-95 more than
a year ago. Scott Parazynski, the other doctor, notes that two
doctors is ``actually par for the course'' for this kind of
``life-sciences emphasis'' flight.
 &HT;    In the early days of the space program, the astronauts insisted
that they be pilots, not passengers _ to be more than the chimps
who preceded them aloft. Glenn knows that regardless of the other
tasks he has been assigned (he's in charge of the photo equipment
and works with some experiments that don't involve his own
biology), he is on STS-95 essentially to accept punishment to his
aging body _ to be, in short, the monkey.
 &HT;    As ironies go, this one is more noble than cheap. Glenn jokes
that his bald head is perfectly designed for the electrodes that he
will wear. He knows that 10 days of weightlessness, some of it
free-floating, may induce not only a loss of muscle and bone but
also nausea _ certainly more of it than he ever had the chance to
experience during five hours strapped into the seat of Friendship
7.
 &HT;    The serious risk to Glenn's health may not be very great, but
the exhaustion is likely to be considerable, and no one at NASA
wants the most memorable photo of STS-95 to be one of Glenn being
carried off the orbiter on a stretcher.
 &HT;    The toll this flight may take on Glenn's status as cultural
legend is probably even less predictable. His return to space could
play out like a lackluster movie sequel, diminishing memories of
the long-ago flight that made him such an icon, and NASA's PR coup
could backfire if Glenn's return adds only to the nostalgia that
dominates public consciousness of the space program.
 &HT;    But the hotels around Cape Canaveral have for months been booked
solid for Oct. 29. And whatever reminiscence it provokes, Glenn's
flight will also begin one entirely forward-looking enterprise: the
movement of civilians into space.
 &HT;    And, oddly enough, it will be Glenn, a plumber's son who became
so mythic that John F. Kennedy was disinclined to risk putting him
on another flight, who may get NASA past the most lingering trauma
of Challenger: the death of Christa McAuliffe, the schoolteacher.
The agency picked the moment of its announcement about Glenn to
declare that Barbara Morgan, the teacher who trained as McAuliffe's
backup a dozen years ago, has been accepted into the next group of
regular astronaut trainees.
 &HT;    At the mention of this ``civilian'' business, Glenn fairly rolls
his eyes. ``I don't know what they think I am,'' he says. ``I spent
a career in the military. I was in the space program. They're not
gettin' a new boy.''
 &HT;    When the Discovery takes Glenn back into space, the science and
public relations of STS-95 will drop away with the shuttle's rocket
boosters. This is especially so for the minority of Americans old
enough to recall Feb. 20, 1962 _ and for those oldest citizens
whose physical needs are the official justification for Glenn's
place on the flight.
 &HT;    What is Glenn's biggest anxiety about this mission? He'll be
thinking in the same quiet, right-stuff italics he did on Feb. 20,
1962. ``My main concern,'' he says, ``is that I just not mess up.''
 &HT;    As she watches him lift off, his wife Annie will be quietly
resurrecting the attitude with which she waited out World War II,
Korea, test-piloting at Patuxent River and Project Mercury:
``John's like a cat with nine lives.'' If something happens, she
will ``always live with the idea that John went the way John would
like to. That's been my way of life, I think.''

 By THOMAS MALLON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    On Feb. 20, 1962, John Glenn flew over a country with 80 million
fewer people than it has today, a land without ZIP codes and
throughout which three-quarters of the households still contained
both husbands and wives. Most of the wives were home that day, and
about the time Friendship 7 was rounding out its third orbit, some
of the husbands were rounding into a third martini at lunch. The
local record store, which may have been down the street from a
segregated hotel, had yet to stock a Beatles album.
 &HT;    Had the astronaut possessed a more powerful periscope than he
did, he still could not have picked out a St. Louis arch or a World
Trade Center to serve as a guidepost below. Not even Telstar, the
early communications satellite, was in the heavens to block his
path. The capsule's progress through the skies was relayed by
teletype from one tracking station to another.
 &HT;    ``In fact,'' says Gene Kranz, the legendary controller who was
directing the flight that morning, ``probably the most advanced
technology we worked with was the Atlantic cable, which had just
been relaid in 1956.''
 &HT;    After five hours, Friendship 7, not much bigger than the
Stratoloungers poised before millions of black-and-white TV sets
below, retrorocketed back to Earth. And as it roared through the
atmosphere like ``a real fireball,'' in the pilot's own calm words,
no one knew for certain that its heat shield wasn't about to fall
off.
 &HT;    A young but edgy country, with no idea of the decade it was
about to live through, leapt from its chairs and crowed over the
man who finally splashed down in the Atlantic. For the next several
weeks it heaped gratitude, relief and sheer unjaded delight on the
honest-to-God hero _ and regular fellow _ who had made this wild,
necessary ride. When it came time for his ticker-tape parade, there
was actual ticker tape to fling through the windows.
 &HT;    Today Glenn's return to space carries enormous public-relations
value to NASA _ this is the biggest manned-space story in years.
Nonetheless, Glenn sticks resolutely to medical-research terms in
discussing his mission's origin and meaning. And his wife Annie,
who will be watching him lift off, says that ``he's always wanted
to go'' back into space.
 &HT;    Yet after a three-decade political hiatus, what requalified him
was, oddly enough, getting old. Glenn, who has long served on the
Senate's Special Committee on Aging, was in his late 60s when he
sat down one weekend with a Merck manual on geriatrics and another

 By FRANCIS FUKUYAMA  
 c.1998 Foreign Affairs Magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Virtually all feminists who study international politics seek
the laudable goal of greater female participation in all aspects of
foreign relations, from executive mansions and foreign ministries
to militaries and universities.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree as to whether women should get ahead in politics
by demonstrating traditional masculine virtues of toughness,
aggression, competitiveness and the willingness to use force when
necessary _ or whether they should move the agenda of politics away
from male preoccupations with hierarchy and domination.
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence was demonstrated in the feminist reaction to
Margaret Thatcher, who by any account was far tougher and more
determined than any of the male politicians she came up against.
Thatcher's conservative politics did not endear her to most
feminists, who much prefer a Mary Robinson or Gro Harlem Brundtland
as their model of a female leader, despite _ or because of _ the
fact that Thatcher had beaten men at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent findings and research in genetics and new
biology, it would seem that there is something to the contention of
many feminists that phenomena such as aggression, violence, war and
intense competition for dominance in a status hierarchy are more
closely associated with men than women.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of international relations that see global politics as
a remorseless struggle for power are in fact what feminists call a
gendered perspective, describing the behavior of states controlled
by men. A world run by women would follow different rules, it would
appear, and it is toward that sort of world that all postindustrial
or Western societies are moving. As women gain power in these
countries, the latter should become less aggressive, adventurous,
competitive and violent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the feminist view is that it sees these
attitudes toward violence, power and status as wholly the products
of a patriarchal culture, whereas in fact it appears they are
rooted in biology. This makes these attitudes harder to change in
men and consequently in societies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of women, men will continue to play a major, if
not dominant, part in the governance of postindustrial countries,
not to mention less-developed ones. The realms of war and
international politics in particular will remain controlled by men
for longer than many feminists would like.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the task of resocializing men to be more like
women _ that is, less violent _ will run into limits. What is bred
in the bone cannot be altered easily by changes in culture and
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   While some gender roles are indeed socially constructed,
virtually all reputable evolutionary biologists today think there
are profound differences between the sexes that are genetically
rather than culturally rooted, and that these differences extend
beyond the body into the realm of the mind. In no area is
sex-related difference clearer than with respect to violence and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the feminist agenda for international politics seems
fundamentally correct: The violent and aggressive tendencies of men
have to be controlled, not simply by redirecting them to external
aggression but by constraining those impulses through a web of
norms, laws, agreements, contracts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more women need to be brought into the domain of
international politics as leaders, officials, soldiers and voters.
Only by participating fully in global politics can women both
defend their own interests and shift the underlying male agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The feminization of world politics has, of course, been taking
place gradually over the past hundred years, with very positive
effects. Women have won the right to vote and participate in
politics in all developed countries, as well as in many developing
countries, and have exercised that right with increasing energy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and other rich countries, a pronounced
gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national security
issues endures. American women have always been less supportive
than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including World War
II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War, by an average margin
of 7 percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They are also consistently less supportive of defense spending
and the use of force abroad. In a 1995 Roper survey conducted for
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, men favored U.S.
intervention in Korea in the event of a North Korean attack by a
margin of 49 percent to 40 percent, while women were opposed by a
margin of 30 percent to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. military action against Iraq in the event it
invaded Saudi Arabia was supported by men by a margin of 62 percent
to 31 percent and opposed by women by 43 percent to 45 percent.
While 54 percent of men felt it important to maintain superior
worldwide military power, only 45 percent of women agreed. Women,
moreover, are less likely than men to see force as a legitimate
tool for resolving conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know how to account for this gender gap.
Observers have suggested various reasons why women are less willing
to use military force than men, including their role as mothers,
the fact that many women are feminists (that is, committed to a
left-of-center agenda that is generally hostile to U.S.
intervention), and partisan affiliation (more women vote Democratic
than men).
</P>
<P>
   It is unnecessary to know the reason for the correlation between
gender and antimilitarism, however, to predict that increasing
female political participation will probably make the United States
and other democracies less inclined to use power around the world
as freely as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Will this shift toward a less status- and
military-power-oriented world be a good thing? For relations
between states in the so-called democratic zone of peace, the
answer is yes. Consideration of gender adds a great deal to the
vigorous and interesting debate over the correlation between
democracy and peace that has taken place in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   The ``democratic peace'' argument, which underlies the foreign
policy of the Clinton administration as well as its predecessors,
is that democracies tend not to fight one another. While the
empirical claim has been contested, the correlation between the
degree of consolidation of liberal democratic institutions and
interdemocratic peace would seem to be one of the few nontrivial
generalizations one can make about world politics.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic peace theorists have been less persuasive about the
reasons democracies are pacific toward one another. The reasons
usually cited _ the rule of law, respect for individual rights, the
commercial nature of most democracies and the like _ are
undoubtedly correct.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another factor that has generally not been taken
into account. Developed democracies also tend to be more feminized
than authoritarian states, in terms of expansion of female
franchise and participation in political decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   It should therefore surprise no one that the historically
unprecedented shift in the sexual basis of politics should lead to
a change in international relations.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if gender roles are not simply socially
constructed but rooted in genetics, there will be limits to how
much international politics can change. In anything but a totally
feminized world, feminized policies could be a liability.
</P>
<P>
   Some feminists talk as if gender identities can be discarded
like an old sweater, perhaps by putting young men through mandatory
gender-studies courses when they are college freshmen. Male
attitudes on a host of issues, from child-rearing and housework to
``getting in touch with your feelings,'' have changed dramatically
in the past couple of generations because of social pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But socialization can accomplish only so much, and efforts to
fully feminize young men will probably be no more successful than
the Soviet Union's efforts to persuade its people to work on
Saturdays on behalf of the heroic Cuban and Vietnamese people.
</P>
<P>
   Male tendencies to band together for competitive purposes, seek
to dominate status hierarchies, and act out aggressive fantasies
toward one another can be rechanneled but never eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we can assume peaceful relations between democracies,
the broader world scene will still be populated by states led by
the occasional Mobutu, Milosevic or Saddam. Even if the democratic,
feminized, postindustrial world has evolved into a zone of peace
where struggles are more economic than military, it will still have
to deal with those parts of the world run by young, ambitious,
unconstrained men.

<P>
   Virtually all feminists who study international politics seek
the laudable goal of greater female participation in all aspects of
foreign relations, from executive mansions and foreign ministries
to militaries and universities.
</P>
<P>
   They disagree as to whether women should get ahead in politics
by demonstrating traditional masculine virtues of toughness,
aggression, competitiveness and the willingness to use force when
necessary _ or whether they should move the agenda of politics away
from male preoccupations with hierarchy and domination.
</P>
<P>
   This ambivalence was demonstrated in the feminist reaction to
Margaret Thatcher, who by any account was far tougher and more
determined than any of the male politicians she came up against.
Thatcher's conservative politics did not endear her to most
feminists, who much prefer a Mary Robinson or Gro Harlem Brundtland
as their model of a female leader, despite _ or because of _ the
fact that Thatcher had beaten men at their own game.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent findings and research in genetics and new
biology, it would seem that there is something to the contention of
many feminists that phenomena such as aggression, violence, war and
intense competition for dominance in a status hierarchy are more
closely associated with men than women.
</P>
<P>
   Theories of international relations that see global politics as
a remorseless struggle for power are in fact what feminists call a
gendered perspective, describing the behavior of states controlled
by men. A world run by women would follow different rules, it would
appear, and it is toward that sort of world that all postindustrial
or Western societies are moving. As women gain power in these
countries, the latter should become less aggressive, adventurous,
competitive and violent.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the feminist view is that it sees these
attitudes toward violence, power and status as wholly the products
of a patriarchal culture, whereas in fact it appears they are
rooted in biology. This makes these attitudes harder to change in
men and consequently in societies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of women, men will continue to play a major, if
not dominant, part in the governance of postindustrial countries,
not to mention less-developed ones. The realms of war and
international politics in particular will remain controlled by men
for longer than many feminists would like.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the task of resocializing men to be more like
women _ that is, less violent _ will run into limits. What is bred
in the bone cannot be altered easily by changes in culture and
ideology.
</P>
<P>
   While some gender roles are indeed socially constructed,
virtually all reputable evolutionary biologists today think there
are profound differences between the sexes that are genetically
rather than culturally rooted, and that these differences extend
beyond the body into the realm of the mind. In no area is
sex-related difference clearer than with respect to violence and
aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the feminist agenda for international politics seems
fundamentally correct: The violent and aggressive tendencies of men
have to be controlled, not simply by redirecting them to external
aggression but by constraining those impulses through a web of
norms, laws, agreements, contracts and the like.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, more women need to be brought into the domain of
international politics as leaders, officials, soldiers and voters.
Only by participating fully in global politics can women both
defend their own interests and shift the underlying male agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The feminization of world politics has, of course, been taking
place gradually over the past hundred years, with very positive
effects. Women have won the right to vote and participate in
politics in all developed countries, as well as in many developing
countries, and have exercised that right with increasing energy.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States and other rich countries, a pronounced
gender gap with regard to foreign policy and national security
issues endures. American women have always been less supportive
than American men of U.S. involvement in war, including World War
II, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf War, by an average margin
of 7 percent to 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   They are also consistently less supportive of defense spending
and the use of force abroad. In a 1995 Roper survey conducted for
the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations, men favored U.S.
intervention in Korea in the event of a North Korean attack by a
margin of 49 percent to 40 percent, while women were opposed by a
margin of 30 percent to 54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, U.S. military action against Iraq in the event it
invaded Saudi Arabia was supported by men by a margin of 62 percent
to 31 percent and opposed by women by 43 percent to 45 percent.
While 54 percent of men felt it important to maintain superior
worldwide military power, only 45 percent of women agreed. Women,
moreover, are less likely than men to see force as a legitimate
tool for resolving conflicts.

<P>

<P>
   On Nov. 16, 1995, Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark sat in Dayton, Ohio, in
a PowerScene virtual reality imaging system, using a joystick to
fly back and forth through simulated three-dimensional scenes of
the hills of Bosnia east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 p.m., Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic joined
him, as well as some other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lubricated by Scotch, Milosevic and the Americans zoomed back
and forth on the computer simulation to try to carve out a path
from the besieged Bosnian capital to Gorazde, a U.N. ``safe area''
surrounded by Bosnian Serbs. In the wee hours of the morning, Clark
used crayons to draw a corridor from Sarajevo to Goraz de that was
not hopelessly indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic shook hands with Clark, who is now the supreme allied
commander in Europe, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the main American
peace negotiator, and what is variously known as the Clark Corridor
or the Scotch Road was born.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the United States had shifted from a determination not
to be dragged into the Balkans to using U.S. officials and
computers to draw Bosnia's new frontiers. Winston Churchill used to
brag about having drawn Jordan's borders on a map one afternoon;
the American general could say much the same thing about Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But America's entry lacked swagger. Rather, U.S. policymakers
came to sketch the Scotch Road with a profound sense of
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to this diplomacy _ including Holbrooke's
memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996 official
study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of November 1995
_ show that American officials were painfully aware of the
shortcomings of U.S. Bosnia policy and the distance it had shifted
from the goals that Bill Clinton had espoused in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Dayton was a vast improvement over the muddle and
bloodshed that preceded it. But it has been oversold.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton represented not the vindication of the liberal ideals
with which Clinton excoriated George Bush on the 1992 campaign
trail _ firm action to halt genocide, bringing war criminals to
justice, tolerance, multiethnic nation-states, liberal nationalism
and the use of international and European institutions _ but rather
a version of the chilly realpolitik that kept the Bush
administration out of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal the administration helped cut edged ominously close to
partition, writing an epitaph for Bosnia as a multiethnic state and
ceding much of its territory to the Bosnian Serbs. Many of Dayton's
better provisions, especially the prosecution of war criminals and
the return of refugees, remain largely unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Dayton required dealing with and ultimately strengthening
Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, two ethnic
nationalists whose ideology and ruthlessness are antithetical to
liberal values.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's lessons are grimly appropriate when considering the
current violence in Kosovo, where Milosevic's demagoguery helped
set off Yugoslavia's demise and which is the latest target of his
ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the approach that
strengthened Milosevic and Tudjman. By doing so, Dayton plunged
Serbia deeper into ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb
soil'' of Kosovo matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the
Albanians living on top of it. As such, today's crisis comes as
scant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While the theater has shifted, and while Kosovo is part of
Serbia proper, the underlying questions are much the same. As in
1993, the Clinton administration finds itself faced with a
fundamental choice. Will the United States push Milosevic to
respect autonomy, the rights of minorities, and the rule of law, or
will it retreat, as it did for two years in Bosnia, by saying that
getting involved is not worth American blood and treasure?
</P>
<P>
   If it does back down, the retreat must include the realization
that the Clinton administration's earlier policy of realpolitik
eased the way to future episodes thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Winning any accord in Bosnia was not easy. Dayton took
considerable diplomatic skill and tenacity. Congress' isolationists
proved unhelpful and irresponsible, and the administration ran huge
political risks by deciding to intervene. But it ran those risks
for a reluctant realism.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to wonder what might have been if it had run them
on behalf of the liberal ideals that it promised. In the end, the
very policies that the administration balked at in May 1993 _ using
military force and firm leadership of the Europeans _ were the ones
that stopped the war in the autumn of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to
Yugoslavia, the cost of delay was more than 100,000 lives. The
fuller our picture of Dayton becomes, the clearer it is that the
Dayton process _ its accomplishments notwithstanding _ is less a
how-to manual for peacemakers than a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Clinton administration inherited a mess. Its
Republican predecessors were consummate realists. After meeting
Milosevic in Belgrade in June 1991 to warn him against
``exploitation of ethnic resentments (and) failure to respect human
rights in Kosovo'' _ complaints that could be lifted from today's
headlines _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III felt he ``was
talking to a wall with a crew cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration greeted Yugoslav intransigence with a
shrug. Its basic _ and correct _ diplomatic calculus was that only
military force would deter the ambitions of Milosevic and Tudjman.
Its basic _ and incorrect _ political calculus was that such an
intervention could never be sold to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was shaded by Bush's determination not to try.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said that the president
would frequently ask him, ``Tell me again what this is all about.''
He saw no U.S. interests engaged in Bosnia, and his European allies
reinforced his skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in, where does it end?'' asked British Prime Minister
John Major. Instead, the Bush administration treated Bosnia as, in
Baker's words, ``a humanitarian nightmare in the heart of Europe,''
as if Bosnia's woes were the result of a famine or an earthquake
rather than an act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as Baker put it, was that the costs in
casualties ``would have been staggering ... the necessary support
by the American people for the degree of force that would have been
required in Bosnia could never have been built or maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different policy on
the campaign trail. ``I know that ethnic divisions are one of the
strongest impulses in all of society all over the world,'' he said,
``but we've got to take a stand against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration, he charged, was immoral ``for turning
its back on violations of basic human rights,'' and needed to show
``real leadership.'' When the Clinton administration dithered,
unlike the Bush administration, it did so in defiance of its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The war could well have been ended in May 1993 had the president
fulfilled his campaign pledge to lift the arms embargo on the
Bosnians and launch air strikes on the Serbs. At that time, Clinton
sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to sound out the
Europeans about lift and strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher was instructed to consult, not to lead, and what
he heard was across-the-board opposition, concern for European
soldiers in the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), distaste for
supposed American arrogance and warnings that NATO might sunder.
</P>
<P>
   At a pivotal briefing in the Roosevelt Room the morning of his
return, Christopher told Clinton that lift and strike was still
viable, but that it would require, as he put it, a ``raw power
approach'': telling the Europeans ``that we have firmly decided to
go ahead with our preferred option and that we expect them to
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the choices, Christopher explained, the least attractive
_ and most hypocritical _ would be to continue the Bush policy of
``doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton blanched.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, after two years of fecklessness, did Clinton
ultimately act decisively, backing heretofore toothless diplomacy
with force and American leadership? Alas, the answer to this puzzle
lies in a startling decision _ or, better, a nondecision _ that no
administration should repeat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the August 1995 decision to push for Holbrooke's
shuttle, without being fully aware of it, Washington had already
committed itself to a military presence in Bosnia. The decision was
made in so aimless a manner that almost all senior officials were
caught off guard when the implications of what they had done
finally sank in.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Bosnia study confirms that most senior
foreign policy officials, most notably the president himself, were
surprised to learn in June 1995 that U.S. troops might soon be on
their way to Bosnia whether the administration liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion stemmed from an earlier presidential decision
that, should the situation on the ground become chaotic enough to
prevent UNPROFOR _ the hapless U.N. peacekeeping mission already in
Bosnia _ from functioning, NATO would intervene to help the blue
helmets flee.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration confirmed this commitment in late
1994, and NATO military planners duly began work on Op-plan 40104,
which called for using 20,000 U.S. troops as part of a
60,000-person evacuation force.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO approved this mission in the spring of 1995 with the
consent of American NATO Amb. Robert E. Hunter and U.S. military
planners in Brussels, the Clinton administration boxed itself in.
</P>
<P>
   While an intervention to limit U.N. failure would be dangerous
and humiliating, the White House figured that reneging on its
promise to NATO would destroy the remains of its credibility and
devastate an already frayed alliance.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.N. peacekeeping force daily revealed to be impotent,
the only way Washington could forestall the withdrawal mission to
which it had committed itself was to push the parties to peace _ a
better option, but one that would still require sending American
troops to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   What one Clinton adviser called ``the single most difficult
decision of (Clinton's) presidency _ to send troops to Bosnia'' had
been made without anyone realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   As the war worsened, the specter of Op-plan 40104 loomed larger.
The Serb massacres of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in July 1995 in
the U.N.-designated ``safe areas'' of Srebrenica and Zepa _ the
worst war crimes in Europe since those of the Nazis _ made
UNPROFOR's ignominy complete.
</P>
<P>
   European countries participating in UNPROFOR began warning that
they would soon pull their troops out, triggering what American
policymakers referred to as the 40104 ``doomsday machine'' _
intervention triggered by humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior officials, including U.N. Amb. Madeleine K.
Albright and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, began arguing
that since American troops were headed for Bosnia anyway, the
administration should try to implement a success rather than ratify
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   As one official memorably put it, the question on Bosnia was not
whether to stay in or out; it was ``choosing which waterfall we
will go over.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven mainly by Lake and the National Security Council staff,
senior officials spent the rest of the summer scurrying to come up
with a plan. In August, Holbrooke's mission began.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to reevaluate its Bosnia
diplomacy came not from a realization of the failure of its earlier
rudderlessness or a renewal of Wilsonian principle. Rather, it came
from a decision few could even remember making.
</P>
<P>
   When apprised of the details of Op-plan 40104, everyone _ from
Holbrooke to Christopher to Clinton himself _ was shocked. The
choice to commit U.S. troops to help withdraw UNPROFOR was not the
fruit of any formal deliberative process in which the president
approved the mission through such standard means as a decision
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was made by inertia. If there were lessons to be
learned from the earlier decisions not to intervene, they were not
learned by the Clinton administration. Instead, it became bold
almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dayton accord, which emerged from the haphazard process
triggered by Op-plan 40104, as Holbrooke himself concedes, is
hardly perfect. To be sure, it stopped the fighting, at least for
the time being, which should not be underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   But what is left of Bosnia are the tatters of a tolerant,
cosmopolitan society. Ultimately, the West lacked the will to
reverse Serb and Croat aggression, and the Bosnian-Serb obsession

   On Nov. 16, 1995, Lt. Gen. Wesley Clark sat in Dayton, Ohio, in
a PowerScene virtual reality imaging system, using a joystick to
fly back and forth through simulated three-dimensional scenes of
the hills of Bosnia east of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   At about 11 p.m., Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic joined
him, as well as some other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Lubricated by Scotch, Milosevic and the Americans zoomed back
and forth on the computer simulation to try to carve out a path
from the besieged Bosnian capital to Gorazde, a U.N. ``safe area''
surrounded by Bosnian Serbs. In the wee hours of the morning, Clark
used crayons to draw a corridor from Sarajevo to Goraz de that was
not hopelessly indefensible.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic shook hands with Clark, who is now the supreme allied
commander in Europe, and Richard C. Holbrooke, the main American
peace negotiator, and what is variously known as the Clark Corridor
or the Scotch Road was born.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, the United States had shifted from a determination not
to be dragged into the Balkans to using U.S. officials and
computers to draw Bosnia's new frontiers. Winston Churchill used to
brag about having drawn Jordan's borders on a map one afternoon;
the American general could say much the same thing about Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   But America's entry lacked swagger. Rather, U.S. policymakers
came to sketch the Scotch Road with a profound sense of
ambivalence.
</P>
<P>
   Documents relating to this diplomacy _ including Holbrooke's
memoir ``To End a War'' and the State Department's 1996 official
study of the process leading to the Dayton Accords of November 1995
_ show that American officials were painfully aware of the
shortcomings of U.S. Bosnia policy and the distance it had shifted
from the goals that Bill Clinton had espoused in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Dayton was a vast improvement over the muddle and
bloodshed that preceded it. But it has been oversold.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton represented not the vindication of the liberal ideals
with which Clinton excoriated George Bush on the 1992 campaign
trail _ firm action to halt genocide, bringing war criminals to
justice, tolerance, multiethnic nation-states, liberal nationalism
and the use of international and European institutions _ but rather
a version of the chilly realpolitik that kept the Bush
administration out of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The deal the administration helped cut edged ominously close to
partition, writing an epitaph for Bosnia as a multiethnic state and
ceding much of its territory to the Bosnian Serbs. Many of Dayton's
better provisions, especially the prosecution of war criminals and
the return of refugees, remain largely unimplemented.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, Dayton required dealing with and ultimately strengthening
Milosevic and Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, two ethnic
nationalists whose ideology and ruthlessness are antithetical to
liberal values.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's lessons are grimly appropriate when considering the
current violence in Kosovo, where Milosevic's demagoguery helped
set off Yugoslavia's demise and which is the latest target of his
ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodshed in Kosovo is a symptom of the approach that
strengthened Milosevic and Tudjman. By doing so, Dayton plunged
Serbia deeper into ethnic chauvinism, whereby the ``sacred Serb
soil'' of Kosovo matters vastly more to Belgrade than do the
Albanians living on top of it. As such, today's crisis comes as
scant surprise.
</P>
<P>
   While the theater has shifted, and while Kosovo is part of
Serbia proper, the underlying questions are much the same. As in
1993, the Clinton administration finds itself faced with a
fundamental choice. Will the United States push Milosevic to
respect autonomy, the rights of minorities, and the rule of law, or
will it retreat, as it did for two years in Bosnia, by saying that
getting involved is not worth American blood and treasure?
</P>
<P>
   If it does back down, the retreat must include the realization
that the Clinton administration's earlier policy of realpolitik
eased the way to future episodes thereof.
</P>
<P>
   Winning any accord in Bosnia was not easy. Dayton took
considerable diplomatic skill and tenacity. Congress' isolationists
proved unhelpful and irresponsible, and the administration ran huge
political risks by deciding to intervene. But it ran those risks
for a reluctant realism.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to wonder what might have been if it had run them
on behalf of the liberal ideals that it promised. In the end, the
very policies that the administration balked at in May 1993 _ using
military force and firm leadership of the Europeans _ were the ones
that stopped the war in the autumn of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   According to Warren Zimmermann, the last U.S. ambassador to
Yugoslavia, the cost of delay was more than 100,000 lives. The
fuller our picture of Dayton becomes, the clearer it is that the
Dayton process _ its accomplishments notwithstanding _ is less a
how-to manual for peacemakers than a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the Clinton administration inherited a mess. Its
Republican predecessors were consummate realists. After meeting
Milosevic in Belgrade in June 1991 to warn him against
``exploitation of ethnic resentments (and) failure to respect human
rights in Kosovo'' _ complaints that could be lifted from today's
headlines _ Secretary of State James A. Baker III felt he ``was
talking to a wall with a crew cut.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration greeted Yugoslav intransigence with a
shrug. Its basic _ and correct _ diplomatic calculus was that only
military force would deter the ambitions of Milosevic and Tudjman.
Its basic _ and incorrect _ political calculus was that such an
intervention could never be sold to the American people.
</P>
<P>
   That assessment was shaded by Bush's determination not to try.
National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft said that the president
would frequently ask him, ``Tell me again what this is all about.''
He saw no U.S. interests engaged in Bosnia, and his European allies
reinforced his skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in, where does it end?'' asked British Prime Minister
John Major. Instead, the Bush administration treated Bosnia as, in
Baker's words, ``a humanitarian nightmare in the heart of Europe,''
as if Bosnia's woes were the result of a famine or an earthquake
rather than an act of aggression.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, as Baker put it, was that the costs in
casualties ``would have been staggering ... the necessary support
by the American people for the degree of force that would have been
required in Bosnia could never have been built or maintained.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the other hand, promised a very different policy on
the campaign trail. ``I know that ethnic divisions are one of the
strongest impulses in all of society all over the world,'' he said,
``but we've got to take a stand against it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration, he charged, was immoral ``for turning
its back on violations of basic human rights,'' and needed to show
``real leadership.'' When the Clinton administration dithered,
unlike the Bush administration, it did so in defiance of its
promises.
</P>
<P>
   The war could well have been ended in May 1993 had the president
fulfilled his campaign pledge to lift the arms embargo on the
Bosnians and launch air strikes on the Serbs. At that time, Clinton
sent Secretary of State Warren Christopher to sound out the
Europeans about lift and strike.
</P>
<P>
   But Christopher was instructed to consult, not to lead, and what
he heard was across-the-board opposition, concern for European
soldiers in the U.N. Protection Force (UNPROFOR), distaste for
supposed American arrogance and warnings that NATO might sunder.
</P>
<P>
   At a pivotal briefing in the Roosevelt Room the morning of his
return, Christopher told Clinton that lift and strike was still
viable, but that it would require, as he put it, a ``raw power
approach'': telling the Europeans ``that we have firmly decided to
go ahead with our preferred option and that we expect them to
support us.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the choices, Christopher explained, the least attractive
_ and most hypocritical _ would be to continue the Bush policy of
``doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton blanched.
</P>
<P>
   Why, then, after two years of fecklessness, did Clinton
ultimately act decisively, backing heretofore toothless diplomacy
with force and American leadership? Alas, the answer to this puzzle
lies in a startling decision _ or, better, a nondecision _ that no
administration should repeat.
</P>
<P>
   By the time of the August 1995 decision to push for Holbrooke's
shuttle, without being fully aware of it, Washington had already
committed itself to a military presence in Bosnia. The decision was
made in so aimless a manner that almost all senior officials were
caught off guard when the implications of what they had done
finally sank in.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's Bosnia study confirms that most senior
foreign policy officials, most notably the president himself, were
surprised to learn in June 1995 that U.S. troops might soon be on
their way to Bosnia whether the administration liked it or not.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion stemmed from an earlier presidential decision
that, should the situation on the ground become chaotic enough to
prevent UNPROFOR _ the hapless U.N. peacekeeping mission already in
Bosnia _ from functioning, NATO would intervene to help the blue
helmets flee.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration confirmed this commitment in late
1994, and NATO military planners duly began work on Op-plan 40104,
which called for using 20,000 U.S. troops as part of a
60,000-person evacuation force.
</P>
<P>
   When NATO approved this mission in the spring of 1995 with the
consent of American NATO Amb. Robert E. Hunter and U.S. military
planners in Brussels, the Clinton administration boxed itself in.
</P>
<P>
   While an intervention to limit U.N. failure would be dangerous
and humiliating, the White House figured that reneging on its
promise to NATO would destroy the remains of its credibility and
devastate an already frayed alliance.
</P>
<P>
   With the U.N. peacekeeping force daily revealed to be impotent,
the only way Washington could forestall the withdrawal mission to
which it had committed itself was to push the parties to peace _ a
better option, but one that would still require sending American
troops to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   What one Clinton adviser called ``the single most difficult
decision of (Clinton's) presidency _ to send troops to Bosnia'' had
been made without anyone realizing it.
</P>
<P>
   As the war worsened, the specter of Op-plan 40104 loomed larger.
The Serb massacres of thousands of Bosnian Muslims in July 1995 in
the U.N.-designated ``safe areas'' of Srebrenica and Zepa _ the
worst war crimes in Europe since those of the Nazis _ made
UNPROFOR's ignominy complete.
</P>
<P>
   European countries participating in UNPROFOR began warning that
they would soon pull their troops out, triggering what American
policymakers referred to as the 40104 ``doomsday machine'' _
intervention triggered by humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior officials, including U.N. Amb. Madeleine K.
Albright and National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, began arguing
that since American troops were headed for Bosnia anyway, the
administration should try to implement a success rather than ratify
a failure.
</P>
<P>
   As one official memorably put it, the question on Bosnia was not
whether to stay in or out; it was ``choosing which waterfall we
will go over.''
</P>
<P>
   Driven mainly by Lake and the National Security Council staff,
senior officials spent the rest of the summer scurrying to come up
with a plan. In August, Holbrooke's mission began.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to reevaluate its Bosnia
diplomacy came not from a realization of the failure of its earlier
rudderlessness or a renewal of Wilsonian principle. Rather, it came
from a decision few could even remember making.
</P>
<P>
   When apprised of the details of Op-plan 40104, everyone _ from
Holbrooke to Christopher to Clinton himself _ was shocked. The
choice to commit U.S. troops to help withdraw UNPROFOR was not the
fruit of any formal deliberative process in which the president
approved the mission through such standard means as a decision
memorandum.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was made by inertia. If there were lessons to be
learned from the earlier decisions not to intervene, they were not
learned by the Clinton administration. Instead, it became bold
almost by accident.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dayton accord, which emerged from the haphazard process
triggered by Op-plan 40104, as Holbrooke himself concedes, is
hardly perfect. To be sure, it stopped the fighting, at least for
the time being, which should not be underappreciated.
</P>
<P>
   But what is left of Bosnia are the tatters of a tolerant,
cosmopolitan society. Ultimately, the West lacked the will to
reverse Serb and Croat aggression, and the Bosnian-Serb obsession
with self-rule was ratified.

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,600 words) available on request  
 &HT;    George Walker Bush was visiting his parents in theWhite House
one day when the talk turned to religion, which is precisely the
subject that some powerful factions in the Republican Party want
their presidential standard-bearer to talk about, forcefully, in
2000.
 &HT;    But Bush, sitting one day recently on a sofa in the governor's
office at the Texas State Capitol, says he is ``cautious about
wearing my religion on my sleeve in the political process.'' And he
offers this particular story to explain why.
 &HT;    ``Mother and I were arguing _ not arguing, having a discussion _
and discussing who goes to Heaven,'' recalls the governor, who at
the time had religion very much on his mind.
 &HT;    Having dealt with a gathering drinking problem by abruptly
swearing off alcohol, he had vowed a renewed commitment to his
family and his faith. Bush pointed to the Bible: Only Christians
had a place in heaven.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New
Testament says. And she said, well, surely, God will accept others.
And I said, Mom, here's what the New Testament says. And she said,
OK, and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to
the White House operator, Get me Billy Graham.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mother, what are you doing?'' Bush continues,
chuckling at the memory. ``Seriously. And about two minutes later,
the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the
phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy
says, From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is
saying, the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution
you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?''
 &HT;    For George W. Bush, a man who, in large part because of his
famous name, shows up in most polls these days as the very early
front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination battle that
is still more than a year away, it is an interesting story to
choose to relate.
 &HT;    Bush says it explains in part why he urged an end to ``name
calling'' this summer when a fracas broke out over his party's
decision to bar a gay Republican group from setting up a booth at
the GOP state convention.
 &HT;    ``There are some great admonitions in the Bible, talking about,
you know, don't try to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye
when you've got a log in your own,'' Bush says. ``I'm mindful of
that.''
 &HT;    And in his nearly four years as governor of the nation's
second-largest state, there has been strikingly little name-calling
from Bush. He talks constantly about being a ``unifier, not a
divider,'' and few things seem to make him happier than forging a
bipartisan consensus on some big bill.
 &HT;    He has grown so close to some Democratic lawmakers that he once
said there was ``no way in the world'' he could bring himself to
campaign against them.
 &HT;    Running now for his own re-election, Bush campaigns ferociously
in Democratic strongholds such as El Paso, where he breaks into
near-fluent Spanish before a delighted crow at a ''Viva Bush!''
rally and where the Democratic mayor, Carlos Ramirez, introduces
him as ``the best governor of Texas that El Paso has ever had.''
 &HT;    For these and many other reasons, the 52-year-old eldest son of
former President George Bush is riding a broad wave of popularity
that, if current polls hold true, will carry him to a sweeping
victory this November as the first governor re-elected in Texas in
24 years, the first ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms.
 &HT;    Already, more than 100 Democratic officeholders have endorsed
him, including the state's lieutenant governor, a gruff political
veteran named Bob Bullock, who announced his support for Bush's
re-election even though he is godfather to the daughter of Bush's
Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, the state land commissioner.
 &HT;    But if all this bodes well for Bush's re-election prospects in
Texas, and arguably for his prospects as a national candidate in a
general election, it also raises some obvious and perhaps
treacherous questions for the governor.
 &HT;    These are questions he would surely find tossed at him by
primary opponents if, in a step he is widely expected to take, he
runs for his father's old job. Just why do all those Democrats like
him so much? What kind of a Republican is he?
 &HT;    Why, for example, have some of his fiercest battles been with
his fellow Republicans? Some, including the state chairman of his
party at the time, are still furious with the governor over a tax
proposal he devised that would have radically reshaped the state
tax system, providing more money for some of the poorest public
schools in part by slapping new taxes on some of the biggest
industries.
 &HT;    Reticent on abortion, disinclined to denounce homosexuals, a
self-described fiscal conservative who is willing to spend money on
new programs such as a huge public-school reading initiative, Bush
does not seem to be offering the orthodoxy that some Republican
conservatives insist will be necessary in the party's candidate in
2000.
 &HT;    For all the speculation right now over whether Bush will want to
run for president _ speculation that has only seemed to grow more
fevered as scandal engulfs President Bill Clinton and threatens
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat with the most obvious
presidential ambitions _ the more intriguing question may in time
turn out to be whether today's Republican Party wants someone like
Bush as its nominee.
 &HT;    Many party foot soldiers, still angry over the way they feel the
1996 nominee, Bob Dole, essentially ignored abortion, school prayer
and other issues they care most about, are determined to find a
candidate who will carry the torch _ or else. Many use Dole's name
as a verb, and not in a nice way _ ``We won't get Doled again,''
they say.
 &HT;    Bush insists that he is a cultural conservative and promotes
what he calls ``the responsibility era.'' But candidates are
already lining up to his right, including the deep-pocketed Steve
Forbes, the flat-tax fanatic of 1996 who this time around is making
an all-out pitch to social conservatives.
 &HT;    Forbes describes a ban on the procedure known as partial-birth
abortion as his foremost priority, ``the first step toward putting
abortion on the road to ultimate extinction in the United States of
America.''
 &HT;    Bush describes himself as ``pro-life,'' supports the
partial-birth abortion ban and pledges to propose a bill next year
requiring parental consent for a minor's abortion _ ``issues over
which we can make a difference,'' he says.
 &HT;    But on the basic question of the right of most women in most
circumstances to obtain an abortion, his position is that the
Supreme Court has already settled the law. And, to date, he has not
pledged any kind of crusade to sweep away those rulings; whether he
might do so in the heat of a primary campaign remains an open
question.
 &HT;    The Bush balancing act will be infinitely tougher to sustain in
the glare of the national stage. And how odd it seems, at least to
some, that so many Republicans might look to a man named George
Bush as their savior, given that George Bush lost it all for the
party just six years ago.
 -0- 
 &HT;    President Bush was at a steakhouse in Council Bluffs, Iowa, one
October day in 1994, reminiscing with some supporters from the old
days, when he excused himself to take a cellular telephone call.
The father was intently following the progress of two of his sons,
George and Jeb, in their respective gubernatorial campaigns against
savvy Democratic veterans in Texas and Florida, and new poll
numbers were just in.
 &HT;    ``He came back and he said, It looks like Jeb's OK, but I'm
worried about George,'' recalled Gordon C. James, a member of the
White House advance team in the Bush administration. ``He was upset
about it.''
 &HT;    Both races looked close, but like a lot of people, the president
saw evidence that Jeb (a nickname John Ellis Bush takes from his
initials) would pull it out over Lawton Chiles and that George's
race against a popular incumbent, Ann W. Richards, was just too
uphill a fight.
 &HT;    As things turned out, though, some invisible law of political
primogeniture seemed to kick in _ the older brother won and the
younger did not. (Late this summer, however, while George W. is
cruising toward re-election, Jeb is, according to the polls,
comfortably ahead too in his second bid for the governor's Mansion
in Tallahassee.)
 &HT;    Back in 1994, in seeing the softer-spoken, genial Jeb as the
more likely success in politics, people in the Bush family were
relying on much more than polling data. It's not that George W.
wasn't as determined to win as any Bush.
 &HT;    ``I think the major word to describe George W. circa 1993 and
the governorship was competitiveness,'' said Chase Untermeyer, a
longtime family friend and former presidential personnel director.
(Asked to compare George W. and his father in this regard,
Untermeyer said with a laugh: ``It is such a competitive family,
it's hard to make those shadings there. That's a driven
situation.'')
 &HT;    But if George W. Bush was driven, he was also known for a sharp
tongue and temper _ the ``Roman candle of the family ... and
likeliest to burn the fingers,'' as he is aptly described in
Richard Ben Cramer's ``What It Takes,'' the exhaustive account of
the 1988 presidential campaign.
 &HT;    When the Queen of England came to a White House dinner, Barbara
Bush sat George W. at the other end of the table, just to make sure
he didn't say anything undiplomatic to Her Majesty. He was the pit
bull brought in to deliver the bad news to the president's pit bull
of a chief of staff, John Sununu, when it was time for Sununu to
leave the White House.
 &HT;    And Bush, an unpaid adviser to his father, quarreled with
reporters during the 1992 campaign, frequently accusing them of
having a bias against the president.
 &HT;    Even Bush doesn't bother to deny that he was brusque in those
days.
 &HT;    ``I love my Dad, and it should not surprise you that I was a
fierce warrior on his behalf,'' he said, as his campaign plane
rumbled over the central Texas prairie one day this spring. ``And
if that ruffled people's feathers, so be it. There's a big
difference between being the son of a candidate and being the
candidate. And I understand the difference.''
 &HT;    And certainly, there was a difference by the time George W.
began his campaign for governor in 1994, a bid he contemplated four
years earlier but passed up, in part over concerns that running
with his father in the White House might look too opportunistic _
and be too embarrassing to all the Bushes if he lost.
 &HT;    Running against Ann W. Richards, the feisty and sharp-witted
incumbent who once famously derided his father as ``poor old
George,'' born with a ``silver foot in his mouth,'' Bush would seem
to have had ample reason to lose his cool.
 &HT;    In the course of the campaign, Richards called him ``Shrub,''
``that young Bush boy'' and ''some jerk,'' and joked that he was
``missing his Herbert'' (a reference to his father's two middle
names).
 &HT;    Richards frequently said that if Bush's name were George Walker,
without the Bush, no one would even take his campaign seriously _ a
point not without merit.
 &HT;    All the barbs and his prior reputation notwithstanding, Bush
turned in a truly remarkable performance. He did not lose his cool
at all, and at times he laughed right along with Richards,
basically telling voters that she sure was a funny lady, whom
everybody enjoyed, but that he came from a party and held to a
conservative philosophy that were more in line with what Texans
wanted in government. (Not that Bush wasn't out for revenge: As he
explained at the time, his strategy was to ``kill her with
kindness.'')
 &HT;    And for a man who had seemingly wandered through much of his 20s
and 30s, and who conceded that the main question surrounding him
was, ``What's the boy ever done?'' he ran a thoroughly disciplined
campaign.
 &HT;    Mindful that his father had lacked a coherent message in 1992,
Bush offered voters a precise, four-point plan for better
government: more control for local school districts, stricter
provisions for welfare recipients, tougher juvenile-justice laws
and reform of the state's tort laws. He never deviated from the
message. And while hardly the most scintillating set of political
themes ever developed, it allowed him to sidestep other issues,
particularly abortion.
 &HT;    Bush says the only painful episode from the campaign was a brief
flap over an interview he gave an Austin reporter about religion,
in which he reiterated his own personal belief that the path to
Heaven leads through acceptance of Christ as one's personal savior.
 &HT;    ``It was, of course, picked up and politicized _ you know, 'Bush
to Jews: Go to Hell,''' he recalls. ``It was very ugly. It hurt my
feelings.''
 &HT;    On election night, buoyed by the Republican surge that led to
the takeover of Congress, Bush won going away, 54 percent to 46
percent.
 &HT;    Jeb Bush, meanwhile, ran a campaign with a much sharper
conservative edge, speaking out against abortion and selecting a
Christian Coalition ``legislator of the year'' as his running mate.
To someone who briefly watched him campaign in 1994, the difference
this year is striking. He seems to have taken a page from his
brother, offering a much more upbeat message, reaching out to
minority groups, emphasizing education and greater ``compassion''
in state services.
 &HT;    Taking a break from a sweltering day of campaigning this summer
in West Palm Beach, Jeb Bush let out a tight laugh as he gave
credit to his big brother for proving himself ``the better
politician.''
 &HT;    ``He ran on four or five items or whatever it was, and he stayed
focused on that,'' Bush said. ``And that is a great lesson in
politics.''
 &HT;    Jeb Bush said he speaks to his brother about running for the
White House only ``in the contingent, in the conditional,'' but
adds that he has no doubt that his brother has ``the right stuff''
to be president.
 &HT;    And what if anyone tries to run to George W.'s right, by
emphasizing abortion or other specific social issues?
 &HT;    ``I think they'll fail,'' Jeb Bush said, ``because the broader
moral questions are the ones that concern the great majority of
people out there that fit this criteria of 'cultural
conservatives.' It is so sterile to talk about the things that the
press in this state wants to try to create, or my opponent.
Basically the same thing. There's all this Christian right, and
abortion. These are not the issues that drive people's concerns.
They want to know, how do they get the support to make sure their
children don't take drugs. They want their schools to be safe.
 &HT;    ``I'm very confident,'' he added, ``that George Bush will be
very successful if he stays the course with his message.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, likes to say that the
fundamental difference between him and his father is that the
former president attended Greenwich Country Day School, while he
went to San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland, Texas.
 &HT;    Born in 1946 in New Haven, George and Barbara Bush's first
child, young ``Georgie'' was along for the famous journey when his
father struck out for West Texas in a 1947 Studebaker.
 &HT;    He was a mischievous boy with a passion for sports, especially
baseball, and a penchant for wisecracks that may well have its
origins in a family tragedy. George was 7 years old when his
sister, Robin, 3, died of leukemia, and both of his parents told
friends that George seemed to develop a joking, bantering style in
a determined bid to lift them from their grief. (There are five
Bush children, four sons and a surviving daughter.)
 &HT;    He did spend many formative years in Midland, and attended the
public schools there. But while his identity as a Texan has never
been mocked to the degree his father's was, the younger Bush has
preppy credentials that parallel those of his father. He went to
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and to Yale University. In
fact, much of Bush's life seems to be a slightly eerie, and not
always successful, bid to retrace the footsteps of the famous
father.
 &HT;    ``You have to really understand how much his father was loved
and respected by so many people to understand what it would be like
to grow up as a namesake, the son of George Bush, `` said George W.
Bush's first cousin, John Ellis, a Boston-based marketing and
advertising consultant who is close to the governor.
 &HT;    ``There are all these parallels in his life. 'He went to
Andover, went to Yale, went to West Texas, ran for Congress, and at
every stage of that he was found wanting. To go through every stage
of life and be found wanting and know that people find you wanting,
that's a real grind.''
 &HT;    To Bush's critics, his prolonged rowdy days and his
unspectacular early career make his later political success _ in
which simply having the name ``George Bush'' was undeniably a
crucial, perhaps THE crucial, element _ all the more irritating,
and undeserved. But in Ellis' view, his cousin's later
achievements, which came after his marriage and his decision to
quit drinking, are all the more impressive in light of the wayward
years.
 &HT;    ``He gathered it together,'' said Ellis. ``George was on the
road to nowhere at 40. At the age of 52, he's the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination. That's a pretty incredible
turnaround.''
 &HT;    Bush himself does not deny that he is a classic late bloomer; he
refers to the ``nomadic years'' of his youth and once explained he
``kind of floated and saw a lot of life'' throughout his 20s. He
even jokes about all this, though one wonders if the stand-up
monologue he delivered to a howling audience this past winter at
Washington's elite Alfalfa Club, with his father present, had just
a tinge of bitter truth to it.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine how much it hurt,'' said George Walker Bush,
``to know that Dad's idea of the perfect son was'' _ and then he
paused before delivering the line that brought down the house _
``Al Gore?''
 &HT;    At Yale, just like his father, Bush was in the secretive Skull
and Bones club. He was president of his fraternity, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, though, as a less-than-diligent student, he did not follow
the old man into Phi Beta Kappa. In any event, he says he did not
like a lot of the ``intellectual arrogance'' and ''snobs'' at Yale,
and he cites one incident as particularly galling.
 &HT;    Several months after his father lost the 1964 Texas Senate
campaign to Ralph Yarborough, the incumbent Democratic populist,
Bush said he met Yale's prominent campus chaplain.
 &HT;    ``I ran into William Sloane Coffin, who was the preacher at
Yale, supposedly the guy that was there to comfort students,'' the
governor said. ``I introduced myself and he said, Yeah, I know your
father, and your father lost to a better man.''
 &HT;    Even today, 33 years later, Bush is clearly offended by the
statement, and it is one of the many reasons, he says, that he
couldn't wait to get back to Texas, after his graduation in 1968:
``Texas people are more polite. I don't think a Texan would do that
to a son.''
 &HT;    When Bush talks about his father, this is not the only trace of
bitterness. Victory in the Persian Gulf War, he told Texas Monthly,
was ``one of the great achievements of the 20th century, and it had
a shelf life of about a month.'' He is also still bothered, as he
later puts it in an interview, by the ``factors that caused this
good man to get defeated.''
 &HT;    And he raises at least one that could well resurface in some
fashion: ``Patrick J. Buchanan handing the baton, the proverbial
political knife, off to Ross Perot _ the kind of isolationism and
nativism and very harsh attacks against George Bush. You die a
death of a thousand cuts in the political process.''
 &HT;    George the younger obviously loves and reveres his father, and
he has plenty of characteristics _ the impish half-grin, the chop
in the air, the passion for foods that gross out some of his staff
(bologna sandwiches, in his case) _ that strikingly betray his
genes.
 &HT;    And yet, President Bush has been curiously absent from his son's
campaigns and oratory. Barbara Bush shows up much more often. One
of the governor's stock campaign jokes involves going to get his
hair cut, and having the barber marvel: ``I can't believe I'm
cutting the hair of the son of Barbara Bush.''
 &HT;    Partly, the governor simply wants to be seen as his own man _
not ``just another rich son of a Bush,'' as the Texas populist Jim
Hightower describes him. And for his part, the president ``almost
makes it a point not to advise him too much, on the theory that
people would say, 'Hey, you're just Daddy's boy,' `` said George
Strake, a former Republican state chairman in Texas and a Bush
family friend.
 &HT;    But there is clearly another undercurrent here. While President
Bush remains personally popular with Americans, any prominent role
in a national campaign could resurrect the ambivalence many
Republicans felt about him. And it could lead to questions about
just how his son differs from him politically, if at all.
 &HT;    Neither Bush nor his top aides will even take much of a stab at
that. (One, insisting he not be quoted by name, offered this
thought: ``I think the father was more of a noblesse oblige
politician, while George W. Bush is a conviction politician.''
Hardly a comparison to flatter the old man.)
 &HT;    President and Mrs. Bush declined requests for an interview for
this story. But a couple of weeks ago, a two-and-a-half-page letter
from Kennebunkport came whirring across my fax machine, a response
to a series of written questions.
 &HT;    In it, President Bush wrote of the ``enormous pride'' he felt as
he watched two of his sons make their way in public life. ``Both
Jeb and George were at my side in some pretty tough times,'' he
said, ``and they know firsthand what Teddy Roosevelt's `Arena' is
really like. I hope they never say, 'It's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    The former president said he was reluctant to speak out on
issues these days, ''because I don't want some reporter from
Washington rushing down to one of our sons after I stake out a
position on an issue saying: 'Your Dad says so and so. ... Why
don't you agree?'
 &HT;    ``I had my chance,'' Bush continued. ``Now it is their time and
I am determined to stay out of the way. To support them where they
want me to. But not to inadvertently cause complications for
them.''
 &HT;    George W. Bush knows that if he runs, everybody will be asking
questions about his relationship with his father. ``Doonesbury''
has already given the governor his cartoon identity: a junior-size
point of light. The governor says he's neither concerned nor
interested. ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm
not really thrilled about talking about,'' he explains. ``It's not
my thing.
 &HT;    ``You occasionally read about, 'Well, he must prove himself''' _
the governor draws out the words with a theatrical flair _ ```to be
different from his father.' The voice is out of Washington, and the
Echo Chamber. `Well, he must distinguish himself''' _ more emphasis
_ ```from his father.' Well, therein lies the dilemma. But I don't
listen to them. Because all I've got to do is be myself.
 &HT;    ``By being myself I will distinguish myself from my father,
because we're two separately different people. I've got half my
mother in me and half my father in me, which is a pretty
interesting combination.''
 &HT;    When George W. got back to Texas in 1968, he joined the Texas
Air National Guard and for five years spent some weekends and
longer stints flying fighter jets. His unit was never called for
service in the Vietnam War, and by enlisting in the guard, he was
automatically removed as a candidate for the military draft, an
issue that flared briefly in the 1994 gubernatorial campaign and
undoubtedly would again in a national race.
 &HT;    In 1992, gearing up for his Texas campaign, Bush told The New
York Times that while he was prepared to serve, he had trouble
remembering what his position was on the war when he was in
college. While that may sound implausible, people who knew him at
the time said that Bush indeed showed virtually no interest in
public policy, or politics.
 &HT;    It seems inconceivable, for instance, that he could ever have
written anyone a letter brooding over how to ``maintain my
political viability within the system,'' to use the memorable
phrase from a 1969 letter sent by a young man named Bill Clinton,
born the month after George W. Bush, to the director of the
University of Arkansas' Reserve Officers Training Corps program.
 &HT;    What most seems to have marked the decade after Bush graduated
from college was his wandering, carousing nature. He held a series
of jobs, working on an offshore rig and (miserably) for an
agricultural firm, and mentoring inner-city youth in Houston.
 &HT;    But he was best known as a major-league partygoer, often seen
driving around town in his Triumph and in the company of attractive
young women.
 &HT;    As governor, Bush has clearly succeeded in drawing a rather huge
zone of privacy around the question of just how wild his wild days
were. He declines to answer specific questions about matters such
as drug use.
 &HT;    ``There were things I did that were mistakes,'' he said. ``But I
think inventorying mistakes is a mistake. I think they send wrong
signals. I think they undermine the message.
 &HT;    ``I'd be the first to admit that I did irresponsible things when
I was young and irresponsible,'' he continued. ``I've assumed the
mantle of being a governor and a father in a responsible way, and
the signal we ought to send to our children is that in spite of
what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have learned some lessons.
And the lesson ought to be, don't be using drugs and alcohol. Learn
the lessons from the past.''

 WILD YOUNG '60s GUY JUMPS INTO MARRIAGE, BUSINESS and POLITICS

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There is something potentially incongruous about George W. Bush
as the self-described promoter of ``a responsibility era.'' As one
who seems to have indulged freely in his past, Bush now routinely
lectures high-schoolers to ``abstain from sex until you've found
the person you want to marry.''
 &HT;    And when Bush stepped ever so gingerly into the White House sex
scandal, saying recently he felt ``embarrassed for the country,''
Lanny J. Davis, a Clinton adviser, leapt in with a response. Noting
that he had been at Yale with Bush, Davis said on national
television that the governor ``shouldn't throw stones.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Bush's message is reflective of the country
at large. He is, after all, just one of countless tens of thousands
of parents who came of age in the 1960s and are now saying much the
same thing to their kids.
 &HT;    In a generally laudatory piece about Bush's campaign for values
in this summer's edition of City Journal, a publication of the
conservative Manhattan Institute, Tucker Carlson suggested that
Bush may in fact be the perfect spokesman for ``the politics of
virtue.''
 &HT;    ``Before his marriage, Bush had a reputation (from all accounts,
deserved) as something of a wild man,'' Carlson wrote. ``When he
speaks, it is as a grizzled veteran of the sexual revolution. But
he is a changed man.''
 &HT;    In a two-and-a-half-page letter, with responses to a series of
questions I posed for this article, President Bush (he declined to
be interviewed) made a point of dismissing the notion that his son
ever seriously lost his way in any of these years.
 &HT;    ``I asked Barbara to read this letter,'' the president wrote.
``She asked me to add that, like me, she never felt George was a
problem _ that he never had trouble 'finding himself.' She
believes, as I do, that 'the wild young man' thesis is greatly
overblown.
 &HT;    ``George really never had trouble 'finding himself,''' Bush
added in the next paragraph. ``He had some happy times, but none of
this 'worried' Barbara and me. He never lost his bearing. He always
came home.''
 &HT;    In 1973, George W. Bush decided he wanted to become serious
about a business career, and he entered Harvard Business School.
Two years later, driving a 1970 Cutlass, he retraced a famous
journey to West Texas his father made in 1948, and headed back
south and west toward dusty Midland. True, given his family
contacts, this was hardly a journey into the great unknown.
 &HT;    Bush's plan was to jump into the oil business, but before long
he was jumping into other things as well: marriage and politics. In
1977, he married Laura Welch, a librarian and schoolteacher from
Midland who is, by wide agreement, a crucial influence in both the
governor's personal transformation and his political success.
 &HT;    With a down-to-earth style, an infectious sense of humor and
campaigns reminiscent of her mother-in-law's, for breast-cancer
awareness and literacy, she is wildly popular in Texas.
 &HT;    Having rarely even been in the area for a decade before his
return, Bush made a brash decision when the 44-year incumbent
Democratic congressman, George Mahon, announced his retirement that
same year. At the age of 31, Bush declared for the seat, and he and
Laura were off on what they call their extended honeymoon.
 &HT;    ``We had a really great time,'' recalls Laura Bush with a hearty
laugh, during an interview at the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
``It was a great way to spend the first year of marriage. We drove
up and down the Panhandle of Texas, from Hereford to Midland.''
 &HT;    In that campaign, Bush got his first taste of themes that
plagued his father's own races in Texas, which included two losing
bids for the U.S. Senate. George W.'s Democratic opponent, Kent
Hance, now a friend and supporter, cleverly played up Bush's
prep-school, Ivy League credentials, which didn't exactly go over
big in rough-and-tumble places such as Odessa.
 &HT;    With his father serving on international boards such as the
Rockefeller-financed Trilateral Commission, the candidate found
himself hectored by groups who said he too was surely a tool of the
New World Order. He finally had to go on record with his opposition
to ``one-world government and one monetary system.''
 &HT;    ``And if the Trilateral Commission supports those things,'' he
explained at the time, ``I'm sure my father is a dissenting
voice.''
 &HT;    Bush lost and, any political aspirations of his own put on hold
for the next decade and a half, he burrowed into the oil business,
founding an exploration company and digging into mineral records.
He was still known as a big party guy, and his friends gave him no
end of a hard time about being both a tightwad and a notoriously
sloppy dresser.
 &HT;    ``George would wear anything anyone would give him,'' said Dr.
Charles Younger, an orthopedic surgeon in Midland and a longtime
friend.
 &HT;    As the holiday season approached one year, his friends all got
together and collected a sheaf of tacky corporate Christmas cards
from West Texas oil firms, then conspicuously crossed out the
company name under the greeting and replaced it with ``Merry
Christmas, from George and Laura Bush.''
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is, I think at least half the people who got
them probably thought it was for real,'' Younger said, laughing.
``It just looked like, Here's that cheapskate Bush at it again,
trying to save money on his Christmas cards.''
 &HT;    But if Bush was a funny character with a pack of friends and a
fondness for good times, there was, by his own account and that of
his wife and friends, a problem with alcohol. He had drunk a lot
for years, and at times his boisterousness became downright
obnoxious: in one infamous incident, a well-lubricated Bush nearly
gave an old friend of his parents a heart attack at a cocktail
party, when he stumbled up to the matronly, elaborately dressed and
coiffed woman and said to her, ``So, what's sex like after 50,
anyway?''
 &HT;    In another incident, at the age of 26, he ran over a neighbor's
trash can and, according to a story that circulated in the 1994
campaign, challenged his perturbed father to go ``mano a mano''
when the senior Bush came out to inspect the damage. Bush now says
the story originated as a joking account by his mother, and has
been exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a fight,'' he said. ``It was an incident where I
drank too much, I believe was the background. It was kind of a
feisty guy talking to a father, and he kind of dismissed me, I
guess was what happened. I can't remember the exact words.''
 &HT;    Laura Bush says she wanted her husband to give up drinking, a
request she says she made not constantly, ``but every once in a
while, after some night that wasn't particularly great.'' Friends
say the marriage was seriously strained, though the governor denies
accounts by some that Laura gave him some sort of ultimatum.
 &HT;    ``Jack Daniels or the road?'' Bush said. ``I don't think so. I
don't remember that. No. She's a pretty patient person.''
 &HT;    In the end, Bush dealt with the problem in a characteristic way:
decisively, impulsively and without much evident introspection, at
least that he has shared publicly _ unlike, say, his predecessor,
former Texas Gov. Ann W. Richards, a dedicated member of Alcoholics
Anonymous who openly and widely discussed her problems with
alcohol.
 &HT;    On a summer night in 1986, spent with his wife and friends at
the Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs in celebration of his and
some friends' 40th birthdays that year, Bush partied heartily. He
woke up with a raging hangover. To his stunned friends, he simply
began announcing that he had made a decision never to drink again.
 &HT;    It was a spontaneous pledge but one he has kept, Bush says. As
he put it to me a few years ago when I was preparing a story about
the contrasting ways in which he and Richards viewed
addiction-treatment programs in the state prison system (in sum, he
has much more faith in the cold-turkey approach): ``I quit for the
rest of my life and if you catch me drinking, it's not going to be
a good sign for your old buddy George.''
 &HT;    To this day, Bush says he does not know whether he is or was an
alcoholic. He thinks not, but he isn't really interested in
exploring the subject. ``I'm a high-energy person, and alcohol
competes with your energy,'' he said. ``It really does. So I
quit.''
 &HT;    During this time, Bush also got serious about the oil business,
prospering in the boom and skirting, like just about every other
oilman in Texas, financial ruin in the bust. His company merged
with another, struggled and in 1986 merged with the Harken Energy
Corp. of Irving, Texas, in a deal that gave him a financial
interest, directorship, consultancy and access to below-market
interest rates to buy more than $500,000 worth of stock.
 &HT;    With his father in the White House as vice president, George
W.'s break raised some eyebrows at the time, even more so when the
little-known Harken, which until that point had virtually no
experience in overseas exploration, won a lucrative contract to
drill for oil in Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf.
 &HT;    He also sold a large block of stock just before the company
announced poor quarterly earnings, raising questions of whether he
improperly used inside information. But George W. was never found
to have traded on his father's position to help the company nor
charged with any wrongdoing.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    By 1987, with his father set to launch a presidential campaign,
George W. Bush too was immersed in politics.
 &HT;    He spent months traipsing around Iowa and New Hampshire, making
contacts that actually may come in handy if he becomes _ as many
predict will be the case _ the Republican standard-bearer in 2000.
 &HT;    It was George W. who coordinated the job of making sure that
Bush loyalists were rewarded in the new administration.
 &HT;    But the younger Bush, expressing distaste for Washington and
perhaps with an eye on his own political future, moved back to
Dallas in 1989, getting involved in the venture he repeatedly
pointed to in his 1994 campaign for Texas governor as his signal
accomplishment: the new ballpark for the Rangers baseball team.
 &HT;    Part of a group that purchased 84 percent of the Rangers that
year for $86 million, Bush's own personal investment was barely
more than $600,000. He was made one of two managing partners, a
high-profile job that gave him frequent media exposure, at least on
the sports pages in Dallas and Fort Worth.
 &HT;    He was a constant presence at games, somewhat indelicately
explaining that he thought it important for ``folks to see me
sitting in the same seat they sit in, eating the same popcorn,
peeing in the same urinal.''
 &HT;    The major project during Bush's time with the club was the
planning and construction of the Ballpark in Arlington, one of the
new generation of old-fashioned baseball stadiums to which fans
have flocked in recent years. When he ran for governor in 1994 and
faced questions about his record (``eight games out of first,'' ran
the joke), Bush cited the park, more than a bit plaintively, as
proof of his ability to plan and execute big things.
 &HT;    ``My biggest liability in Texas is, What's the boy ever done?''
he told one paper. ``So he's got a famous father and ran a small
oil company. ... Now I can say I've done something. Here it is.''
To another, he explained: ``When all those people in Austin say,
'He ain't never done anything,' Well, this is it.''
 &HT;    The granite-and-brick Ballpark is indeed a thing of beauty, and
attendance at Rangers games soared. That the park was built with
the help of a voter-approved half-cent sales tax as well as with
eminent domain proceedings that generated local controversy has led
Bush's critics to suggest that his one self-described big thing is
curiously inconsistent with his conservative message.
 &HT;    ``Whether the public interest issue is taxes, size of
government, property rights or public subsidies of private sports
ventures,'' editorialized the liberal Texas Observer in a May 1997
article headlined ``Stealing Home,'' ``Bush's personal ownership in
the Texas Rangers baseball team has been wildly at odds with his
publicly declared positions on those issues.''
 &HT;    Whatever it says about his political philosophy, his relatively
small initial investment with the Rangers has turned out to be
immensely profitable, leading to recurring questions about whether
his corporate friends found a clever way to set him up financially
and thus free him up for politics.
 &HT;    Under his contract, his interest grew by an additional 10
percent as compensation for his service as managing partner. That
overall partnership merged with other investors and this year the
whole ownership was sold for $250 million, a deal netting Bush
$14.9 million.
 &HT;    Given the taxpayers' subsidy, this enormous profit has generated
criticism from State Land Commissioner Garry Mauro, Bush's
Democratic opponent, who calls it ``plain old corporate welfare.''
Bush said the ballpark is generating tax revenues that more than
offset the original sales-tax increase, and his office describes
the overall deal as a ``win-win'' situation for both Bush and
Arlington taxpayers.
 &HT;    Dissuading all other Republicans with his famous name and
powerful access to campaign funds, Bush got the gubernatorial
nomination in 1994 unopposed. It ventures far into the realm of
psychology to wonder just how much Bush was _ is _ motivated by
proving himself worthy of his famous name. While all this is
precisely the kind of ``psychobabble'' that both George Bushes
insist they don't indulge in anyway, John Ellis, his first cousin,
who lives in Boston, thinks it is ultimately off base.
 &HT;    ``I really think the opposite is true here,'' Ellis said. ``What
he was caught in for a long time was an 'I'll never be good enough,
I'll never be good enough' deal. At some point, though, he decided,
'I'll just take what I've got and we'll see what we can do with
that.' People will say he's running to prove something to the old
man, but the thing that really liberated him was the realization
that he didn't have to be his old man.''
 &HT;    As governor, Bush is a strong supporter of the death penalty and
has presided over a record number of executions, including that of
Karla Faye Tucker, the first woman put to death in Texas since the
Civil War and whose case sparked an international uproar earlier
this year. Bush's stance is broadly supported in Texas; it could
conceivably cause him problems in a general election in less
conservative states, though not, most likely, in the Republican
primaries.
 &HT;    And while other governors with an eye on the White House,
including those in Wisconsin and Michigan, have devised sweeping
job-training programs aimed at getting recipients off welfare,
Texas lags in that area, in large part because its welfare payments
are so low that there is little money available for such
approaches.
 &HT;    Bush applies the following spin to the state's relatively
minuscule welfare stipends: ``If you're trying to move people from
welfare to work,'' he says, ``that's exactly where you want your
payments to be.''
 &HT;    During his years as governor, Bush has grown far more
comfortable on the hustings. He is capable of moving an audience
with words like this: ``Today's challenge lies not so much outside
our borders as inside our souls.'' And he can make them laugh, as
when he cites his travails as the father of twin teen-age
daughters, Barbara and Jenna.
 &HT;    ``No one warned me!'' he says in mock horror. ``There are not
enough DPS officers in Austin to protect my fellow Texans from
these new drivers.''
 &HT;    Around the Capitol, his style is jocular and informal, and he is
not exactly known as a policy wonk. It is not lost on visitors that
his office is lined with cases full of baseballs, not books.
Meetings with Bush do not drag on into the wee hours.
 &HT;    ``Like a lot of great leaders,'' State Sen. Teel Bivins, a
Republican from Amarillo, jokingly says, ``he has about a 20-second
attention span. He listens to your issues, analyzes, gets to the
heart of them, makes a decision, gets bored and is ready to move
on.''
 &HT;    Everywhere he goes, the governor is asked if he will run for
Dad's old job. He says he genuinely does not know. ``The bubble,''
he says, summarizing what he calls the case against going for it
all. ``It's the perpetual bubble. It's not a one-time bubble. It's
life.''
 &HT;    Or, as Laura Bush cheerfully puts it: ``It's sort of a stretch
for me, because I could just as soon, you know, hang around and
work in the yard.''
 &HT;    Bush says that if he runs, it will be because he has a clear and
compelling idea in his mind of where he wants to take the nation _
and not because he wants to avenge his father's defeat in 1992.
``You can't lead people from a pessimistic or revengeful point of
view,'' he says.
 &HT;    The general consensus among the governor's friends is that,
inevitably, he will run. It's in the family's blood. If Bush does
run, he is likely to encounter little trouble finding money. He is
already generating huge amounts from out of state. (Nearly half of
his most recent four-month haul of $4.4 million came from outside
Texas.)
 &HT;    There is certainly a case to be made against George Bush. There
are entire realms of policy _ such as, say, foreign policy _ that
he has simply never dealt with. Albert R. Hunt, a Wall Street
Journal columnist, recently observed that that Bush would be the
Republicans' ``most inexperienced nominee since Wendell Willkie in
1940.''
 &HT;    As the nomination fight gets under way, Bush is unlikely to
start off with the firm blessing of the religious right. ``I don't
think that George W. Bush would be the favored candidate of the
religious right under any circumstances _ he's far too moderate for
them,'' said John C. Green, a professor at the University of Akron
and an expert on the religious right in American politics. ``He
could be their second choice, or their third or fourth or fifth.
That's the big question.''
 &HT;    The governor does have an important bridge to at least one
faction of religious conservatives: not the militantly
rather-be-right-than-be-president set, but the more pragmatic wing
embodied by Ralph Reed, the former executive director of the
Christian Coalition and current political strategist, with whom
Bush talks frequently.
 &HT;    Many Republicans think Reed is likely to settle on Bush as a
candidate who can advance at least part of the agenda of religious
conservatives _ and actually win a general election. On the record,
Reed would say only that the Republican Party is likely to have
``an embarrassment of riches, a heck of a lot of great candidates
out there'' in 2000.
 &HT;    There is also the question of groundwork. A spokesman for Lamar
Alexander, for instance, notes that the former Tennessee governor,
who ran in 1996 and plans to do so again in 2000, has spent an
average of a few days every month in both Iowa and New Hampshire
these past few years. Since becoming governor, Bush has literally
not set foot in either state. That may mean a great deal, but then
again, it may not.
 &HT;    ``What someone like Lamar Alexander could do with 1,000 lobster
dinners in New Hampshire, someone like George Bush could walk in
and do on the first day,'' says Alex Castellanos, a Republican
consultant. ``Because he's not George W. Smith. He's George W.
Bush.''

 WILD YOUNG '60s GUY JUMPS INTO MARRIAGE, BUSINESS and POLITICS

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    There is something potentially incongruous about George W. Bush
as the self-described promoter of ``a responsibility era.'' As one
who seems to have indulged freely in his past, Bush now routinely
lectures high-schoolers to ``abstain from sex until you've found
the person you want to marry.''
 &HT;    And when Bush stepped ever so gingerly into the White House sex
scandal, saying recently he felt ``embarrassed for the country,''
Lanny J. Davis, a Clinton adviser, leapt in with a response. Noting
that he had been at Yale with Bush, Davis said on national
television that the governor ``shouldn't throw stones.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, Bush's message is reflective of the country
at large. He is, after all, just one of countless tens of thousands
of parents who came of age in the 1960s and are now saying much the
same thing to their kids.
 &HT;    In a generally laudatory piece about Bush's campaign for values
in this summer's edition of City Journal, a publication of the
conservative Manhattan Institute, Tucker Carlson suggested that
Bush may in fact be the perfect spokesman for ``the politics of
virtue.''
 &HT;    ``Before his marriage, Bush had a reputation (from all accounts,
deserved) as something of a wild man,'' Carlson wrote. ``When he
speaks, it is as a grizzled veteran of the sexual revolution. But
he is a changed man.''
 &HT;    In a two-and-a-half-page letter, with responses to a series of
questions I posed for this article, President Bush (he declined to
be interviewed) made a point of dismissing the notion that his son
ever seriously lost his way in any of these years.
 &HT;    ``I asked Barbara to read this letter,'' the president wrote.
``She asked me to add that, like me, she never felt George was a
problem _ that he never had trouble 'finding himself.' She
believes, as I do, that 'the wild young man' thesis is greatly
overblown.
 &HT;    ``George really never had trouble 'finding himself,''' Bush
added in the next paragraph. ``He had some happy times, but none of
this 'worried' Barbara and me. He never lost his bearing. He always
came home.''
 &HT;    In 1973, George W. Bush decided he wanted to become serious
about a business career, and he entered Harvard Business School.
Two years later, driving a 1970 Cutlass, he retraced a famous
journey to West Texas his father made in 1948, and headed back
south and west toward dusty Midland. True, given his family
contacts, this was hardly a journey into the great unknown.
 &HT;    Bush's plan was to jump into the oil business, but before long
he was jumping into other things as well: marriage and politics. In
1977, he married Laura Welch, a librarian and schoolteacher from
Midland who is, by wide agreement, a crucial influence in both the
governor's personal transformation and his political success.
 &HT;    With a down-to-earth style, an infectious sense of humor and
campaigns reminiscent of her mother-in-law's, for breast-cancer
awareness and literacy, she is wildly popular in Texas.
 &HT;    Having rarely even been in the area for a decade before his
return, Bush made a brash decision when the 44-year incumbent
Democratic congressman, George Mahon, announced his retirement that
same year. At the age of 31, Bush declared for the seat, and he and
Laura were off on what they call their extended honeymoon.
 &HT;    ``We had a really great time,'' recalls Laura Bush with a hearty
laugh, during an interview at the Governor's Mansion in Austin.
``It was a great way to spend the first year of marriage. We drove
up and down the Panhandle of Texas, from Hereford to Midland.''
 &HT;    In that campaign, Bush got his first taste of themes that
plagued his father's own races in Texas, which included two losing
bids for the U.S. Senate. George W.'s Democratic opponent, Kent
Hance, now a friend and supporter, cleverly played up Bush's
prep-school, Ivy League credentials, which didn't exactly go over
big in rough-and-tumble places such as Odessa.
 &HT;    With his father serving on international boards such as the
Rockefeller-financed Trilateral Commission, the candidate found
himself hectored by groups who said he too was surely a tool of the
New World Order. He finally had to go on record with his opposition
to ``one-world government and one monetary system.''
 &HT;    ``And if the Trilateral Commission supports those things,'' he
explained at the time, ``I'm sure my father is a dissenting
voice.''
 &HT;    Bush lost and, any political aspirations of his own put on hold
for the next decade and a half, he burrowed into the oil business,
founding an exploration company and digging into mineral records.
He was still known as a big party guy, and his friends gave him no
end of a hard time about being both a tightwad and a notoriously
sloppy dresser.
 &HT;    ``George would wear anything anyone would give him,'' said Dr.
Charles Younger, an orthopedic surgeon in Midland and a longtime
friend.
 &HT;    As the holiday season approached one year, his friends all got
together and collected a sheaf of tacky corporate Christmas cards
from West Texas oil firms, then conspicuously crossed out the
company name under the greeting and replaced it with ``Merry
Christmas, from George and Laura Bush.''
 &HT;    ``The funny thing is, I think at least half the people who got
them probably thought it was for real,'' Younger said, laughing.
``It just looked like, Here's that cheapskate Bush at it again,
trying to save money on his Christmas cards.''
 &HT;    But if Bush was a funny character with a pack of friends and a
fondness for good times, there was, by his own account and that of
his wife and friends, a problem with alcohol. He had drunk a lot
for years, and at times his boisterousness became downright
obnoxious: in one infamous incident, a well-lubricated Bush nearly
gave an old friend of his parents a heart attack at a cocktail
party, when he stumbled up to the matronly, elaborately dressed and
coiffed woman and said to her, ``So, what's sex like after 50,
anyway?''
 &HT;    In another incident, at the age of 26, he ran over a neighbor's
trash can and, according to a story that circulated in the 1994
campaign, challenged his perturbed father to go ``mano a mano''
when the senior Bush came out to inspect the damage. Bush now says
the story originated as a joking account by his mother, and has
been exaggerated.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't a fight,'' he said. ``It was an incident where I
drank too much, I believe was the background. It was kind of a
feisty guy talking to a father, and he kind of dismissed me, I
guess was what happened. I can't remember the exact words.''
 &HT;    Laura Bush says she wanted her husband to give up drinking, a
request she says she made not constantly, ``but every once in a
while, after some night that wasn't particularly great.'' Friends
say the marriage was seriously strained, though the governor denies
accounts by some that Laura gave him some sort of ultimatum.
 &HT;    ``Jack Daniels or the road?'' Bush said. ``I don't think so. I
don't remember that. No. She's a pretty patient person.''
 &HT;    In the end, Bush dealt with the problem in a characteristic way:
decisively, impulsively and without much evident introspection, at
least that he has shared publicly _ unlike, say, his predecessor,
former Texas Gov. Ann W. Richards, a dedicated member of Alcoholics
Anonymous who openly and widely discussed her problems with
alcohol.
 &HT;    On a summer night in 1986, spent with his wife and friends at
the Broadmoor resort in Colorado Springs in celebration of his and
some friends' 40th birthdays that year, Bush partied heartily. He
woke up with a raging hangover. To his stunned friends, he simply
began announcing that he had made a decision never to drink again.
 &HT;    It was a spontaneous pledge but one he has kept, Bush says. As
he put it to me a few years ago when I was preparing a story about
the contrasting ways in which he and Richards viewed
addiction-treatment programs in the state prison system (in sum, he
has much more faith in the cold-turkey approach): ``I quit for the
rest of my life and if you catch me drinking, it's not going to be
a good sign for your old buddy George.''
 &HT;    To this day, Bush says he does not know whether he is or was an
alcoholic. He thinks not, but he isn't really interested in
exploring the subject. ``I'm a high-energy person, and alcohol
competes with your energy,'' he said. ``It really does. So I
quit.''
 &HT;    During this time, Bush also got serious about the oil business,
prospering in the boom and skirting, like just about every other
oilman in Texas, financial ruin in the bust. His company merged
with another, struggled and in 1986 merged with the Harken Energy
Corp. of Irving, Texas, in a deal that gave him a financial
interest, directorship, consultancy and access to below-market
interest rates to buy more than $500,000 worth of stock.
 &HT;    With his father in the White House as vice president, George
W.'s break raised some eyebrows at the time, even more so when the
little-known Harken, which until that point had virtually no
experience in overseas exploration, won a lucrative contract to
drill for oil in Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf.
 &HT;    He also sold a large block of stock just before the company
announced poor quarterly earnings, raising questions of whether he
improperly used inside information. But George W. was never found
to have traded on his father's position to help the company nor
charged with any wrongdoing.

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    George W. Bush, the governor of Texas, likes to say that the
fundamental difference between him and his father is that the
former president attended Greenwich Country Day School, while he
went to San Jacinto Junior High School in Midland, Texas.
 &HT;    Born in 1946 in New Haven, George and Barbara Bush's first
child, young ``Georgie'' was along for the famous journey when his
father struck out for West Texas in a 1947 Studebaker.
 &HT;    He was a mischievous boy with a passion for sports, especially
baseball, and a penchant for wisecracks that may well have its
origins in a family tragedy. George was 7 years old when his
sister, Robin, 3, died of leukemia, and both of his parents told
friends that George seemed to develop a joking, bantering style in
a determined bid to lift them from their grief. (There are five
Bush children, four sons and a surviving daughter.)
 &HT;    He did spend many formative years in Midland, and attended the
public schools there. But while his identity as a Texan has never
been mocked to the degree his father's was, the younger Bush has
preppy credentials that parallel those of his father. He went to
Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., and to Yale University. In
fact, much of Bush's life seems to be a slightly eerie, and not
always successful, bid to retrace the footsteps of the famous
father.
 &HT;    ``You have to really understand how much his father was loved
and respected by so many people to understand what it would be like
to grow up as a namesake, the son of George Bush, `` said George W.
Bush's first cousin, John Ellis, a Boston-based marketing and
advertising consultant who is close to the governor.
 &HT;    ``There are all these parallels in his life. 'He went to
Andover, went to Yale, went to West Texas, ran for Congress, and at
every stage of that he was found wanting. To go through every stage
of life and be found wanting and know that people find you wanting,
that's a real grind.''
 &HT;    To Bush's critics, his prolonged rowdy days and his
unspectacular early career make his later political success _ in
which simply having the name ``George Bush'' was undeniably a
crucial, perhaps THE crucial, element _ all the more irritating,
and undeserved. But in Ellis' view, his cousin's later
achievements, which came after his marriage and his decision to
quit drinking, are all the more impressive in light of the wayward
years.
 &HT;    ``He gathered it together,'' said Ellis. ``George was on the
road to nowhere at 40. At the age of 52, he's the front-runner for
the Republican presidential nomination. That's a pretty incredible
turnaround.''
 &HT;    Bush himself does not deny that he is a classic late bloomer; he
refers to the ``nomadic years'' of his youth and once explained he
``kind of floated and saw a lot of life'' throughout his 20s. He
even jokes about all this, though one wonders if the stand-up
monologue he delivered to a howling audience this past winter at
Washington's elite Alfalfa Club, with his father present, had just
a tinge of bitter truth to it.
 &HT;    ``Can you imagine how much it hurt,'' said George Walker Bush,
``to know that Dad's idea of the perfect son was'' _ and then he
paused before delivering the line that brought down the house _
``Al Gore?''
 &HT;    At Yale, just like his father, Bush was in the secretive Skull
and Bones club. He was president of his fraternity, Delta Kappa
Epsilon, though, as a less-than-diligent student, he did not follow
the old man into Phi Beta Kappa. In any event, he says he did not
like a lot of the ``intellectual arrogance'' and ''snobs'' at Yale,
and he cites one incident as particularly galling.
 &HT;    Several months after his father lost the 1964 Texas Senate
campaign to Ralph Yarborough, the incumbent Democratic populist,
Bush said he met Yale's prominent campus chaplain.
 &HT;    ``I ran into William Sloane Coffin, who was the preacher at
Yale, supposedly the guy that was there to comfort students,'' the
governor said. ``I introduced myself and he said, Yeah, I know your
father, and your father lost to a better man.''
 &HT;    Even today, 33 years later, Bush is clearly offended by the
statement, and it is one of the many reasons, he says, that he
couldn't wait to get back to Texas, after his graduation in 1968:
``Texas people are more polite. I don't think a Texan would do that
to a son.''
 &HT;    When Bush talks about his father, this is not the only trace of
bitterness. Victory in the Persian Gulf War, he told Texas Monthly,
was ``one of the great achievements of the 20th century, and it had
a shelf life of about a month.'' He is also still bothered, as he
later puts it in an interview, by the ``factors that caused this
good man to get defeated.''
 &HT;    And he raises at least one that could well resurface in some
fashion: ``Patrick J. Buchanan handing the baton, the proverbial
political knife, off to Ross Perot _ the kind of isolationism and
nativism and very harsh attacks against George Bush. You die a
death of a thousand cuts in the political process.''
 &HT;    George the younger obviously loves and reveres his father, and
he has plenty of characteristics _ the impish half-grin, the chop
in the air, the passion for foods that gross out some of his staff
(bologna sandwiches, in his case) _ that strikingly betray his
genes.
 &HT;    And yet, President Bush has been curiously absent from his son's
campaigns and oratory. Barbara Bush shows up much more often. One
of the governor's stock campaign jokes involves going to get his
hair cut, and having the barber marvel: ``I can't believe I'm
cutting the hair of the son of Barbara Bush.''
 &HT;    Partly, the governor simply wants to be seen as his own man _
not ``just another rich son of a Bush,'' as the Texas populist Jim
Hightower describes him. And for his part, the president ``almost
makes it a point not to advise him too much, on the theory that
people would say, 'Hey, you're just Daddy's boy,' `` said George
Strake, a former Republican state chairman in Texas and a Bush
family friend.
 &HT;    But there is clearly another undercurrent here. While President
Bush remains personally popular with Americans, any prominent role
in a national campaign could resurrect the ambivalence many
Republicans felt about him. And it could lead to questions about
just how his son differs from him politically, if at all.
 &HT;    Neither Bush nor his top aides will even take much of a stab at
that. (One, insisting he not be quoted by name, offered this
thought: ``I think the father was more of a noblesse oblige
politician, while George W. Bush is a conviction politician.''
Hardly a comparison to flatter the old man.)
 &HT;    President and Mrs. Bush declined requests for an interview for
this story. But a couple of weeks ago, a two-and-a-half-page letter
from Kennebunkport came whirring across my fax machine, a response
to a series of written questions.
 &HT;    In it, President Bush wrote of the ``enormous pride'' he felt as
he watched two of his sons make their way in public life. ``Both
Jeb and George were at my side in some pretty tough times,'' he
said, ``and they know firsthand what Teddy Roosevelt's `Arena' is
really like. I hope they never say, 'It's not worth it.'''
 &HT;    The former president said he was reluctant to speak out on
issues these days, ''because I don't want some reporter from
Washington rushing down to one of our sons after I stake out a
position on an issue saying: 'Your Dad says so and so. ... Why
don't you agree?'
 &HT;    ``I had my chance,'' Bush continued. ``Now it is their time and
I am determined to stay out of the way. To support them where they
want me to. But not to inadvertently cause complications for
them.''
 &HT;    George W. Bush knows that if he runs, everybody will be asking
questions about his relationship with his father. ``Doonesbury''
has already given the governor his cartoon identity: a junior-size
point of light. The governor says he's neither concerned nor
interested. ``These are the kind of psychological analyses that I'm
not really thrilled about talking about,'' he explains. ``It's not
my thing.
 &HT;    ``You occasionally read about, 'Well, he must prove himself''' _
the governor draws out the words with a theatrical flair _ ```to be
different from his father.' The voice is out of Washington, and the
Echo Chamber. `Well, he must distinguish himself''' _ more emphasis
_ ```from his father.' Well, therein lies the dilemma. But I don't
listen to them. Because all I've got to do is be myself.
 &HT;    ``By being myself I will distinguish myself from my father,
because we're two separately different people. I've got half my
mother in me and half my father in me, which is a pretty
interesting combination.''
 &HT;    When George W. got back to Texas in 1968, he joined the Texas
Air National Guard and for five years spent some weekends and
longer stints flying fighter jets. His unit was never called for
service in the Vietnam War, and by enlisting in the guard, he was
automatically removed as a candidate for the military draft, an
issue that flared briefly in the 1994 gubernatorial campaign and
undoubtedly would again in a national race.
 &HT;    In 1992, gearing up for his Texas campaign, Bush told The New
York Times that while he was prepared to serve, he had trouble
remembering what his position was on the war when he was in
college. While that may sound implausible, people who knew him at
the time said that Bush indeed showed virtually no interest in
public policy, or politics.
 &HT;    It seems inconceivable, for instance, that he could ever have
written anyone a letter brooding over how to ``maintain my
political viability within the system,'' to use the memorable
phrase from a 1969 letter sent by a young man named Bill Clinton,
born the month after George W. Bush, to the director of the
University of Arkansas' Reserve Officers Training Corps program.
 &HT;    What most seems to have marked the decade after Bush graduated
from college was his wandering, carousing nature. He held a series
of jobs, working on an offshore rig and (miserably) for an
agricultural firm, and mentoring inner-city youth in Houston.
 &HT;    But he was best known as a major-league partygoer, often seen
driving around town in his Triumph and in the company of attractive
young women.
 &HT;    As governor, Bush has clearly succeeded in drawing a rather huge
zone of privacy around the question of just how wild his wild days
were. He declines to answer specific questions about matters such
as drug use.
 &HT;    ``There were things I did that were mistakes,'' he said. ``But I
think inventorying mistakes is a mistake. I think they send wrong
signals. I think they undermine the message.
 &HT;    ``I'd be the first to admit that I did irresponsible things when
I was young and irresponsible,'' he continued. ``I've assumed the
mantle of being a governor and a father in a responsible way, and
the signal we ought to send to our children is that in spite of
what happened in the '60s and '70s, we have learned some lessons.
And the lesson ought to be, don't be using drugs and alcohol. Learn
the lessons from the past.''

 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 NOTE: Full-length article (8,600 words) available on request  
 &HT;    George Walker Bush was visiting his parents in the White House
one day when the talk turned to religion, which is precisely the
subject that some powerful factions in the Republican Party want
their presidential standard-bearer to talk about, forcefully, in
2000.
 &HT;    But Bush, sitting one day recently on a sofa in the governor's
office at the Texas State Capitol, says he is ``cautious about
wearing my religion on my sleeve in the political process.'' And he
offers this particular story to explain why.
 &HT;    ``Mother and I were arguing _ not arguing, having a discussion _
and discussing who goes to Heaven,'' recalls the governor, who at
the time had religion very much on his mind.
 &HT;    Having dealt with a gathering drinking problem by abruptly
swearing off alcohol, he had vowed a renewed commitment to his
family and his faith. Bush pointed to the Bible: Only Christians
had a place in heaven.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mom, look, all I can tell you is what the New
Testament says. And she said, well, surely, God will accept others.
And I said, Mom, here's what the New Testament says. And she said,
OK, and she picks up the phone and calls Billy Graham. She says to
the White House operator, Get me Billy Graham.
 &HT;    ``I said, Mother, what are you doing?'' Bush continues,
chuckling at the memory. ``Seriously. And about two minutes later,
the phone rings, and it's Billy Graham, and Mother and I are on the
phone with Billy. And Mother explains the circumstances, and Billy
says, From a personal perspective, I agree with what George is
saying, the New Testament has been my guide. But I want to caution
you both. Don't play God. Who are you two to be God?''
 &HT;    For George W. Bush, a man who, in large part because of his
famous name, shows up in most polls these days as the very early
front-runner for a Republican presidential nomination battle that
is still more than a year away, it is an interesting story to
choose to relate.
 &HT;    Bush says it explains in part why he urged an end to ``name
calling'' this summer when a fracas broke out over his party's
decision to bar a gay Republican group from setting up a booth at
the GOP state convention.
 &HT;    ``There are some great admonitions in the Bible, talking about,
you know, don't try to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye
when you've got a log in your own,'' Bush says. ``I'm mindful of
that.''
 &HT;    And in his nearly four years as governor of the nation's
second-largest state, there has been strikingly little name-calling
from Bush. He talks constantly about being a ``unifier, not a
divider,'' and few things seem to make him happier than forging a
bipartisan consensus on some big bill.
 &HT;    He has grown so close to some Democratic lawmakers that he once
said there was ``no way in the world'' he could bring himself to
campaign against them.
 &HT;    Running now for his own re-election, Bush campaigns ferociously
in Democratic strongholds such as El Paso, where he breaks into
near-fluent Spanish before a delighted crowd at a ''Viva Bush!''
rally and where the Democratic mayor, Carlos Ramirez, introduces
him as ``the best governor of Texas that El Paso has ever had.''
 &HT;    For these and many other reasons, the 52-year-old eldest son of
former President George Bush is riding a broad wave of popularity
that, if current polls hold true, will carry him to a sweeping
victory this November as the first governor re-elected in Texas in
24 years, the first ever elected to back-to-back four-year terms.
 &HT;    Already, more than 100 Democratic officeholders have endorsed
him, including the state's lieutenant governor, a gruff political
veteran named Bob Bullock, who announced his support for Bush's
re-election even though he is godfather to the daughter of Bush's
Democratic opponent, Garry Mauro, the state land commissioner.
 &HT;    But if all this bodes well for Bush's re-election prospects in
Texas, and arguably for his prospects as a national candidate in a
general election, it also raises some obvious and perhaps
treacherous questions for the governor.
 &HT;    These are questions he would surely find tossed at him by
primary opponents if, in a step he is widely expected to take, he
runs for his father's old job. Just why do all those Democrats like
him so much? What kind of a Republican is he?
 &HT;    Why, for example, have some of his fiercest battles been with
his fellow Republicans? Some, including the state chairman of his
party at the time, are still furious with the governor over a tax
proposal he devised that would have radically reshaped the state
tax system, providing more money for some of the poorest public
schools in part by slapping new taxes on some of the biggest
industries.
 &HT;    Reticent on abortion, disinclined to denounce homosexuals, a
self-described fiscal conservative who is willing to spend money on
new programs such as a huge public-school reading initiative, Bush
does not seem to be offering the orthodoxy that some Republican
conservatives insist will be necessary in the party's candidate in
2000.
 &HT;    For all the speculation right now over whether Bush will want to
run for president _ speculation that has only seemed to grow more
fevered as scandal engulfs President Bill Clinton and threatens
Vice President Al Gore, the Democrat with the most obvious
presidential ambitions _ the more intriguing question may in time
turn out to be whether today's Republican Party wants someone like
Bush as its nominee.
 &HT;    Many party foot soldiers, still angry over the way they feel the
1996 nominee, Bob Dole, essentially ignored abortion, school prayer
and other issues they care most about, are determined to find a
candidate who will carry the torch _ or else. Many use Dole's name
as a verb, and not in a nice way _ ``We won't get Doled again,''
they say.
 &HT;    Bush insists that he is a cultural conservative and promotes
what he calls ``the responsibility era.'' But candidates are
already lining up to his right, including the deep-pocketed Steve
Forbes, the flat-tax fanatic of 1996 who this time around is making
an all-out pitch to social conservatives.
 &HT;    Forbes describes a ban on the procedure known as partial-birth
abortion as his foremost priority, ``the first step toward putting
abortion on the road to ultimate extinction in the United States of
America.''
 &HT;    Bush describes himself as ``pro-life,'' supports the
partial-birth abortion ban and pledges to propose a bill next year
requiring parental consent for a minor's abortion _ ``issues over
which we can make a difference,'' he says.
 &HT;    But on the basic question of the right of most women in most
circumstances to obtain an abortion, his position is that the
Supreme Court has already settled the law. And, to date, he has not
pledged any kind of crusade to sweep away those rulings; whether he
might do so in the heat of a primary campaign remains an open
question.
 &HT;    The Bush balancing act will be infinitely tougher to sustain in
the glare of the national stage. And how odd it seems, at least to
some, that so many Republicans might look to a man named George
Bush as their savior, given that George Bush lost it all for the
party just six years ago.
 -0- 
 &HT;    President Bush was at a steakhouse in Council Bluffs, Iowa, one
October day in 1994, reminiscing with some supporters from the old
days, when he excused himself to take a cellular telephone call.
The father was intently following the progress of two of his sons,
George and Jeb, in their respective gubernatorial campaigns against
savvy Democratic veterans in Texas and Florida, and new poll
numbers were just in.
 &HT;    ``He came back and he said, It looks like Jeb's OK, but I'm
worried about George,'' recalled Gordon C. James, a member of the
White House advance team in the Bush administration. ``He was upset
about it.''
 &HT;    Both races looked close, but like a lot of people, the president
saw evidence that Jeb (a nickname John Ellis Bush takes from his
initials) would pull it out over Lawton Chiles and that George's
race against a popular incumbent, Ann W. Richards, was just too
uphill a fight.
 &HT;    As things turned out, though, some invisible law of political
primogeniture seemed to kick in _ the older brother won and the
younger did not. (Late this summer, however, while George W. is
cruising toward re-election, Jeb is, according to the polls,
comfortably ahead too in his second bid for the governor's Mansion
in Tallahassee.)
 &HT;    Back in 1994, in seeing the softer-spoken, genial Jeb as the
more likely success in politics, people in the Bush family were
relying on much more than polling data. It's not that George W.
wasn't as determined to win as any Bush.
 &HT;    ``I think the major word to describe George W. circa 1993 and
the governorship was competitiveness,'' said Chase Untermeyer, a
longtime family friend and former presidential personnel director.
(Asked to compare George W. and his father in this regard,
Untermeyer said with a laugh: ``It is such a competitive family,
it's hard to make those shadings there. That's a driven
situation.'')
 &HT;    But if George W. Bush was driven, he was also known for a sharp
tongue and temper _ the ``Roman candle of the family ... and
likeliest to burn the fingers,'' as he is aptly described in
Richard Ben Cramer's ``What It Takes,'' the exhaustive account of
the 1988 presidential campaign.
 &HT;    When the Queen of England came to a White House dinner, Barbara
Bush sat George W. at the other end of the table, just to make sure
he didn't say anything undiplomatic to Her Majesty. He was the pit
bull brought in to deliver the bad news to the president's pit bull
of a chief of staff, John Sununu, when it was time for Sununu to
leave the White House.
 &HT;    And Bush, an unpaid adviser to his father, quarreled with
reporters during the 1992 campaign, frequently accusing them of
having a bias against the president.
 &HT;    Even Bush doesn't bother to deny that he was brusque in those
days.
 &HT;    ``I love my Dad, and it should not surprise you that I was a
fierce warrior on his behalf,'' he said, as his campaign plane
rumbled over the central Texas prairie one day this spring. ``And
if that ruffled people's feathers, so be it. There's a big
difference between being the son of a candidate and being the
candidate. And I understand the difference.''
 &HT;    And certainly, there was a difference by the time George W.
began his campaign for governor in 1994, a bid he contemplated four
years earlier but passed up, in part over concerns that running
with his father in the White House might look too opportunistic _
and be too embarrassing to all the Bushes if he lost.
 &HT;    Running against Ann W. Richards, the feisty and sharp-witted
incumbent who once famously derided his father as ``poor old
George,'' born with a ``silver foot in his mouth,'' Bush would seem
to have had ample reason to lose his cool.
 &HT;    In the course of the campaign, Richards called him ``Shrub,''
``that young Bush boy'' and ''some jerk,'' and joked that he was
``missing his Herbert'' (a reference to his father's two middle
names).
 &HT;    Richards frequently said that if Bush's name were George Walker,
without the Bush, no one would even take his campaign seriously _ a
point not without merit.
 &HT;    All the barbs and his prior reputation notwithstanding, Bush
turned in a truly remarkable performance. He did not lose his cool
at all, and at times he laughed right along with Richards,
basically telling voters that she sure was a funny lady, whom
everybody enjoyed, but that he came from a party and held to a
conservative philosophy that were more in line with what Texans
wanted in government. (Not that Bush wasn't out for revenge: As he
explained at the time, his strategy was to ``kill her with
kindness.'')
 &HT;    And for a man who had seemingly wandered through much of his 20s
and 30s, and who conceded that the main question surrounding him
was, ``What's the boy ever done?'' he ran a thoroughly disciplined
campaign.
 &HT;    Mindful that his father had lacked a coherent message in 1992,
Bush offered voters a precise, four-point plan for better
government: more control for local school districts, stricter
provisions for welfare recipients, tougher juvenile-justice laws
and reform of the state's tort laws. He never deviated from the
message. And while hardly the most scintillating set of political
themes ever developed, it allowed him to sidestep other issues,
particularly abortion.
 &HT;    Bush says the only painful episode from the campaign was a brief
flap over an interview he gave an Austin reporter about religion,
in which he reiterated his own personal belief that the path to
Heaven leads through acceptance of Christ as one's personal savior.
 &HT;    ``It was, of course, picked up and politicized _ you know, 'Bush
to Jews: Go to Hell,''' he recalls. ``It was very ugly. It hurt my
feelings.''
 &HT;    On election night, buoyed by the Republican surge that led to
the takeover of Congress, Bush won going away, 54 percent to 46
percent.
 &HT;    Jeb Bush, meanwhile, ran a campaign with a much sharper
conservative edge, speaking out against abortion and selecting a
Christian Coalition ``legislator of the year'' as his running mate.
To someone who briefly watched him campaign in 1994, the difference
this year is striking. He seems to have taken a page from his
brother, offering a much more upbeat message, reaching out to
minority groups, emphasizing education and greater ``compassion''
in state services.
 &HT;    Taking a break from a sweltering day of campaigning this summer
in West Palm Beach, Jeb Bush let out a tight laugh as he gave
credit to his big brother for proving himself ``the better
politician.''
 &HT;    ``He ran on four or five items or whatever it was, and he stayed
focused on that,'' Bush said. ``And that is a great lesson in
politics.''
 &HT;    Jeb Bush said he speaks to his brother about running for the
White House only ``in the contingent, in the conditional,'' but
adds that he has no doubt that his brother has ``the right stuff''
to be president.
 &HT;    And what if anyone tries to run to George W.'s right, by
emphasizing abortion or other specific social issues?
 &HT;    ``I think they'll fail,'' Jeb Bush said, ``because the broader
moral questions are the ones that concern the great majority of
people out there that fit this criteria of 'cultural
conservatives.' It is so sterile to talk about the things that the
press in this state wants to try to create, or my opponent.
Basically the same thing. There's all this Christian right, and
abortion. These are not the issues that drive people's concerns.
They want to know, how do they get the support to make sure their
children don't take drugs. They want their schools to be safe.
 &HT;    ``I'm very confident,'' he added, ``that George Bush will be
very successful if he stays the course with his message.''

Father'')

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    PARIS _ The instinctive reaction to word that Chile's Augusto
Pinochet has been arrested in London and faces extradition for
crimes against humanity is: Good, at least one bloody dictator can
be held to account.
 &HT;    But it isn't a simple issue, and the simple answer can have very
bad consequences.
 &HT;    It is no accident that the French government congratulated
itself on having foreseen possible embarrassment and refused
Pinochet a visa earlier this month. Nor is it surprising that
Spain's Prime Minister Jose-Maria Aznar commented that ``the best
outcome would be if the government doesn't even have to decide,'' a
reference to the fact that the Spanish judiciary still has to rule
on whether to advance the extradition request.
 &HT;    The implications involve all the jumble of issues provoked by
the collision of demands for pure justice and the demands of
politics, the demands of peace, the demands of reconciliation.
Further, the new emphasis on the international right to judge
certain crimes complicates the question of who is to judge whether
circumstance or unyielding moral dictates should prevail.
 &HT;    It has been pointed out that the peaceful, constructive
transition of Spain from a fascist dictatorship to a sturdy
democracy was achieved, despite ominous predictions of another
civil war, by refusing to judge the past. South Africa found relief
from intolerable prospects of confrontation and revenge in its
Truth and Reconciliation Commission. Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who
led it, will have some profound guidelines to offer from the moral
insights the experience has provided.
 &HT;    Many countries, El Salvador, Guatemala, Argentina, ex-communist
countries of eastern Europe as well as Chile, have sought to
transcend ferocious or deeply wounding civil strife by trying to
tell the truth instead of by insisting on punishment. Is their
choice to be overruled on the grounds that crimes committed were
crimes against humanity, not just their own nation?
 &HT;    The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, who asked to question
Pinochet as a step toward extradition had been working on testimony
collected by victims for several years. He is a man of rigor, who
pushed corruption cases and the tracks of the ``dirty war'' by
police against Basque terrorists during the previous Socialist
government, to its great discomfiture.
 &HT;    His document calling for Pinochet's arrest and listing 91 people
kidnapped, tortured or killed also lists a long series of
international declarations and agreements which Britain has signed
prescribing genocide, war crimes, torture. There may be some
question about the jurisdiction of a Spanish court (or of a British
court since it has been suggested Britain could hold the trial
instead of granting extradition.)
 &HT;    But there is no question about the straightforward legal
sincerity of Garon or that crimes were committed.
 &HT;    There has been a tendency of late, particularly in connection
with the atrocities in former Yugoslavia, to proclaim the
inevitability of eventual punishment as a kind of consolation for
not being able to stop the terror and not being able to catch the
perpetrators. The Pinochet arrest gives the satisfaction of being
able to feel that some day they will get their due.
 &HT;    The new treaty on establishing a permanent international
tribunal, which the United States has refused to sign, has been
hailed as a signal advance that will deter future criminal
monsters. This is fantasy. If anything, an advance, locked-in
provision for punishment makes it harder to end a conflict short of
total victory. It leaves no room for negotiation or compromise, one
of the reasons I don't think it's a good treaty.
 &HT;    Of course, a possible answer is that there never should be
compromise with evil. Justice must be complete, there must be no
escaping the highest law.
 &HT;    That leaves the underlying question of what we really hope to
achieve and what standards are to be applied. Even today in Chile,
there are people who consider Pinochet a savior rather than a
murderer. He was able to make his deal for lifetime immunity there
because he still had considerable support when he turned power over
to a freely elected president.
 &HT;    It isn't just a matter of who is to decide. It is whether the
desired outcome should be punishment, revenge, blind justice
regardless of its consequences or removal of civil conflict, a
better chance of peaceful life. When, as was the case at Nuremberg
after World War II, it is possible to achieve all at once, so much
the better.
 &HT;    But the best in moral terms must not destroy the chances of
improving how people live.

<P>
   For all its nuclear peril, the Cold War was in some ways a
reassuring time. The enemy was clear, and so were America's
choices, or at least it often seemed.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps Congress can be forgiven for reverting to its Cold
War reflexes when confronted with a sudden series of proliferation
issues last spring.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, India exploded several nuclear devices, becoming the
first nation in three decades to declare itself a new member of the
nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later came the shocking allegation that two U.S.
satellite companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, had violated U.S. export restrictions by helping
Beijing to improve its missile guidance systems _ and, presumably,
the aim of a handful of Chinese intercontinental ballistic missiles
targeted at U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
   Then on May 28, Pakistan set off its own nuclear tests, an event
unconnected to the China controversy but one that seemed,
nonetheless, to be insidiously linked. Pakistani Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, after all, made a point of thanking the Chinese for
their technical help on the bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a world long decompressed from the Cold War seemed to
be back on the brink. Only this time, Dr. Strangelove had a Chinese
face. On May 20, the House voted overwhelmingly to ban the sale and
launching of U.S. satellites in China.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pakistani tests, Congress also approved a $2.5 million
investigation of all technology transfers to China. America's
national security, declared some politicians, was being sacrificed
at the altar of commerce. Both Republicans and Democrats accused
the Clinton administration of carelessly liberalizing high-tech
trade with China _ encouraged, perhaps, by $1 million campaign
donations from the likes of Loral chief Bernard L. Schwartz _ and
engaging Beijing with a stream of deals that were helping to
transform what is still a large developing nation into a
21st-century superpower.
</P>
<P>
   That, anyhow, was the perception. Despite the amicable
Clinton-Jiang summit in late June, it is a perception that has
endured. But the truth is that such thinking is a dangerous
anachronism. Demonizing China, a nation clearly in transition, may
prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy, unnecessarily fostering
Cold War II.
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, Congress' reaction is a technological
throwback. Its worst mistake is not in misunderstanding China, but
in failing to comprehend the transformation going on before its own
eyes in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that national security and commercial interests trade
off _ that every time you sell a satellite overseas, you make a
profit but lose a little bit of your military edge _ harks back to
a time when CIA bean counters worried over every uptick in Soviet
technology, and when the U.S. defense industry was sequestered in
top-secret grandeur, spending untold billions on weapons designed
exclusively for the Pentagon, with older-generation models going to
America's Cold War allies.
</P>
<P>
   Today the situation could not be more different. Quietly,
without most Americans noticing, a revolution has turned the U.S.
defense industry upside down.
</P>
<P>
   Very little is custom-made for the Pentagon. So reduced is its
procurement budget _ at about $50 billion, it is now about
one-third what it was at the start of the decade _ that few defense
contractors could survive without a heavy diet of commercial and
overseas contracts.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, by necessity, the defense industry has grown
civilianized. Now much of the best defense technology _ such as
naval propulsion, electronics and command-and-control
telecommunications _ is coming from the commercial sector. Dual use
has become the rule and not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a handful of quasi-monopolistic contractors such as
Lockheed Martin and Newport News Shipbuilding, ``the industry is
reconstituting itself into a commercially oriented business that
also happens to have defense customers,'' said John R. Harbison, a
long-time defense analyst for Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in an
interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that, more than ever before, national
security and commerce have become mutually reinforcing, not
competing, interests. America's defense edge is part and parcel of
its commercial prowess. And that prowess in turn depends on exports
and a global leadership role for American business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banning Loral, Hughes and other satellite companies from
competing for business in China would probably harm America's
national security more than letting their prize technologies slip
into Beijing's hands, which, in any case, almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   This growing reliance on commercial technology has been a
long-term trend, one set in motion well before Schwartz ever met
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, satellites are a good example of how dramatically the
Cold War order has been overturned. Once developed largely for
spying and command and control, satellites have become the building
blocks of an immense new commercial space industry. Last year was
the first time that Vandenberg Air Force Base sent up more
commercial than military payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is now a minority user on its own ramps,''
Gil I. Klinger, the deputy under-secretary of defense for space,
told John Barry, Newsweek's defense correspondent, last spring.
``Now we are chasing furiously behind the commercial users.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the main U.S. defense satellite
constellations are nearly obsolete, and intelligence sources say
the Pentagon intends to go commercial to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   No worry there, you might think: The United States is still far
and away the world leader in this $27 billion commercial industry,
which could grow to be worth as much as $170 billion by 2007. But
others, like the Europeans, are close behind. And competition is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 commercial satellite launches are projected for the
next 10 years, and there is a nearly three-year global backlog for
launcher space. At present only four countries _ the United States,
Russia, France and China _ supply it. Launch schedules are crucial
to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When customers such as CNN buy satellites or time on satellites
from Loral or Hughes, they pay for it up front, and they do not get
revenue until the satellite is aloft. So, to stay competitive,
sellers like Loral need to minimize the time lag between purchase
and launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the nearest launch window is in two years for U.S.
satellites, and the Germans come in and say, 'Oh, by the way, we'll
launch on China and they've got a window 9 months from now.' That's
a 15-month revenue stream I can't get if I buy the American
satellite,'' said William A. Reinsch, under-secretary of commerce
for export administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics point out that more countries are planning to offer
launch services. But few experts dispute that a competitive rush is
on and that the launch bottlenecks are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Any loss of business for U.S. satellite companies may translate
into a lost defense edge for the Pentagon down the line _
especially since military and civilian satellite technology is so
similar. The message is plain: To react to the putative threat from
China by banning satellite sales to that country is to cut off
Uncle Sam's nose to spite his face.
</P>
<P>
   There are side benefits to America's commercial dominance as
well: U.S. intelligence, for instance, is helped far more if the
Chinese military uses U.S. commercial satellites than it would be
if China developed its own hard-wired, secure military alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Today the line dividing military technologies from civilian ones
is constantly receding. One by one, commercial uses are being found
for formerly military technologies. Night vision goggles are
important military equipment, covered as munitions by the State
Department, but they are also available in the L.L. Bean catalog.
Global positioning satellites, once intended for guiding ballistic
missiles, today are within reach of every backpacker and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider chips hardened to withstand radiation. Once devised
because the U.S. military wanted to protect its satellites from
attack, today there is a civilian clamor for them. Fearing cyclical
spikes in solar activity, companies hope to use them to preempt
pager blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the West should just drop efforts
at export control. Nor is there question of the potential
seriousness of the allegation against Loral and Hughes. If it is
true that these two satellite companies evaded the required State
Department approval before passing on missile-guidance information
to China, that would be an indisputable violation of U.S. export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to remember that for now the allegation
remains a singular one, hardly something that would justify banning
all satellite exports to China. Contrary to reports, the Pentagon
is sharply divided over whether national security was harmed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that America's export control policy can no longer be
to close down its borders. In an era of open technology transfer,
the centerpiece of any viable strategy must be to keep one's
industries running faster than the next economy's.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy should be twofold: to promote U.S. commercial
leadership in dual-use technologies, and to maintain tough but
reasonable export monitoring that will slow _ even if it does not
stop _ the acquisition of those technologies by potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   America's national security will be assured as long as the
Chinese (or, through them, the Iranians or Pakistanis) are always
lagging a few product cycles behind. But that is about all that can
be done.

telecommunications _ is coming from the commercial sector. Dual use
has become the rule and not the exception.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from a handful of quasi-monopolistic contractors such as
Lockheed Martin and Newport News Shipbuilding, ``the industry is
reconstituting itself into a commercially oriented business that
also happens to have defense customers,'' said John R. Harbison, a
long-time defense analyst for Booz, Allen &AMP; Hamilton, in an
interview in June.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that, more than ever before, national
security and commerce have become mutually reinforcing, not
competing, interests. America's defense edge is part and parcel of
its commercial prowess. And that prowess in turn depends on exports
and a global leadership role for American business.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, banning Loral, Hughes and other satellite companies from
competing for business in China would probably harm America's
national security more than letting their prize technologies slip
into Beijing's hands, which, in any case, almost never happens.
</P>
<P>
   This growing reliance on commercial technology has been a
long-term trend, one set in motion well before Schwartz ever met
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, satellites are a good example of how dramatically the
Cold War order has been overturned. Once developed largely for
spying and command and control, satellites have become the building
blocks of an immense new commercial space industry. Last year was
the first time that Vandenberg Air Force Base sent up more
commercial than military payloads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. military is now a minority user on its own ramps,''
Gil I. Klinger, the deputy under-secretary of defense for space,
told John Barry, Newsweek's defense correspondent, last spring.
``Now we are chasing furiously behind the commercial users.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, several of the main U.S. defense satellite
constellations are nearly obsolete, and intelligence sources say
the Pentagon intends to go commercial to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   No worry there, you might think: The United States is still far
and away the world leader in this $27 billion commercial industry,
which could grow to be worth as much as $170 billion by 2007. But
others, like the Europeans, are close behind. And competition is
intense.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,700 commercial satellite launches are projected for the
next 10 years, and there is a nearly three-year global backlog for
launcher space. At present only four countries _ the United States,
Russia, France and China _ supply it. Launch schedules are crucial
to competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   When customers such as CNN buy satellites or time on satellites
from Loral or Hughes, they pay for it up front, and they do not get
revenue until the satellite is aloft. So, to stay competitive,
sellers like Loral need to minimize the time lag between purchase
and launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say the nearest launch window is in two years for U.S.
satellites, and the Germans come in and say, 'Oh, by the way, we'll
launch on China and they've got a window 9 months from now.' That's
a 15-month revenue stream I can't get if I buy the American
satellite,'' said William A. Reinsch, under-secretary of commerce
for export administration.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics point out that more countries are planning to offer
launch services. But few experts dispute that a competitive rush is
on and that the launch bottlenecks are staggering.
</P>
<P>
   Any loss of business for U.S. satellite companies may translate
into a lost defense edge for the Pentagon down the line _
especially since military and civilian satellite technology is so
similar. The message is plain: To react to the putative threat from
China by banning satellite sales to that country is to cut off
Uncle Sam's nose to spite his face.
</P>
<P>
   There are side benefits to America's commercial dominance as
well: U.S. intelligence, for instance, is helped far more if the
Chinese military uses U.S. commercial satellites than it would be
if China developed its own hard-wired, secure military alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Today the line dividing military technologies from civilian ones
is constantly receding. One by one, commercial uses are being found
for formerly military technologies. Night vision goggles are
important military equipment, covered as munitions by the State
Department, but they are also available in the L.L. Bean catalog.
Global positioning satellites, once intended for guiding ballistic
missiles, today are within reach of every backpacker and car owner.
</P>
<P>
   Or consider chips hardened to withstand radiation. Once devised
because the U.S. military wanted to protect its satellites from
attack, today there is a civilian clamor for them. Fearing cyclical
spikes in solar activity, companies hope to use them to preempt
pager blackouts.
</P>
<P>
   None of which is to say that the West should just drop efforts
at export control. Nor is there question of the potential
seriousness of the allegation against Loral and Hughes. If it is
true that these two satellite companies evaded the required State
Department approval before passing on missile-guidance information
to China, that would be an indisputable violation of U.S. export
controls.
</P>
<P>
   But it is important to remember that for now the allegation
remains a singular one, hardly something that would justify banning
all satellite exports to China. Contrary to reports, the Pentagon
is sharply divided over whether national security was harmed at
all.
</P>
<P>
   It remains that America's export control policy can no longer be
to close down its borders. In an era of open technology transfer,
the centerpiece of any viable strategy must be to keep one's
industries running faster than the next economy's.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy should be twofold: to promote U.S. commercial
leadership in dual-use technologies, and to maintain tough but
reasonable export monitoring that will slow _ even if it does not
stop _ the acquisition of those technologies by potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
   America's national security will be assured as long as the
Chinese (or, through them, the Iranians or Pakistanis) are always
lagging a few product cycles behind. But that is about all that can
be done.

<P>
   After years of being tolerated with a mixture of apathy,
cynicism and denial, corruption is becoming a target of serious
international action.
</P>
<P>
   Where once they looked the other way, the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other global organizations
are now seeking to curb bribery and other corrupt practices.
</P>
<P>
   These expanding efforts add up to a reform movement whose most
significant achievement to date is the Convention on Combating
Bribery of Foreign Public Officials of the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
   The convention, signed in 1997 and now undergoing ratification
by the legislatures of 34 nations, will end the competitively
damaging isolation of the United States, which banned bribing
foreign public officials in 1977. Bribery scandals in half a dozen
countries led the United States to pass the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act in hopes that other countries would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   But the act was derided as misguided American moralism, and
foreign competitors remained free to use bribes to win commercial
orders. Many countries, including Germany and France, even allowed
their deduction as business expenses. The United States also
promoted a U.N. treaty to ban bribery, but that effort fizzled. The
developing world saw the proposed treaty merely as an opportunity
to bash multinational companies.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom saw corruption as a chronic characteristic
of human behavior that, in any event, was not of debilitating
proportions in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Although admittedly widespread in the Third World, endemic
corruption was not seen as impeding rapid growth in countries such
as Indonesia, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Some economists
even saw bribery as grease for the wheels of progress in
overregulated societies.
</P>
<P>
   During the last six years, however, there has been a dramatic
change in the tolerance of corruption. A wave of bribery scandals
hit all parts of the world. In Asia, the downfall of Indonesian
President Suharto followed swelling protests against his refusal to
undertake reforms, especially regarding his family's ill-gotten
billions from state-connected enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption charges played a critical role in the defeat of Prime
Ministers P.V. Narasimha Rao of India and Benazir Bhutto of
Pakistan. In South Korea, former Presidents Roh Tae Woo and Chun
Doo Hwan were jailed following disclosures that they had received
enormous bribes from Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, numerous top-level government and business leaders
have resigned in the wake of corruption scandals. In Latin America,
bribery charges resulted in the impeachments of Presidents Fernando
Collor de Mello of Brazil and Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, as
well as the resignation of President Abdala Bucaram of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari was tarnished by
his brother's illicit accumulation of huge sums. President Ernesto
Samper of Colombia avoided impeachment over his acceptance of money
from the Cali drug cartel, but his political authority was eroded
and his party lost the recent presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the bribery charges brought by Milanese magistrates
have overthrown the entire leadership that ruled Italy for more
than four decades. The defeat of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez of
Spain was partly due to bribery scandals involving members of his
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Bribery charges also caused the resignation of NATO
Secretary-General Willy Claes, a former Belgian defense minister,
and of Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's overthrow of Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko was
fueled by popular resentment of his multibillion-dollar corruption.
In China, a member of the Politburo resigned in a massive
corruption scandal. The foregoing, while far from complete,
demonstrates a worldwide phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The growing intolerance of corruption stems from the convergence
of several political and economic pressures. The post-Cold War era
has brought an opening up of governmental processes, freer news
coverage and increased independence of prosecutors and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Corruption is harder to hide, as the wave of bribery scandals
involving high-level officials in Europe, Asia and South America
demonstrates. On the economic front, impediments to investment and
other dysfunctions due to corruption are vividly displayed in
Russia, Africa and Eastern Europe. With the growth of the global
economy, international business leaders are increasingly
recognizing that common, morally defensible rules are essential.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, people have recognized that corruption is a
major obstacle to democratic transitions, market economies and
development. Citizens are using protests, elections and agencies of
civil society to press for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the World Bank and other international financing
agencies paid little heed to corruption, apparently considering it
a political matter outside their purview. At the bank, this
attitude began to change with the appointment of James Wolfensohn
as president in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   His speech at that year's annual meeting included the first
reference to corruption in a presidential address. At the 1996
meeting, Wolfensohn made combating bribery a top priority. He
invited Transparency International _ an anticorruption organization
that in five years has established chapters in more than 70
countries and publishes an annual index rating corruption country
by country _ to help develop the bank's anticorruption strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the bank adopted a comprehensive program, including
strong controls to prevent bribery on World Bank-financed projects
and assistance to governments to promote reforms. Similar changes
are taking place at other international financing agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, going beyond its traditional focus on monetary and
fiscal policy, is emphasizing the need for transparency and other
steps to curb corruption. The Inter-American, European and Asian
Development Banks are following the World Bank's lead in adopting
stricter controls over projects they finance. And the Global
Coalition for Africa has made combating corruption its most
important priority for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Inter-American Convention Against Corruption was adopted in
March 1996. It has been signed by 26 countries, but ratified by
only 10. Momentum behind this convention lessened as efforts to
create a hemispheric free-trade area stalled. Congressional renewal
of the fast-track authority needed by the executive branch to
negotiate trade treaties could reignite interest.
</P>
<P>
   Establishment by the Organization of American States of a body
similar to the OECD's Anti-Bribery Working Group to provide
professional support and monitor progress by Western hemisphere
governments would also be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The International Chamber of Commerce in Paris is playing an
important role in encouraging the global business community to
become active in fighting corruption. The chamber's focus is on
improving corporate self-regulation programs.
</P>
<P>
   Strong ``Rules of Conduct to Combat Extortion and Bribery,''
prepared by a group of lawyers, managers, and scholars from over a
dozen countries, were issued in 1996. The rules deal forthrightly
with such issues as payments to sales agents and other
intermediaries, business entertainment and gifts, and political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   They cover not only bribery of public officials but bribery
within the private sector as well. The chamber is preparing a
manual to assist companies in complying with the rules and with the
OECD principles.
</P>
<P>
   This, along with greater use of corporate rules of conduct, will
reduce the supply side of international corruption. The demand side
_ extortion and other forms of corruption by public officials _ is
more difficult to target effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Every country has laws prohibiting its officials from taking
bribes, but such laws are unlikely to be enforced when top
officials are corrupt. The World Bank, IMF, Transparency
International and others are working on programs to promote greater
transparency in government operations and other measures to combat
demand-side abuses.
</P>
<P>
   By curbing foreign bribery, industrialized countries will
increase the credibility in the developing world of their proposals
for combating demand-side corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The developments of the last five years, although remarkable,
are only the start of a long, difficult effort. Although there is
widespread support for action against corruption, entrenched groups
oppose reforms. Corruption has powerful beneficiaries: officials in
high places, companies with large resources and a legion of
influential middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever corruption has become a way of life, wholesale change
is necessary. Tossing out a few rotten apples will not be enough.
During the last five years, the argument that the costs of
corruption are intolerable has been winning. The biggest challenge
for the next five years is to assure continued public support by
showing tangible results.
</P>
<P>
   Many factors contribute to the pressure for accountability in
the post-Cold War world: the spread of investigative journalism,
opposition parties anxious to expose corrupt ruling parties, more
independent prosecutors and judges, whistle-blower protection, the
growth of the corporate governance movement and the expansion of
the global economy with increased demand for international
accounting standards.
</P>
<P>
   These developments bolster the movement to curb corruption and
enhance the prospects for achieving lasting reforms.

 &HT;    Hollywood and Las Vegas have a lot in common. Both towns _ twin
oases in different deserts _ feed greedily on our collective dreams
and desires.
 &HT;    The strongest connection between the two places is that neither
really cares much about history, but both are loaded with
mythology.
 &HT;    The biggest difference between them is that in LA, when the
movies are done shooting, the sets come down. The sets where Las
Vegas dreams _ the casinos and theme hotels _ have to last for
years and years.
 &HT;    Now the biggest long-duration set of them all is under
construction on 63 acres of prime real estate in the middle of the
Las Vegas Strip. In one gigantic engineering feat, this ``set of
the century'' will culminate in a hotel-casino complex called The
Venetian. Among other things, it conjures D. W. Griffith building a
massive Babylonian temple in Hollywood for his film
``Intolerance.''
 &HT;    This Renaissance Venice is on the exact site of the old Sands
Hotel, where Dino, Frank, Sammy and the other Rat Pack boys whooped
it up at least a thousand years ago.
 &HT;    The price tag for this bit of old-world charm is about $2.5
billion and, as its promoters never tire of saying, when it's
finished it will be the biggest resort of its kind in the world.
 &HT;    The Venetian will, of course, sport canals. More than a quarter
mile of them, including 650 feet of outdoor waterways that will run
parallel to the Strip. The canals won't go through the casino, but
will slide gracefully through the 800,000-square-foot enclosed
shopping complex _ built to mirror Piazza San Marco and,
conveniently, house 150 upscale shops and restaurants.
 &HT;    Phase I of The Venetian _ the area with a replica of Saint
Mark's Square at its center _ broke ground on April 14, 1997, and
is expected to open in the spring of 1999. Phase II, The Lido, a
``beach resort'' containing a marina, then begins construction.
When both phases have been completed, their hotels alone will
contain more than 6,000 rooms.
 &HT;    The Mirage and Treasure Island hotels across the street already
look less like big-time resorts and more like Disneyland rides.
 &HT;    When Bovis, principal construction manager for The Venetian,
poured the foundation of Phase I, it was the largest continuous
concrete pour in U.S. history. To be precise, Bovis used 300
workers and 125 trucks to pour 20,600 cubic yards of concrete in 30
hours, creating a 68,000-square-foot foundation slab 8 feet deep.
 &HT;    According to Kurt Ouchida, publicist for The Venetian, Bovis
could have poured more concrete that day, but it would have meant
shutting down all construction in LA for a weekend.
 &HT;    The Vegas Venice will offer the greatest hits: the Doges'
Palace, the Campanile tower, the Rialto Bridge and Bridge of Sighs,
the Contarini Palace and Saint Mark's Square, sited like a
Renaissance rummage sale.
 &HT;    But then Vegas has pretty much always epitomized a certain kind
of hospitality, the malleable kind. The fantasies here are generic,
populist, with the promise of extravagance. This is the home of the
water feature, the deluxe discount, the Ideal Guest Experience, in
addition to being the home of the evanescent lucky streak.
 &HT;    Even the dusty, pre-theme-hotel Vegas (talk about ancient
history) had it, this quality and enticement of the extraordinary.
The saloons and bordellos were like something out of a John Ford
western: functional and minimal and alluring.
 &HT;    What could be more dreamlike, right here, right now, than
bringing Venice, a city of water, to the middle of the American
desert?
 &HT;    When The Venetian is finished, besides the surreal ribbon of
canals and the humming craft (gondoliers plying poles for show
while serenading their customers), the first thing you'll see is
the looming Campanile tower _ 315 feet tall. You'll also espy the
Doges' Palace, serving as a grand entrance to the
116,000-square-foot casino. The tower will lead to the Palace via
the Rialto Bridge. The bridge will feature a people mover on which
tourists will glide into the Saint Mark's shopping area.
 &HT;    A company called Treadway is in charge of the multitude of
planned statuary and ornately carved cornices and moldings and
friezes. Venice is a city that is lousy with marble, but The
Venetian will not be, except for floors in places like the Doges'
Palace. (In a city of illusions, the Vegas crew scored big here:
They're getting their stone from the quarry that supplied it for
the original palace.)
 &HT;    Most of the ``marble'' will be made of polyurethane foams,
expanded polystyrene, and sign foam (aka polyiso foam) _ the same
materials used to carve large structures on many movie sets _ then
hand-painted with marble texturing. Some of the sculptures will be
made from glass-fiber-reinforced concrete. It's a strong material,
and Treadway has developed a formula that looks remarkably like
marble.
 &HT;    Despite all the synthetic materials and techniques (including a
computer-driven cutter that roughs out giant foam sculpture blocks
for Treadway's artists), much of the fabrication is like that of a
Renaissance workshop, and concrete pieces are cast using a process
similar to the one artists have used for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    So can we expect Elvis in wrap-around shades and Cesare Borgia's
cardinal's robes, waving to us from the Doges' Palace?
 &HT;    Well, wasn't Venice the Vegas of its day, full of overblown and
sexy distractions, warring families, political and power factions?
Is the Venice of the Renaissance really all that different from the
Vegas of Bugsy Siegel, $2 shrimp cocktails and nude ice-skating
spectaculars?
 &HT;    Consider the famous Campanile tower: While it's a lovely thing,
and the subject of high praise by many critics, including John
Ruskin in his exalted book `The Stones of Venice,'' the one now
standing in Venice isn't even the real tower. The original one
collapsed in 1902, and a new tower was built in 1912. A
reproduction.
 &HT;    Consider also Saint Mark in the Vegas pantheon. He's the patron
saint of the actual city. He rates a major square and a cathedral
in his name. But Mark isn't Venice's first patron saint. That was
Theodore, a warrior saint, and defender of the Venetian city-state.
But Saint Mark had a better spin than Theodore, and in the year
828, when a couple of plucky merchants smuggled Mark's remains from
Alexandria back to Venice, Saint Theodore was out of luck.
 &HT;    It's not hard to see Theodore as the spiritual version of Bugsy
Siegel in this little tale. Both were early supporters and
protectors of their cities, both were warriors and both, after
their deaths, were swept under the carpet of convenient history.
Saint Theodore fared a little better. His statue, standing atop a
crocodile, is situated across from Mark's winged lion on the Piazza
San Marco.
 &HT;    There are no memorials to Bugsy, the man who pretty much
invented the idea of the big hotels on the Strip. In fact, when it
came time to expand the Flamingo in 1993 _ the hotel Bugsy helped
finance and build _ the new owners bulldozed Bugsy's special
bulletproof bungalow-office and tossed the remains out with the
trash.
 &HT;    What's especially striking about The Venetian, in the context of
Vegas' current building boom (according to the Las Vegas Sun, as of
July 1997, there were 15,000 new hotel rooms under construction),
is that it's the best and brightest example of the city's latest
romance _ with the past.
 &HT;    For sure, if Venice isn't to your taste, you can try another
city-themed complex, Bellagio _ or Paris (Paris) or Burma (the
Mandalay Bay) _ built to re-create its past glory. But it should go
without saying that none of the new resorts is about re-creating
the past, The Venetian least of all.
 &HT;    These hotels, really vast self-contained entertainment
arcologies, are Big Gulp Super-Size Monuments that are _ surprise!
_ really about Vegas itself, and the Swell Future to Come.
Capitalism triumphant. Boundless optimism. Sex and youth and
vitality forever and getting rich quick. As long as there's sun and
land to expand into, we'll never die, never even grow old, never
end up like Europe, with its sad weight of history, collision of
languages and soon, some weird common currency that's less
convincing as money than the Jimi Hendrix chips at the Hard Rock
Casino.
 &HT;    Leave it to a Frenchman, though (Jean Baudrillard, the
postmodernist poster boy), to observe that there ``is something
stronger than sex or happiness: the passion for illusion.'' Maybe
he was passing through Vegas. It's all here, in Vegas as in
Hollywood, and in the empty spaces in between, and on the grounds
of The Venetian _ still waiting for its Renaissance sculptures
carved from expanded polystyrene and sign foam. Collapsible time,
where the past, present, and future merge into an endless,
revisable dream.

join the ranks of such Internet blockbusters as Yahoo! and
Amazon.com. But before the team could even plan a road show to
advertise its initial public offering (IPO) of stock, their Morgan
Stanley bankers brought sobering news: In only 45 days, comparable
Internet companies had lost as much as 50 percent of their
valuations. Institutional investors were balking at new offerings.
In short, the IPO window was slamming shut. The Vignette team has
joined the legions of executives across the country postponing or
shelving plans to sell stock to the public. (Regan, Cox News

   SPACE-PRIVATIZE _ WASHINGTON _ As Americans relive the past

heating up. This time the competition is not between international
superpowers, but among a handful of scrappy startup U.S. companies
who are vying to build space planes and rockets that would fly so
cheaply that costly government vehicles would be left in the dust.
Even as NASA continues to rely on its huge and complex shuttle
system, costing $400 million to $600 million per flight, these lean
and mean space entrepreneurs are developing small, reusable
vehicles that could haul satellites and other cargo into orbit at
bargain-basement rates. (Malone, Cox News Service 880&AMP;add).

   AUS-SIERRA _ AUSTIN _ And you thought the radioactive dump fight
was bad. In Sierra Blanca, an ongoing fued between Hudspeth County
Judge James Peace and County Attorney Tom Chellis has shut down all
misdemeanor prosecutions in the county _ for a year. Chellis, angry
that Peace and county commissioners have steadily cut his budget,
stopped accepting new cases a year ago, which means drunk drivers,
assault suspects and others arrested on class A and B misdemeanors
get their cases quickly dismissed. Not that it matters, because
Peace, who presides over all misdemeanor cases, stopped holding
court a year ago, about the time that Chellis filed criminal
charges against him for official oppression, which is another story
altogether. A tale of border un-justice. (Harmon, Austin

disciplined 50 administrators, including one who's been fired.

   AUS-AIRPORT _ On a cool, overcast morning in southeast Travis

four years already. But in a sometimes cynical city where ideas are
born, then changed, debated (and debated), shelved and maybe even
born again, that loading bridge, which will carry passengers to and
from waiting planes, is also proof positive of something many
Austin residents have doubted for years: we're getting a new
airport. In just six months passenger planes will _ barring natural
disaster or unexpected construction delays _ fly out of
Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. (Hiott, Austin
American-Satesman)

two bounty hunters who broke down the door of the wrong house
earlier this week, terrifying the 14-year-old girl who was home

track down fugitives, and since they thought they were at the right

charged. Talking to legal experts, the district attorney etc. over

   (``Thoughts held in mind produce after their kind.'' -- Charles
Fillmore)
</P>
<P>
   (Sir John Templeton, the Tennessee-born billionaire and founder
of the Templeton funds, built his fortune on his legendary ability
to perceive value that others overlooked. In his column, he urges
us to recognize the value of spirituality in life.)

</P>
<P>
   The comedian Flip Wilson made famous the phrase, ``What you see
is what you get.'' While this is a common belief, it would perhaps
be more accurate to say, ``What you think is what you get.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoughts, like seeds, sprout and blossom according to their
variety, and the thoughts you cultivate create your experiences of
life. Just as a seed planted in fertile soil produces healthy
fruit, your mind may be lightened or darkened depending on the type
of thoughts planted in it.
</P>
<P>
   If apple seeds are planted and nurtured, you can harvest
delicious, juicy apples. If you plant and nurture thistle seeds,
you get prickly thistles.
</P>
<P>
   This analogy also holds true for the mind. Positive thoughts can
produce positive results, whereas negative thoughts can lead to
negative results. Understanding this cause-and-effect relationship
can help you ``think into being'' the kind of life you wish to
have.
</P>
<P>
   The personality, ever in a state of change, creates itself anew
based on ideas that move through the inlet and outlet of the
thinking faculty. It is important to monitor the traffic because
``thoughts held in mind do produce after their own kind.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take practice, although no more energy, to direct the
active, zealous, impulsive thinking faculty to retain thoughts that
build one's world according to a wise pattern.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us is born with the freedom to choose the thoughts we
want to direct our lives. We can choose the path we desire to
pursue; we may choose the pace at which we wish to travel, and also
what we wish to carry along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever realized that you have the ability to precondition
your mind to success? When you precondition your mind, you invest
in the process of transforming your life.
</P>
<P>
   This is a basic principle of positive thinking. You can forecast
whether you find future success or failure by your present type of
thinking. How? Because what you consistently think is likely to
happen, tends to happen!
</P>
<P>
   Let's take a further step and define the meaning of ``success.''
In its deepest sense, success means to live graciously, humbly,
orderly, lovingly, and compassionately as a person and to use fully
your talents to help others, not merely to achieve things.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon Hill, the best-selling American author of ``Think and
Grow Rich,'' was born and raised in a one-room log cabin in the
mountains of southwest Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Young Hill's home was so isolated that he was 12 years old
before he saw his first railroad train. Adding to his
impoverishment was the loss of his mother when he was only 8.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, in his later years, remembered the day, a year after his
mother's death, when his father brought home a new wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father introduced her to the relatives. When my turn came,
I was standing in the corner with my arms folded and a scowl on my
face. I was all set to show her how tough I could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father walked up to me and said, 'Martha, here is your son,
Napoleon, the meanest boy in Wise County. I won't be surprised if
he starts throwing rocks at you by tomorrow morning.''' All the
relatives roared with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stepmother walked up to me,'' Hill recalled, ``put her hand
under my chin, and lifted my head upward so she could look squarely
into my sullen face. 'You are wrong about this boy,' she said. 'He
is not the meanest boy in Wise County. He is a smart boy, who has
not yet learned how to make the best use of his wisdom.'''
</P>
<P>
   With his stepmother's encouragement, Napoleon Hill traded his
rifle for a typewriter. She taught him to type, to research
information, and to express his ideas in writing.
</P>
<P>
   When later he said, ``There is but one thing over which man has
complete control. That is his own mental attitude,'' it was his own
experience speaking. For when Napoleon Hill replaced the belief
that he was mean with the seed-thought that he was wise and could
do great things, he became the successful person he was meant to
be.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to advise kings and presidents and to inspire
millions through the power of the written word. His book ``Think
and Grow Rich'' is still a best seller after some 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   As you are reading this column, you presently reflect what your
thoughts have created over a period of time. Defeatist thoughts,
angry thoughts, dishonest thoughts, self-centered thoughts, and
failure thoughts are destructive. Loving thoughts, honest thoughts,
service thoughts, and success thoughts are creative.
</P>
<P>
   Just as fruit generated from the best kind of seed is the most
delicious and pleasing so, too, the life most worth living is
cultivated from the best and most loving thoughts. Before you can
utilize the positive power of your thoughts, it is necessary to
become aware of your current pattern of thinking.
</P>
<P>
   You may not have a stepmother who was as helpful as Napoleon
Hill's in pointing out negative thought patterns. Nevertheless, in
quiet times on your own, observe your habits of thought, and begin
to weed out those that do not suit your higher purposes.
</P>
<P>
   You can train your mind to nurture positive, loving, and
unselfish thought patterns and, through them, develop a deeper,
richer personality that may be the fulfillment and fruition of your
greatest creative potential. Try making friends with the most
powerful and positive ideas that are available to you as a human
being. Give them your attention and belief.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of filling your mind with aimless chatter or with fears
and negativity, work at filling your mind with the presence and
instruction of positive, constructive ideas. As you do, you are not
only blessed but you can become a blessed representative in our
world of the life-transforming ``law of good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   You can grow from negativity and limitation to an abundance of
usefulness and happiness.

BABY BOOMERS HAVING MAJOR IMPACT ON RETIREMENT PLANNING, FUNDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baby boomers spawned the Summer of Love in San Francisco, gave
birth to the Me Generation in the 1970s and turned America into a
land of Yuppies during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Their impact has been just as powerful at work. They've lobbied
for help to tend to their aging parents, pushed companies for
on-site child care and no longer work long enough for one employer
to collect a gold watch when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as boomers get older they're going to affect employers in
another key way: in the pocketbook. Older workers use more health
care and their retirement plans are more expensive to fund.
</P>
<P>
   It's a huge group. For the next 15 years, every day another
11,000 boomers will turn 50, said Bill Partridge, retirement
practice leader in the Houston office of Watson Wyatt, an employee
benefits consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the average length of employment with one company has
increased from 12.3 years in the early 1990s to 13 years, said
Partridge.
</P>
<P>
   That's a double whammy because so many employee benefit programs
are tied to age and length of employment, he said. For example,
most companies dole out vacation time based on the years an
employee has been with the company and base pay typically increases
the longer someone stays with a company.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are just beginning to look at their own demographics
and are discovering they have to make some plans to ensure they can
afford the financial crunch _ and the potential loss of workers,
Partridge said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Challenge is to keep boomers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The boomer population is so big that companies may need to
rethink whether they should continue to offer sweeteners to
encourage employees to retire early, Partridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Once those boomers are gone there won't be enough Generation
Xers, the workers who range in age from about 23 to 34, to fill the
jobs, he said. It will be a challenge to companies to keep boomers
in the work force in new roles, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement plans are another big concern of employers, Partridge
said. While most people wouldn't think that an older population
would affect 401(k) plans, older workers are more likely to
participate in their company's 401(k) plan and at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies offer a 50 percent match up to the first 6
percent an employee contributes, so if an older employee boosts his
contribution from 4 percent to 6 percent, that costs a company
money, Partridge said.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional pension plans also become more costly when employees
are older. The cost of funding a pension for an employee who is 25
years old is relatively insignificant because the pension won't be
paid out for so many years, Partridge said. It's quite expensive,
on the other hand, if an employee is 55 because retirement is so
much closer.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid those big costs down the road, some employees are
coming up with alternatives to traditional pension plans, Partridge
said. Cash balance plans, for example, give employees a percentage
of their salary each year that they can take with them when they
leave the company or retire.
</P>
<P>
   Cash balance plans introduced &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Herman Healthcare System replaced its traditional
pension plan with a cash balance plan this year that uses a point
system based on age and years of service to determine how much the
hospital contributes each year to each employee's account. The
amounts range from a low of 2.5 percent to 7 percent, plus
employees also earn interest equal to 1 percent more than the U.S.
Treasury Bill rate.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was designed to reward employees for their length of
service, said Gene Ross, vice president of human resources. And the
plan was also designed to make it easier for employees to
understand what they'll receive at retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Employees were given a starting balance that equaled the money
they had in the system's traditional pension plan, Ross said. One
of the downsides of the plan is that it doesn't reward older
workers as much as the traditional pension plan did. So the
hospital put in extra credits for older workers to create
equalization.
</P>
<P>
   Bank One Corp. also has its eye on the future, replacing its
traditional pension plan with a cash balance plan this year.
However, it doesn't have the worries that many other employers
have.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Russell, spokesman for Bank One in Columbus, Ohio,
estimates that 50 percent of its work force is younger than 27.
Those folks are very interested in vacation benefits, support for
children and health care, Russell said. ``They couldn't care less
about retirement.''

GREAT .PLAN SHOWS THINGS CAN CRACK UP

<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine a business shutting down and giving away its product.
</P>
<P>
   Picture a homebuilder stacking mortar, bricks and lumber by the
side of the road next to a big sign that says ``Take me.'' Or
consider a defunct automaker letting folks cart away pistons,
tires, gas tanks, fuel gauges and bucket seats, for free.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Dave ``DDT'' Taylor, the stock-in-trade was
software. And when his Austin game company, Crack dot Com, went out
of business, he literally gave away the store.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Taylor posted on the Internet the unfinished pieces
of the game he and his staff had been building. Golgotha was to be
a battle strategy game in which players marshal armies against each
other, rendered in a 3-D, first-person style.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone with enough time on his or her hands can download the
game's source code _ its raw programming _ as well as sound
effects, original music and artwork. Because these components are
now in the public domain, prospective game developers can use them
in their own programs, or even complete Golgotha if they choose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard from one group calling themselves Golgotha Forever
who want to make it a goal to complete the game like I intended it
to be, as though I had this grand vision,'' said Taylor. ``I told
them they really ought to do their own thing with it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A different style of business &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's largesse is both a matter of practicality and
consistent with his approach to dealing with the audience that
plays his games. Taylor used the Internet to keep fans informed
about the game's progress, as well as the health of his business.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a lot of companies that keep their business dealings
close to the chest, Taylor wore his on his sleeve. He regularly
posted updates on how Crack dot Com was doing, and those reading
his musings could literally watch as his business withered and
died.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, 29, is a former employee of id Software, the
Mesquite-based games company that pioneered the 3-D shooter genre
with hits like Wolfenstein 3-D, Doom and Quake.
</P>
<P>
   While at id, he began posting his thoughts on the Net in what's
known as a .plan file. This is a kind of calling card or greeting
that pops up when a function known as a ``finger'' is performed
across a network, or the Internet. For example, if you used an
Internet finger program and entered ddtcrack.com, you'd see
Taylor's current .plan file.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's .plans became popular among those awaiting id's next
game, and soon his colleagues began writing their own .plan files.
These postings have since become an important way for game
companies to keep their audiences up to date on the development of
highly anticipated games. (To see a good selection of game-industry
.plan files, go to finger.stomped.com or finger.planetquake.com on
the Web.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Problems of a start-up &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He started Crack dot Com in 1994 with Jonathon Clark, and left
id two years later to work full-time as its chief executive. The
company had a cult hit with a 2-D, side-scrolling game called
Abuse, but Golgotha was going to be its masterpiece, the title that
put Crack on the map.
</P>
<P>
   Clark and Taylor set up shop in Austin and hired a staff of
designers, artists and even a sound effects/music specialist.
Securing enough funding to keep it going was a problem almost from
the start as the company relied on some income from Abuse and small
deals worked out as advances on Golgotha.
</P>
<P>
   As early as May 1997, Taylor was expressing concern in his .plan
file about Crack dot Com's tenuous nature: ``Unfortunately, my work
logs will be a bit more sparse than the others because most
business/press work is supposed to remain confidential until things
are finalized. Maybe this will change. Maybe I will be the one to
change it! Hm. Maybe I don't want Crack to fold.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's .plans talked about the most basic aspects of running
his company _ meeting with publishers, working with press, even
hiring temporary workers: ``Yummy. We've got a temp in here doing
filing and paying bills. I've never hired a temp before. `I'll do
whatever you like!' This rocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor partly blamed Crack dot Com's problems on the fact that
publishers were not willing to strike a deal with a new developer
until a finished game was in hand. Throughout his postings, he
discussed many deals that never came to fruition: ``Forsooth, it is
Sunday, and Publisher X did not fax an offer on Golgotha NA (North
America) rights on Friday. Dave suspecteth Publisher X is trying to
string Crack along, perhaps not for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, after a verbal agreement was undone by language
added to a written contract, Taylor expressed his frustration:
``Still doing publisher/investor discussions. Would love to go into
sordid detail, but if you knew what makes the business world tick,
you'd curl up in a ball and ask for your mommy. I know I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Crack dot Com ran out of money in July, and Taylor posted this
remarkably candid announcement in his .plan: ``Conventional biz
wisdom says you shouldn't announce this sorta thing, but I do so
because of an annoying decency streak. So before the rumors start
to fly, I should announce that Crack is in deep financial ----.
We're not in debt and refuse to enter debt, but we just ran out of
cash and are not making payroll. Those of us financially stable
enough to weather some time without being paid will stay on. We're
all confident the money will come in, including those of us who
can't afford the loss of income. There is just too much value in
the project, it's inexpensive to complete, and there are too many
opportunities even outside Golgotha. But two of us, Gene &AMP; Stephen,
don't have the reserves to miss a single payroll, so I'd like to
help place them at other companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that announcement got job offers for both employees,
though one is still looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   Later .plan files talk about disconnecting phone lines and
moving out of the company's high-rent offices. But Taylor never
actually said in his .plan that Crack dot Com was gone. But his
partner, Jonathon Clark, did: ``Welp, I'm 25 years old now! Time to
do something different with my life. If you haven't heard yet,
Crack.com is dead.''
</P>
<P>
   So why, after four years of work on Golgotha, did Taylor decide
to give away all that work?
</P>
<P>
   ``Code rots,'' he said, referring to the programming code.
``Game code rots even faster. If you're not keeping it up to date
with all the advances going on out there, it becomes worth less and
less. We weren't going to be around to support it, so we're just
giving it away.''
</P>
<P>
   He's now looking for work, hoping to find a job as a programmer
or designing hardware. The job interviews are coming regularly, he
said. And how will he feel about no longer being the boss, and
going back to being just another employee?
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be thrilled,'' he said.

JOHN CARPENTER OFFERS ONE OF THE BEST VAMPIRE FILMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The teen-slasher rehashes that sparked today's horror
renaissance have already gone stale. We know what they did last
summer. So, what new blood can be summoned for fall?
</P>
<P>
   ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' has the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we expect greatness again from the creator of
``Halloween.'' Carpenter hasn't made a good movie since 1988's
``They Live.'' But just when we thought his creative well had run
dry, he delivers one of the best vampire films of the modern era.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by ``The Wild Bunch,'' ``From Dusk Till Dawn'' and
actor Sam Raimi's armed-for-bear horror heroes, Carpenter has
concocted an audacious, brashly energized action flick about a band
of fearless vampire killers led by James Woods. As such an intense,
overbearing actor, Woods is ideal as the indomitable Jack Crow, a
cool cat in dark duds who works with ruthless efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by a shadowy arm of the Catholic Church, he and his men
roam remote New Mexico like western bounty hunters, seeking
vampires who nest by day in shuttered shacks. They wield firearms
to slow down the bloodsuckers until Crow, with his chrome crossbow,
can snag and drag them into the incinerating sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Crow explains such rules in a delightful tirade to a naive
priest (former Houstonian Tim Guinee), laying to rest quaint
notions that vampires are tuxedo-wearing seducers who fear garlic
and crosses. No, the vampires of John Steakley's novel on which
this film is based aren't so delicate. They're the vile vermin of
Bram Stoker's ``Dracula'' and Stephen King's ``Salem's Lot.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, they're also one-dimensional compared to Anne Rice's
anguished characters. But they're also strong villains who are
tough to kill _ especially a ``master vampire'' (Thomas Ian
Griffith) who wipes out everyone but Crow and his lieutenant
(Daniel Baldwin).
</P>
<P>
   Desperate, they take in tow a prostitute (Sheryl Lee) who's been
bitten and has a psychic link to their prey. Thus begins a cat and
mouse game that erupts in over-the-top gore, giving this what's
known in the trade as a ``hard R'' rating.
</P>
<P>
   Yet gore is no exploitative crutch. ``Vampires'' is skillfully
crafted, from its gorgeous cinematography to its vibrant rock score
(composed by Carpenter and performed by him and his Texas Toad
Lickers) to its fervent performances.
</P>
<P>
   The only trouble is that Woods is so powerful that his enemies
seem mundane. Griffith looks like Howard Stern crossed with Marilyn
Manson, and he has little chance to bare more than fangs, much less
a heart of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the action is grandly galvanized; Crow and Carpenter
don't mess around. But it's fantasy violence, not reality violence,
making it more outrageous than truly appalling.
</P>
<P>
   While likable and flamboyant, Woods has a fierce expediency that
may disturb some. Lee is slapped around, and Guinee's priest is
tortured to reveal a secret. But Woods' Crow doesn't relish
brutality toward innocents. He simply doesn't have time to
negotiate or cajole, and he figures his end _ ridding Earth of
hellish scum _ justifies his means. Besides, he shows a human side,
slinging sarcastic zingers at his thin-skinned cohorts and bonding
closely with Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   These men may be violent, but they're the good guys, laying
their lives on the front lines of a secret war against evil. It's a
mean, dirty job, but someone's got to do it, and by championing
their cause, Carpenter and Woods have done a genre proud. &QL;

VIRUSES ARE ONLY CARRIED BY CERTAIN TYPES OF FILES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I've been using a virus checker faithfully since I got my
first computer a year ago. I run it every week and check for
viruses on my hard drive, and I scan every program I put on my
computer. So far, so good, no viruses. But these checks take a long
time. I have my virus checker set to scan all files, because a
friend told me viruses can hide in any file on your hard drive. But
someone else said they can only be in certain files, though she
wasn't sure which ones. What's the truth?
</P>
<P>
   A. Your second friend is right. Viruses can reside only in
certain kinds of files, so there is no need to scan every single
thing on your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Most viruses either hide in, or attach themselves to, what are
known as executables. These are program files that actually launch
and run. For example, when you double-click on an icon in Windows,
that usually fires up one of these kinds of files. Executable files
have an extension of .EXE or .COM.
</P>
<P>
   However, viruses also can be hidden away in .DLL files. That
stands for Dynamic Link Library, and they essentially are
components another program calls on when needed. For example, if a
program needs a ``Save As ... '' dialog box, it can be stored
inside a .DLL file.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses also can be found in Microsoft Word and Excel documents.
These are called macro viruses, because they take advantage of
those programs' ability to run automated routines called macros.
Word 97 and Excel 97 have built-in safeguards against macro
viruses, but Word and Excel 95 are fairly vulnerable. This is why,
in general, you should be careful about reading any Word or Excel
documents sent to you, and why it's better to send plain-text
attachments instead of Word documents over the Net.
</P>
<P>
   Viruses also can hide in the boot sectors of your hard and
floppy disks. These are areas on the disks that contain information
about the operating system and how the computer should start up.
</P>
<P>
   Most virus checkers have a setting that only checks the boot
record, memory and program files, and that's a fairly safe way to
go. More modern antivirus programs also can look inside ZIP archive
files and scan macro viruses, too. But it's usually unnecessary to
scan every file on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've noticed in your reviews, as well as in some of the
computer magazines, that the sub-$1,000 computers often are
criticized for not having enough free slots for add-on cards. But
many of them come with everything you'd need. Why is this such a
big deal?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because even with the sub-$,1000 systems, you don't want to
limit your options.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these computers do indeed come ``loaded'' _ they are
excellent values. But what if your needs change over time?
</P>
<P>
   Let's imagine that you have a child who enjoys educational
software. But in two years, he wants to play games that require
higher 3-D power than you have in your machine. You can buy an
add-on 3-D card, such as a Voodoo2-based graphics board (by then it
will be Voodoo3!) _ but only if you have the spare slot.
</P>
<P>
   You may already have filled up your slots with an SCSI board, if
you decide you want a fast scanner. Or, if you've started a home
network, a slot may be taken up with a network interface card, or
NIC.
</P>
<P>
   So given that there are sub-$1,000 PCs that do have plenty of
open slots _ I'd say at least two free PCI slots and one free ISA _
then why limit yourself?
</P>
<P>

Dwight Silverman can help. Send e-mail to dwight.silverman at

CREATOR MILKS PATHOS TO EXTREMES IN CHAPLINESQUE `LIFE IS
BEAUTIFUL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether or not you end up liking ``Life Is Beautiful,'' you will
likely credit its star-director-co-writer, Roberto Benigni, with
audacity for keeping true to his premise: Charlie Chaplin sends his
Little Tramp character to a Nazi concentration camp and even there
finds laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Audacity may have to count a lot for you, for the film is
``Chaplinesque'' past the point of aggression. Although Guido, the
Italian-Jewish waiter Benigni plays, neither looks nor moves like
the Little Tramp, the ways Benigni works the character for humor
and poignancy _ pounds of pathos _ are hugely derivative of
Chaplin.
</P>
<P>
   Benigni would like us to think that not only is the film about
the late '30s, it was made in the late '30s.
</P>
<P>
   Consider these museum-reproduction jokes that are the film's
credit-sequence tone-setters: When Guido arrives in a small town in
Tuscany, the car he's driving loses its brakes. This results in his
bumping into a barn and Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), with whom he will
fall in love _ she literally falls from the hayloft into his lap.
Then, directing traffic, Guido's arm gestures are interpreted by
the local fascists as Mussolini salutes.
</P>
<P>
   Dora will turn her back on her aristocratic family to marry the
little Jewish waiter. They have a son. Giosue (Giorgio Cantarini)
is about 6 when, after escalating anti-Semitism, it happens: Guido
and Giosue are loaded on the cattle cars. Dora will demand to be
taken, too.
</P>
<P>
   The humor Benigni extracts from this situation is driven by
genuine pathos. The measure of Guido's love for his son is his
shielding the child from the horror into which he has been plunged.
</P>
<P>
   Since the boy is still young enough to believe his father
entirely, Guido is able to keep the boy believing that everyone in
the camp is there voluntarily, in competition to win a big army
tank.
</P>
<P>
   Guido's loving fabrications are fragile things. Each of
Begnini's repetitions will devalue our credulity for the next
repetition. And there are many.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin's addiction to sentiment is wearing, and so is
Begnini's. The way he escalates it feels competitive, like a pole
vault. It almost feels as though he doesn't care if we react to it
with tears or cynicism. He's just blissed by thinking it up and
raising the bar. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Life is Beautiful'' &QL; 
Starring: Roberto Begnini &QL; 
In Italian with English subtitles &QL; 
Rating: PG-13 (for Holocaust-related elements) &QL;

DISJOINTED SCREENPLAY MAKES `DEVIL' OF A FILM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JEFF MILLAR 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each time you begin to think that ``Love Is the Devil'' may be a
bit on the excessive side, a small voice of reason asks you to
consider, again, the subject and the subtitle.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Francis Bacon (1909-1992) was the English painter of
grotesque canvases, often of human shapes distended by unspecified
agony.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director John Maybury, who came to music videos from
painting, makes his feature debut with this. He subtitles it ``A
Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon.''
</P>
<P>
   The borrowing of the term ``study'' from the lexicon of art,
bringing with it implications of experimentation, the unfinished,
the tentative, explains (and excuses) a lot.
</P>
<P>
   It excuses, for example, the filmmakers from fidelity to the
facts of its subject's life. It explains why we see Bacon eternally
in preparation but never in execution of his work (the absence of
any of Bacon's canvases from the film is attributable to a business
reality rather than an aesthetic decision: Either the production
could not afford to license them, or Bacon's estate would not
license them).
</P>
<P>
   But accepting this as a ``study'' can't conjoin the two
unsynchronous films that exist within the space defined by the
title: the film on the screen and the film coming from the
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The one on the screen is engrossing. The one to which we listen
is labored, with the dialogue sometimes rather silly.
</P>
<P>
   The film concerns the seven or so years, beginning in 1963, when
Bacon (Derek Jacobi) lived with George Dyer (Daniel Craig).
</P>
<P>
   Sir Francis was in his cum laude years. As the narrative begins,
in 1971, Bacon was in Paris being proclaimed the greatest living
painter as his work was installed in the Grand Palais. Back in the
hotel room, Dyer was gobbling enough pills and drinking enough
alcohol to result in his death.
</P>
<P>
   They had met when Dyer fell through a skylight into Bacon's flat
attempting to burgle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not much of a burglar,'' said Bacon. ``Take your
clothes off and come to bed, and you can have whatever you want.''
</P>
<P>
   By Maybury's account, Bacon was an extraordinarily unpleasant
man. Although early on he may have exhibited a bit of affection to
Dyer in private, Bacon was in public contemptuous and controlling
of his young lover, who modeled for Bacon and whose image dominated
Bacon's work during this period.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon called Dyer his ``odd job man'' in his presence and locked
him out of the house in the rain while he had sex with other men.
Bacon, who sought dissipation the way some acquire Beanie Babies,
introduced Dyer into the scariest of sadomasochistic practices.
</P>
<P>
   When he hesitantly tells Bacon that he loves him, Bacon asks
Dyer what bad television show he took that line from.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer's response: drugs and dissolution.
</P>
<P>
   Maybury and cinematographer John Mathieson take license to turn
the lens into Bacon's eye. The image is often distressed. A long
scene in the bar where Bacon traded speak-to-hurt chat with artists
and mavens was photographed through wine and whisky glasses.
Filters, which change the depth of field in different areas of the
image, go on the lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobi and Craig are first-rate. The screenplay, though, is a
tangle, and the dialogue generally falls short of whatever
objective it has. Almost anything the characters are asked to say
sounds written.
</P>
<P>
   The film at this point may ask you to re-read the first and
third paragraphs of this review. But this exculpates the filmmakers
only so far. The reason artists make studies is to sort the bad
ideas from the good ones. A few too many of Maybury's bad ideas got
all the way to canvas. &QL;

`WITHOUT LIMITS' WITH HUMAN SIDE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Without Limits'' wins as a sports film precisely because it's
not really about sports or a great victory.
</P>
<P>
   There are several beautifully filmed, exciting running scenes
that give an unusually strong sense of a heated track competition.
But ``Without Limits'' manages to be surprisingly involving by
focusing on the personality of cocky, charismatic, attractive
runner Steve Prefontaine, looking at what made him succeed and
sometimes fail spectacularly.
</P>
<P>
   Until eight days ago, Warner Bros. was saying ``Without Limits''
would not open in Houston due, apparently, to its disappointing
box-office showing in New York. A track film is no sure
blockbuster, even if Tom Cruise is the producer. (Cruise even
considered playing the lead role early on.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie, directed by Robert Towne, is fueled by two excellent
performances. Billy Crudup is wonderfully self-assured and
convincing as the sexy, daring track idol Prefontaine.
</P>
<P>
   And Donald Sutherland gives an appealing, richly textured
performance as Prefontaine's famous coach, Bill Bowerman, who
started Nike.
</P>
<P>
   There's also good work by Monica Potter as Mary Marckx,
Prefontaine's most significant of many girlfriends, in what could
have been simply a pretty-girl part.
</P>
<P>
   Prefontaine died in a car crash in 1975 at age 24, just as he
was entering the prime years of a middle-distance runner. If he did
not live long enough to dominate on the track, he certainly
dominated the imagination of thousands of track fans who made
``Pre'' their hero. His driving, no-holds-barred attitude on and
off track made him stand out even in a sport where individualism is
the norm.
</P>
<P>
   The film follows Pre from his recruitment by Bowerman to the
University of Oregon track team, through the ill-fated 1972 Munich
Olympics (marred by terrorism) to his sudden death. Towne's theme
(he also co-scripted with former Olympic runner and Prefontaine
friend Kenny Moore) is the fruitful conflict between the runner and
the coach, and their opposite approaches to competition and life.
</P>
<P>
   Bowerman says in the film that Prefontaine taught him that the
Olympic motto of ``higher, faster, stronger'' does not mean higher,
faster, stronger than anyone else in the race, as he, Bowerman,
interpreted it. Simply, higher, faster, stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Bowerman tried to teach Prefontaine to win through tactics such
as working with teammates or letting other runners wear themselves
out in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Prefontaine contended that the only true way to win was by
direct frontal assault and by withstanding more pain than anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to win unless I do my best, and the only way to
do that is to run flat out until I don't have anything left,''
Prefontaine insists in the film.
</P>
<P>
   When Prefontaine first bursts to attention in a track meet by
charging out front and leading a race all the way, fans in the
stands begin chanting his name as he circles the track, increasing
his lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they saying the rube's name?'' groans Bowerman. ``They're
only encouraging the little showboater.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the film is their conflict, which is always _ almost
always _ tempered by respect and growing affection.
</P>
<P>
   Towne, who is better known for writing (``Chinatown,'' ``The
Last Detail,'' ``Days of Thunder'') than directing (``Tequila
Sunrise,'' ``Personal Best'') keeps the film interesting with a
deft touch. He prevents this from becoming the cliche ``smart
coach-cocky jock'' of too many sports films. He focuses on the
human elements as the film races from running scenes to romance to
the coach relationship and back. The movie has a fast pace, plenty
of humor and never turns into a ``Rocky''-style ``big win'' movie.
</P>
<P>
   The film makes Prefontaine so interesting we wish it told what
made him the way he was, besides just hinting at childhood
persecution for being small and German.
</P>
<P>
   Crudup (``Everyone Says I Love You''), a handsome actor whose
lean face and body look right for a distance runner, perfectly
captures the self-assured brashness and charm of Prefontaine. He's
cocky, but impossible not to like.
</P>
<P>
   Still, wise old Sutherland cagily steals the movie. If the film
gets enough exposure, Sutherland should have the inside track for a
best supporting actor nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Limits,'' which was originally titled ``Pre,'' is the
second film on the runner in two years. Last year's ``Prefontaine''
starred Jared Leto in the title role. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``Without Limits'' &QL; 
Starring: Billy Crudup, Donald Sutherland, Monica Potter &QL; 
Rated: PG-13 for brief sexual material and brief strong language. &QL;

HAVE YOUR EYES CHECKED, TOO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: We have a 56K modem, and the audio/video
quality is blurry and muffled. I was told we need a T-1 cable to
improve the quality of the picture and sound.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fuzzy
</P>
<P>
   DEAR FUZZY: It might improve the quality of the picture, but
your quality of life would go in the dumper. T-1 lines are so
expensive, you'd have to eat cat food for Sunday dinner for the
rest of your days. And even if you mortgage the kids to get a T-1,
that's no guarantee you're going to get good video.
</P>
<P>
   There's lots of stuff conspiring to muddy up the picture.
Primarily, though, it takes a whole bunch o' bytes to make up even
a single video frame. It takes some real doing to cram it all
through the Net. Imagine sending a bowling ball through a garden
hose, and you get the idea. Crunch the ball into little bitty
pieces and it makes it through, but it still has to be reassembled
on the other end. Of course, lots of those pieces get lost along
the way.
</P>
<P>
   The faster the pieces get to the other end, the faster they can
be reassembled. Your 56K modem lets you download things around
53,000 bits per second (Kbps), assuming conditions are ideal, and
they never are. A T-1 does it at 1.544 million bits per second
(Mbps). ISDN digital lines can do it at 64 or 128 Kbps, those
little satellite dishes at 400 Kbps, and cable modems usually start
around 512 Kbps. The Ethernet network at your office runs at either
10 Mbps or 100 Mbps. Starting to feel like the small and
insignificant nonentity that you are?
</P>
<P>
   To get a semi-decent picture, many video-conferencing systems
have to use three dedicated 128 Kbps ISDN lines. Good luck with
your dinky little analog phone line and modem, especially when it
rains.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if there's heavy traffic on the Net or the sender's
using a crummy camera and a dime-store microphone, or the frame
rate is too fast for the conditions or any of about a hundred other
things, you'll still get a lousy picture. Is it worth spending all
that money just to watch some tired hooker on a live-sex video
feed? Whoops! Sorry, that's what I was watching.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I'm prepping my old computer for use by my
mother. Where can I find a copy of every virus ever written?
</P>
<P>
   _ Diabolical Evilman
</P>
<P>
   DEAR LOSER: You, sir, are a pinhead. Go away.
</P>
<P>
   STUPID HARDWARE TRICK: Just to prove it's not just the Microsoft
guys who goof off, here's one that somebody at Hewlett Packard must
have thought validated making classical music his minor at good ol'
Dweeb U.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know your HP ScanJet 5Pse can play music? Turn it off,
then set the SCSI switch in back to 0. That's a zero for all you
old guys who need bifocals.
</P>
<P>
   Now press and hold the green Scan button in front as you turn
the power back on. Voila! It should be playing ``Ode to Joy'' by
varying the pitch of the scanner motor. Not exactly CD-quality
sound, but you still have to be impressed that somebody went to all
that trouble to include something that'll probably burn your motor
out if you don't stop playing with it.

ASTRONAUT IN-LAW CARRIES FAMILY'S PRIDE TO NEW HEIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Just a few pictures graced the walls of
my grandparents' home. Wed in the darkest days of the Depression,
they took care of the few things they had, hiding their couch under
a slipcover and storing just about everything else in mothballs.
They weren't the kind to make nail holes in the wall willy-nilly.
</P>
<P>
   But right by the front door hung a framed photo of the astronaut
who married their granddaughter, my cousin Gail.
</P>
<P>
   An 8-by-10 glossy of Scott Parazynski, a sunny blond in a navy
blue NASA uniform, smiled at all who came and went from John and
Rose Vozzella's suburban Boston town house. Pictures of their three
sons and 14 grandchildren, meanwhile, crowded the coffee table and
dining room buffet.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us relegated to table-top status jokingly griped that
only Scott _ an in-law, for crying out loud _ rated high enough for
a nail in the plaster.
</P>
<P>
   A little jealousy aside, we can't deny there's something special
about having an astronaut in the family.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thrill came Thursday, when Scott went up in space
with John Glenn and the rest of the space shuttle Discovery crew. I
was among about a hundred family members and friends who traveled
to Florida to watch the shuttle roar into space.
</P>
<P>
   This is Scott's third trip into outer space. But long before
Scott left the planet, we all knew he had the ``right stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, family news bulletins about the guy then getting
serious with my cousin kept getting better and better. Gail was
dating a doctor out in Colorado, where she worked as a nurse. He
had studied at Stanford, undergrad and med school. He was handsome.
He was nice. And oh, by the way, they'll be moving to Houston
because he has been accepted into the astronaut program.
</P>
<P>
   Later we would learn a few more details that, for anyone else,
might merit top billing: He had competed on the U.S. luge team and
was among the top 10 Americans at the 1988 Olympic trials; he was a
scuba diver, mountain climber and amateur pilot; he spoke Greek.
</P>
<P>
   When Scott came to the Boston area to meet the family, he proved
to be a genuinely friendly, personable guy. He seemed as proud of
Gail's accomplishments _ she was then training for a marathon _ as
his own. He wasn't one to brag. He even volunteered a particularly
unglamorous space-program tidbit: Because of the long hours spent
on the launching pad before takeoff, astronauts have to wear
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's unassuming manner hardly put a damper on the family's
excitement. When Gail and Scott tied the knot in 1993, my aunt and
uncle threw a grand wedding reception with an ice sculpture shaped
like a space shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   His first space trip came in 1994. A number of family members
traveled to Florida for the shuttle launch, and those who didn't
tuned in on TV. Scott also invited one of his heroes, Jacques
Cousteau, and Cousteau made the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Scott's second mission was supposed to have been a long-duration
stay aboard the Russian space station Mir, but he had to withdraw
after five months of training in Russia. At 6-foot-2, Scott turned
out to be too tall to fit safely in a cramped Soyuz escape capsule
in the event of an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   To the rest of the world, that may have looked like a setback.
To my family _ a bunch of vertically challenged Italians _ it was
yet another accomplishment. No Vozzella will ever be too tall for
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Scott got his second chance to go up in space. He
helped deliver one astronaut to Mir and bring another back to
Earth. During the mission, Scott and a Russian cosmonaut conducted
a five-hour spacewalk while Atlantis was docked with Mir.
</P>
<P>
   This third trip is an even bigger thrill because of Glenn's
participation, and I wish my grandparents, who died within a month
of the second mission, could have lived to see it. I watched the
liftoff with my parents and two of their friends on the banks of
the Banana River inside the sprawling Kennedy Space Center, about
five miles from the shuttle.
</P>
<P>
   A day earlier, we had snatched up T-shirts, pins, caps and
refrigerator magnets with Scott's name or photo on them. At the
launch, we had four cameras among the five of us, and we snapped
eagerly as smoke billowed from the engines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go. Go. Go. Go,'' my father whispered. ``I hold my breath till
that thing is up.'' My mother covered her mouth and cried.
</P>
<P>
   As one of two doctors on the flight, Scott will be collecting
most of Glenn's blood samples for studies on aging and
weightlessness. The 77-year-old Glenn reportedly calls Scott his
``vampire.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASA Channel is already a well-worn button on family remote
controls. But all of the extra media attention showered on this
mission means we're also seeing Scott pop up on ``60 Minutes'' and
CNN, in magazines and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to believe that he (Glenn) is not reminded of his
old Project Mercury self more by this fresh-faced 36-year-old
doctor than by anyone else on the mission,'' The New York Times
Magazine gushed in June. ``The astronaut corps is a large pack to
break out of these days, but Parazynski's forthright talk about
hoping to go to Mars someday and of wanting to give `110 percent'
to the folks on the ground recalls a younger Glenn delighting
assembly-line workers on visits to contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this could easily take its toll on the mere mortals in
the family. Over the phone, the bigwig banker who married Gail's
sister has taken to greeting my aunt and uncle with, ``This is your
nonastronaut son-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   He's joking, I'm sure. Just like I joked about being left off my
grandparents' wall. Deep down, some of us may wish that we, too,
were doing something remarkable, if not flying through space. The
rest of us have normal jobs as teachers and lawyers and computer
nerds and reporters. No one but Scott seems destined for the
history books.
</P>
<P>
   But so what if the closest we're likely to come to greatness is
that nice astronaut on the other side of the dining room table at
Christmas? That's still close enough for a vicarious thrill.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Elizabeth Catlett carves wood and stone, models clay
and casts bronze. Her primary subject is the female body, whose
appearance may be stylized like an African mask or as voluptuous as
a classical nude.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the individual sculpture and point of view, the
figure is the archetypal mother, Everywoman or an African queen.
</P>
<P>
   It dominates the retrospective of Catlett's work at the Blaffer
Gallery in Houston, where 60 sculptures created during five decades
testify to the artist's steadfast vision and mastery of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The figure may be tenderly realistic, as in a 1956 mother and
child modeled in clay, or provocatively abstract, as in the 1987
``Nude Torso'' carved from mahogany, or thoughtful, as in the 1993
``Seated Woman'' coaxed from a chunk of butterscotch-yellow onyx.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an underlying message of individual power in the
work, implicit in the strength of sculptural volumes and the
figure's stance. The political impulse is clarified in works dating
from the 1960s to the early 1970s. The shocking ``Target,'' a
bronze dated 1970, frames the stoic head of a black man behind
cross hairs. The 1968 ``Homage to My Young Black Sisters,''carved
from cedar, is an abstracted standing figure with its right arm
raised in a fisted salute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have gradually reached the conclusion that art is important
only to the extent that it aids in the liberation of our people,''
Catlett said in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Elizabeth Catlett was born in 1915, the youngest of three
children, and always knew she wanted to be an artist. Her father,
who taught mathematics at Tuskegee Institute and in schools in
Washington, D.C., died before she was born. Her maternal
grandparents were about 18 years old when they were freed from
slavery, Catlett says. Her grandfather earned enough money to buy a
farm in North Carolina and send his eight children through college.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a weeklong series of public events organized in
conjunction with her exhibition, Catlett took time out to talk
about her life and her art.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was educated,'' Catlett said, ``but she didn't have
anything to do a job with. She washed floors and was a checker in a
nightclub until some friends got her a job as a truant officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very supportive of us. My sister liked dance, so she
took dancing lessons. My father used to play the violin and carve
wood, and my mother felt I was taking after him. She used to buy me
stuff to work with and paid my tuition for my first quarter at
Howard University.''
</P>
<P>
   Catlett was on her own after that. She competed for
scholarships, sewed her own clothes, worked as a lifeguard and, for
a small fee, helped fellow students apply for grants.
</P>
<P>
   She was politically active, too. Catlett worked with Thurgood
Marshall, then an attorney with the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, in a campaign for equal pay for
black teachers in Durham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   And she protested the showing of D.W. Griffith's ``Birth of a
Nation'' in New York. The landmark film was considered a great
advance in the art of picture-making, but it embraced black
stereotypes of the worst kind and portrayed the Ku Klux Klan as
heroes protecting white people from the inherent evil of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've fought against this image of the darky, the white-face,
all my life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Howard University with a bachelor's degree
and went on to study with painter Grant Wood, leader of the
American Regionalist school, and with the Russian cubist sculptor
Ossip Zadkine &UR;  &LR; at his Manhattan studio. She taught at Dillard
University in New Orleans and at her alma mater, where beloved
Houston painter John Biggers was among her students, and exhibited
in numerous shows.
</P>
<P>
   She is considered by many to be the greatest African-American
sculptor, yet she came of artistic age in Mexico, where she became
a citizen 36 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Her move to Mexico was prompted by two compelling factors.
First, leaving New York was a condition for the renewal of her 1945
Julius Rosenwald Foundation award. The mightier impetus was her
desire to visit a country that fascinated her and that she knew
only through research.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett had read about the Mexican muralists _ Diego Rivera,
Jose Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros among them _ while
preparing a mural commission of her own. She was also keenly
interested in the politically active print collective Taller de
Grafica Popular in Mexico City, which she had heard about from some
of its principal artists on their visits to New York.
</P>
<P>
   So Catlett and her husband, renowned painter Charles White,
moved to Mexico City. A year later, he returned to the United
States. But she had discovered something important, and she stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was interested in art for people,'' the artist explains in
her husky and resonant voice.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she had fallen in love with the handsome Francisco
Mora, an artist member of the collective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pablo O'Higgins (an American artist and collective member)
introduced us,'' Catlett says. ``He suggested I teach Pancho (Mora)
English and he would teach me Spanish.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs at the memory of a dinner in a restaurant where she
sat admiring Mora's ascot and raincoat _ he later confessed he had
no shirt _ and his arrival later at her apartment, serenading
guitar in hand. Fifty-two married years and three sons later, they
are as tender and affectionate as young lovers.
</P>
<P>
   Art in Mexico in the 1940s was about reaching the public. The
Taller de Grafica Popular had been founded in 1938 by idealistic
artists who, like the muralists, believed in the power of art to
educate and inspire. The collective produced broadsheets that sold
for pennies, so the poorest person could afford them, and
educational brochures on subjects such as how to plant corn, which
were distributed in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   The ``black Northamerican,'' as friends and colleagues referred
to Catlett, responded strongly to the collaborative work and
camaraderie of the collective. And inspired by the idealistic
artists around her, who were committed to creating work for the
Mexican people, Catlett determined that she would do the same for
black people. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Her leftist associations had put her under the scrutiny of both
the U.S. and Mexican governments, and in 1958, she was arrested and
slated for deportation. After two days and nights in jail, while
Mora, O'Higgins and others sought ways to free her, Mexico's
secretary of education interceded and secured her release. Catlett
believes her name was on a list provided by the American Embassy
that also included the names of Americans who had run from Sen. Joe
McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Catlett had continued to study and teach. She enrolled in
classes at La Esmeralda, the government-supported art school in
downtown Mexico City, studied ceramics with renowned sculptor
Francisco Zuniga, and learned linocut technique at the collective.
She was included in international exhibitions of Mexican art from
Cuba to Czechoslovakia, and in 1959, became the first woman to head
the sculpture department of the National Autonomous University of
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Catlett became a Mexican citizen. It did nothing to
soothe her relationship with the State Department, which denied her
visas to visit the United States numerous times, but made sense in
light of her family life and artistic interests. Six years later,
when her sons were in high school and the university and Mexico
City was in the throes of the student rebellion that culminated
with the bloody ``Massacre at Tlatelolco,'' her Mexican passport
also meant that the government could not force her departure as it
did that of other resident aliens, including artists Leonora
Carrington and Lucas Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Catlett &UR;  &LR; divides her time between studios in New York
City and Cuernavaca, Mexico, and is a grande dame of sculpture on
both sides of the Rio Grande. Her energy doesn't appear to have
abated.
</P>
<P>
   At age 83, Catlett is not only active but also determined and
self-assured. Asked what she would advise younger artists today,
Catlett doesn't hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should learn as much as they can about techniques and as
many things as they can about art history,'' she says. ``To know
what is possible in art means you don't get stuck in little ruts.''
</P>
<P>
   Her retrospective at the Blaffer Gallery in Houston, which is
complemented by a smaller showing of Mora's paintings, is a
celebration of an artist's life. Both also have works on display at
Houston's new Gallery Thirty-nine 17. &QL;

DEMOCRATS SEE A CHANCE TO STAND THEIR GROUND IN THE SOUTH 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Republican Party's Sherman-like march across the
South appears to have slowed, and Democrats who have been on the
run for much of the decade see a chance to stand their ground.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now hold a majority of the U.S. House and Senate
seats _ and most of the governor's offices _ in the 11 states of
the old Confederacy, which means pickings are slim for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   While the recent trend has firmly entrenched the two-party
system in the South, Republicans ``have topped out in the South,''
said Merle Black, an Emory University professor who specializes in
Southern politics.
</P>
<P>
   This year, only minor changes are forecast for Southern House
seats, and none are expected in the Senate. The outcome of a
handful of governor's races will provide clearer signals of whether
the South has been transformed from a Democratic stronghold to the
foundation of the GOP's national constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Democrats held virtually every seat in the
U.S. House and Senate and every governor's office in Dixie, the
southeastern states stretching from Texas to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP began breaching the region's Democratic wall in the
1950s in presidential elections, then by winning statewide
elections in the early 1960s in Texas and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South, the Republicans began making big gains with the
electorate in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan,'' Black said. But it
was not until the 1994 midterm elections that the GOP would
dominate Southern politics, thus ending 125 years of Democratic
control of the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tide has run its course,'' said Olivia Morgan of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``Now the Republicans
are the incumbents, and for the first time in a long time, that
will work to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the governors elected on Tuesday will have veto power
over the redrawing of legislative and congressional district
boundaries after the 2000 Census. That process will help determine
the partisan makeup of their state legislatures and their
delegations to the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Redistricting in the early 1990s was overseen in the South by
seven Democratic governors and four Republicans, all working with
Democratic-controlled legislatures. This year, four governorships
are held by Democrats and seven by Republicans, and the task of
changing legislative and congressional district boundaries is still
three years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a state has a Republican governor during redistricting,
this gives Republicans a big advantage'' when districts are being
redrawn, even by Democratic state legislators, said Michael
Binford, a political science professor at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven Southern governorships up for election this year,
two have no incumbents on the ballot. The rest are held by
Republicans, and two of them _ Fob James of Alabama and David
Beasley of South Carolina _ are in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only two guys who are in trouble in the South are the ones
trying to govern on socially conservative, Christian issues,'' said
Black. ``They've gone too far to the right, and they've begun to
alienate part of their base'' _ Republicans and independents who
are conservative on economic issues but not social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Both James and Beasley have opposed efforts to create state-run
lotteries. Their Democratic challengers _ Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman in
Alabama and state Rep. Jim Hodges in South Carolina _ have pushed
the lottery as a way to raise money to improve public education,
much as Democratic Gov. Zell Miller did in neighboring Georgia to
finance college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   James, who switched from the Democratic to Republican parties in
the early 1980s, won this year's GOP gubernatorial nomination after
a bitter and expensive primary against businessman Winton Blount.
The campaign ended with James' negative ratings at an all-time high
and many of Blount's top supporters moving to the Siegelman camp.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last week by Southern Opinion Research, an independent
polling firm hired by the Birmingham News, showed Siegelman ahead
of James, 60 percent to 35 percent. In early October, the same
polling firm found Alabama voters favoring Siegelman over James 52
percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   James has come from behind before, and observers are reluctant
to count him _ or his social conservative supporters _ out of the
running. In early summer, polls showed him in a dead heat with
Blount going into the June 30 GOP runoff. James won, 56-44.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, arguably the most Republican state in the
South, Beasley alienated a large segment of his white GOP
supporters by proposing to remove the Confederate flag from atop
the state Capitol. His opposition to a state-run lottery has
alienated some Republican business leaders who see it as a way to
finance education improvements without increasing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling interests have poured money into Hodges' campaign, and
a poll in mid-September showed the two candidates in a dead heat.
This prompted Beasley to launch a series of television
advertisements attacking Hodges as a tool of the gambling industry.
More recent surveys show Beasley ahead of Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the South Carolina governor's race also could
determine who might be appointed to replace one of the state's two
U.S. senators _ Republican Strom Thurmond, 95, and Democrat Ernest
``Fritz'' Hollings, 76 _ should either of them vacate his office
before his term ends.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hodges has said he would appoint a caretaker senator who would
not seek re-election to a full term. Beasley has made no such
promise, but GOP activists predict he would pick popular former
Gov. Carroll Campbell, a Republican who currently is working as a
top-dollar lobbyists in South Carolina and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent governors Mike Huckabee in Arkansas, George W. Bush in
Texas and Don Sundquist of Tennessee have moderate records and hold
double-digit leads over their Democratic challengers. In Florida's
race for governor, Bush's younger brother, Jeb Bush, has moved away
from his hard-right rhetoric of four years ago and is leading
Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the last Southern state with no Republican governor
since Reconstruction, businessman Guy Millner has put up $11.6
million of his own money to finance his third statewide race.
Millner, a Republican who failed in two previous bids for statewide
office, has raised $3.3 million in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, founder of the temporary employment agency Norrell
Corp., was not the first choice of Georgia Republican leaders to
take on state Rep. Roy Barnes, the Democratic nominee. But the GOP
turned to Millner after the leading candidate, former state
Attorney General Mike Bowers, a Democratic turncoat, disclosed a
long-term adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who compiled a moderate voting record as a House member
and earlier as a state senator, is being painted as a liberal by
Millner, who is struggling to keep from appearing inept.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the campaign, Millner ran a television ad showing a
woman accusing Barnes of being soft on drunken drivers. The ad was
pulled after it was discovered the woman herself had been charged
with drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   During a televised debate last week, Millner was unable to
respond to a question _ ``how many seats are in the state House of
Representatives'' _ until an aide scribbled the answer (180) on a
tablet and held it up just off camera.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Southern Democrats held a 15-7 advantage
over Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Today, the number has
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Democratic Party's only hope of recovering a
Senate seat in the South is in North Carolina, where first-term
Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth faces a well-financed challenge
from attorney John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Republican hopes of picking up another seat from the South
seemed fairly good two months ago in South Carolina, where GOP Rep.
Bob Inglis was positioned to knock off Hollings, a 32-year
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollings' narrow lead in the polls over the underfunded
Inglis campaign has held steady since Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   A sign that the South has for now achieved partisan equilibrium
is the radical difference between the anticipated outcome of this
congressional election and the 1994 and 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Republicans won control of the House after major
victories in the Midwest and West, but none as big as in the South
where Democrats yielded 16 seats to the GOP. Two years later,
Democrats recovered in other areas of the country, but those wins
were offset by the party's continuing loss of House seats in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Republicans occupy 72 House seats from southern states,
up from 47 prior to the 1994 elections. Democrats hold 53 seats,
down from 77 earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't expect to see gains this year like we had in
1994 simply because we swept them all then,'' said Todd Harris of
the National Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans best chances of taking southern House seats from
Democrats are in North Carolina, where incumbent Rep. Mel Watt's
district was radically redrawn since his last election and where
Rep. Bill Hefner decided against seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Watt's district, which was dominated by African-American voters
when he was elected in 1992, was redrawn by federal court order to
include counties with mostly white voters. The reconfigured
district now is one-third black and almost one-third Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing Watt, who is black, is Scott Keadle, a dentist who is
making his first run for political office.
</P>
<P>
   In Hefner's district, former GOP state Rep. Robin Hayes, a
Cannon textile heir and unsuccessful gubernatorial nominee in 1996,
is heavily favored to take the seat. Little-known Mike Taylor, a
lawyer, is being outspent four-to-one by Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have a long-shot chance at picking up an open seat in
Mississippi, where Republican Rep. Mike Parker is quitting.
</P>
<P>
   State Highway Commissioner Ronnie Shows, a socially conservative
Democrat, is making a populist pitch that nudged him into
contention with Republican tax attorney Delbert Hosemann, whose
campaign was battered and broke after the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance for Democrats to knock-off an incumbent is in
Louisiana, where Republican Rep. Richard Baker's nine-parish
district around Baton Rouge was redrawn since the last election in
a fashion that more than doubled the black population.
</P>
<P>
   The two-term Republican, who faces a campaign-fundraising
complaint before the Federal Election Commission, is being
challenged by Democrat Marjorie McKeithen, the daughter of
Republican Secretary of State Fox McKeithen and former Democratic
Gov. John McKeithen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best candidates are not cookie-cutter Democrats, but
candidates who fit their districts,'' said Morgan of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``They're not letting the
Republicans lay claim to any issue, whether its prayer in schools
or fighting crime. We're staying competitive.'' &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the last midterm congressional election, the
Republican Party ran on a ``Contract with America'' filled with
major issues and picked up 52 House seats. But as this year's
campaign careens toward a frenetic end, the GOP is betting that a
$10 million ad blitz highlighting President Clinton's sex scandal
will prove decisive.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in strategies has divided Republicans, who worry
they could lose control of Congress, and has delighted Democrats,
many of whom are convinced the ads reinforce the idea that the
GOP's top priority is to prolong an increasingly unpopular probe
into the president's sex life and his alleged lies about it.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists acknowledge that the party's slipping
fortunes in the past three weeks led to the decision to run the
ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things haven't been going well the last two or three weeks,''
said Republican pollster Linda DiVall. ``With the closing of the
congressional session, many conservatives were disenchanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ads are ``obviously risky,'' said DiVall, who helped the
party test them. But they could make a significant impact in a
couple of dozen key races, especially in rural Southern districts,
she said. Republican Party officials, meanwhile, said the ads are
being wrongly characterized by the press as a new national
strategy; the ads are running only in carefully tested markets
where they will be well-received, they said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials said the GOP ads have had the ironic
effect of underscoring that Democrats have this year's version of a
Contract with America. Democrats are relatively united in running
on the issues of saving the budget surplus for Social Security,
implementing health care reforms, reducing school class size, and
other matters. While the GOP ad also focuses on issues, it says the
major question in the campaign is whether to ``reward Bill
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Democratic National Committee launched an ad Thursday
that seems to play into the notion this election will be a
referendum on whether Clinton should be impeached. ``Republicans,
so focused on attacking the President, they've forgotten about
us,'' the ad says. ``Next Tuesday, vote Democratic and tell
Congress we're ready to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the professed Democratic glee about the GOP ads,
Democrats said that private polling shows most of the key races are
too close to call, with the next few days before Election Day being
crucial in determining which party will have power in Congress, and
therefore, whether Clinton will be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign endgame is focusing on a small number of volatile
races. Nearly all House incumbents are likely to be reelected, and
only a handful are in danger in the Senate. Political analysts said
there are 26 highly competitive House races out of 435, and fewer
than a dozen close Senate races out of 34. The most endangered
Democrats include Senators Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois and
Barbara Boxer of California, while Republicans in trouble include
Senators Al D'Amato of New York and Lauch Faircloth of North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican National Committee,
said in an interview that the ads are ``generic'' and are running
in 68 districts. ``These ads seem to be ones that will work in
those races,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a Nicholson aide said the ad asking whether voters
should ``reward Bill Clinton'' _ the toughest of three _ is running
in only three districts, in South Carolina, North Carolina, and
Georgia. In each, the Democratic candidate is an imcumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Republican concerns about the election were underscored with the
release of a poll by The Wall Street Journal and NBC-TV that showed
Democrats leading in the ``generic'' congressional vote by 43
percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the ads will provoke a backlash during the
crucial last week of the campaign. ``This is a major strategic
blunder on the part of Republicans,'' presidential adviser Paul
Begala said. Indeed, Democrats noted that few Republican candidates
until now have tried to make an issue out of Clinton's affair with
Monica S. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   While the ads don't mention Lewinsky, they do raise the question
of whether Clinton should be rewarded for his misleading testimony
about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every election, there is a big question to think about,''
one ad says. ``This year, the question is, `Should we reward Bill
Clinton?'''
</P>
<P>
   Republican consultant Ron Kaufman said that the ads should not
be viewed as a national GOP strategy. Instead, he said, they
represent a ``tactical move'' in key races where the party needs to
motivate Republican voters. Kaufman said that while Democrats are
pleased about the possible backlash, the reality is the ads may
work in enough key districts and wind up swinging some races toward
Republican candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be dumb but we're not stupid,'' Kaufman said. ``Money,
in the end, makes a difference.'' He noted that in the 1996
election, the Democrat infusion of money into Massachusetts races
played a major role in defeating House Republicans Peter Torkildsen
and Peter Blute.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans control the House by a 228-206 margin, and the
Senate by 55-45. Republican officials this week said they expect to
pick up no more than 15 seats in the House, while some independent
analysts said the GOP gain may be closer to seven. Congressional
Quarterly, a Washington magazine that analyzed every House race
this week, predicted Democrats would wind up with a two-seat gain,
and Republicans would still control Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Republicans had hoped to pick up five seats to
get the filibuster-proof majority of 60. But analysts at the Cook
Political Report said the GOP gain is more likely to be between one
and three seats.

<P>
   Also angry at the president is 67-year old Georgia Triplett, who
attended a debate in Ironton, Ohio, between incumbent Democratic
Rep. Ted Strictland and GOP challenger Nancy Hollister, who are
locked in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   `` I was a teacher for 32 years and I find it difficult to say
the president is a good role model,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett, who had already voted by absentee ballot, said that
she usually votes Republican and this year, she noted, ``I did not
even hesitate,'' to choose the GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cracchiola, a Democrat from Kentucky who voted for Clinton
in 1996, said he has been tempted not to vote this year because the
scandal had turned him off to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point,'' he said. ``You vote for a guy. He does a
good job. Then you find out he's lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the last-minute GOP barrage, the Democrats have
fired back with their own ads warning that Republicans are so
focused on investigations they are ignoring issues such as
education and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans _ so focused on attacking the president _ they've
forgotten about us. Next Tuesday, vote Democratic and tell Congress
we're ready to move on,'' the announcer says in the spot.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is shared by a number of voters.
</P>
<P>
   In Donaldson, Ga., Ashley Register, a semi-retired stockbroker
who has voted Republican in the last three elections said this year
the GOP emphasis on scandal has soured him on the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is going to make me vote Democrat,'' he said. ``I
think the Republicans have run it into the ground. They are using
the scandal as vehicle to hurt Clinton and the Democrats, and it is
going to backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton, N.C., Sharon Royal, the proprietor of Sharon's
Country Diner, took a break from fixing eggs and grits to talk
about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Royal said she initially believed the president should have been
impeached because of the lying. But then she changed her mind when
the media refused to let go of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been covered so much that people just got tired of it.
Let him run the country like he's been doing,'' she said. Royal
said she will probably vote for Democrats this year.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson have been barnstorming the country trying to energize
key Democratic constituencies, including African-Americans who are
particularly angry about the investigation. However, the president,
who usually relishes campaigning, has traveled the country to raise
money for Democratic candidates but has avoided large rallies.
</P>
<P>
   African-American turnout could well determine the outcome of
North Carolina Senate race where GOP incumbent Lauch Faircloth is
locked in a tight race with Democratic lawyer John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth has tied Edwards to Clinton in numerous ads to
energize conservative voters. But at the Omega House restaurant in
Winston Salem two African-American women rushed up to embrace
Edwards, and later said they were even more determined to vote for
Democrats this year because of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women, Cynthia Mack, a 40-year-old government worker
said the investigation into Clinton's behavior was ``political rape
and character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Terry Spaugh, 44, said that she is not concerned
about Clinton's conduct, saying her husband would also have been be
tempted by Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``What man wouldn't want that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ebbing interest in the scandal, candidates still are
confronted with the issue at various events.
</P>
<P>
   At the debate between Strictland and Hollister, the sole
question about the impeachment came at the end of the 90-minute
forum.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister, who has called on Clinton to resign, said she was
``appalled'' at his behavior and defended the Republicans
open-ended probe of the president.
</P>
<P>
   While Strictland said he was keeping an open mind on how to vote
on impeachment, he also justified his vote for the Democratic
proposal to limit the scope and time of any inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not good for this thing to drag on for months and years
in the future,'' said Strictland. ``We need to bring this matter to
a conclusion and them move on to improve health care, improve
education and save Social Security, the matters that really count
for most citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer drew sustained applause from the audience. &QL;

N.H. SPECTATORS PAY TRIBUTE TO COURAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. _ The draw was septuagenarian &UR;  &LR; John Glenn's return
to space, but another astronaut was on the minds of a captive,
capacity audience reclining in tilted armchairs inside the
planetarium here.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of Christa McAuliffe, the Concord High School teacher
who perished in the Challenger explosion in 1986, literally
surrounded 100 people watching the liftoff of the space shuttle
Discovery. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I was nervous,'' said Jack Bentz, a great-grandfather who
watched the launch projected on the 40-foot dome of the planetarium
named for McAuliffe. ``I felt that something was going to happen.
But when we saw they were safe, I let out a big sigh.''
</P>
<P>
   But while McAuliffe's fate was on the minds of everyone here,
the memory of her courage and inspiration was stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Auger, 26, of Pembroke, brought her 7-year-old son to
the planetarium to witness history and to honor McAuliffe's
accomplishments as the first US civilian to be selected for space
travel.
</P>
<P>
   Auger recalled watching the Challenger explosion live on
television, but not being aware that the tragedy would be so
historic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, she knows. So, bearing witness to Glenn's flight
in the city where McAuliffe taught social studies had special
meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about Christa,'' Auger said.
</P>
<P>
   As her son paid rapt attention to simulated displays in a
shuttle mockup, Auger described how he had sat ``mesmerized'' by
the ``fire'' that thrust the shuttle skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice for him to see this, especially in a place like
this,'' Auger said.
</P>
<P>
   Planetarium director Jeanne Gerulskis decided only this week to
invite the public to a CNN broadcast of the launch.
</P>
<P>
   The planetarium had been deluged by so many calls asking whether
a special event was planned that Gerulskis decided to throw open
the doors free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the callers, Gerulskis said, ``I didn't know if anyone
would come.''
</P>
<P>
   The seats were quickly taken, and an overflow crowd watched the
launch from other venues in the planetarium complex.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the small dome, applause echoed off the curved walls as
Discovery hurtled toward space 19 minutes behind schedule. Until
that point, the planetarium had been eerily quiet as spectators
from infants to 80-year-olds were bathed in images of blue Florida
skies.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast was the first showing of a shuttle launch in the
planetarium, which opened in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, shuttle liftoffs had been carried by small TV
monitors in the complex.
</P>
<P>
   Gerulskis said she hoped that Glenn's journey will rekindle an
interest in the space program that has declined dramatically since
McAuliffe and six crewmates died over the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Vetter, the planetarium's development director, believes
such a resurgence is possible _ even though the scientific basis
for many shuttle missions does not grab the public's interest.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's turnout bolsters that thinking, she said, and helps
reaffirm the planetarium's forward-looking mission instead of
dwelling on past tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Vetter said, the planetarium showed videos of
the Challenger explosion. Now, it was time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christa would have wanted us to move forward,'' Vetter said.
``Instead of showing Christa's story, we're showing Christa's
vision.''
</P>
<P>
   That vision may have been glimpsed by Melissa Cappucci, a
9-year-old from Concord.
</P>
<P>
   As she left the planetarium with her mother and younger brother,
Melissa talked excitedly of watching her first launch.
</P>
<P>
   She also talked of a new-found goal: ``I would like to walk on
the moon.''

`METHUSELAH' GENE THAT CONTROLS LONGEVITY   IS FOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists have discovered a longevity gene that protects
against environmental stress and extends life by more than
one-third _ at least among fruit flies.
</P>
<P>
   The gene, which they have dubbed ``methuselah'' after the
character in Genesis who supposedly lived 969 years, is another
piece in a fast-accumulating mosaic of evidence that longevity is
not an immutable fact of life but a trait that can be manipulated
genetically _ perhaps eventually in humans too.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of longevity genes has been demonstrated so far in
yeast, roundworms, and fruit flies. The new gene, reported Friday
by scientists from the California Institute of Technology in the
journal Science, is ``the first such gene that has been well
identified in drosophila,'' or fruit flies, said David Finkelstein,
a National Institute on Aging scientist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long step from drosophila to healthy 90-year-olds, but
this is all part of a field that is beginning to close in on the
aging process and think about ways to intervene in ways that are
practical and socially useful,'' added Daniel Perry, executive
director of the Alliance for Aging Research.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit flies are a favorite animal for genetic studies because
their normal 80-day lifespan enables scientists to observe the
effect of various genes over generations in a relatively short
period of time. It takes two years to observe lifelong genetic
effects in a single generation of mice.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good bet, scientists say, that longevity genes in
primitive species play a role in all organisms' metabolism and
response to stress. ``Now it's inescapable that aging is regulated
deliberately by genes,'' San Francisco geneticist Cynthia Kenyon
wrote in a Science commentary on the Caltech work. ``Since it
happens in both worms and fruit flies, you have to be crazy not to
think it won't happen in vertebrates.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies have demonstrated that fruit flies can be inbred
for longevity. Michael Rose and his colleagues at the University of
California at Irvine have bred flies with twice the normal lifespan
or more, and are on the trail of perhaps 100 genes they believe
contribute to long life.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking thing about the Caltech results is
that a single gene protected the insects against the wear and tear
of different kinds of stress _ starvation, high temperatures, and a
diet laced with the weedkiller paraquat.
</P>
<P>
   Normal flies fed paraquat became sluggish within 12 hours and by
48 hours nearly 90 percent were dead. But flies carrying the
``methuselah'' gene were still active 24 hours after eating the
toxin, and at 48 hours, more than half were still alive.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit flies bearing the ``methuselah'' mutants were 20 to 30
percent heavier than those with the normal version of the gene,
suggesting that it has something to do with regulation of
metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   The normal function of the unmutated gene is not known, but it
is obviously important. Fruit fly embryos that lack it entirely die
before hatching.
</P>
<P>
   The Caltech scientists found that the mutant gene is the
blueprint for a protein that sits on cells' surfaces and hooks onto
chemicals that are probably involved in the stress response. They
hypothesize that the gene is part of cells' defense system against
so-called free radicals _ highly reactive oxygen molecules that are
byproducts of normal metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Free oxygen radicals can damage cells in various ways, so
scientists are focusing on mechanisms to soak them up or defend
cells against them with antioxidant chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   Raj Sohal of Southern Methodist University, an expert on such
oxidative stress, said the Caltech findings are potentially
important. But he stressed that researchers must demonstrate that
the increased longevity is not merely a result of slowing the fruit
flies' metabolism _ a well-known but not particularly illuminating
way to extend various species' life spans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really hopeful and really interesting,'' added Rose.
``I expect to see many more mutants like these generated. We'll
have to sort through them to see which really stands the test.''

UP IN THE SKY! A RICH OLD GUY! 
</HEADLINE>
   By JON CARROLL  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am bewildered by the amount of attention that John Glenn's
flight into space is getting. I am bewildered by the messages that
people are reading into the event. I am bewildered by the event
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what happened, insofar as I understand it. Sen. Glenn,
never exactly a shrinking violet, decided it would be an amusing
capstone to his career to go into space one more time.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you remember the characterization of Glenn in Tom
Wolfe's ``The Right Stuff'': a prissy sort of fellow who seemed to
sense that, someday in the far future, private detectives might be
sent to dig up dirt on his every youthful indiscretion _ a problem
he solved by having no youthful indiscretions.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad guy, but just quivering with ambition. Every aspect of
his public life since then seems to match that impression. Good
moderate politician, works hard, a little too impressed with his
own virtue. That's OK _ there are worse things in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So Glenn gets that old counting-backward itch again. He has a
lot of juice, being a senator and all. He leans on NASA in
not-so-subtle ways. NASA finally caves.
</P>
<P>
   Why is this a triumph of anything other than the commonplace but
unlovely truth that there are different rules for the powerful? Is
this somehow a victory for senior citizens, that a powerful ancient
politician can be hurled into the ionosphere? Does it give new hope
to anyone besides other powerful old guys?
</P>
<P>
   It's like celebrating Mayor Willie Brown's ability to get a
table at Postrio without a reservation as a triumph for African
Americans everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   So NASA, which probably welcomes all the positive publicity but
resents the extra work, had to come up with post-facto reasons why
catapulting a senator into ovoid orbit has (set ital)scientific
significance.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Well, science is wonderful that way _ science can test anything.
Science can test the effects of aging on the ability to withstand
the rigors of zero gravity. Kind of a well-down-the-list
experiment, one would think, since the likelihood is that any trips
into space taken by 80-year-olds will be of the Timothy Leary
variety, one-way and postmortem.
</P>
<P>
   But still. They design some tests. Glenn goes down for a final
medical workup, and it turns out that he has some mysterious
ailment that disqualifies him from participating in one of the
principal tests.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with your regular astronauts, that might be an automatic
disqualification. But John Glenn is not really an astronaut; he's a
public relations device. He's a symbol of some damn thing. So
suddenly the scientific experiment is (set ital)not that
important.(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   (Were you bothered, by the way, by how everyone turned coy when
John Glenn's unfortunate condition was discussed? Here's a guy
whose blooming good health, whose fitness for this task, is yet
another symbol of the Best Is Yet to Come, and when a ``condition''
is uncovered _ many 77-year-olds have ``conditions''; the challenge
is to understand them and live with them _ all of a sudden it's a
big secret.
</P>
<P>
   (Disease is shameful, one more time. He's even selling out his
own symbolic value.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Glenn going into space will act as a symbolic Miata for a
million older Americans. Maybe it will be like Viagra without the
side effects. I dunno. I myself am over 50, and it sure doesn't do
anything for me.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly I think it's hype that has been, for curious reasons,
largely unexamined by the media. It's almost as though this were
some high-tech version of the Special Olympics, and the point is
just taking part and trying your best and, darn it, everyone gets a
medal.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a bunch of taxpayer money that could go to other
things, perhaps even to other NASA projects. It is turning science
into showbiz. I hope he makes it back safe and sound, but it seems
to me the rocket should have had a big banner streaming along
behind it reading: Was This Trip Necessary?

THE SAD WINDING DOWN OF AN UGLY CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Political struggles never end nicely. Feelings are too
strong, passions too raw, stakes too high for pretty endings.
</P>
<P>
   As we close out this governor's race, it's hard not to conclude
that it was less illuminative than it could have been and a lot
more negative than it had to be. The media bear part of the blame;
that has to be said as well.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sad event when Ray Flynn, the fading Boston Strongboy,
a working-class hero when he was mayor and a man down on his luck
now, showed up for a hollow
endorsement-that-was-not-technically-an-endorsement of Republican
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   It took place in a barroom, the same tap where Jolly Olde Bill
Weld quaffed an ale with then-Mayor Flynn for benefit of cameras in
a previous election. But this time hundreds of angry building
trades workers marched outside, denouncing Flynn's apostasy.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night, Ray nominated himself for the Gyppo Nolan role,
after the IRA traitor who betrayed the cause he'd spent a lifetime
serving. Ray is down on his luck, out of work, apparently needing
the palship or patronage of a conservative Republican running
desperately to defeat the AFL-CIO and labor's consensus choice,
Scott Harshbarger.
</P>
<P>
   So Ray swallowed hard and stood at the bar with Cellucci, both
men looking uncomfortable on TV, as the union pickets outside
picked their old champ from City Hall. ``This is the most
disappointing night I've ever had,'' said a grim-faced Bobby
Haynes, the formidable Ironworkers chieftain who heads a
rejuvenated state AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   The chant from countless Bruins games rang through the
neighborhood: ``Na-na-na-na ... hey-hey-ay, gooooood-bye!'' So
long, Ray. Your buddies of the denim-and-dungaree brotherhood have
written you out of their club. It was sad to see. Ray did a lot for
working people, always fighting the kind of politics Cellucci
springs from.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci mumbled some neutral phrases about liking working-class
people. I'm sure he feels he's sincere. But the politics he
practices is opposed to too much of what the unions and the
non-union workers who benefit from union muscle need.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the building trades' protest, Tom McIntyre of the
Bricklayers Union gulped his lunch in Amrhein's on Broadway in
South Boston. He'd gotten word Flynn was about to leap the fence
and was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going out from here to get some signs painted, `Let's Make
a Deal, Hello Monty Hall,''' said McIntyre sadly. He'd always been
a Flynn guy; he'd been one of the handful who signed on to the
doomed Flynn-for-governor campaign last winter. And now Ray was
going out to stab the Democrats on election eve. And McIntyre and
his brickies, and the ironworkers, plumbers, carpenters, glaziers,
electricians, ``a little bit of everything'' under the building
trades' ample awning, would be picketing Flynn for the first time
in his and their life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't belong there,'' said McIntyre later. ``Ray turned
his back on lots of people who put him in the mayor's office.
Loyalty is not a frivolous bit of business. He was never more in
error.'' Harshbarger is a handful back of Cellucci, in the Globe
poll a week out, but the Democrat's advisers say he's within a
point or two. Hillary Clinton cut a new TV spot for him and told a
Bay State Democrat, ``I'm doing everything I can for Scott.''
</P>
<P>
   Down at the level of street campaigning, the old bricklayer
voiced pride in his comrades. ``It's great to be in the company of
people that stand for something _ and these guys, they are not
unsophisticated people, they weren't there just because we asked
them to be there. They had a clear understanding of why they were
there. There's too much winking and blinking going on. This
election is about working people. And Harshbarger is our guy.'' As
he spoke, Harshbarger was running around with Mayors Mike Albano in
Springfield and Ray Mariano in Worcester, Attorney General Mike
Moore of Mississippi, the antitobacco champion, and pocketing
endorsements in Lawrence and Lowell.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's chief of staff, Virginia Buckingham, had played the
ethnic card, accusing the attorney general of being
``anti-Italian'' and offering nothing convincing by way of
evidence. That clumsy bid to energize the Italo vote was a pathetic
coda to a campaign year in which more opportunities were lost than
seized. For a guy who is always complaining about negative
politics, Cellucci practices an awful lot of it.
</P>
<P>
   The most important corner turned in Massachusetts Tuesday may be
Question 2, the referendum on public campaign financing, up by 3-1
in polls. There are 6,000 volunteers behind this important reform
initiative, with $1 million behind it. This is our version of what
Maine and Vermont have already done. It's the voters' chance to
take the candy away from bloated politicians who gorge on campaign
cash like crack.
</P>
<P>
   State-by-state, up-from-the-bottom reform is the only way our
corrupt system of campaign funding will be brought to heel. If the
Yes on 2 forces win here with the state version of the national
effort US Representative John Tierney spearheaded in the House this
year, our politics will be a lot less susceptible to the election
time thumb-on-the-scale of special interests.

MANIC ABRASIVENESS THAT LACKS IMAGINATION

<P>
   THE LAST BIG THING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed and written by: Dan Zukovic &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Zukovic, Susan Heimbinder, Mark Ruffalo, Pamela
Dickerson, Andrew Falk, Sibel Ergener, James Lorinz &QL;

   Running time: 98 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: R (strong language) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Big Thing,'' a would-be millennial comedy, can't find
a way around its central problem _ rendering watchable a
transparent, self-important bore who tools around L.A., jeering at
scenesters. His self-proclaimed agenda consists of confronting and
verbally abusing wannabe actors, rockers, comedians, and models who
believe his line about interviewing them for a new mag he's putting
out called The Next Big Thing, but which, in fact, doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Long before he starts ranting into his tape recorder about the
pathetic ego thirst of his subjects, the truth beneath his
overpitched diatribes and obsessive agenda becomes dispiritingly
obvious. Far from being genuinely outraged, or even offended, he
only wants a piece of the same action his subjects want to get in
on. But unlike most hypocrites and con men, this one is charmless
and tedious. Only the terminally insecure would hold still for his
projectile invective.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, may be the film's point, assuming it has one.
Writer-director-star Dan Zukovic brings nonstop manic abrasiveness
to his character named, none too imaginatively, Simon Geist. But
Zukovic the actor has only himself to blame for not giving himself
more to work with and forfeiting any claim to trenchant comment on
LA nothingness. The film flickers momentarily to life only when he
finds himself rationalizing his deepening association with a model
who seems to get a kick out of him and brings him into a music
video project.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this funny is the reaction of his depressed, intense,
virtually silent disciple, Susan Heimbinder's Darla, a trust-funded
Gen Xer paying for the aggressively bland tract house that serves
as their base, hiding her collection of '70s lunch boxes, fearing
his scorn. When Simon glibly speaks of switching tactics and
subverting the system from within after he's finally offered real
work, the things she does with her eyes say more than all his
strident one-note braying.

LET HISTORY JUDGE ALEX HALEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ I am a sucker for the desperate cause, the long shot,
the quixotic endeavor. Certainly, Philip Nobile's 19-year campaign
to have the Pulitzer Prize board rescind the 1977 special award to
the late Alex Haley for ``Roots'' would fall into that category. On
the one hand, I think Nobile is doomed to fail. Successive board
chairmen have told him to go fly a kite. Last year's chair, Geneva
Overholser, quoting one of her predecessors, Russell Baker, told
Nobile: ``We are not in the business of passing judgment on the
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand ... well, you be the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Since ``Roots'' was published, plenty of derogatory information
about its creation has surfaced. In a 1978 trial, Haley admitted to
plagiarizing from Harold Courlander's ``The African'' and had
copied from four other public domain sources. He paid Courlander
$650,000 in an out-of-court settlement. Furthermore, some key
``Roots'' episodes have been revealed to be fiction. (The book was
and is sold as a work of nonfiction.) For instance, Haley's
dramatic account of learning of his ancestry from an African
``griot'' appears to have been staged.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview for a 1997 BBC documentary never aired in this
country, Judge Robert Ward, who presided over the Courlander trial,
said: ``In academia, if someone were to have obtained a degree and
it later came out that he had copied major portions of his thesis,
the degree would likely be taken away. I don't know if there's a
parallel with respect to the Pulitzer Prize, but I think ... an
award that was not properly earned could very well be taken away.''
(According to Pulitzer administrator Seymour Topping, a prize has
never been rescinded. In 1981, The Washington Post returned a
Pulitzer Prize awarded to Janet Cooke, who had fabricated portions
of her winning entry.)
</P>
<P>
   Haley died in 1992, and many people acquainted with Nobile's
jihad prefer to let him rest in peace. But, curiously, Haley does
live on in two posthumous works, both clearly labeled as fiction.
Both of them _ the ``Roots'' sequel called ``Queen'' and the
just-published ``Mama Flora's Family'' _ were primarily written by
Newburyport's David Stevens, who befriended Haley toward the end of
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign is one of the most mean-spirited things I've
ever come across,'' Stevens says. ``In hindsight, the world would
have been easier on Alex's ghost if `Roots' had been published as
fiction. This book changed the thinking of a nation, about slavery
and about history. I wonder where this lack of generosity is coming
from. ... How is this different from those marvelous poets we call
Homer?''
</P>
<P>
   Let history judge. History-like, it is already judging. Haley is
distinguished by his absence from the recently published ``Norton
Anthology of African American Literature'' co-edited by Harvard's
Henry Louis Gates Jr. ``Let's speak candidly,'' says Gates, who was
friends with Haley and is close to his family. ``Most of us feel
it's highly unlikely that Alex actually found the village whence
his ancestors sprang. `Roots' is a work of the imagination rather
than strict historical scholarship. It was an important event
because it captured everyone's imagination.''

   On Oct. 23, Dr. Barnett Slepian, who performed abortions, was
shot and killed by a sniper while standing with his wife and son in
his kitchen in the Buffalo suburb of Amherst, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   They had just returned from synagogue. Slepian, father of four,
beloved gynecologist and obstetrician, is now a statistic in the
annals of antiabortion violence: the seventh medical practitioner
to be killed since 1992 in a wave of violence that in 1997 touched
one in four abortion clinics _ arson, acid attacks, stalkings,
assaults, death threats.
</P>
<P>
   His death leaves Buffalo, a city of 350,000, with only three
doctors who perform abortions. As I write, two of them are ``in
seclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Slepian's death is being treated in the media as an occasion for
revelations about the violent wing of the antichoice movement. It's
great copy. By now, every reporter in America has probably visited
``The Nuremberg Files'' website, where, on pages decorated with
pictures of supposedly aborted fetuses and lines of dripping blood,
Neal Horsley of Carrollton, Ga., maintains detailed personal
descriptions, including photos, addresses and phone numbers, of
abortion providers, as well as the names and ages of their spouses
and children.
</P>
<P>
   On his list the names of the wounded are in gray; those of the
dead are struck through with a line. Horsley, who calls himself a
``journalist,'' denies that he advocates violence or is in touch
with those who commit it, although Slepian's name was crossed out
within hours of his murder.
</P>
<P>
   The press has also made much of the fact that Slepian was the
fifth abortion provider, one other in Western New York and three in
Canada, in the past four years to be shot in their homes by a
sniper around this time of year, apparently in honor of Veterans'
Dayfor Canadians, a Remembrance Dayon which the antichoicers mourn
the ``unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you know about that? I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that New York's Attorney General Dennis Vacco was
the U.S. attorney in Buffalo in 1992, when the city was targeted by
Operation Rescue's ``Spring for Life,'' and that he defied a
federal judge by refusing to prosecute Operation Rescue for its
many flagrant violations of the Freedom of Access to Clinic
Entrances Act (FACE)? One of his first acts as attorney general was
to abolish the Office of Reproductive Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Sen. Al D'Amato, recent recipient of
endorsements from the Human Rights Campaign and from influential
New York-based black clergymen Floyd Flake and Calvin Butts, voted
against FACE, and that his two narrow re-elections came from votes
on the Right to Life Party line?
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times poll shows 69 percent of New Yorkers don't even
know that D'Amato is antichoice. As New York Observer columnist
Richard Brookhiser put it, the state's pro-choice majority forces
the senator to keep quiet about ``the good he does'' and his ``love
of the unborn.'' But what kind of pro-choice majority needs 18
years to figure out where its senator stands?
</P>
<P>
   If zealots like the ones who burn down abortion clinics and kill
doctors and stalk their children were committing the same crimes
against, say, dermatology clinics or convents or the U.S. Marines,
we'd probably know all these things and more.
</P>
<P>
   We'd know about the annual White Rose Dinner in Washington at
which the antichoice leaders celebrate their heroes. We'd know that
four out of five of the doctors shot around Remembrance Day were
Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   But then, if antiabortion violence was treated like the
terrorism it is, the perpetrators might have been caught by now. It
was the National Abortion Federation, not the police, who warned
area doctors of the Remembrance Day pattern.
</P>
<P>
   We are told that violent antichoicers are a mere fringe.
Obviously, few antichoicers commit murder or arson. But, as the
Matthew Shepard case reminds us, extreme vocabulary creates a
climate of moral permission for extreme acts. This is a movement
whose main spokespeople, many of them mantled in clerical or
political authority, regularly use words such as ``babykillers,''
``murder,'' ``holocaust'' and ``Nazis,'' thus legitimizing just
about anything.
</P>
<P>
   If antichoicers are so opposed to violence, how come Eric
Rudolph, the suspect in the bombing of a Birmingham, Ala., clinic,
which killed a security guard and seriously injured a nurse, has
had no trouble swimming like a fish in the sea of the people of
North Carolinaeven now that he has been charged with the Atlanta
Summer Olympics bombings?
</P>
<P>
   At the practical level, antiabortion violence makes it harder to
choose abortion, to find it, to afford it. Like all terrorism, it
aims to terrify, not just the brave doctors who still perform
abortions but also the doctors of tomorrow, who simply choose
another specialty. It also aims to terrify the support staffs and,
of course, women.
</P>
<P>
   More subtly, the violence makes ``mainstream'' antichoicers look
reasonable by moving the debate ever further onto their turf. In
Michigan this past summer a prosecutor made a 12-year-old who'd
been raped by her brother a ward of the state to prevent her
parents from taking her out of state for a late abortion. In
Louisiana, a woman awaiting a heart transplant was denied a
medically necessary abortion by the hospital that had been treating
her because the chances of her dying in childbirth weren't higher
than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Louisiana, a mentally disabled 17-year-old raped by her
father was denied a Medicaid abortion. (Both eventually had
abortions in Texas, thanks to the National Abortion Federation,
which arranged and paid for them.) And these are the ``hard
cases''involving rape, incest and risk to lifethat the media
assures us will always be protected!
</P>
<P>
   The middle ground keeps moving right. And it will do so as long
as pro-choicers leave activism to the other side.

WHERE WERE YOU IN '62? ASK GLENN, AND HE'LL TELL YOU: WHERE I AM
TODAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It lasted only a moment, a few seconds at most. But for those
fleeting seconds, it was 1962 again. John Glenn was soaring into
space atop a fiery rocket, carrying with him the hopes and
aspirations of a nation that desperately needed to believe in
itself.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of deja vu couldn't have lasted for more than an
instant, of course, because so much has changed since February of
'62, when Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the United States was losing the space race to the
Soviet Union. Today, the Soviet Union is merely an unpleasant
memory, and America virtually holds the patent on space travel.
Non-Americans who want to see the world from the top down are
inclined to hitch a ride with us.
</P>
<P>
   When John Glenn squeezed into his one-seater Mercury space
capsule for a three-orbit, five-hour space flight in 1962, he was a
40-year-old adventurer, one of America's original seven astronauts.
Today, Glenn is but one of seven crew members embarked on a
nine-day mission aboard the space shuttle Discovery _ and he is 77
years old, less a pioneer on this space flight than a human guinea
pig who won a seat on the shuttle by offering himself as a subject
for scientific studies of the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   So much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, space was the new frontier. Glenn and his fellow
astronauts were the 20th-century counterparts of Daniel Boone, Davy
Crockett, Lewis and Clark. Now these space flights are so routine
that the TV networks rarely bother with live coverage; astronauts'
names are familiar only to the most fanatical of space buffs.
</P>
<P>
   But for a few moments on Thursday, as fire spewed from the
rockets that boosted Discovery into space, the mundane spectacle of
space travel seemed new again. When the countdown to liftoff
reached the final seconds, even the most jaded launch-watcher must
have felt the heart-stopping combination of excitement,
anticipation and fear that Americans used to feel every time one of
these flaming spaceships set off on a mind-boggling journey into
the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   I felt the excitement, and I count myself among the jaded.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the space program lost its luster when the shuttle
Challenger exploded in January 1986, killing schoolteacher Christa
McAuliffe and everyone else on board. Space travel didn't seem
thrilling after that; it seemed dangerous and unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   I fully understand the argument that exploring new worlds can be
hazardous, that many Earth-bound pioneers suffered and died while
spreading civilization across the wilderness that once stood
between the greatest nation on earth and its full potential. None
of that changes my post-Challenger perception of space travel as a
frivolous risk and an extravagant expense.
</P>
<P>
   It's just my opinion and I'm entitled to it, even though I've
rarely found anyone who agrees with me. When I've written on this
subject in the past, I have usually been rewarded with a barrage of
phone calls and letters from readers who dismiss my misgivings
about the space program as ignorant and shortsighted.
</P>
<P>
   But then, ``ignorant'' and ``shortsighted'' is how some readers
describe most of my opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Glenn's return to space have ridiculed his mission as
a publicity stunt _ or worse, as a political payoff to a senator en
route to retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Some have dismissed the former astronaut's flight as a
transparent ``victory lap'' for a onetime hero of the space race.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to take Glenn and the space program honchos at their
word when they insist that Glenn's participation will provide
significant scientific benefits, not just for space travelers but
for those of us who plan to live out our lives right here on Earth.
Doesn't a man who has devoted his entire adult life to serving his
country deserve the benefit of the doubt?
</P>
<P>
   Of course he does, just as he deserves the unqualified gratitude
of countless Americans who remember Glenn's first trip into space _
and who were thrilled to relive it on Thursday, if only for a
moment.

`TEMPTATIONS' WORKS BETTER AS CONCERT THAN BIOPIC

   THE TEMPTATIONS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by: Allan Arkush &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On: NBC &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: Sunday and Monday at 9 p.m. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: TVPG &QC;

</P>
<P>
   Purists won't find sunshine on a cloudy day in ``The
Temptations,'' a two-part movie fictionalizing the ups and downs of
the hugely successful soul group. It's as TV-ized as TV-ized gets,
with open schmaltziness and character arcs that span three scenes
and every plot turn listed in the TV-movie recipe book under
``pathos,'' from substance abuse and adultery to cancer, the death
of a child, a shooting, and suicide. Based on the 1988
autobiography of original Temptation Otis Williams, who coproduced
the movie, it's also factually skewed, with significant events
omitted and a highly romanticized view of the group's formative
years on the streets of Detroit. We see the Temptations' early-'60s
Motown audition as if through a sepia haze, with an unusually
gentle Berry Gordy announcing: ``I didn't like it'' _ pause,
worried looks all round _ ``I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, most everyone else will overlook the biopic cliches
and dramatic inanities and succumb happily to ``The Temptations,''
which airs in two parts on Sunday and Monday nights at 9 on
WHDH-Ch.7. The music is, of course, absolutely irresistible _ the
beautifully parsed harmonies, the dynamic lead singing, the lush,
sweet melodies. Wisely, the makers of ``The Temptations'' have
fitted in as many song sequences as possible, most of them using
original recordings, and so for every bit of condensed soap opera
(wait until you catch Melvin Franklin's death scene in Part 2) we
are given an electrified Temptations performance as compensation.
Once the group receives the Motown makeover, the musical numbers
are accompanied by sensational dancing _ that lighthearted, campy
choreography that is a distant cousin to mime.
</P>
<P>
   Director Allan Arkush's presentation of the group's creative
hours _ on the street, onstage, in the studio _ is consistently
outstanding. The mostly unknown actors, all energetic, lip-synch
the songs convincingly and unself-consciously, and the close
camerawork manages to capture the intensity and pleasure of making
such full-bodied music. You can almost suspend disbelief and
pretend you are really watching Smokey Robinson teaching the young
group ``My Girl,'' or David Ruffin joining them onstage for the
first time, or the recording of their first Motown hit, ``The Way
You Do the Things You Do.'' In one effective sequence, we see two
screens of ``Ball of Confusion'' in performance, one by the
original group on tour and the other by former members Eddie
Kendricks and David Ruffin, who have vindictively decided to tour
as the Temptations.
</P>
<P>
   The acting is fine all around, as the Temptations' personnel
constantly shifts. Leon gives an arch spin to David Ruffin, the
bespectacled Temptation dogged by drug abuse and ego. With his
pusher/manager in tow, Ruffin makes a power play and insists the
group rename itself as David Ruffin and the Temptations.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Malik Whitfield is the model of loyalty as Otis
Williams, and DB Woodside plays Melvin Franklin as a sweet-natured
sidekick. While they squeeze the most out of their uninspired
dialogue, the actors are at their best during the musical
performances.
</P>
<P>
   And of course, they are helped along by the amusing hairstyles,
which evolve along with the eras. Naturally, when the
high-school-age Otis decides to become a singer he goes right to
the local barbershop, submits to the pain of having his hair
straightened, and orders up a popular cut known as the ``Tony
Curtis.''

MINISERIES ABOUT THE MOTOWN PHENOM MISSES A FEW BEATS

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone who lived through The Temptations' heyday, the
knowledge that there's more there _ and that it isn't all that
pretty _ has long been severed from the soul group's sleek aura as
the quintessential song-and-dance men with a string of infectious
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes ``The Temptations,'' the miniseries,
enlightening us with the real lowdown, warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   Airing at 8 p.m. CST Sunday and Monday on NBC, the musically
rich ``The Temptations'' will make you move, but I can't vouch for
how ``moving'' it ultimately will be. That might have more to do
with your personal stake in the music and the real lives behind the
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   A definitive story of The Tempts, whose rise is well-documented
but whose fall has always been somewhat sketchy, certainly offers
great promise. (Aren't those promos tempting?) But ``The
Temptations'' doesn't even attempt to explain this mythic phase of
American music, staging instead a production that is essentially
great music masking melodramatic, mushy and often simple-minded
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1988 biography of Otis Williams, the last surviving
original Temptation, the film is told in narrative, chronological
order. It begins with Williams' (Charles Malik Whitfield's)
wide-eyed obsession with starting a singing group, even though his
voice was merely adequate. If anything, he was superb at finding
talent and blanketing himself with it.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, we see him literally chasing down Melvin Franklin
(D.B. Woodside), portrayed here as a mama's boy who hid behind a
tree while Williams asked his mother whether he could join the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Williams recruited Eddie Kendricks (Terron Brooks) and Paul
Williams (Christian Payton) along the way, and even came up with
the group's name off the cuff after Motown's Berry Gordy refused to
audition them without one.
</P>
<P>
   Try as it might, ``The Temptations'' doesn't make the connection
that Detroit in general and Motown in particular was, during the
'60s, the center of the music universe, a tiny outfit kicking out
monster hits from folks like The Supremes, Stevie Wonder and Smokey
Robinson, who wrote much of The Temptations' early material.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, The Temptations grew as Motown grew, melding
doo-wop with the house band's blues and the pop/R&AMP;B inventions of
Gordy's stable of producers. In many ways, The Temptations were the
ultimate Motown act, a group whose hills-and-valleys career
paralleled the changing fortunes of Motown.
</P>
<P>
   They broke out in 1964 with the hit ``The Way You Do the Things
You Do.'' The floodgates opened: ``My Girl.'' ``Cloud Nine.''
``Can't Get Next to You.'' ``Ball of Confusion.'' ``Psychedelic
Shack.'' During their most successful stretch, they had five
platinum albums, four Grammy awards and 12 gold albums.
</P>
<P>
   But The Tempts also had their share of underlying drama and
tragedy, and ``The Temptations'' zeros in quite closely on those
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Williams was lost in alcohol and eventually killed himself
with a gun while sitting in his car. (His drinking, wife-beating
descent is chronicled artistically with a glorious video montage
covered by ``Papa Was a Rolling Stone.)''
</P>
<P>
   Tumultuous lead singer David Ruffin (Leon) fell into drug abuse
and is shown here being tossed out of a moving car at the front
door of a hospital, bloody and dying.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy cigarette smoker Kendricks died of lung cancer, and
Franklin had rheumatoid arthritis, which broke down his immune
system and contributed to a stroke. (In one of the final scenes, he
is laughing and talking with his mother and Otis Williams one
moment; the next, he's dead.)
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the group continued, reloading with members _
there have been 19 so far, with some, like Dennis Edwards (Charles
Ley), leaving and returning, only to leave again.
</P>
<P>
   One irksome problem is that the film telegraphs scenes rather
than simply developing them. Songwriter Norman Whitfield (Mel
Jackson), responsible for hits like ``Ain't Too Proud to Beg'' and
``My Girl,'' wafts through the proceedings like a talented but
egotistical sleazebag. Even Gordy (Obba Babatunde) and longtime
manager Shelly Berger (Alan Rosenberg) are stuck in shallowly
conceived roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Temptations'' tries mightily to capture this drama while
telling a cohesive story, showing the group in rehearsals and
performing and yelling at one another, usually about Ruffin's slide
into the darker side.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ruffin, he's thoroughly demonized. Leon, who plays him
quite well, accordingly breathes fire and wears horns. Ruffin was
known for his womanizing, drug addiction and mood swings, but why?
He is first seen as a ladies' man, recording solo with Motown,
until The Temptations needed a lead singer. One scene shows Ruffin
nearly in tears waiting for the tour bus. ``Nothing's wrong,'' he
says to one of the Tempts. ``For the first time, everything's
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a few scenes later, Ruffin is showing up at a picnic with
his personal drug supplier.
</P>
<P>
   After his dismissal from the group, Ruffin showed up at so many
of The Temptations' performances that they began to employ security
to stop him. But he never made it close enough to swipe the mike
from Edwards, leap on stage and lead the group in song, as is
dramatically played out in the film.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, too, that Williams is the film's
co-producer, and the most clearly defined of the original members.
He's shown here as a family man (even though his wife divorced him
for spending too much time on the road and not enough with their
son), as a level-headed survivor who was one of the least-known of
the Tempts but actually was the glue that held them together.
</P>
<P>
   Over four hours, you'd think writers Kevin Arkadie, Robert P.
Johnson and Alan Landsburg could have shown the Motown era more
vividly, illustrating why, for instance, the Tempts at one point
came to a complete standstill. (It was during the period Gordy
turned his attention to making movies instead of records, and all
the Motown artists found their instant success no longer so
instant.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Temptations'' is nearly saved by the music, which becomes
even more poignant as the troubles mount. Even with the movie's
many flaws, at least one thing's certain: You won't listen to the
music the same way again.

NASAL-SPRAY FLU VACCINE IS NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No needle, no tears. For Rhonda Powell, an elementary-school
social worker in Temple, Texas, the decision to have her 8-year-old
son vaccinated against the flu was easy this year.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's son is one of 15,000 children in the Temple-Bolton area
eligible to receive a new nasal-spray vaccine that promises to
protect children against the flu and painful middle-ear infections.
The free nasal inoculations are part of a five-year National
Institute of Health study involving doctors at the Influenza
Research Center at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are trying to determine whether widespread
immunization of children 18 months to 18 years old will provide
communitywide protection against influenza. The nasal spray being
used is FluMist, a product developed by the Aviron pharmaceutical
company that may hit the consumer market by next fall, pending Food
and Drug Administration approval.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, like many parents, has a flu shot each year. But she
didn't consider giving her child the annual vaccine until she heard
about the new no-pain alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought of giving my son a flu shot until the nasal
spray became available,'' she said. ``I watched him take it, and it
was quick and easy. He said he would much rather have it than a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayla Herschler, coordinator of the study in Temple, has
observed hundreds of children being immunized (about 1,900 of the
15,000 targeted children have been given the spray), including her
3-year-old granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just sat there and smiled the whole time. My daughter was
laughing because she says when kids get shots, she has to be
prepared to hold them down,'' Herschler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the children blink their eyes and react with a little
surprise when the spray suddenly hits their noses, but they do just
great. It's amazing. I tell people, you need to come and watch us
vaccinate. You won't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The flu vaccine is important for children for several reasons,
according to Pedro Piedra, pediatrician and associate professor of
microbiology and immunology at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preschool and school-aged children are at high risk and play
an important role in the transmission of flu to family members and
the community,'' Piedra explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need universal immunization to reduce the impact in
children, which we tend to underestimate. Children have the highest
infection rate and one of the highest medically attended illness
rates. The hospitalization rate is comparable to that of the
elderly. Children just don't die from flu at as high a rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians see a lot of children with flu problems, plus a
lot of ear and sinus infections that are flu complications, Piedra
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a pediatrician, I support universal immunization,'' he
said. ``For universal immunization, you need a very good vaccine
that is accepted by the public. If children and parents are afraid
of it, they are less likely to receive it. It must be safe,
well-tolerated and something children don't dread receiving. Where
the vaccines are equally good, I prefer the one that doesn't have
pain associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Herschler says most children have had no reaction to the spray.
``A few have had a little runny nose and slight fever that develop
the second day after receiving it,'' she said, but that goes away
in four to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three years of the study, the vaccine has been 93
percent effective in preventing the flu and 98 percent effective
against influenza-associated ear infections in children.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that there were 30 million doctor visits last
year for acute ear infections, a 300 percent increase in office
visits since the mid-'70s. It is the most common illness for which
parents take their children to see a pediatrician. By age 3, more
than 80 percent of children have had at least one episode of acute
otitis media, and nearly 50 percent have had three or more
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The nasal-spray flu vaccine surprised researchers last year by
protecting not only against the anticipated flu strains to which it
was targeted, but also against A/Sydney, an unanticipated strain
not found in the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, flu shots provided virtually no protection
against A/Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got broader protection than could have been expected,''
Piedra said. ``We need more data, but right now, the studies are
very supportive of the notion that nasal spray may provide a
greater breadth of protection than the injected vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary difference between the traditional shot and the new
spray, other than method of administration, is that the injected
vaccine is made from killed viruses and nasal spray is derived from
weakened strains of live virus. The spray is easier to produce in
large amounts, and easier to administer. Both types of vaccine are
grown in eggs, but the injectable vaccine needs one egg per dose,
and one egg can produce 1,000 doses of the nasal vaccine.

   AMERICAN HISTORY X &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by: Tony Kaye &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screenplay by: David McKenna &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Edward Norton, Edward Furlong, Beverly D'Angelo, Avery
Brooks, and Stacey Keach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 118 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: R (graphic violence, pervasive language, sexuality and
nudity) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' is that rarest of Hollywood commodities _
an intelligently provocative film. It's doubly controversial, first
because of its refusal to simply demonize neo-Nazi skinheads,
second because its director, Tony Kaye, publicly disowned it after
a dispute over the final cut.
</P>
<P>
   But a viewing of the film can't help leaving you wondering what
Kaye's problem was. Centered by Edward Norton's stunning
performance as Derek Vinyard, a charismatic California white-power
icon who repudiates neo-Nazism after a prison term and tries to
keep his worshipful kid brother from going the skinhead route,
``American History X'' jumps off the screen with a power and impact
matched by few films whose directors emblazon their names across
the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Told through the eyes of Edward Furlong's Danny, younger brother
of Derek, the story is of a California working-class family
struggling to stay together after their firefighter father is
killed fighting a blaze in a crack house, and Norton's embittered
big brother is imprisoned for killing two African-Americans he
catches stealing his truck. The title refers to an afterschool
project that Danny's high school principal (Avery Brooks) assigns
him after he hands in a book review praising Hitler's ``Mein
Kampf.'' His first assignment is to relate his older brother's
story.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing the film does right is to make Norton's
protagonist, Derek, not only charismatic, but intelligent. It's
easy to see how he could become the Hitler of Venice Beach, a
magnet for his disaffected going-nowhere contemporaries, supplying
legitimacy and justification for their thuggery, manipulated from
the wings by hate-mongering businessman Stacey Keach. Although the
film is self-servingly facile in providing the rationale for
Derek's racism (some of its speeches are lifted almost verbatim
from the campaign rhetoric surrounding California's
anti-affirmative action Proposition 209), it takes the trouble to
examine the roots of racist rage.
</P>
<P>
   It's shocking to watch the transition from grumbling and
scapegoating among the rudderless malcontents to an organized raid
on a Korean grocery store. Regarded as a young god by the
riff-raff, Norton's Derek blazes with rage that erupts when he
throws his widowed mother's Jewish date (Elliott Gould) out of
their house. There's more than indignation at theft when he
finishes off the two young black men outside his house. None of the
Nazi paraphernalia covering the walls of the brothers' bedroom is
as startling as the sight of Norton himself, naked to the waist,
head shaved, swastika tatooed over his heart, barbed wire tattoos
circling his biceps, eyes bright with fury.
</P>
<P>
   He's so tightly wound you can all but hear him crackle like a
high-tension wire in a performance that has Oscar nomination
written all over it. While Derek serves time, Furlong's Danny is
welcomed into the skinhead clique. All he wants is to follow in his
brother's footsteps. But when Derek is released, his younger
brother is confused by the fact that the hero he has worshipped has
undergone a change of heart behind bars. After disillusioning
contact with skinheads in jail and a friendship with Guy Torry's
black fellow inmate, Derek has outgrown his racist views and wants
to yank Danny back from what he now sees as a self-destructive
path. He's a Venice Beach Odysseus, back from a spiritual journey,
determined to put his house in order.
</P>
<P>
   He has enough street smarts to know that this about-face places
him and his kid brother in peril. Although the motivations are
sketchy, the feelings connected to them are played out with fierce
intensity, and the social pathology is etched with clarion
immediacy by Kaye, who did his own camerawork and clearly knows how
to impart visceral punch to his images. It isn't often that a film
maintains the danger level this one does. Although Kaye has
previously made his living directing beer, car, and running shoe
commercials, he draws uniformly fresh and gripping performances
from his cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``American History X'' isn't just Norton throwing off sparks
and, later, ruefulness, as Derek, in a stunning performance arc.
Beverly D'Angelo's chain-smoking sickly mom and Jennifer Lien's
ambitious sister convince us there's love in the beleaguered house,
and Furlong projects an essential sweetness that makes his lost kid
doubly poignant.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks' principal persuades us not only that's he's intelligent
and nobly motivated, but was himself once a young firebrand and was
pained by Derek's embrace of hate because he valued Derek's
intellectual promise. Ethan Suplee, as a hulking follower unable to
reach Derek's level of enlightenment, is another plus. ``American
History X'' doesn't suggest that there are any easy answers. But it
spotlights real social ills with heightened urgency. Unlike most
films, it wants to matter _ and does.

   LIFE IS BEAUTIFUL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by: Roberto Benigni &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screenplay by: Vincenzo Cerami, Benigni &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Benigni, Nicoletta Braschi, Giorgio Cantarini,
Giustino Durano, and Sergio Bustric. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 122 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: PG-13 (Holocaust-related thematic material) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Chaplin in a Nazi death camp? It sounds like a recipe
for disaster, but it's the second half of a major career stretch
for Italian comic Everyman Roberto Benigni in his new film, ``Life
Is Beautiful,'' and it works more serendipitously than you'd have
any reason to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, ``Life Is Beautiful'' is two films, linked by a
quality of fairy-tale charm that Benigni conjures up, keeping the
spectres of sentimentality and bathos at bay with a masterly
lightness and delicacy of touch.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly a student of Chaplin, Benigni always tries for childlike
buoyancy, and has never before come so close to successfully
generating it as in this most serious and ambitious of his films.
The first half, set in the Tuscan town of Arezzo in 1939, is bright
and feathery and romantic as Benigni's penniless but gallant and
upbeat Guido arrives from the country to try his luck with the help
of his uncle, maitre d' in the fanciest local hotel.
</P>
<P>
   En route, he meets and courts an attractive local schoolteacher
(Benigni's wife and frequent co-star, Nicoletta Braschi, who
captures perfectly the look of a well-bred young woman of the
period). Guido's way is to cheerfully do his thing, relying, if
necessary, on a healthy dose of denial. Although he's Jewish, he
follows his uncle's lead and ignores what he figures he can't
change, even to the extent of daring to woo the woman he loves even
though she's engaged to the local fascist big shot.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has his way of taking a stand, and his gesture in a
hotel dining room is as joyous a fantasy scene as any in Italian
cinema since Fellini's heyday. But a few brief years later, when
he's married, is the father of a young son, and the proprietor of
his own bookstore, things change gravely. Without warning, he's
bundled off to a boxcar with other Jews and sent to a camp,
followed by his loyal wife.
</P>
<P>
   This sets the stage for the film's grand conceit. Concealing the
fact that he has brought his young son, Guido hides the boy in the
camp barracks. He warns the boy never to reveal himself to the
Germans but shields him from the terrors of the place by pretending
that it's all a huge game with rules they must obey to get a big
prize. There are a few close calls as the anxious father sustains
the clowning, using the nimbleness of his imagination to cloak the
boy from the surrounding horrors.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what makes the film so watchable is knowing the
largeness of the gamble Benigni is taking. He's not only shielding
the boy; he's diverting us from the intruding thought that
maintaining his noble deception wouldn't really be possible, that
the boy would surely notice something that would shatter the
illusion. Yet we want to keep believing in it, and we keep our own
disbelief at bay as we watch Benigni's comic inventiveness do
battle with the impending credibility problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' frankly goes on a little too long to
sustain its high-wire act. But Benigni pushes himself to new
heights, realizing the drama is inherent enough to compel a
watchful eye lest pathos leak in and dilute the impact of this
generous and life-affirming fable. It does more than a lesser
perfect movie does; it makes us want it to succeed. In the end,
Benigni's physical gracefulness translates into a gracefulness of
spirit that shines forth as the antithesis of fascism and all the
other isms.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, Benigni has created a film that is as
powerful as the best fables. Skirting the sentimentality inherent
in any rendering of any ``little man,'' he compels belief in the
childlike purity his character keeps alive _ and uses to keep his
son alive. In short, he translates the sunny innocence of his
characters into a sunny tone that carries the film's tricky
balancing act, making it seem the expression of a life force
finding a way through evil like a dandelion finding its way through
cement.

SIMMERING SECRETS ERUPT IN VINTERBERG'S `CELEBRATION' 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   THE CELEBRATION
</P>
<P>
   Directed by: Thomas Vinterberg &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screenplay by: Vinterberg, Mogens Rukov &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starring: Ulrich Thomsen and Henning Moritzen &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 105 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: R (strong sexual content and language, including
references to sexual abuse) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Vinterberg's ``The Celebration'' arrives from Denmark
with a baggage of theoretical dogma that's best ignored in favor of
the jagged immediacy its stylistic credo makes possible. If the
dizzying propulsiveness of its hand-held camerawork recalls Lars
Von Trier's ``Breaking the Waves,'' it's because both directors
adhere to an anti-artifice credo they hammered out with Danish New
Wave colleagues. Although their manifesto, Dogma 95, sounds
forbidding, it's more tongue-in-cheek rambunctious than
foot-in-mouth dour.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the group's stripped-down esthetic is well suited to
its story of ugly old secrets erupting at what's supposed to be the
gala 60th birthday celebration of a domineering patriarch in the
elegant country hotel he owns. Vinterberg's deliberate avoidance of
slick illusion-mongering is advanced by a style that suggests a
camcorder running amok as the old man's three grown children barrel
down country roads to converge on the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Also influencing the climate at the gathering is the fourth,
absent sibling, who committed suicide. The atmosphere is thick with
bumptious overstatement arising from the high anxiety levels of the
uneasy surviving sibs. They are feeling far from festive. Ulrich
Thomsen's eldest, Christian, who owns a restaurant in Paris, is
practically catatonic. Paprika Steen's Helene is spooked by being
put in the same room in which her sister killed herself. And Thomas
Bo Larsen's bullying Michael yells at his wife and crashes around
to conceal his rage at his ongoing status as baby of the family.
</P>
<P>
   At the dinner, the brooding Christian rears up and offers a
shocking toast that has been simmering inside him since the abused
and miserable childhood he shared with his dead twin. When pressed
to apologize, he not only refuses, but deepens his indictment of
his father, whose stoicism is sorely tested and whose smugness is
dented. While one faction tries to smooth things over and avoid
confronting the ugliness, Christian and the others fuel the
insurrection, aided by the long-smoldering resentments of the
kitchen staff.
</P>
<P>
   Just as you think you're in for a Danish ``Discreet Charm of the
Bourgeoisie,'' the last vestiges of playfulness vanish in a jolting
display of racism when Helene's black boyfriend shows up. Then the
intergenerational gloves come off. A few squalid revelations and
jerky camera movements later, the film gives way to natural light,
as if to say that the family has stopped dealing in falsehood and
is at last facing the realities of its history.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see the technical trademarks of these Danish
directors turning into cliches just as empty as the ones they mean
to sweep away. But on this occasion they are trenchantly wedded to
their subject. And Vinterberg draws vigorous and suitably unruly
performances from his ensemble. Thomsen makes Christian's
bitterness sympathetic, Larsen's aggrieved petulance as the
excluded youngest brother achieves moments of poignance, and,
against all probability, Henning Moritzen's tarnished patriarch
finds a measure of dignity. The mordant, urgent, raw, vital
``Celebration'' is a bare-knuckle powerhouse.

in campaign ads before, where they usually sat silently alongside

in the second quarter and 5.5 percent in the first. By Sylvia
Nasar.

FBI's FINANCIAL BITE ON GUN OWNERS IS GONE 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buried deep within the voluminous, 4,000-page omnibus
appropriations bill passed by Congress this month was a bit of good
news for gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Nov. 30, when the National Instant Criminal Background
Check System (also known as NICS) for new gun purchases goes into
effect, the FBI will be prohibited from collecting the threatened
$14 ``user fee'' to pay for its scrutiny of a potential buyer's
facts on file.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of dunning law-abiding citizens for the criminal
background checks (after all, it's decent folk _ not felons _ who
buy guns through licensed dealers), the FBI will fund the program
through a mix of direct congressional appropriations and existing
funds in the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   As it should have been from the get-go. Only the elected
Congress has the authority to assess and retain taxes from the
American people, not some agency eat up with a fantasy about power
and control.
</P>
<P>
   So all you Wal-Mart shoppers who were worried about having to
cough up a $14 nonrefundable fee when purchasing a new deer rifle
after Nov. 30 can rest easy. Those bright yellow signs that warned
about the impending collection of taxes are disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of Oct. 21, all our stores are in the process of taking
down the signs,'' said Bryan Holmberg, corporate spokesman for
Wal-Mart's gun departments.
</P>
<P>
   Holmberg said Wal-Mart directed its stores to display the signs
starting Aug. 17, in anticipation of what might become the law of
the land. The Senate actually voted in July to prohibit taxing
lawful gun buyers for background checks, but the jury was still out
in the House. Call it erring on the side of caution.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Oct. 21, the day after Congress approved the
appropriations bill, Wal-Mart stores along with licensed gun
dealers nationwide have been removing the signs.
</P>
<P>
   The next battle lies in stopping the feds from retaining the
names obtained in the instant background checks for as long as 18
months. Once again, the FBI is overstepping its authority. This not
only is contrary to the wording in the budget provision about
destroying such information, but it is a blatant constitutional
violation, as well as a violation of the Brady Act itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady Act specifically states that once a firearm
transaction is approved, the system ``shall ... destroy all records
of the system with respect to the call and all records of the
system relating to the person and the transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: One minute after the computerized system has OK'd a
gun purchase as legal, any record of the sale should be relegated
to the great computer zap file in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, for some inexplicable reason, has proposed holding on
to those records for up to 18 months, which is a bald-faced
violation of the Brady Act's prohibition against establishing a
registration system of firearms, firearm owners or firearm
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Gun owners, of course, think the worst. We've grown exceedingly
suspicious of each new incursion on our civil and privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of suspicion, allow me to dispel a crazy rumor that's
circulating in these parts. The story goes that Denver recently
passed a complete gun ban, and sportsmen and women traveling
through the Denver International Airport are having their firearms
confiscated upon arrival. By the time they can fight such action in
court, the guns are being destroyed and the visitors are given
vouchers for the replacement of their guns.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, says everyone from the National Rifle Association to
the public affairs office of the airport. The Denver City Council
did pass a local ordinance this year that bans certain types of
semi-automatic firearms (and the members of that misguided body can
expect to hear from the NRA next spring when the national
convention convenes there), but airport personnel have nothing to
do with enforcement of that ordinance. Shucks, the airport isn't
even in the city limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really off the wall,'' said Chuck Cannon, director of
public affairs at Denver International. ``Hunting is big business
in Colorado, and we see all kinds of rifles going through here.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is bad enough, folks. Let's not start making things
up.

`VAMPIRES' LIMPS OFF INTO THE SUNSET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Directed by: John Carpenter &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Screenplay by: Don Jakoby (novel: John Steakley) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Starring: James Woods, Daniel Baldwin, and Sheryl Lee &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Running time: 107 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rated: R (strong violence and gore, language and sexuality) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Garlic and crucifixes can't stop the chomping fangs in ``John
Carpenter's Vampires,'' but a lame script and flat direction drive
stakes through its heart. Carpenter needn't have bothered to append
his name to the title. Nobody else is likely to be tempted to lay
claim to this misfire.
</P>
<P>
   It has the intellectual firepower of ``From Dusk Till Dawn,''
but not the laughs, although at first it teases us with a promise
of wry humor as James Woods and his band of vampire fighters pile
out of a couple of vehicles near a decrepit hulk of a house and
start unloading gear that suggests an impending goth rock concert.
</P>
<P>
   But no. They're only dressed like rockers. They're really a SWAT
team, wiping out vampires by day, when the vampires are weakest. To
the hunt they bring a new technique _ steel harpoons shot into the
vampire's chest, attached to a cable, so the harpooned bloodsuckers
can be winched, kicking and screaming, into the daylight, where
they go up in flames. But although the posse decimates the nest,
its leader (Thomas Ian Griffith) escapes. He has a plan. If he can
steal a certain antique crucifix and reverse an exorcism, he and
the other vampires can walk in the sunlight. As one silver-tongued
good guy puts it, ``He'll be unstoppable _ unless we stop him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when you're beginning to wonder on whose behalf the
anti-vampire commandos are patrolling the back roads of New Mexico,
it's revealed that they're in the employ of the Vatican,
represented by a leering cardinal played by Maximilian Schell, in
what surely is the low point of an otherwise mostly distinguished
career. Woods is better suited to the wipeout mode the film calls
for, although the team leader he plays is slowed down after the
vampire chief descends on the motel where the crew is unwinding
with a squad of hookers and slaughters the lot.
</P>
<P>
   For a film that hurls as many bleeding chunks through the air as
this one does, ``John Carpenter's Vampires'' is remarkably dull.
Not even a campy subplot can inject much life into it. It involves
Sheryl Lee's hooker, who has been bitten but hasn't yet turned, and
Daniel Baldwin's vampire hunter who falls for her, undeterred by
the likelihood of her walking away from him with blood dripping
down her chin and into her cleavage. Such is where the film goes
for drama.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, a vampire movie isn't poetry or rocket science. All you
ask is that it scare you a little, and maybe muster a little style.
But it would take a lot more than Woods's valiant attempt to fill
the screen with attitude to make this anemic specimen stand up and
march.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, it wasn't a bad idea to try and cross the vampire and
Western genres. It worked for Kathryn Bigelow in ``Near Dark.''
Reportedly, Carpenter wanted to marry ``Dracula'' and ``The Wild
Bunch.'' But the gory boredom we get cries out to be thought of as
``The Mild Bunch.''

RANDY NEWMAN AS EVERYMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Short people, fat people, yellow people, rednecks, gridiron
stars, dancing bears, and ``Toy Story'' animated cartoon figures.
Randy Newman has sung about them all, during an outrageous _ and
often irreverent _ pop career that will hit a crescendo in the next
few months.
</P>
<P>
   Newman, whose rapier wit has ruffled more than a few feathers in
his day, has a flurry of upcoming projects. Topping the list is a
wildly entertaining four-CD box, ``Guilty: 30 Years of Randy
Newman,'' due Tuesday ($59.98 list price).
</P>
<P>
   There's more. In keeping with his recent career as film
composer, Newman contributes to the soundtrack of the current
``Pleasantville'' and the forthcoming ``A Dog's Life'' and ``Babe:
A Pig in the City,'' for which he wrote a song (``That'll Do'')
sung by Peter Gabriel. Next spring, Newman will release a CD of
original songs, ``Bad Love,'' followed by his first tour since the
mid-'80s. He also expects to stage his pop-opera updating of
``Faust'' next year at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to be everywhere!'' Newman says with a hearty laugh
from his Los Angeles home. ``It's this little brief window of
opportunity. I prefer this to nothing going on, I can tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman, who could be labeled the Mark Twain of piano-pop, is
best appreciated on the new boxed set. It pools his hits ``Short
People'' and ``I Love L.A.'' with older classics such as ``Mama
Told Me Not to Come'' (a hit for Three Dog Night), ``Davy the Fat
Boy,'' ``Miami,'' and his bigotry-smashing ``Rednecks.'' And it
collects his movie music from the films ``Toy Story'' (he wrote its
showpiece track, ``You Have a Friend in Me''), ``The Natural,''
``Awakenings,'' ``The Paper,'' ``Maverick,'' ``James and the Giant
Peach,'' and ``Ragtime,'' which contained his Oscar-nominated song,
``One More Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   The box is a sure crowd pleaser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally never go back and listen to stuff,'' says Newman,
now 54, ``but the stuff on this boxed set was better than I
remember it. That was a pleasant surprise, rather than thinking,
`Oh my God, I thought it was good, but it was horrible.' I'm proud
of it. It's an accurate documentation of my last 30 years of
writing. And writing is the only thing I'm really serious about.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, listening to the box, it's hard to believe that the
same singer/pianist could have done such divergent songs, running
the gamut from the bitingly satirical slant of his solo albums to
the consumer-friendly tone of his classical-meets-pop soundtrack
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music on `Toy Story' brought me into the mainstream,''
Newman says. ``The songs that I've written for movies have been the
most remunerative songs that I've ever written, though they're not
the most artistic. Certainly, `I Love to See You Smile' and `You've
Got a Friend in Me' are just sort of generic lyrically, but they're
also friendly. A lot of people could do them, I think, where there
are some things that I do, like `Davy the Fat Boy' or `God's Song'
or `Miami,' that I don't think a lot of people could do. But I'm
grateful for the balance. It's good to get out of the position of
the third-person-narrative stuff that I do on my own, and do
something straight ahead and friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman calls it a ``vestige from my family'' to be interested in
film scoring. His uncle, Alfred, wrote music for the films ``How
Green Was My Valley,'' ``How the West Was Won,'' ``Airport,'' and
``Wuthering Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Did Newman get any advice from him?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he was too busy. All he did was work. But I'd see him in
there working. And when I was a kid, he was onstage and I was able
to see an orchestra (with him) up close at a young age, which is a
good thing for any kid to do. I recommend it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between composing for films and for one's own
albums is the meaning attached to each. ``It's an odd ethic I
have,'' says Newman, ``of putting a lot of time and effort into
something that's not really very important _ that is, movie music
compared to making a record. The movie is not your thing. The movie
is the big thing, and the music isn't the most important part of
the movie. But I care desperately about it when I'm doing it. When
I'm done doing it, I don't care about it at all. I don't look back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can work up to 12 to 14 hours a day on movies _ more than on
my own songs. On my songs, I can't do it for more than four hours a
day because it's too hard, too intense. I can do it for much longer
on movies. And if you're writing for orchestra, the time goes
pretty fast. Your adrenaline is going and you don't notice that
you're sort of wiped out until you stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The new boxed set has one CD devoted to his soundtracks, two to
his studio recordings (which include appearances by members of the
Eagles and Fleetwood Mac, notably on ``I Love L.A.''), and one to
``Odds and Ends,'' referring to previously unreleased tunes and
live tracks. The funniest of these is ``Golden Gridiron Boy,'' his
first original record, dating to 1961. Sings Newman of the football
hero who is stealing his girlfriend: ``All the girls run after
him/And my girl is in front of them all .../With every score I lose
more ground/I'm too small to make the team/I can only play in the
band.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a bobby-socks-style pop tune (contrasted with the more
meditative musings of his later, documentary-type songs) and was
produced by former teen idol Pat Boone. The latter was actually a
patient of Newman's doctor father; hence the connection.
</P>
<P>
   Newman's early nerd tendencies were thus well established. They
can also be seen in other odds and ends like the piano ballad
``Tickle Me'' (``Why don't you tickle me?/Gee whiz, that would be a
good idea'') and ``My Little Buttercup.''
</P>
<P>
   But Newman's forte later became his double-edged takes on the
human condition _ a role that he continues to play well. His next
album of original songs, ``Bad Love,'' will even include a song
about aging rock stars, entitled ``I'm Dead, But I Don't Know It.''
Sample lyric: ``I have nothing left to say/But I'm going to say it
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Newman: ``It's for all of us old farts who won't leave the
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain couldn't have put it any better.

</P>
<P>
   Here's guitarist-singer Lars Frederiksen on what he would do for
the three other guys in his punk rock group, Rancid. ``I'd lie,
cheat, steal, and kill for any (person) in my band,'' he declares,
on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a real close band,'' adds singer-guitarist Tim
Armstrong. ``How would you like to travel around the world with
your closest homeboys? It's so natural out here.''
</P>
<P>
   The men in the Berkeley, Calif.-based Rancid are road dogs. They
are in the midst of their 33d tour; they've played over 1,000 shows
in five years. They stop at the Palladium in Worcester tomorrow
night.
</P>
<P>
   What about their attitude toward fans, perhaps the most
important aspect of all?
</P>
<P>
   This past summer, Frederiksen was sitting in a ramshackle
backstage area at the multi-band Vans Warped tour in Northampton.
Asked to define the ethos of the tour, Frederiksen kept repeating,
almost as a mantra, ``No rock stars.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, status quo has been the star on a pedestal and the
lucky fans who are allowed to bask in the star's shadow. Punk rock
broke down that divide, briefly, during the mid- to late 1970s,
declaring everyone part of the same squalid mess. Then, the divide
formed again. Rancid, one of today's most prominent neo-punk bands,
does its best to revisit the punk vibe of 1976 on contemporary
terms. It doesn't really matter that the four guys _ including
bassist-singer Matt Freeman and drummer Brett Reed _ were children
when punk first happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been turned off by bands with this imperious
attitude,'' says Armstrong. ``Like, `We're better than anyone
else.' That's a weird rock-star kind of thing. I actually get
uncomfortable if I don't feel like I'm on the same level as people
who come to see us play.''
</P>
<P>
   Rancid, adds Frederiksen, knows the world owes it nothing. ``If
you're some kid that's been handed everything to you in life, of
course, you're going to expect everything,'' he says. ``But this
all happened by accident, and that's why you've got to take it with
a grain of salt, stay humble, and treat people with respect. I
mean, all of us come from single-parent families, broken homes, and
it installs a work ethic. We all grew up in minority neighborhoods,
melting pots. You see people as human beings. ... When you do get
something in your life, you treat it with a little bit more
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Rancid grabbed a place in the punk pantheon with its ``Let's
Go'' album from 1994. The band turned the corner toward what
someone else might call stardom two years ago by selling nearly a
million copies of ``... And Out Come the Wolves,'' bolstered by the
songs ``Ruby Soho'' and ``Time Bomb.'' Its latest, ``Life Won't
Wait,'' was released in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is done on the feisty indie label Epitaph, which
lacks the clout of the major labels. Frederiksen takes pride in the
underdog status. ``I mean you can be on a major label,'' he says,
``and become some commodity like Janet Jackson. A CEO, what does a
CEO know about music? He knows numbers, figures, and money. He
doesn't know about the artists having to be in a van, traveling
across the country, making your T-shirts. That's the thing about
punk rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Epitaph main man Brett Gurewitz does know about these
things from his days in the band Bad Religion. Frederiksen says,
``He knows about writing songs, making records, turning the knobs
to get the sound right, putting the shrink wrap on.''
</P>
<P>
   Rancid formed in 1991. Armstrong and Freeman came from Operation
Ivy; Reed joined and made it a three-piece; Frederiksen, formerly
of Slip and off a stint in a revived UK Subs, was the last to join,
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The band has always mixed punk, ska, reggae, and roots rock _
nothing about any of the genres feels forced or false to them.
``(It's) music we've been listening to since we were kids,'' says
Frederiksen. ``It all came from the street. There was nothing nice
about it. It was real, honest, had integrity. So, it was kind of
obvious that you can interwine all of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In this way, Rancid is like many of its California punk-bred
peers. But never too far away is the aura of the early Clash,
England's original punk rock avatars. There's the hard and rough
sound; the stylistic mix; the working-class, left-wing politics;
the sense of band-as-gang. They even echo the Clash's
``Sandinista!'' cry on the rockabilly-styled ``Lady Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never get bent out of shape when people compare us to the
Clash,'' says Armstrong. ``'Cause, you know, if somebody says, `You
guys sound a lot like the Smashing Pumpkins,' that would be
horrific.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Armstrong does note that Rancid plays faster than the Clash,
mixes more reggae and ska into its stew. But how's this for
serendipity? Armstrong has signed former Clash singer-guitarist Joe
Strummer to his Hell Cat label, a joint venture between Armstrong
and Epitaph's Gurewitz.
</P>
<P>
   Rancid's ``Life Won't Wait,'' recorded on the West Coast, New
York, New Orleans, and Jamaica, showcases a band that has seen the
world, not just its neighborhood. ``I don't live in the exact same
environment anymore,'' says Armstrong, the principal songwriter.
``It would be kind of redundant to keep singing the same thing over
and over again. That would be weird.'' Songs on ``Life Won't Wait''
address class struggle and strife (invoking Bosnia and other
places), black lung disease, the futility of the junkie life. The
Mighty Mighty Bosstones' Dicky Barrett shows up to bark on ``Cash,
Culture &AMP; Violence,'' and some of the Specials join in on
``Hooligans.'' Reggae singer Buju Banton joins on the title track.
There is a righteous charge to most everything Rancid touches, an
us-against-them battle cry, a sense of serious fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music,'' says Frederiksen, ``is something powerful. It's not
something you lock yourself into, like a 4-by-4 cell, and say `I
can't go out of this.' From the very start, Rancid, first of all,
is built on friendship, and, No. 2, we're fans of music _ not just
punk, not just reggae, not just soul. ... Whether the radio is
playing our songs or MTV is playing our videos _ I mean we never
went for that. That happened and it snowballed. You got four kids
from Nowheresville, USA, and you got all this thrown on your lap.''
</P>
<P>
   They may have made a few mistakes along the way, Frederiksen
says, but the band treats them as learning experiences. ``We've
never stepped on anyone's toes,'' he says. ``We have fun. We work.
The one thing I think in common with all our records, and the way
we operate is, just treat people with respect and be true to
ourselves. You'll never fail doing that.''

SOUND OF CARDIGANS EVOLVES INTO `TRIP-HOP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Remember the Cardigans and their sexy Swedish singer Nina
Persson, the woman who incessantly cooed ``Love me, love me, say
that you need me'' in the sugary pop tart single ``Lovefool?''
</P>
<P>
   That was the Cardigans of 1996 and '97 and ``Lovefool'' was the
mega-hit from their third album, the platinum-plus ``First Band on
the Moon.'' That album also marked their US debut. This year's
Cardigans, who play the Paradise tomorrow in their first US concert
of the year, is a slightly different sounding outfit.
</P>
<P>
   The last ``album was cute and nice,'' says guitarist Peter
Svensson from Sweden. ``We tried to make something jolly and happy
because (before) people thought we were too pretentious. Now, we're
older and we can allow ourselves to be a bit serious again. Last
time, we had the tongue-in-cheek thing to hide behind.'' (Keep in
mind, ``Lovefool'' was playfully iroinc, too.)
</P>
<P>
   The Cardigans' ``Gran Turismo'' CD comes out Tuesday. Svensson
says Persson wrote all the lyrics this time _ up from half _ and he
says the album title suggests the theme. ``It's the situation where
you're living your life, but you're not really part of it. You
spend so much time figuring it out you can't enjoy it. Like on
`Starter,' (it's about) how you're always reinventing yourself,
seeing a new girlfriend, buying a new car, moving to a new
apartment, you try to make yourself happy and in the end, you
realize ... you're like a tourist in your own world.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-year-old quintet's sound has evolved from '60s-infused,
kitsch-tinted pop to what might be called trip-hop/pop. Svensson,
however, is wary of the trip-hop term, because, he says, ``I think
trip-hop is more about atmosphere and beats, and this is still more
about simple songs with an electronic feeling. More like Depeche
Mode, more about melody. They're more singer-songwriter type
songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Live, Svensson says, ``we're a bit heaviver and rougher. This
time, we're going to use some electronics and backup tapes and
drums. It's still the band playing; this just adds an electronic
element. Nina's been growing into this thing. It's making the
situation better 'cause she's singing her own words.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Built to Spill &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Built to Spill is the brainchild of Boise-spawned
guitarist-singer-songwriter Doug Martsch and is an ever-evolving
entity. Mostly, though, starting in 1993, it's been a craftsman's
studio project. Built to Spill was responsible for one of last
year's great unheard masterpieces, ``Perfect From Now On,'' a
spectacular splash of ebb-and-flow psychedelia.
</P>
<P>
   This year, BTS is a flesh-and-blood band and Martsch says, ``I
think it makes for more interesting music, the things that are more
interesting are stumbled upon, not the things that come out of one
person's head. (It's what) will happen when people are
collaborating and improvising _ the combinations of rhythms and
notes.''
</P>
<P>
   The upcoming (January) release ``Keep It a Secret,'' is more
structured and pop-centered. ``Any time we've made records,'' says
Martsch, ``they come out sounding different for different reasons.
There's not much of a vision; it's just pieces of ideas that just
sound the way they do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a band now,'' Martsch, referencing bassist Brett Nelson
and drummer Scott Ploug. ``It used to be a rotating lineup with me
as the only constant. The only thing I was shooting for was to make
it not like the last record. When you work on six minute songs it
takes ten times longer than a three-minute song. A lot of this (new
album) was written out of us (forging) bits and pieces out of hours
of jamming, picking out what sounds cool. I stumble across things.
The ones that stick in my head are the ones we end up using. I
never think about writing a certain kind of song.''
</P>
<P>
   As to any accolades about being an alt-rock guitar hero, Martsch
offers this: ``Just 'cause I play a lot of guitar solos, people
might think I'm good at it. I'm pretty llimited in terms of
ability, but I try to make up for it with ... whatever ... the
unexpectedness. It's daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Can they recreate the expansive sonic tapestry in concert? ``Not
really,'' says Martsch. ``We just do cover versions of our songs.
It's way louder than when anyone ever listens to the records. I
like it better, actually.''

IMPEACHMENT BECOMES A GALVANIZING ISSUE ON ELECTION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)   (EDs: Filed in the ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was being called the ``Seinfeld election,''
something about nothing, a midterm yawner void of any galvanizing
national issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the launching of a last-minute Republican advertising blitz
highlighting the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal changed all that. No
longer a sleeper, this election will set the stage for the
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, who is accused of lying
and using his power to cover up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Any way it goes, the congressional election will have a major
impact on the impeachment process. With hearings likely to begin a
few weeks after Tuesday's balloting, leaders of both political
parties say they'll be happy to either gain a few seats or not lose
too many.
</P>
<P>
   Republican gains would embolden GOP lawmakers in their conduct
of impeachment hearings. If the Democrats do well in races for the
House and Senate or lose only a few seats, ``the hearings will be
brief,'' said political scholar Thomas Mann of the Brookings
Institution, an independent Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrated by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the $10-million
television effort is aimed at 30 districts, many in the South and
rural areas where animosity to Clinton runs high. The goal:
Energize conservatives disappointed by GOP budget compromises two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, say the backfire potential is so high that
the ads and ensuing news coverage might help bring out their
voters. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee announced an
ad blitz of its own. The aim is to convince voters Republicans are
scandal-obsessed while Democrats want to move forward on issues
such as education and preserving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling ad campaigns ``open up a Pandora's box of
uncertainty,'' said Curtis Gans, president of the nonpartisan
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Before they
aired, he added, ``we were heading into a low-turnout election.''
</P>
<P>
   While candidates on the home turf may be talking about abortion,
health care and other issues, the ads put impeachment on the
electoral map as perhaps the closest thing there is to a
galvanizing national issue.
</P>
<P>
   All 435 House seats are up, but only 50 to 60 are considered
competitive. Many of those are taking place in 34 districts where
the incumbent is retiring, leaving an open seat. The open seats are
evenly split _ 17 belonged to Republicans and 17 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-four incumbents are in uncontested races. Another 240 are
expected to be re-elected. Republicans now control the House
228-206, with one independent who generally votes.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Democrats appeared gleeful that the 11 seats needed to
retake the House seemed within reach. Now they concede that
scenario is virtually impossible. Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee executive director Matt Angle predicted ``plus five or
minus five'' for the party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties will closely watch the races in the 31 districts
where Democrats voted with the Republicans to launch an
unrestricted impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, predicted the Republicans would gain
between 10 and 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four Senate seats are up for grabs. With Republicans in
control 55-45, Democrats are given virtually no chance of retaking
control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are unlikely to pick up the five needed to reach 60,
a number that would enable them to defeat Democratic filibusters
that can kill bills. More probable is that the Republicans will
gain two to three seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gender is less of an issue this year than in 1992, dubbed ``the
year of the woman'' because of strong electoral gains by women.
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., elected in 1992, has been
entangled in scandals ever since. She looks to be a goner.
</P>
<P>
   In California, after a tumultuous struggle against Republican
challenger Matt Fong, incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer is ahead in the
polls. And in Washington state, self-proclaimed ``mom-in-tennis
shoes'' Sen. Patty Murray, another Democrat elected in 1992,
appears to be headed for a slim victory over Republican Rep. Linda
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other hot races:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Kentucky, the Senate seat vacated by retiring Sen. Wendell
H. Ford, a Democrat, is a tossup between Rep. Scotty Baesler, a
Democrat, and Republican Rep. Jim Bunning.
</P>
<P>
   _ In New York, the mudbath between Republican Sen. Alfonse M.
D'Amato and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles E. Schumer,
remains close. Most polls put Schumer slightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Wisconsin, it's too close to call between Democratic
incumbent Sen. Russ Feingold, and Republican Rep. Mark Neumann. One
late poll shows Neumann moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   _ In North Carolina, Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth is in a
tight race against trial attorney John Edwards. Faircloth's poll
numbers are slipping, making him one of the few vulnerable
incumbent Republicans this November.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Republicans outdistanced Democrats in campaign
fund-raising. Democrats raised $106.9 million, a 40 percent
increase over the last mid-term election in 1994. But they have a
debt of $11.1 million, much of it left over from the 1996 campaign.
Republicans raised $184.6 million and have a debt of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also beat Democrats in the war for ``soft'' money,
contributions for party building and voter turnout that are not
subject to Federal Election Commission limitations. Soft money
mostly winds up financing not-to-subtle party television
commercials that endorse candidates without specifically soliciting
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took in $93.7 million in soft money, a 144 percent
increase over 1994. Democrats received $78.8 million, an 84 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of the GOP's success: Business contributions.
Business interests have given Republicans $262 million, according
to research by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Business also gave Democrats $198 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the race, the election this year is less about winning
converts than it is about getting out loyal followers and hoping
opponents' supporters take the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University,
compared it to the staunch loyalty of pickup truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not anything that will make a Chevy pickup driver
drive a Ford,'' he said. ``But dealers still have the task of
getting them to dealership to buy their products every few years.''
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is spending $28 million, mostly to elect Democrats.
Some $14 million of that is for an on-the-ground campaign involving
telephone banks, leaflets at factory gates, union meetings and 392
organizers agitating to get organized labor's vote in 75 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense was that politics had become completely
impersonal,'' said AFL-CIO political director Steven Rosenthal.
``We thought we could personalize it on the ground better than we
could on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Also within the $28 million is $7 million for television
advertising, most of it geared to issues such as saving Social
Security and reining in managed health care. In 1996, the AFL-CIO
put most of its massive $35 million war chest into television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor also is contributing $35 million to Democratic
candidates. But money alone may not do it for labor. The AFL-CIO
gave $40 million to Democrats in 1994, the year Republicans took
control of Congress in an election widely interpreted as a
rejection of Clinton's first two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, not only did the Republican voter turnout surge, but
the number of Democrats heading to the polls declined. (Overall in
mid-term congressional elections, turnout has declined since 1966,
falling from 48.6 percent that year to 38.8 percent in 1994.)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and their supporters also are concentrating on
turnout. Linder said the campaign committee committed $5 million to
a get-out-the-vote drive, with $300,000 of that targeted to
absentee balloting in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition is spending $3.1 million to distribute
45 million copies of its ``non-partisan'' voter guide in churches,
advising supporters on candidates' views on issues such as abortion
and school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign for Working Families, a conservative political
action committee, is spending about $3 million on more than 200
candidates and on promotions to boost voter turnout.

AN ISLAND ADVENTURE

<P>
   SERPENT IN PARADISE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Dea Birkett &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anchor Books, 296 pp., $23.95 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pitcairn Island holds a place in the collective imagination
wholly out of proportion to its place on Earth. In the expanse of
the Pacific Ocean, better than 63 million square miles, Pitcairn is
a rock holding less than two of them.
</P>
<P>
   But because of location (3,000 miles from anywhere) and history
(it was chosen as haven and last home by Fletcher Christian and
nine other mutineers of the Bounty), it is a destination of desire
for countless dreamers who apply for admission each year. Almost
all of them are turned away.
</P>
<P>
   British writer Dea Birkett, an adventurer with an easy
storytelling style, is one of the few who got in. For her, living
on Pitcairn was less a dream than an idea formed the day she saw
``The Bounty,'' the most recent of five films inspired by the
high-seas takeover of the British ship commanded by Captain William
Bligh in 1789. As its final credits rolled, she read on screen that
the descendants of the mutineers still lived on the island. From
that flickering beginning developed a quest lasting almost two
years, during which she researched, and networked, and persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcairn is nothing if not difficult to reach, and that owes
only partially to its isolation. Approvals are required not only
from the island's appointed governor (who lives 3,000 miles away in
New Zealand and has never seen the place) but from the islanders,
whose approval is far from pro forma.
</P>
<P>
   But the location is formidable, too. There are only three
scheduled port calls a year, by a supply ship from New Zealand.
Birkett's trip to the South Pacific was by way of Houston, where
she met a Swedish chemical carrier bound for New Zealand via the
Panama Canal. Its route passed within 30 miles of Pitcairn, and it
would trade passage for some redecorating _ quite unlike the
circumstances of the first Westerners' arrival.
</P>
<P>
   Christian and company landed Jan. 21, 1790, seeking to escape
the gallows. Hunted by the British Navy, they needed a spot where
they could not only survive but disappear. Master's mate Christian
had found Pitcairn in Bligh's meticulous ship's log, something his
pursuers would not be able to do, since their maps had mischarted
the island.
</P>
<P>
   When Birkett arrived, there were 12 men and 26 women. They
seemed to welcome her, and she quickly became a part of, or party
to, generations-old disputes and falsehoods, such as the one about
drinking. Islanders are Seventh-Day Adventists, whose creed
proscribes smoking, card playing, and drinking. The first couple of
times Birkett was asked, conspiratorially, if she drank, she said
no, because she thought she was supposed to; it certainly was the
answer her observant hostess, Irma Christian, would want to hear.
But the third time she said yes, and was invited to a canasta game
where cold Carlsbergs were offered up.
</P>
<P>
   Islanders grow a lot of their food _ in addition to their
gardens, practically every tree belongs to someone _ and the rest
they get from trading with ships such as the one Birkett arrived
on. They trade their handicrafts, such as baskets and carved
sharks, in exchange for, say, frozen fried chicken pieces.
</P>
<P>
   As part of her rent, Birkett did all the cooking for the house,
and she became particularly adept at baking without eggs, because
although Irma had three dozen on hand, she didn't like to use them.
One day, though, Birkett decided to splurge on a cake that required
just two. When she discovered that all but a half dozen had gone
bad, she decided to salvage what she could and make omelettes. Upon
returning home, Irma was aghast. Having rotten eggs, it seemed, was
preferable to having none.
</P>
<P>
   Birkett relates her stories engagingly, albeit with an uneven
knack for allusion. When she describes Jenny, an islander, as being
``unnaturally white with hair the color of a pair of tights from
the 1950s,'' it adds little. But she fares far better in her very
next line when she says, ``If a color photograph were taken of
Jenny, it would appear to be black and white.''
</P>
<P>
   Birkett lasted just a few months on the island. She tried to fit
in but found that while she could learn many island skills, she
couldn't accept the core value of putting community before self,
which caused a growing estrangement. During an expedition to gather
breadfruit _ in which .22 rifles are used to dislodge them from
their high perches _ she even began doubting whether she was safe,
and decided to take the next ship out.

that she lived to tell about it. She makes many of the 38 islanders
come alive, about as well as an outsider could, and by sharing her
fears and relating her foibles, she herself becomes a sympathetic
heroine.

COST CLAIMS BOOST A LOTUS RIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives at Lotus Development Corp. are fuming at new research
reports claiming their flagship Notes groupware product is much
more costly than a competing product from archrival Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The reports by two separate research firms are the latest bit of
unwelcome news for Lotus. The IBM Corp. subsidiary invented
groupware _ software used to coordinate the activities of many
people in large businesses and organizations. And Lotus Notes has
long dominated the groupware market. But a spate of reports this
year has shown that Microsoft's competing product Exchange is now a
serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey by International Data Corp. found 21.9 million
Notes users as of mid-1998, compared to 15 million Exchange users.
But the same survey revealed that Exchange outsold Notes in the
first half of the year, the first time this has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now two research firms are saying that Exchange is often cheaper
to buy and operate than Notes.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic data came from the Radicati Group of Palo
Alto, Calif. In a survey of 110 large corporations, Radicati found
that at companies where workers used Notes, the average yearly cost
per user for the software was $166.66. But for companies using
Exchange, the cost fell to $64.93.
</P>
<P>
   Lotus spokesman Paul Davis says the comparison is unfair. He
said the firms that used Exchange are on average much larger than
those using Notes, thus lowering their per-user cost. In addition,
Exchange users generally concentrate on simple electronic mail
messaging, while Notes is often used for more demanding and complex
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a direct apples-to-apples comparison, as far as the
size of companies that were surveyed and the kinds of
applications,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But Sara Radicati defended her company's research. In fact, she
agreed with Lotus officials that Notes is a more advanced product
than Exchange, and that this largely explained the cost difference.
</P>
<P>
   Radicati said that instead of trying to compete with Exchange as
an e-mail product, Lotus should emphasize Notes' more advanced
features. ``They keep wanting to position Notes as a messaging
product. It does more than that,'' Radicati said. ``They're really
doing themselves a needless disservice with all of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus also sniped at a report from another Palo Alto think tank,
Creative Networks Inc. In a study commissioned by Microsoft,
Creative Networks found that companies that installed Exchange
spend $109.86 less per worker in the first year of use than
companies that installed Notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That study was funded by Microsoft, so nothing more to say
there,'' said Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lotus officials said that the Creative Networks study was
fairer than Radicati's because it compared companies of roughly
similar size. And director of Notes marketing Ken Bisconti said
that a close reading of the two studies actually shows that Notes
and Exchange cost about the same if they are &UR;  &LR;  compared feature by
feature.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Malcolm, a group product manager for Microsoft Exchange,
hailed the studies as proof that Exchange is a superior value.
``What these studies do is they help to shed some light on why
customers are overwhelmingly choosing Exchange Server over Lotus
Notes,'' Malcolm said.

IMPEACHMENT BECOMES A GALVANIZING ISSUE ON ELECTION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)   (EDs: Filed in the ``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was being called the ``Seinfeld election,''
something about nothing, a midterm yawner void of any galvanizing
national issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the launching of a last-minute Republican advertising blitz
highlighting the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal changed all that. No
longer a sleeper, this election will set the stage for the
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, who is accused of lying
and using his power to cover up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Any way it goes, the congressional election will have a major
impact on the impeachment process. With hearings likely to begin a
few weeks after Tuesday's balloting, leaders of both political
parties say they'll be happy to either gain a few seats or not lose
too many.
</P>
<P>
   Republican gains would embolden GOP lawmakers in their conduct
of impeachment hearings. If the Democrats do well in races for the
House and Senate or lose only a few seats, ``the hearings will be
brief,'' said political scholar Thomas Mann of the Brookings
Institution, an independent Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrated by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the $10-million
television effort is aimed at 30 districts, many in the South and
rural areas where animosity to Clinton runs high. The goal:
Energize conservatives disappointed by GOP budget compromises two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, say the backfire potential is so high that
the ads and ensuing news coverage might help bring out their
voters. On Friday, the Democratic National Committee announced an
ad blitz of its own. The aim is to convince voters Republicans are
scandal-obsessed while Democrats want to move forward on issues
such as education and preserving Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling ad campaigns ``open up a Pandora's box of
uncertainty,'' said Curtis Gans, president of the nonpartisan
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Before they
aired, he added, ``we were heading into a low-turnout election.''
</P>
<P>
   While candidates on the home turf may be talking about abortion,
health care and other issues, the ads put impeachment on the
electoral map as perhaps the closest thing there is to a
galvanizing national issue.
</P>
<P>
   All 435 House seats are up, but only 50 to 60 are considered
competitive. Many of those are taking place in 34 districts where
the incumbent is retiring, leaving an open seat. The open seats are
evenly split _ 17 belonged to Republicans and 17 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-four incumbents are in uncontested races. Another 240 are
expected to be re-elected. Republicans now control the House
228-206, with one independent who generally votes.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Democrats appeared gleeful that the 11 seats needed to
retake the House seemed within reach. Now they concede that
scenario is virtually impossible. Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee executive director Matt Angle predicted ``plus five or
minus five'' for the party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties will closely watch the races in the 31 districts
where Democrats voted with the Republicans to launch an
unrestricted impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, predicted the Republicans would gain
between 10 and 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four Senate seats are up for grabs. With Republicans in
control 55-45, Democrats are given virtually no chance of retaking
control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are unlikely to pick up the five needed to reach 60,
a number that would enable them to defeat Democratic filibusters
that can kill bills. More probable is that the Republicans will
gain two to three seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gender is less of an issue this year than in 1992, dubbed ``the
year of the woman'' because of strong electoral gains by women.
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., elected in 1992, has been
entangled in scandals ever since. She looks to be a goner.
</P>
<P>
   In California, after a tumultuous struggle against Republican
challenger Matt Fong, incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer is ahead in the
polls. And in Washington state, self-proclaimed ``mom-in-tennis
shoes'' Sen. Patty Murray, another Democrat elected in 1992,
appears to be headed for a slim victory over Republican Rep. Linda
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other hot races:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Kentucky, the Senate seat vacated by retiring Sen. Wendell
H. Ford, a Democrat, is a tossup between Rep. Scotty Baesler, a
Democrat, and Republican Rep. Jim Bunning.
</P>
<P>
   _ In New York, the mudbath between Republican Sen. Alfonse M.
D'Amato and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles E. Schumer,
remains close. Most polls put Schumer slightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Wisconsin, it's too close to call between Democratic
incumbent Sen. Russ Feingold, and Republican Rep. Mark Neumann. One
late poll shows Neumann moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   _ In North Carolina, Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth is in a
tight race against trial attorney John Edwards. Faircloth's poll
numbers are slipping, making him one of the few vulnerable
incumbent Republicans this November.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Republicans outdistanced Democrats in campaign
fund-raising. Democrats raised $106.9 million, a 40 percent
increase over the last midterm election in 1994. But they have a
debt of $11.1 million, much of it left over from the 1996 campaign.
Republicans raised $184.6 million and have a debt of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also beat Democrats in the war for ``soft'' money,
contributions for party building and voter turnout that are not
subject to Federal Election Commission limitations. Soft money
mostly winds up financing not-to-subtle party television
commercials that endorse candidates without specifically soliciting
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took in $93.7 million in soft money, a 144 percent
increase over 1994. Democrats received $78.8 million, an 84 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   The secret of the GOP's success: Business contributions.
Business interests have given Republicans $262 million, according
to research by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Business also gave Democrats $198 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the race, the election this year is less about winning
converts than it is about getting out loyal followers and hoping
opponents' supporters take the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University,
compared it to the staunch loyalty of pickup truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not anything that will make a Chevy pickup driver
drive a Ford,'' he said. ``But dealers still have the task of
getting them to dealership to buy their products every few years.''

</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is spending $28 million, mostly to elect Democrats.
Some $14 million of that is for an on-the-ground campaign involving
telephone banks, leaflets at factory gates, union meetings and 392
organizers agitating to get organized labor's vote in 75 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense was that politics had become completely
impersonal,'' said AFL-CIO political director Steven Rosenthal.
``We thought we could personalize it on the ground better than we
could on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Also within the $28 million is $7 million for television
advertising, most of it geared to issues such as saving Social
Security and reining in managed health care. In 1996, the AFL-CIO
put most of its massive $35 million war chest into television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor also is contributing $35 million to Democratic
candidates. But money alone may not do it for labor. The AFL-CIO
gave $40 million to Democrats in 1994, the year Republicans took
control of Congress in an election widely interpreted as a
rejection of Clinton's first two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, not only did the Republican voter turnout surge, but
the number of Democrats heading to the polls declined. (Overall in
midterm congressional elections, turnout has declined since 1966,
falling from 48.6 percent that year to 38.8 percent in 1994.)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and their supporters also are concentrating on
turnout. Linder said the campaign committee committed $5 million to
a get-out-the-vote drive, with $300,000 of that targeted to
absentee balloting in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition is spending $3.1 million to distribute
45 million copies of its ``non-partisan'' voter guide in churches,
advising supporters on candidates' views on issues such as abortion
and school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign for Working Families, a conservative political
action committee, is spending about $3 million on more than 200
candidates and on promotions to boost voter turnout.

NBA UNION HAS A BARGAIN HUNTER 
</HEADLINE>
 BKN-UNION-LEADER-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The criterion was clear: Get someone who would stare
David Stern in the eye and not come down with conjunctivitis.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA Players Association saw a street fight brewing two years
ago, one that has erupted into open warfare. It wanted someone to
lead the union who would see Stern as a mere antagonist rather than
the intimidating, dominating, bullying, and, in its mind, always
victorious foe.
</P>
<P>
   That someone is Billy Hunter. Prior to his hiring as the union's
executive director, he was best known for taking on members of the
Hell's Angels and Jim Jones's People's Temple. Now he's taken on an
even more sinister group in the eyes of some of his flock: the NBA
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA lockout has wiped out the month of November and, with no
settlement imminent, could soon take a chunk out of December. It's
a first for the NBA, which always has managed to play a season
relatively free of labor strife. In the minds of Stern and his
deputy, Russ Granik, that was possible because reasonable people
made reasonable decisions. In the minds of the players, it was
because Stern always got his way. They wanted that to change.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter investigated the job at the urging of former Syracuse
classmate Dave Bing. He met some of his eventual clientele during
All-Star weekend in 1996, and it was clear to him, and to them,
what the job description entailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we couldn't have David Stern ourselves, we wanted the next
best thing. We needed someone to stand up to him and battle with
him,'' said Seattle center Jim McIlvaine, one of the members of the
union's executive committee. ``We wanted a guy who could get into a
room with David Stern and duke it out _ verbally _ and for a
variety of reasons, we thought Billy could be that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   What also made Hunter attractive to the union was his
background. There wasn't a hoop in it. The two other finalists,
agent Bill Strickland and former CBA commissioner Terdema Ussery,
each had some battle scars from years in the game. Hunter was
clean, fresh, ambitious, and knew a little about underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   As an 11-year-old, he pitched in the championship game of the
1955 Little League World Series, believed to be the first
integrated team in the final. Football was his sport at Syracuse,
where he roomed with John Mackey and captained the 1964 Orangemen.
He played briefly in the NFL for Washington and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a hard worker on the field and in the classroom,''
Mackey said. ``He kept saying that he came to Syracuse not just to
score touchdowns but also to score in the classroom. He knew how
important it was. But he was a damn good football player, too. And
he won't be intimidated by the owners. If he wasn't intimidated by
all those linemen, he isn't going to be intimidated now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter had been the US Attorney in Northern California,
appointed by President Carter in 1977. He had been a defense lawyer
and an entertainment industry litigator. But basketball? He was a
fan, an observer, an outsider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in from the outside, he had a fresh perspective,'' said
union attorney Ron Klempner, who has worked at the association for
five years under three executive directors. ``He just made it so
easy for everyone. He's straight with you. He cuts right to it.
People can warm up to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, some people can. Stern has found Hunter and his minions to
be implacable almost to the point of absurdity. ``This union
membership has stymied us,'' Stern said recently. ``We've been at
this, Russ and I, for somewhere over 50 years combined. We've been
able to negotiate with every other combination of executive
directors and presidents in the history of the union.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Hunter has kept the players and agents on the same page,
a far cry from the fractured union of three years ago. He hired a
director of communications _ he needs more help, Billy _ to help
get the message out and makes his players available when possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are not dumb jocks,'' Hunter said. ``These are
sophisticated and enlightened people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter got huge numbers to show up in a solidarity showcase in
Las Vegas while at the same time telling some agents to stifle the
decertification talk for now. He got another big crowd Wednesday in
New York. Such longtime union ciphers as Michael Jordan, Karl
Malone, and David Robinson have been transformed into Eugene V.
Debs clones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done it through effective and forthright
communication,'' Strickland said. ``After Larry Fleisher (the first
union head), this is the first guy who is looking David Stern right
in the eye and not kowtowing. That's what the players have
needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who remember Hunter as a talented tailback/defensive back
at Syracuse, as well as a leader off the field, are not surprised.
Floyd Little, who took Hunter's tailback job, got a taste of what
motivated Hunter soon after Little arrived on the Syracuse campus.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule had Syracuse playing Virginia Tech. Hunter
organized a petition drive with Bing, Little, and others to
eliminate schools with no African-American players from the
Syracuse schedule. It didn't work immediately. They played the game
and Syracuse won, but barely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was frightening for me. I had just come out of two years of
military school, and here I am, confronted with this,'' said
Little. ``There were only a handful of us (blacks) on campus, but
Billy fought the right fight. He's always fought the right fight.''
</P>
<P>
   The fight is far from over. Even after Thursday's eight-hour
marathon bargaining session, there has been little movement. More
talks soon will be held while more games and more money will be
lost.
</P>
<P>
   The players don't like what the league is offering and say they
won't accept it. Armon Gilliam noted Wednesday that Stern &AMP; Co. are
expecting the union to crack, crumble, and cave under the weight of
lost paychecks. Hunter said the union is anxious but not to
interpret the anxiety as a sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   He went into this job with his eyes wide open. He hasn't come
close to blinking yet. His constituency is betting, hoping, that he
never will.

HUNTERS ARE A DYING BREED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When Ray Bergiel of Plymouth, &UR;  &LR; Mass., takes to the woods in
the next few weeks in pursuit of his prized whitetail deer, his
prospects for success should be a bit brighter than in past years.
At least according to the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts and Maine, two of the states where Bergiel
hunts deer every fall, the trends are going his way: more deer,
fewer hunters, higher hunter success rate.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, national figures also show that while the deer herd is
growing, sometimes to annoyingly large numbers in suburban
settings, the number of hunters is on the decline, now around 16
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a change in values,'' says Bergiel, 50, who learned
hunting from his father, now 75. ``Kids today just don't see
hunting as a way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   This state has an archery season in the month of November and a
shotgun season from Nov. 30 to Dec. 13 (Dec. 5 on the Cape and
Martha's Vineyard). But the Interstate 495 beltway, which has a
large and growing deer population (up to 15 percent growth yearly),
has been developing residentially, necessitating firearms bans near
roads and houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winters are relatively mild in southeastern Massachusetts;
there is less hunting and predation,'' says John McDonald, director
of the Deer Project for the state's Division of Fisheries and
Wildlife. ``And people are growing lots of nutritional food for the
deer in their backyards. They love those nice shrubs.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of deer hit by cars is just one indication, says
McDonald, of the growing clash between the natural world and
development. While statewide numbers show the herd growing 6-8
percent annually, from the I-495 belt south, the growth rate is
double. In the last decade, the growth has resulted in as many as
5,000 additional deer in a statewide total of 80,000-90,000, or a
density of 16-20 deer per square mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that's out of control,'' says McDonald. ``We've
doubled the number of antlerless permits to control herd growth,
and people can tolerate the current density.''
</P>
<P>
   Except, that is, for those on Nantucket, where the deer density
on the 50-square-mile island grew to 50-60 per square mile. Aside
from the nuisance factor, the growing herd, as carriers of the Lyme
tick, were a threat to residents, who voted overwhelmingly two
years ago to expand the deer hunt on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Bergiel and his hunting friends had competition
from around 75,000 other hunters, who could expect around 10
percent sucess rate. Last year only 65,000 Massachusetts hunters
took to the woods, and the success rate, according to McDonald,
rose to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Why such a decline in the face of more quarry? ``The World War
II generation has pretty much stopped hunting, and the baby boomers
are beginning to drop out,'' says McDonald. ``And there are fewer
and fewer 17-year-olders coming into hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is Bergiel's 20-year-old son, who is in college.
Though he grew up sharing many shooting sports with Ray, he has
never wanted to hunt. ``I didn't want to push it on him,'' says
Bergiel. ``There's not a need to hunt today, but I just have a love
of the old ways and past traditions. Today the values have changed.
Kids are more on the soccer fields than in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maine, the largest New England state with the largest deer
herd, the trend is precisely the same. Fifteen years ago, Maine's
deer herd stood at 160,000. Today it's more than a quarter-million,
according to Jerry Lavine, a state deer biologist from Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers of hunters _ both residents and out-of-staters _
are on the decline at a rate of 1,500 per year. ``We're at a rate
now,'' says Lavine, ``where we're losing twice as many older
hunters than we're adding new ones. At one time, we had about
200,000 hunters hunting 160,000 deer. We now have more deer than
hunters.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Maine's 180,000 hunters last year enjoyed a success rate
of 18 percent, and it's growing. Lavine says the goal of his
department is a herd of 300,000 deer, or 10 per square mile, and a
higher harvest. ``Right now, we're underharvesting the herd.''
</P>
<P>
   In the northern reaches of the state, above a line formed by
Greenville, Millinocket, and Rumford, the herd is showing no
increase. Severe winters and loss of winter habitat to logging keep
the herd from growing. But in the rest of Maine, from the farmland
along the major rivers to the suburbs along the coast, deer are
more and more in evidence, as are antifirearms laws. The Maine
season begins tomorrow and runs through Nov. 28.
</P>
<P>
   As the deer herd grows and numbers of hunters decline, Bergiel
and his friends may feel fortunate to reap the benefit of a high
success rate. But like most hunters, they feel that a way of life
is slowly slipping away with their generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are replacing the older generation, who taught us how to
hunt, but there's no one coming along to fill our place,'' says
Bergiel. He says he enjoys all aspects of the sport: ``I enjoy the
gatherer-server kind of thing. And my friends all look forward to
coming over and having venison at my house because they can't get
it anywhere else.''

TRUTH IS ELUSIVE ON TERRY BOWDEN'S RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every once in a while, college football gets slimed by an event
that is beyond the pale.
</P>
<P>
   What happened at Auburn last week was the latest example. Coach
Terry Bowden, who began his tenure on the Plains with a 20-game
winning streak and whose 5 1/2-year record was 47-17-1, announced
his resigination. Effective immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me? What caused this? Why would a coach who had just been
given a contract extension for seven years, a coach who took Auburn
from the depths of probation back to national prominence, just quit
in the middle of a season, even with a dreadful 1-5 mark against
what the NCAA said was the toughest schedule in the country?
</P>
<P>
   If you listen to the Auburn backers, there was no good reason.
Sure, things were tough at Auburn, just as they would be anyplace
college football is regarded almost as a religion and the
parishioners are uneasy over a 1-5 start. But to just quit in
midseason? That made no sense.
</P>
<P>
   There had to be some reason, some explanation. Sure there was.
Terry Bowden was cheating on his wife, said the rumormongers. Not
only that, but he was having an affair with the daughter of the
member of the Board of Trustees who had hired him.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors were so rampant that Bowden and his wife, Sheryl,
issued a statement denying it.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the counterattack. Bowden said he left because he had
been told by a member of the Board of Trustees there was virtually
nothing he could do to save his job at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   More counterattacks. The trustee in the news, Montgomery, Ala.,
businessman Bobby Lowder, said he was as surprised as anyone that
Bowden had quit.
</P>
<P>
   And there came still another salvo after it was revealed that
Bowden received a buyout of more than $600,000, prompting another
member of the board to publicly wonder why Auburn was paying
anything since he simply quit.
</P>
<P>
   Want more? Former War Eagles quarterback Pat Sullivan said,
``Auburn needs someone to rally the Auburn people, to recruit and
coach. I feel I'm good at those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, a former Heisman Trophy winner coming off six years as
coach Texas Christian, was obviously offering his services.
</P>
<P>
   Former coach Pat Dye, who also offered his services _ only
half-kiddingyly _ said, ``I don't think the truth will ever come
out because it will hurt both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurt both sides? They've already been hurt.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that Terry Bowden, who until one six-game
stretch this season seemed to have been doing a pretty good job of
coaching and representing the university, walked away from his team
in the middle of a bad season.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Was he forced? The Board of Trustees says that is not the
case. It doesn't operate that way.
</P>
<P>
   Right.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a Bill Clinton type of sexual scandal brewing down
around Toomers Corner, where gossip is as much a part of the
lifestyle as fried chicken?
</P>
<P>
   Who knows? You can argue all you want that this is the climate
we live in, that this stuff happens all the time, whether it's in
the Oval Office or in a football coach's office.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it still stinks. If you are in the middle of a manure
field, you still can smell it, even though you are used to the
aroma.
</P>
<P>
   College football, which has enough problems as it is, has been
slimed, and some good people have been slimed as well, and no one
connected with the program should be happy about it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Health crises
</P>
<P>
   People at Nebraska are worried about the continuing
deterioration of quarterback Bobby Newcombe's left knee. What was
first thought might be a minor sprain may require major surgery.
With the Big 12 showdown against Kansas State coming in two weeks,
the once-beaten Cornhuskers probably need Newcombe to win. If there
is good news in Lincoln, it is the uncertainty concerning Kansas
State quarterback Michael Bishop, who also has been plagued by
injuries this season. Wildcat coach Bill Snyder, who does not
reveal injuries to the media, says Bishop is fine. But word around
Kansas State is that Bishop may be hurt more seriously than Snyder
is admitting ... The members of the Western Athletic Conference who
defected last summer _ Colorado State, Air Force, Brigham Young,
Nevada-Las Vegas, New Mexico, San Diego State, Utah, and Wyoming _
have a new name for their alliance: the Mountain West Conference.
Mountain West, Mountain Dew, who cares? It still will be the WAC to
most people. New commissioner Craig Thompson now must decide where
the league offices will be. The candidates: Colorado Springs or Las
Vegas. Vegas, of course, makes sense since the NCAA has been almost
evangelical in its anti-gambling crusade the last few years ... In
case you were wondering why the just-released Bowl Championship
Series rankings went down to 20 instead of stopping at 15, it was
because the provisions required the inclusion of the top-ranked
school from each of the BCS conferences who have a guaranteed
automatic spot. The lowest-ranked conference leader was Syracuse of
the Big East, No. 20 ... Oklahoma's John Blake is feeling more and
more pressure and will undoubtedly be one of the first coaches
fired at the end of the season. Some OU high rollers want former
Sooner coach Barry Switzer back. Others say they want either Bowden
or Tulane coach Tommy Bowden. &UR;  &LR; One of Blake's problems is his
team's sloppiness. In last week's 41-26 loss to Oklahoma State, the
Sooners committed 19 penalties.

A RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATE SEEKS ADVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating for all needed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 25-year-old college graduate and recently started a
new job paying $45,000 a year. My company offers a 401(k) plan
managed by Fidelity to which I can contribute up to 15 percent of
my base salary. My company will match 150 percent of the first 2
percent, and 50 percent of the next 3 percent, with full vesting
happening after two years of employment, a milestone I will reach
in July of 2000. I also have the option of investing from 1 to 10
percent of my salary in a company stock purchase program, which
allows the purchase of company stock at 85 percent of the fair
market value. I am debt-free at the moment, but some expected
future expenditures include a new car and a house within the next
five years and the possibility of taking two years off from work to
pursue an advanced degree in the next five to 10 years. I would
like to begin saving for these events as well as for retirement,
and I am considering my alternatives, including these
company-sponsored options and a Roth IRA. How should I allocate my
savings to best prepare myself for the future, and which Fidelity
investments, if any, should I pursue?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A.F., Gresham, Ore. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You have so many options that it's hard to set priorities.
For example, if you were to buy a home within the next five years,
would the idea of taking two years off for advanced study shortly
thereafter be realistic? If you buy a new car, will you be able to
save enough for a home down payment?
</P>
<P>
   But an easy place to start is with the 401(k). It would be just
plain silly not to take full advantage of the handsome company
matches of your savings. The company will put in $1,350 a year for
your first $900 contribution, and add $675 for your next $1,350 _
meaning that when you put $2,250 in the 401(k), the company adds
$2,025. Even if your contributions and the company matches never
change, by the time you're 65, that pool would grow to $1,211,722,
assuming 10 percent average annual investment returns. So I would
consider contributions of at least 5 percent of your earnings to
the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   As for graduate school, a home, and a new car _ I would rank
them in that order. My suggestion would be to postpone the idea of
a home until after you have completed your graduate studies,
especially since the advanced degree should mean that you should
earn a higher salary afterward.
</P>
<P>
   For similar reasons, I'd rather see you save money for graduate
school than buy a new car. Let's presume you can manage to save a
total of 15 percent of your pretax salary. That comes to $6,750 a
year. If the first $2,250 of that is going into the 401(k), that
leaves you with $4,500, which you could spread among an education
account, purchase of company stock, a Roth IRA, and a new car. If
you went with the car purchase, you might expect a monthly payment
of about $300 _ representing 80 percent of your saving power. I'd
rather see you go with a clunker, or a series of clunkers, while
you plan to make that big investment in your education.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, I'd bypass the Roth IRA, not because tax-free money
in retirement isn't great, but because the better investment at
this point is in building your future earning power.
</P>
<P>
   As for the company stock, the 15 percent discount is attractive,
but most of your goals are short- to intermediate-term, so I would
save that prospect for later in your career. At this point, CDs and
money market accounts should be your major savings vehicles, aside
from the 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   For your 401(k) program, I suggest you begin by building a core
holding, using a vehicle such as Fidelity Growth and Income fund
(closed to new investors, but still available in many 401(k)
programs) or Fidelity Spartan Market Index fund.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm 29 and looking to retire by age 50 or 55. My only
investments consist of two 401(k) plans, 223 shares of 3Com stock,
and $20,000 in a money market account. The 401(k) plans were
established with former employers, and we can't add to them. Mine
consists of $15,625 invested in Founders Growth and $15,619 in
Twentieth Century Ultra. My wife's has $7,995 in Putnam Growth and
Income, $3,651 in Putnam Voyager, and $3,536 in Putnam New
Opportunities. I'm considering rolling the two plans into IRAs.
Based on this information, how should we align our portfolios to
reach a goal of $4,000 a month to get by on in retirement?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; G.O., Carlsbad, Calif. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Basically, the bigger problem isn't how the money is
invested, but the fact that you need to keep contributing to it. At
first blush, it might seem your proposal would work if you retired
at age 55. Presuming 10 percent average annual portfolio growth you
would have $874,426 at the age of 55; you might then invest this to
produce an income stream of $56,900 a year. The trouble is that in
26 years, that $56,900 will have a buying power of $20,523 in
today's money, assuming that inflation averages 4 percent over
those 26 years. Even if it ran at only a 3 percent rate, the
current buying power would be only $26,384.
</P>
<P>
   Attacking the problem from the other end, and assuming 4 percent
inflation, you would need to have an $89,294 income stream in 21
years if you wanted the same buying power as $48,000 in today's
money; you would need a $103,516 annual income stream if you waited
to retire at age 55. Moreover, you don't want to limit your worries
to age 55 _ you'll want to think about the effect of inflation on
your savings later in retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line here is that far from being $800,000 or so, the
target should be closer to $2 million. Achieving this, with
presumed 10 percent average annual returns, would require monthly
deposits of $820.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, you have too much concentration in the
large-cap stocks. Only Putnam Voyager and Putnam New Opportunities
funds, both with mid-cap portfolios, give you exposure to other
market elements, and they collectively represent less than 10
percent of the whole. I suggest that you do roll over the 401(k)s
to IRAs, and then invest no more than 50 percent in large-cap core
positions. Finally, unless you view that $20,000 in the money
markets as your emergency savings, I would put it to work harder,
at the most conservatively in a balanced fund and otherwise in
stock funds along the lines of those recommended above.

BEEF UP THAT BOND FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 52 and currently employed, earning $40,000 a year. Due
to an inheritance from my parents I now feel financially
comfortable. Enclosed is my portfolio information. Is my money in
the right place, doing the right job, to allow me to plan an early
retirement in 10 years? I feel I'm well diversified, but maybe a
little too aggressive for my age. At retirement, I will collect a
total of $700 a month pension from two current jobs, plus a
projected $300 a month from my current job and $900 in estimated
Social Security benefits. Will I have enough for retirement?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; K.K., Needham, Mass. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You should be in fine shape for retirement, especially if you
make a few fairly minor changes in your $293,415 portfolio. The
list you provided showed 14 different mutual funds, eight common
stock positions, and a variety of cash-type savings accounts,
providing a breakdown of 61 percent stocks, 38 percent cash, money
markets and government securities, and the insignificant balance in
bonds. It's the latter category I think you should beef up, either
by replacing some of the stock funds with bond funds, or by
building larger positions in the funds such as Vanguard Star and
Vanguard Wellington that hold significant bond positions.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion is to move toward a portfolio that works out to 50
percent stocks, 25 percent fixed-income holdings, and 25 percent
cash and government securities. The easiest way to make this move
would be within your two IRAs and your 403(b) account, where you
have a total of $69,949. If you were to sell all of these holdings,
moving the proceeds to bond funds, this would mean you would have
$72,510, or 25.8 percent of the total portfolio, in fixed-income
holdings, which, as they say, is close enough for jazz. As a
replacement for the stock funds, I would advise Vanguard GNMA as
the mainstay of your fixed-income portfolio, with smaller positions
in short-term bond and high-yield bond funds.
</P>
<P>
   On the cash side, the current $111,699 position is dominated by
$50,000 in government securities and a $31,266 CD. No need to rush,
but when the CD matures, you could then transfer that money into
taxable positions in some of the stock funds you previously held in
those tax-deferred accounts, most notably Vanguard Index 500 and
Vanguard Specialized Health Care funds. These moves would bring you
roughly into that 50/25/25 breakdown I suggested. Also on the cash
side, nearly $20,000 of your cash position is in bank money market
accounts. The odds are that your returns from these are very poor _
entering this week, the national average yield from bank money
market accounts was 2.46 percent; you can achieve double these
returns from mutual fund money markets.
</P>
<P>
   You might set a target for such a portfolio of 8 percent average
annual returns. If you achieved that, after a decade your $293,415
would grow to $633,481. You anticipate $1,900 a month from pensions
and Social Security. Let's estimate that in early retirement, when
your cash requirements should be lower, you can live on the same
$40,000 you do now, although its buying power would be somewhat
sapped by inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean your savings would have to generate $17,200 a
year for you. If you have the same 50/25/25 portfolio balance at
that time, the cash and fixed income portions of the portfolio
should be ample to supply that.
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband is 51 and would like to retire at age 62. I am now
working, but eventually will receive a minimal Social Security
benefit. We receive a Navy retirement of approximately $1,200 a
month, which provides cost-of-living increases in the range of 1
percent to 3 percent a year. When there was a change in my
husband's 401(k) program, we rolled the funds into a Vanguard IRA,
which consists of $9,163 in Vanguard Windsor, $13,367 in Vanguard
Morgan Growth, and $9,633 in Vanguard Prime Money Market. We also
contribute to his company's new 401(k) program, adding the $600 a
month maximum, and we now have $13,000 in Raytheon common stock and
$16,000 in Fidelity Magellan. Finally, we have another IRA of
$10,000, invested in Monetta fund, and we try to contribute $100 to
$150 a month to that account. Do you have any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; S.L., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The major change I would suggest is some fund transfers in
the two IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   I would swap Vanguard Windsor to Vanguard Windsor II; the former
seems to have run off track pretty consistently since its storied
former manager John Neff retired almost three years ago. It's now
rated above average for risk, and below average overall. Windsor II
fishes in the same waters; both funds hold value-oriented large-cap
portfolios. But Windsor II, has done a much better stock picking
job. Over a decade, its average annual returns lead those of
Windsor, 15.97 percent to 12.09; over five years, the scores are
18.01 percent to 12.38 percent, again favoring Windsor II.
</P>
<P>
   Second, I think the money market position is too conservative.
This portfolio has 11 years to grow, and settling for money market
returns from nearly 23 percent of the portfolio will prove a
serious drag. I'd swap the money market for Vanguard GNMA, which
will probably have a couple of bad years before your husband
retires _ Ginnie Mae funds are whipped around by interest rate
changes. But the odds are overwhelming that the other nine years
will more than make up for those tough years.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I'd look elsewhere than the Monetta fund for a small
cap value position. I like the idea of having a portfolio position
in the small caps, but this isn't the fund to do it with. As of the
last Morningstar Mutual Funds report, the fund has been in the
bottom quartile of its peer group for six of the last ten years.
Moreover, it's hard to determine who its peers are; the fund's
portfolio has migrated over the past three years from a growth
concentration to a blend between value and growth to, at present, a
value portfolio. The fund posted its first top-quartile performance
since 1990 last year, when it gained 26.18 percent, but as this is
written it has lost 19.1 percent year-to-date, and it is back in
the cellar with Morningstar. I would look for a well-established
small cap value fund, such as Fidelity Low-Priced Stock or Longleaf
Partners Small-Cap funds.

 PRIVATIZED SCHOOL DOMINATES BOARD ELECTION  
 (EDs: Stands for EDUCATION-POLL.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The question of whether a for-profit company
should be allowed to run a struggling public school has become the
hot-button issue in Tuesday's San Francisco school board election.
</P>
<P>
   Both the powerful teachers union and the San Francisco Parents'
Lobby, a small watchdog group, have endorsed candidates solely on
that issue, in the hopes of preventing more takeovers of public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in San Francisco's recent history, this year
the current board, following the lead of Superintendent Bill Rojas,
allowed the for-profit Edison Project to manage a troubled
elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, there has been little discussion about what
candidates would do to improve public schools, boost academic
performance of black and Hispanic students, hire qualified teachers
or make sure very student has textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest misfortune of focusing on (Edison) is that it's
dividing us and costing us the political goodwill we need to do big
reforms, like eliminating the achievement gap between ethnic
groups,'' said Dan Kelly, school board vice president and the only
incumbent endorsed by the union and parents' lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the debate over Edison is not what parents are most
concerned about, according to San Francisco PTA president Carol
Kocivar. She said there are traditional issues that must be
addressed before getting to ``whatever happens to be the hot issue
of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   There are three incumbents and nine challengers vying for three
seats on the Board of Education, which manages a $550 million
annual budget and sets policy for more than 60,000 public
schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents Carlota del Portillo and Kelly are seeking to retain
their seats, along with Frank Chong, who was appointed to the board
by Mayor Willie Brown in August. There are seven seats on the
board.
</P>
<P>
   Mauricio Vela, a longtime community organizer and director of
the Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center, and Eddie Chin, a lawyer
who teaches civics at City College, have emerged as the
front-running challengers. Both ran and lost in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Parents' Lobby _ which has about 100 members and has
operated off and on since the 1970s _ and the teachers' union
endorsed Vela, Kelly and Chin because of their opposition to the
district's decision to sign a contract with the Edison Project.
</P>
<P>
   The Edison Project began running the school, now called the
Edison Charter Academy, in September. Supporters of the district's
decision say it gives the school a needed infusion of cash,
enthusiasm, new teachers and pedagogy. Critics assail it as a step
toward privatization that undermines public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privatization is not the only issue in this race, but it is
the most outrageous and high profile,'' said Marybeth Wallace, a
parent liaison with the child advocacy group, Coleman Advocates,
and a member of the Parents' Lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Del Portillo and Chong say the more important questions, such as
what kids are taught and how to hire and retain qualified teachers,
have been usurped by the politically divisive issue.
</P>
<P>
   Chong, a dean of student affairs at City College who graduated
from University of California at Berkeley and Harvard's Kennedy
School, was not endorsed by the parents lobby or the union because
of what Wallace called his ``foggy'' position on the Edison
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Del Portillo, the current board president who is dean of City
College's Mission campus, was not endorsed because she voted in
favor of handing the school to the Edison Project. Both the parents
lobby and the union said they see her as a rubber stamp to the
superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Edison Project has been made the issue by people who know
how to act up,'' del Portillo said. ``Everyone has bought into
it.''
</P>
<P>
   If re-elected, del Portillo said she would work to reduce class
size in the fourth and fifth grades. She also wants to train
parents to be advocates for their children and focus on helping
Hispanic children do better in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all this ballyhoo about Edison, no one is asking how we
improve education for kids in the lowest quartile,'' del Portillo
said. ``One thing we absolutely must do is train parents to become
advocates for their children. When you do that, the whole culture
of the school changes.''

DEMOCRATS SEE A CHANCE TO STAND THEIR GROUND IN THE SOUTH 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Republican Party's Sherman-like march across the
South appears to have slowed, and Democrats who have been on the
run for much of the decade see a chance to stand their ground.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans now hold a majority of the U.S. House and Senate
seats _ and most of the governor's offices _ in the 11 states of
the old Confederacy, which means pickings are slim for the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   While the recent trend has firmly entrenched the two-party
system in the South, Republicans ``have topped out in the South,''
said Merle Black, an Emory University professor who specializes in
Southern politics.
</P>
<P>
   This year, only minor changes are forecast for Southern House
seats, and none are expected in the Senate. The outcome of a
handful of governor's races will provide clearer signals of whether
the South has been transformed from a Democratic stronghold to the
foundation of the GOP's national constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty years ago, Democrats held virtually every seat in the
U.S. House and Senate and every governor's office in Dixie, the
southeastern states stretching from Texas to Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP began breaching the region's Democratic wall in the
1950s in presidential elections, then by winning statewide
elections in the early 1960s in Texas and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South, the Republicans began making big gains with the
electorate in the 1980s under Ronald Reagan,'' Black said. But it
was not until the 1994 midterm elections that the GOP would
dominate Southern politics, thus ending 125 years of Democratic
control of the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tide has run its course,'' said Olivia Morgan of the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``Now the Republicans
are the incumbents, and for the first time in a long time, that
will work to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the governors elected on Tuesday will have veto power
over the redrawing of legislative and congressional district
boundaries after the 2000 Census. That process will help determine
the partisan makeup of their state legislatures and their
delegations to the U.S. House.
</P>
<P>
   Redistricting in the early 1990s was overseen in the South by
seven Democratic governors and four Republicans, all working with
Democratic-controlled legislatures. This year, four governorships
are held by Democrats and seven by Republicans, and the task of
changing legislative and congressional district boundaries is still
three years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a state has a Republican governor during redistricting,
this gives Republicans a big advantage'' when districts are being
redrawn, even by Democratic state legislators, said Michael
Binford, a political science professor at Georgia State University.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven Southern governorships up for election this year,
two have no incumbents on the ballot. The rest are held by
Republicans, and two of them _ Fob James of Alabama and David
Beasley of South Carolina _ are in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only two guys who are in trouble in the South are the ones
trying to govern on socially conservative, Christian issues,'' said
Black. ``They've gone too far to the right, and they've begun to
alienate part of their base'' _ Republicans and independents who
are conservative on economic issues but not social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Both James and Beasley have opposed efforts to create state-run
lotteries. Their Democratic challengers _ Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman in
Alabama and state Rep. Jim Hodges in South Carolina _ have pushed
the lottery as a way to raise money to improve public education,
much as Democratic Gov. Zell Miller did in neighboring Georgia to
finance college scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   James, who switched from the Democratic to Republican parties in
the early 1980s, won this year's GOP gubernatorial nomination after
a bitter and expensive primary against businessman Winton Blount.
The campaign ended with James' negative ratings at an all-time high
and many of Blount's top supporters moving to the Siegelman camp.
</P>
<P>
   A survey last week by Southern Opinion Research, an independent
polling, showed Siegelman ahead of James, 60 percent to 35 percent.
In early October, the same polling firm found Alabama voters
favoring Siegelman over James 52 percent to 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   James has come from behind before, and observers are reluctant
to count him _ or his social conservative supporters _ out of the
running. In early summer, polls showed him in a dead heat with
Blount going into the June 30 GOP runoff. James won, 56-44.
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, arguably the most Republican state in the
South, Beasley alienated a large segment of his white GOP
supporters by proposing to remove the Confederate flag from atop
the state Capitol. His opposition to a state-run lottery has
alienated some Republican business leaders who see it as a way to
finance education improvements without increasing taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling interests have poured money into Hodges' campaign, and
a poll in mid-September showed the two candidates in a dead heat.
This prompted Beasley to launch a series of television
advertisements attacking Hodges as a tool of the gambling industry.
More recent surveys show Beasley ahead of Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the South Carolina governor's race also could
determine who might be appointed to replace one of the state's two
U.S. senators _ Republican Strom Thurmond, 95, and Democrat Ernest
``Fritz'' Hollings, 76 _ should either of them vacate his office
before his term ends.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hodges has said he would appoint a caretaker senator who would
not seek re-election to a full term. Beasley has made no such
promise, but GOP activists predict he would pick popular former
Gov. Carroll Campbell, a Republican who currently is working as a
top-dollar lobbyists in South Carolina and Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Incumbent governors Mike Huckabee in Arkansas, George W. Bush in
Texas and Don Sundquist of Tennessee have moderate records and hold
double-digit leads over their Democratic challengers. In Florida's
race for governor, Bush's younger brother, Jeb Bush, has moved away
from his hard-right rhetoric of four years ago and is leading
Democratic Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the last Southern state with no Republican governor
since Reconstruction, businessman Guy Millner has put up $11.6
million of his own money to finance his third statewide race.
Millner, a Republican who failed in two previous bids for statewide
office, has raised $3.3 million in contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Millner, founder of the temporary employment agency Norrell
Corp., was not the first choice of Georgia Republican leaders to
take on state Rep. Roy Barnes, the Democratic nominee. But the GOP
turned to Millner after the leading candidate, former state
Attorney General Mike Bowers, a Democratic turncoat, disclosed a
long-term adulterous affair.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, who compiled a moderate voting record as a House member
and earlier as a state senator, is being painted as a liberal by
Millner, who is struggling to keep from appearing inept.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the campaign, Millner ran a television ad showing a
woman accusing Barnes of being soft on drunken drivers. The ad was
pulled after it was discovered the woman herself had been charged
with drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   During a televised debate last week, Millner was unable to
respond to a question _ ``how many seats are in the state House of
Representatives'' _ until an aide scribbled the answer (180) on a
tablet and held it up just off camera.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Southern Democrats held a 15-7 advantage
over Republicans in the U.S. Senate. Today, the number has
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Democratic Party's only hope of recovering a
Senate seat in the South is in North Carolina, where first-term
Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth faces a well-financed challenge
from attorney John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Republican hopes of picking up another seat from the South
seemed fairly good two months ago in South Carolina, where GOP Rep.
Bob Inglis was positioned to knock off Hollings, a 32-year
incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   But Hollings' narrow lead in the polls over the underfunded
Inglis campaign has held steady since Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   A sign that the South has for now achieved partisan equilibrium
is the radical difference between the anticipated outcome of this
congressional election and the 1994 and 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Republicans won control of the House after major
victories in the Midwest and West, but none as big as in the South
where Democrats yielded 16 seats to the GOP. Two years later,
Democrats recovered in other areas of the country, but those wins
were offset by the party's continuing loss of House seats in the
South.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Republicans occupy 72 House seats from southern states,
up from 47 prior to the 1994 elections. Democrats hold 53 seats,
down from 77 earlier this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't expect to see gains this year like we had in
1994 simply because we swept them all then,'' said Todd Harris of
the National Republican Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans best chances of taking southern House seats from
Democrats are in North Carolina, where incumbent Rep. Mel Watt's
district was radically redrawn since his last election and where
Rep. Bill Hefner decided against seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Watt's district, which was dominated by African-American voters
when he was elected in 1992, was redrawn by federal court order to
include counties with mostly white voters. The reconfigured
district now is one-third black and almost one-third Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing Watt, who is black, is Scott Keadle, a dentist who is
making his first run for political office.
</P>
<P>
   In Hefner's district, former GOP state Rep. Robin Hayes, a
Cannon textile heir and unsuccessful gubernatorial nominee in 1996,
is heavily favored to take the seat. Little-known Mike Taylor, a
lawyer, is being outspent four-to-one by Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have a long-shot chance at picking up an open seat in
Mississippi, where Republican Rep. Mike Parker is quitting.
</P>
<P>
   State Highway Commissioner Ronnie Shows, a socially conservative
Democrat, is making a populist pitch that nudged him into
contention with Republican tax attorney Delbert Hosemann, whose
campaign was battered and broke after the GOP primary.
</P>
<P>
   The best chance for Democrats to knock-off an incumbent is in
Louisiana, where Republican Rep. Richard Baker's nine-parish
district around Baton Rouge was redrawn since the last election in
a fashion that more than doubled the black population.
</P>
<P>
   The two-term Republican, who faces a campaign-fundraising
complaint before the Federal Election Commission, is being
challenged by Democrat Marjorie McKeithen, the daughter of
Republican Secretary of State Fox McKeithen and former Democratic
Gov. John McKeithen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our best candidates are not cookie-cutter Democrats, but
candidates who fit their districts,'' said Morgan of the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee. ``They're not letting the
Republicans lay claim to any issue, whether its prayer in schools
or fighting crime. We're staying competitive.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Working his way through a bowling alley in a
working-class suburb, two-term Republican Rep. Steve Chabot is
handing out plastic cups with his likeness.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to talk politics above the din, Chabot is pressed about
his views on a variety of matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is he an NRA guy?'' asks one pro-gun bowler.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is your position on smoking?'' inquires a woman sitting
with her girlfriends and puffing on a cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watch my Social Security,'' urges an older bowler.
</P>
<P>
   Only once does the the subject that has consumed Washington and
was supposed to dominate the campaign trail this election year _
the Clinton sex scandal _ come up as the candidate winds his way
through the crowded alley.
</P>
<P>
   While some voters interviewed in this southern Ohio city and
elsewhere in the country said they intend to vote Republican to
register their disgust with the president's behavior, many more say
they have been turned off by what they view as an unhealthy
obsession with the topic among the media and politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has been screaming, yelling, ranting raving about
moral behavior in the White House will not get my vote. If that's
all they have to talk about then they are not talking about things
that matter to me,'' said Tina Koczeniak, a 41-year old registered
Republican who was greeted outside her workplace by Chabot's
Democratic opponent, Cincinnati Mayor Roxanne Qualls.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Qualls had complained about the difficulty of
piercing the blanket coverage of the scandal. But lately she said
the situation has turned around and the scandal is barely mentioned
in her rounds of the competitive district.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Chabot sits on the House Judiciary Committee that is
scheduled to hold impeachment hearings after the election he rarely
brings up the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't particularly want to talk about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Back in August when Clinton first admitted to his affair with
Monica Lewinsky, Republicans salivated at the prospect of major
gains in the House and Senate. Conservatives were angry and
energized while Democrats were demoralized and appeared likely to
stay home on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   But after House Republicans released the videotape of the
president's testimony before Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr,
public opinion began to shift as many voters complained they were
being inundated with too many salacious tidbits. Pollsters began to
detect a rising resentment at Clinton's treatment and an indication
that growing number of Democrats might head to the polls to show
their disapproval with the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Since Congress adjourned in mid-October after voting to commence
an impeachment inquiry, the issue has largely disappeared from
front pages of the newspapers and the top of the nightly news.
</P>
<P>
   And opinion surveys suggest that the scandal will not be a major
factor in the mid-term elections on Tuesday when voters select all
435 House members, 34 senators, and 36 governors.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts are predicting that the election will turn out the
way it typically does _ the better-financed Republicans will likely
to pick up a modest number of seats in both chambers, as the
out-of-power party traditionally does in a non-presidential
election year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment inquiry never produced that big national issue
that would lead to a substantial rejection of the president's
party,'' said Thomas Mann, a political analyst at the Brookings
Institution. ``It got trumped by a healthy economy and public
rejection of scandal as relevant to work of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   That has not stopped both parties from trying to exploit the
scandal in the closing days of the campaign as they seek to
energize their most active voters who could swing the outcome in
the closest races.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Republican Party commenced a $10 million
advertising blitz that uses the scandal _ particularly Clinton's
lying about his affair with Lewinsky _ to remind people why they
should not elect Democrats. In one ad an announcer asks, ``And
should we reward not telling the truth? That is the question of
this election. Reward Bill Clinton. Or vote Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Campaign Committee, said that it would have been unrealistic to
avoid the scandal in talking about this year's election.
</P>
<P>
   ``This scandal is really top of the mind for the public,'' she
said from Washington. ``If you are trying to have a discussion
about politics and you pretend it doesn't exist your message isn't
going to ring true.''
</P>
<P>
   And there certainly are those who remain hostile to the
president, including the man who confronted Chabot last week after
the candidate swept through bingo night at the Resurrection School
on Cincinnati's gritty west side.
</P>
<P>
   Upon leaving, Chabot found his car blocked by another vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   When he asked the driver to move, he retorted, ``When you
impeach the president I will move.''

   WORKPLACE-COLUMN-SMITH (Undated) Egregious sexual harassment
usually brings titters from those who hear about it. It's easy to
recognize and condemn someone for obviously offensive sexual
remarks, or blatant unwelcomed sexual behavior. But most sexual
harassment isn't so blatant, and figuring out whether it has taken
place and an employer should be liable for it isn't so easy.

   AUTHORS-WILLIAMS (Undated) _ School children do not memorize his
words or sketch his portrait. Holiday festivities do not honor his
birthday with parades or sermons. That he was once widely known as
``Mr. Civil Rights'' is largely forgotten now as Thurgood Marshall
has quickly faded behind the curtain of history. Juan Williams aims
to change that.

be,'' lead singer Michael Stipe said in a phone interview.

   Also angry at the president is 67-year old Georgia Triplett, who
attended a debate in Ironton, Ohio, between incumbent Democratic
Rep. Ted Strictland and GOP challenger Nancy Hollister, who are
locked in a tight race.
</P>
<P>
   `` I was a teacher for 32 years and I find it difficult to say
the president is a good role model,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett, who had already voted by absentee ballot, said that
she usually votes Republican and this year, she noted, ``I did not
even hesitate,'' to choose the GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Cracchiola, a Democrat from Kentucky who voted for Clinton
in 1996, said he has been tempted not to vote this year because the
scandal had turned him off to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the point,'' he said. ``You vote for a guy. He does a
good job. Then you find out he's lying.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the last-minute GOP barrage, the Democrats have
fired back with their own ads warning that Republicans are so
focused on investigations they are ignoring issues such as
education and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans _ so focused on attacking the president _ they've
forgotten about us. Next Tuesday, vote Democratic and tell Congress
we're ready to move on,'' the announcer says in the spot.
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment is shared by a number of voters.
</P>
<P>
   In Donaldson, Ga., Ashley Register, a semi-retired stockbroker
who has voted Republican in the last three elections said this year
the GOP emphasis on scandal has soured him on the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is going to make me vote Democrat,'' he said. ``I
think the Republicans have run it into the ground. They are using
the scandal as vehicle to hurt Clinton and the Democrats, and it is
going to backfire.''
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton, N.C., Sharon Royal, the proprietor of Sharon's
Country Diner, took a break from fixing eggs and grits to talk
about the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Royal said she initially believed the president should have been
impeached because of the lying. But then she changed her mind when
the media refused to let go of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been covered so much that people just got tired of it.
Let him run the country like he's been doing,'' she said. Royal
said she will probably vote for Democrats this year.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and the Rev.
Jesse Jackson have been barnstorming the country trying to energize
key Democratic constituencies, including African-Americans who are
particularly angry about the investigation. However, the president,
who usually relishes campaigning, has traveled the country to raise
money for Democratic candidates but has avoided large rallies.
</P>
<P>
   African-American turnout could well determine the outcome of
North Carolina Senate race where GOP incumbent Lauch Faircloth is
locked in a tight race with Democratic lawyer John Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   Faircloth has tied Edwards to Clinton in numerous ads to
energize conservative voters. But at the Omega House restaurant in
Winston Salem two African-American women rushed up to embrace
Edwards, and later said they were even more determined to vote for
Democrats this year because of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   One of the women, Cynthia Mack, a 40-year-old government worker
said the investigation into Clinton's behavior was ``political rape
and character assassination.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend, Terry Spaugh, 44, said that she is not concerned
about Clinton's conduct, saying her husband would also have been be
tempted by Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``What man wouldn't want that,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite ebbing interest in the scandal, candidates still are
confronted with the issue at various events.
</P>
<P>
   At the debate between Strictland and Hollister, the sole
question about the impeachment came at the end of the 90-minute
forum.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister, who has called on Clinton to resign, said she was
``appalled'' at his behavior and defended the Republicans
open-ended probe of the president.
</P>
<P>
   While Strictland said he was keeping an open mind on how to vote
on impeachment, he also justified his vote for the Democratic
proposal to limit the scope and time of any inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not good for this thing to drag on for months and years
in the future,'' said Strictland. ``We need to bring this matter to
a conclusion and them move on to improve health care, improve
education and save Social Security, the matters that really count
for most citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer drew sustained applause from the audience. &QL;

ISRAELI SETTLERS SAY GIVING LAND TO PALESTINIANS IS ULTIMATE
BLASPHEMY 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   YITZHAR, West Bank _ Yigal Amitai sees the land of the Bible
when he looks out his kitchen window at this windswept Israeli
settlement. He points with a finger to the sites where the biblical
stories unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   On one rocky mountain, the biblical patriarch Abraham received
revelations from God, he says. In the valley of Shechem, now the
city of Nablus, Abraham's son, Jacob, is buried. Nearby, in Shilo,
the tabernacle once stood.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they establish a Palestinian state, our strategy will be to
destroy it,'' says Amitai, a 32-year-old father of seven. He has a
fuzzy brown beard and wears the knitted scullcap common to
religious settlers here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will find ways to weaken them, to transfer the Arabs from
here,'' said Amitai. ``I have no problem with this word, transfer.
It's not a bad word. Someone must move, so it has to be them.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the Israeli settlements on the West Bank, Yitzhar has a
reputation as one of the most extreme.
</P>
<P>
   For the 70 families living in dinky trailers and dingy yellow
houses here the agreement signed at the Wye River conference center
last month was a continuation of the ultimate blasphemy: giving
parts of the land of Israel to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a crime that I don't forgive _ that they brought an army
of strangers inside Israel,'' said Amitai, sitting in a living room
filled with religious books and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's against everything the Bible says to do,'' he said. ``It
will endanger Jews and this is quite against Jewish law. It's a
crime history will not forgive.''
</P>
<P>
   Amitai's words, echoing those of many on the fringes of the
Israeli settler movement, have the Israeli government worried.
</P>
<P>
   Since the agreement was signed, Netanyahu has been bombarded
with banners _ some drenched in blood and riddled with bullets _
calling him a traitor. The scenes are all too reminiscent of the
frenzied protests that preceded the assassination of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin by a right-wing Jew three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Netanyahu, Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon and Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai returned from the Wye negotiations to
find the Shin Bet, the secret service charged with internal
security, recommending extra protection in response to the threats.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the potential for violence against Palestinians or
against holy places shared by Muslims and Jews may be higher as
settlers feeling increasingly under siege, and defended by an
Israeli army that many of them describe as ``weak,'' take matters
into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for violence is there,'' said Aviezer Ravitzky,
a professor of Jewish thought at Jerusalem's Hebrew University and
author of ``Messianism, Zionism and Jewish Religious Radicalism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The extreme religious right believes this agreement is against
divine will,'' said Ravitzky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they are pushed to the corner, and they no
longer believe they have any representative in the government now
that Netanyahu has signed onto the peace process, makes it a
dangerous situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some experts say the atmosphere today is different than
it was prior to Rabin's assassination, the prospect of giving up
territory, continued Palestinian terrorism both before and after
the agreement and despondency among settlers unsure what the next
political step should be have given rise to desperate acts.
</P>
<P>
   Since August, when two young seminary students from Yitzhar were
murdered by Palestinian gunmen, the tiny mountain settlement has
been a focal point for talk of violence.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that Palestinian farmers coming near the settlement to
pick olives were secretly casing the place in preparation for an
attack, Yitzhar's settlers have prevented any harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Hebrew daily Haaretz, when Israeli soldiers
tried to escort Palestinians to their olive groves, a settler
shouted: ``We have snipers in the trees and if any of you has the
nerve to take one step around the bend, he'll get a bullet between
the eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prepared for one or two Arabs, innocent Arabs, being
punished when they get close to the settlement in order that not
one terrorist gets through,'' Amitai explained. ``If they bother
us, we're not going to just sit quietly and accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the West Bank, right-wing violence has been on the
rise. In September, a settler from Kiryat Arba was indicted for
shooting into the homes of Palestinians living in a nearby refugee
camp.
</P>
<P>
   In October, an elderly Palestinian farmer was found bludgeoned
to death outside the settlement of Itamar. And in the past few
months, several settlers have been briefly detained after calling
for violence or resistance to peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The attention placed on these incidents, particularly when
Palestinians have perpetrated far more violence _ including seven
murders since August_ makes many of these settlers mad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crazy the way everyone focuses on a few olive trees when
there's been so much terrorism from Palestinians,'' said Eli
Mendelovitch, a 27-year-old settler from Yitzhar. ``It's out of
proportion, the quantity of effort (the Israeli army) uses to chase
a few Jews who have Jewish pride instead of going after the
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, say observers, is that anger peaked at the time of
the Rabin assassination in the wake of the first deal to hand West
Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they say, that nasty atmosphere no longer prevails.
Demonstrations are calmer and the slanderous pictures _ of Rabin in
Arab headdress or Nazi uniform _ have not been used against
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many settlers say they don't feel quite the sense of
political isolation or anger that they felt when Rabin's left-wing
government seemed bent on portraying them as a lonely minority
whose beliefs were wrecking the nation's chance for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Rabin government, there was a feeling of deep
personal distress,'' said Rabbi Shimon Klein. The rabbi heads the
Jewish seminary of BeitEl, a 5,000-strong settlement of religious
nationalists, most of whom moved to this hilltop because of its
biblical significance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told the settlers to go spin like propellers, said we were
only 3 percent of the nation, when we have much more support than
that,'' Klein said. ``Netanyahu doesn't ridicule us.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Israel's president, Ezer Weizman, reminded Israelis
that ``there are democratic ways to express opposition to the
agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   And in recent days, several settler leaders have appealed for
calm and lashed out in particular against the extremist elements
among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fringe elements are causing so much tension with threats
to the (settler leadership),'' said Yehudit Tayar, a settler
spokeswoman. She referred to threats received by more moderate
settler leaders, citing one in which a bullet was left on the
windshield of a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of people who are very level-headed and just
want to raise a family,'' she said. ``It's unacceptable that we
have people who are trying to destroy who we are and what we're
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Arutz 7, the settlers' mainstream radio station, has
been using sharp rhetoric similar to the pronouncements used when
the original peace deal arrived five years ago to denounce this
latest agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current withdrawal agreement ... is a degradation of our
national pride, is against Jewish law and is in violation of
several biblical prohibitions,'' said one statement signed by
several settler rabbis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is (therefore) forbidden to cooperate with this terrible
agreement,'' the statement, published at Arutz 7's web site, said.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere is so charged that a majority of Israelis say
incitement against their leaders is on the rise. Many fear they may
be killed.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Gallup poll of 566 adult Israelis, 81 percent
think there is incitement against Netanyahu, 60 percent think there
is a possibility of political assassination and 63 percent think
Rabin's murder expressed broader political and ideological views
shared by other people.
</P>
<P>
   In Yitzhar, the settlers say only that they will protest, pray
and work to strengthen the settlement by bringing in new families.
But the air is still charged with anger and a sense of foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope (Netanyahu) will find some miraculous way to escape
from this agreement,'' said Amitai. ``I don't have an alternative.
But giving guns to the enemy is not the answer. It's a one-way
ticket to war.''

   CHURCH-SOCIAL (New York) _ Across the city, religious leaders,
both Christians and Jews, say they have noticed the most unlikely

   FURSTENBERG-MODEL (Undated) _ Diane Von Furstenberg surely had
the most photographed cheekbones of the 1970s. A woman who could
flirt with the camera in ways that helped shape her career, she
flaunted her formidable bone structure for the leading image makers
of her day: Francesco Scavullo, Ara Gallant and, most memorably,
Andy Warhol. So it was jolting, after the recent premiere of ``Life
Is Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni's emotionally wrenching fable set
in Italy during the Holocaust, to see those famous contours soften.

   PEA-COAT-FASHION (Undated) _ Despite the peacoat's universal

MINISERIES ABOUT THE MOTOWN PHENOM MISSES A FEW BEATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For anyone who lived through The Temptations' heyday, the
knowledge that there's more there _ and that it isn't all that
pretty _ has long been severed from the soul group's sleek aura as
the quintessential song-and-dance men with a string of infectious
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Now along comes ``The Temptations,'' the miniseries,
enlightening us with the real lowdown, warts and all.
</P>
<P>
   Airing at 8 p.m. CST Sunday and Monday on NBC, the musically
rich ``The Temptations'' will make you move, but I can't vouch for
how ``moving'' it ultimately will be. That might have more to do
with your personal stake in the music and the real lives behind the
lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   A definitive story of The Tempts, whose rise is well-documented
but whose fall has always been somewhat sketchy, certainly offers
great promise. (Aren't those promos tempting?) But ``The
Temptations'' doesn't even attempt to explain this mythic phase of
American music, staging instead a production that is essentially
great music masking melodramatic, mushy and often simple-minded
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the 1988 biography of Otis Williams, the last surviving
original Temptation, the film is told in narrative, chronological
order. It begins with Williams' (Charles Malik Whitfield's)
wide-eyed obsession with starting a singing group, even though his
voice was merely adequate. If anything, he was superb at finding
talent and blanketing himself with it.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, we see him literally chasing down Melvin Franklin
(D.B. Woodside), portrayed here as a mama's boy who hid behind a
tree while Williams asked his mother whether he could join the
group.
</P>
<P>
   Williams recruited Eddie Kendricks (Terron Brooks) and Paul
Williams (Christian Payton) along the way, and even came up with
the group's name off the cuff after Motown's Berry Gordy refused to
audition them without one.
</P>
<P>
   Try as it might, ``The Temptations'' doesn't make the connection
that Detroit in general and Motown in particular was, during the
'60s, the center of the music universe, a tiny outfit kicking out
monster hits from folks like The Supremes, Stevie Wonder and Smokey
Robinson, who wrote much of The Temptations' early material.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '60s, The Temptations grew as Motown grew, melding
doo-wop with the house band's blues and the pop/R&AMP;B inventions of
Gordy's stable of producers. In many ways, The Temptations were the
ultimate Motown act, a group whose hills-and-valleys career
paralleled the changing fortunes of Motown.
</P>
<P>
   They broke out in 1964 with the hit ``The Way You Do the Things
You Do.'' The floodgates opened: ``My Girl.'' ``Cloud Nine.''
``Can't Get Next to You.'' ``Ball of Confusion.'' ``Psychedelic
Shack.'' During their most successful stretch, they had five
platinum albums, four Grammy awards and 12 gold albums.
</P>
<P>
   But The Tempts also had their share of underlying drama and
tragedy, and ``The Temptations'' zeros in quite closely on those
elements.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Williams was lost in alcohol and eventually killed himself
with a gun while sitting in his car. (His drinking, wife-beating
descent is chronicled artistically with a glorious video montage
covered by ``Papa Was a Rolling Stone.)''
</P>
<P>
   Tumultuous lead singer David Ruffin (Leon) fell into drug abuse
and is shown here being tossed out of a moving car at the front
door of a hospital, bloody and dying.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy cigarette smoker Kendricks died of lung cancer, and
Franklin had rheumatoid arthritis, which broke down his immune
system and contributed to a stroke. (In one of the final scenes, he
is laughing and talking with his mother and Otis Williams one
moment; the next, he's dead.)
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the group continued, reloading with members _
there have been 19 so far, with some, like Dennis Edwards (Charles
Ley), leaving and returning, only to leave again.
</P>
<P>
   One irksome problem is that the film telegraphs scenes rather
than simply developing them. Songwriter Norman Whitfield (Mel
Jackson), responsible for hits like ``Ain't Too Proud to Beg'' and
``My Girl,'' wafts through the proceedings like a talented but
egotistical sleazebag. Even Gordy (Obba Babatunde) and longtime
manager Shelly Berger (Alan Rosenberg) are stuck in shallowly
conceived roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Temptations'' tries mightily to capture this drama while
telling a cohesive story, showing the group in rehearsals and
performing and yelling at one another, usually about Ruffin's slide
into the darker side.
</P>
<P>
   As for Ruffin, he's thoroughly demonized. Leon, who plays him
quite well, accordingly breathes fire and wears horns. Ruffin was
known for his womanizing, drug addiction and mood swings, but why?
He is first seen as a ladies' man, recording solo with Motown,
until The Temptations needed a lead singer. One scene shows Ruffin
nearly in tears waiting for the tour bus. ``Nothing's wrong,'' he
says to one of the Tempts. ``For the first time, everything's
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet a few scenes later, Ruffin is showing up at a picnic with
his personal drug supplier.
</P>
<P>
   After his dismissal from the group, Ruffin showed up at so many
of The Temptations' performances that they began to employ security
to stop him. But he never made it close enough to swipe the mike
from Edwards, leap on stage and lead the group in song, as is
dramatically played out in the film.
</P>
<P>
   It should be noted, too, that Williams is the film's
co-producer, and the most clearly defined of the original members.
He's shown here as a family man (even though his wife divorced him
for spending too much time on the road and not enough with their
son), as a level-headed survivor who was one of the least-known of
the Tempts but actually was the glue that held them together.
</P>
<P>
   Over four hours, you'd think writers Kevin Arkadie, Robert P.
Johnson and Alan Landsburg could have shown the Motown era more
vividly, illustrating why, for instance, the Tempts at one point
came to a complete standstill. (It was during the period Gordy
turned his attention to making movies instead of records, and all
the Motown artists found their instant success no longer so
instant.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Temptations'' is nearly saved by the music, which becomes
even more poignant as the troubles mount. Even with the movie's
many flaws, at least one thing's certain: You won't listen to the
music the same way again.

EACH YEAR, THOUSANDS OF BOYS WIN AWARDS BASED ON THEIR RELIGION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEYVILLE, Texas _ Alex Bustillos loves camping, hiking, tying
knots and doing other things good Scouts do.
</P>
<P>
   He also takes his religion, Judaism, seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worked hard to get this,'' said Alex, proudly showing a
gold-colored Aleph badge, the Jewish religion award for Webelo
Scouts.
</P>
<P>
   He is one of thousands of Scouts _ Protestants, Catholics,
Mormons, Muslims, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews or Zoroastrians _ who win
awards through their knowledge and practice of their religious
faith.
</P>
<P>
   Faith in a higher power is a central _ and sometimes
controversial _ aspect of Scouting. Some atheists and agnostics
barred from participating in Boy Scouts have claimed
discrimination. But courts so far have backed the Boy Scouts'
insistence that members profess an allegiance to a supreme being.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known religion awards are called ``God and Me,'' ``God
and Country,'' ``God and Family'' and ``God and Church.'' But there
are many other names given to the awards by religious groups.
</P>
<P>
   Alex's award for a Webelo Scout, for example, is the ``Aleph,''
after the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Members of the
Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormons) receive a
``Faith in God'' medal, and Bahais earn ``Unity of Mankind''
religion awards.
</P>
<P>
   Alex, 9, was the only Jewish Scout among several Baptists,
Methodists and Lutherans who recently received religion medals in
ceremonies at First United Methodist Church of Hurst, a Fort Worth
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   To earn his award, he had to prove he helped others; give a talk
to his adviser about Bible heroes, including Noah and Abraham;
recite Hebrew blessings; memorize five of the 10 Commandments; and
explain the symbolism of objects used in Jewish holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spencer of Arlington, a member of the religious relations
committee of the Longhorn Council, which oversees 35,000 Scouts in
the regioin, says the awards don't come directly from Scouting
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the religious organizations provide the awards, and
we allow them to be worn on the Scout uniform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer, a Catholic, leads Boy Scout Troop 5, sponsored by the
Kiwanis Club of Arlington, and he has helped boys of various faiths
earn religion awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my Scouts just earned his Bismillah award for the
Islamic faith,'' said Spencer. ``Another of my boys, who is a
Buddhist, won the Metta award.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasis on a supreme being is an integral part of Scouting,
said Gregg Shields, a national spokesman for the Irving-based Boy
Scouts of America Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very first line of the Scout oath is `On my honor I will
do my best to do my duty to God ...,' '' said Shields. ``It comes
before duty to country, duty to others and duty to self.''
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis on God has come under fire. Some atheists and
agnostics have filed suits claiming the Boy Scouts are a public
organization that discriminates on the basis of religion.
</P>
<P>
   A lower court in California ruled earlier this year that twin
brothers could not be excluded from the organization because they
didn't believe in God. But the case was appealed and the California
Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts had a right to set
standards of membership.
</P>
<P>
   Also, a 1993 ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court said the Scouts
had the right to exclude a suburban Chicago youth who said he was
an agnostic.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Downey, founder and president of the
Anti-Discrimination Support Network in Pennsylvania, said the
Scouts' religious policies will continue to be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   She joined the fray in 1992 when her son, Matthew, then 13, was
barred from a West Chester, Pa., Scout troop because he refused to
sign a statement saying he believed in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Scouts should come into the 20th century,'' Downey
said. ``They should be ashamed that they are spreading prejudice
and discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Gorski, an Arlington physician who is leader of the
North Texas Church of Free Thought for atheists and agnostics, says
the Boy Scouts are a ``stealth'' religious organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Scouts want to be a religious group, they should put up
a cross and declare that they are religious,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gorski has urged the United Way of Metropolitan Tarrant County
to stop giving financial support to Boy Scouts because of its
insistence that members believe in a supreme being.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Clifton, executive director of the Longhorn Council, said
one of the main benefits of the religion awards is promoting
respect for others' beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Scouting officials depend on churches, synagogues and other
religious organizations to designate the achievements needed to
qualify for the awards, Clifton noted.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Bustillos, for example, worked with Linda Hoffman, his
Sunday School teacher at Congregation Beth-El, a Reform synagogue
in Fort Worth, to earn his Aleph medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is an important program,'' said Hoffman. ``Even
though nobody else in his den had a clue about what being Jewish
was, they learned a lot from him.''

`WIFELY SUBMISSION' STATEMENT CREATES TENSIONS AT SEMINARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ To submit or not to submit. Professors at
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth were
pondering that question this week.
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members of the 3,300-student seminary _ the nation's
largest _ are being asked to sign an updated Baptist doctrinal
statement that contains a controversial clause stating that wives
must ``submit'' graciously to the servant leadership of their
husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Although faculty members emphatically support a strong stand for
the traditional family _ which backers say is the intent of the
statement _ many professors have reservations about the ``wifely
submission'' part of the document.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment to the Baptist Faith and Message Statement _ the
first since 1963 _ created a furor last summer when it was approved
at the national Southern Baptist Convention in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   It begins: ``The husband and wife are of equal worth before God,
since both are created in God's image ... A husband is to love his
wife even as Christ loved the church ...''
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the part that, to some, flies in the face of equal
rights for women: ``A wife is to submit herself graciously to the
servant leadership of her husband even as the church willingly
submits itself to the headship of Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides having reservations about the submission part of the
statement, some faculty argued that the Fort Worth seminary is
changing the rules of employment. Seminary faculty members were
hired under the 1963 version of the doctrinal statement _ not the
revised version.
</P>
<P>
   Two professors have already said they won't sign, choosing to
leave the seminary. Dan G. Kent, professor of Old Testament for 19
years, will retire in June, but his objection to signing the
statement is only one reason for his retirement, he said. Health
problems and the fact that his wife is happily retired also were
factors.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brehm, assistant professor of New Testament since 1992,
submitted his resignation to seminary President Ken Hemphill. The
latest event caused him to make a decision he said he had been
considering for some time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had already been experiencing a crisis of conscience over
the direction of the Southern Baptist Convention and over recent
events at Southwestern,'' Brehm said. ``This has helped clarify my
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Brehm said he backs support for the traditional family, but he
has concerns about the wording of the Baptist doctrinal statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``One concern is that I feel that the statement does not allow
other legitimate interpretations of what Ephesians 5 has to say
about male-female relationships in marriage,'' Brehm said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the statement have complained that it fails to
emphasize Ephesians 5:21, which asks wives and husbands to submit
``yourselves one to another.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the more than 150 full- and part-time Southwestern
faculty members are expected to eventually sign the doctrinal
statement, said David Porter, a seminary spokesman. Southwestern's
bylaws have always required professors to teach in accordance with
the Baptist Faith and Message Statement, a general statement of
Baptist beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Trustees last week approved a bylaw requiring faculty members to
sign the more controversial, updated version of the statement of
faith. Also, the change means professors must support any future
revisions to the doctrinal statement.
</P>
<P>
   Kent told the Associated Baptist Press that he and others
resented endorsing a broad, ``open-ended'' statement of faith. It
means, he said, that professors would be endorsing any future
statement approved by the Southern Baptist Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue has caused a great deal of heartache and concern,''
Kent said after the trustees' meeting. ``The faculty has been
carrying a terrible burden for the past several weeks. I hurt for
them. I wish there was some way it could be avoided.''
</P>
<P>
   Seminary President Hemphill and other officials of the graduate
training institution are attempting to dampen the controversy and
retain the strong support the 90-year-old seminary is still
receiving.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how it is approached, though, the latest happening at
Southwestern shows a further tightening of control by the dominant
conservative leadership of the Southern Baptist Convention.

DAVIS STILL HOLDS LEAD IN CALIFORNIA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Filed in ``a'' and ``p'' category)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Lt. Gov. Gray Davis retains his lead over
his Republican opponent in the race to become governor of
California, according to a new survey out Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 809 likely voters shows Davis leading Attorney
General Dan Lungren 50 percent to 43 percent. Although the poll
indicates Lungren leads among voters in the Central Valley, Davis
continues to command support among women voters and self-described
independents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gray's got it,'' said Del Ali, senior vice president of
Mason-Dixon Political/Media Research of Columbia, Md., which
conducted the survey for the San Francisco Examiner from Monday
through Wednesday. ``The key thing here is that there is absolutely
no momentum on the positive side for Lungren.''
</P>
<P>
   Other polls this week also showed Davis with support among
likely voters in Tuesday's election. A Field Poll released Thursday
gave Davis a 14 percentage-point advantage over Lungren, and the
Los Angeles Times showed Davis 11 points ahead.
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren said his own polls show a much closer race, putting
him only 4 or 5 points behind Davis. The margin is close enough
that the Republican National Committee agreed to send him $400,000
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee they would not send us $400,000 if we were 14
points down or 11 points down,'' Lungren said. ``I have no problem
with the sincerity of people taking these polls. But hopefully you
look at polls as what they really stand for, which are trends. And
the trends ... have been going in our direction since a week ago
Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll showed voter opinion of the two candidates has changed
little over the past two weeks, with Davis slightly more popular
than Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-one percent of voters said they had a favorable opinion of
Davis and 45 percent said they viewed Lungren favorably, despite
efforts from both sides to demonize their opponents as too extreme
for California.
</P>
<P>
   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 points. All
those surveyed were registered voters who said they regularly vote
in elections. Seven percent of those surveyed said they were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been buoyed by recent reports showing a
record-high year for absentee voting. The number of Republicans
requesting absentee ballots in the state's five largest counties is
running 16 percent higher than requests from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Bill Jones predicted this week that 9.4
million Californians would vote in Tuesday's election, and 25
percent of them would vote by mail. In the past, absentee ballots
have favored Republican candidates, but more recent trends show
that people from all parties vote by mail because it is convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are pushing hard in the final days, with huge mail
and phone bank campaigns. Lungren said he had 89,000 volunteers
spread throughout the state ready to get voters to the polls on
Election Day, and Democrats said they would have 5,000 volunteers
on Tuesday to drive people to the polls.

   The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 points. All
those surveyed were registered voters who said they regularly vote
in elections. Seven percent of those surveyed said they were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have been buoyed by recent reports showing a
record-high year for absentee voting. The number of Republicans
requesting absentee ballots in the state's five largest counties is
running 16 percent higher than requests from Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Bill Jones predicted this week that 9.4
million Californians would vote in Tuesday's election, and 25
percent of them would vote by mail. In the past, absentee ballots
have favored Republican candidates, but more recent trends show
that people from all parties vote by mail because it is convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are pushing hard in the final days, with huge mail
and phone bank campaigns. Lungren said he had 89,000 volunteers
spread throughout the state ready to get voters to the polls on
Election Day, and Democrats said they would have 5,000 volunteers
on Tuesday to drive people to the polls.

COLD WINDS NEEDN'T PUT AN END TO THE SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)  
 (bl) 
By CASS PETERSON   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Several years ago, flowering kale enjoyed a period of vogue
among my gardening neighbors. It was as common a sight in the fall
as chrysanthemums, lined up in front of the foundation shrubs or
clustered around the mailbox post.
 &HT;    The plants have eye-catching red, white or pink centers,
surrounded by a ruff of blue-green outer leaves. They look a little
like the stiff, frilly petticoats once worn by little girls under
their party skirts. I never cared that much for them, until I
discovered their great advantage over chrysanthemums, asters,
monk's hood and other decorative autumn plants.
 &HT;    They are delicious.
 &HT;    When frost has wiped out the tender vegetables and hard freezes
threaten the tougher ones, it's a treat to munch anything fresh
from the garden. Even my cats understand that. We vie with each
other for the right to the last sprigs of parsley. Flowering kale
is not safe in my yard.
 &HT;    Many of my neighbors consider the gardening season to coincide
with the swimming pool season. It opens on Memorial Day weekend and
closes roughly three months later on Labor Day weekend. Whatever's
left to be harvested at that point becomes the locally popular
concoction called End-of-the-Garden Salad, a mixture of tomatoes,
cauliflower, corn, peppers, carrots, beans and more, packed into
jars and sealed in a pressure canner for winter eating.
 &HT;    I'm of a different persuasion. As long as the soil is warm and
the days are of reasonable length, plants will grow well into
November. Moreover, autumn often brings the best gardening weather
_ clear, sunny days and crisp mornings.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, that fine season wears into winter, and even a
diehard's desire to work in the garden wanes when the north wind is
whipping sleet into one's eyes.
 &HT;    The last crops have to be good soldiers, capable of taking care
of themselves. I've no desire to trudge into the garden each night
with tarps and blankets to swaddle the vegetables.
 &HT;    Collards and kale (the regular kind) are real troupers, as are
brussels sprouts and cabbages. They don't need shelter. Why have
bags of vegetables in the freezer when there are living ones that
will handle being frozen and thawed repeatedly, getting sweeter
with each cold blast?
 &HT;    Chinese cabbage looks fragile compared with the thicker-leaved
red and green cabbages, but it's a deception. After a night in the
20s, the fat, drumlike heads will be frozen so solid that the outer
leaves can be snapped like crisp potato chips. But if the
temperature rises above freezing, the plants will look dewy and
fresh, as if they had just been bathed by a spring shower.
 &HT;    Bok choy and tatsoi are variants of Chinese cabbage, with the
same stalwart attitude toward the weather. Tatsoi (the name
translates loosely as ``black cabbage lying flat'') forms a
ground-hugging rosette of dark green leaves. It looks like spinach,
but has a mild mustard flavor, and is beautiful enough to grow
around the mailbox post with the flowering kale.
 &HT;    Leeks are nonchalant about winter, although a little mulch
around the base of the plants might be needed to keep the soil from
freezing. I've chipped leeks out of frozen ground and left them in
the cellar until the collar of soil halfway up the shank thawed
enough to be removed, but it's a messy business.
 &HT;    The same goes for parsnips, carrots, rutabagas, turnips and
other root crops. They'll keep beautifully in the ground, even
after their foliage is gone, but knowing they're down there, safe
and savory, isn't much help if you can't pry them out without a
pickax.
 &HT;    One year I neglected to mulch the parsnips early enough, and the
foliage was completely gone by the time I hauled a cartload of
straw to the spot. I mulched the wrong bed, to my great frustration
when the urge for parsnips hit.
 &HT;    Roots can also be dug when the ground is still soft, and stored
indoors over winter. (That's why everyone used to have a root
cellar, after all.) My limited storage facilities are already
crammed with comestibles that can't be left outdoors, like winter
squash, sweet potatoes and apples, so the roots must fend for
themselves.
 &HT;    With some protection, like a cold frame or some plastic
sheeting, it's possible to keep more delicate vegetables going into
early winter. Lettuce, arugula, mizuna, beets, chard and mustard
greens will take cold temperatures if they are sheltered from dry
winds that dry out their thin leaves.
 &HT;    I might use a scrap of polyester row cover to protect
ready-to-harvest salad greens if the weather takes a nasty turn,
but true extended-season gardening requires more dedication than I
am likely to muster in November. Cold frames have to be opened for
ventilation on sunny days, covered with insulation on really cold
nights and watered even if the garden hose is frozen.
 &HT;    The rugged cold-weather plants in my garden, standing proudly
over the mowed-down remains of the peppers, tomatoes and squash,
are more to my liking. In my south-central Pennsylvania climate,
even kale will succumb to the weather typical of January and
February, but it starts sprouting new growth in March.
 &HT;    Flowering kale, I'm told, will do that as well, but I can't
attest to it. By March, the few I've ever grown have long since
been eaten.
 &HT;

<P>
   Tie long rose canes securely to fences and arbors to prevent
snapping or splitting in winter winds. Cut out diseased or damaged
wood, but don't do major rose pruning now. If you've had black
spot, mildew or other rose diseases, scrupulously remove fallen
leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Start planting tulips and continue planting other spring bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   Wait until frost has blackened foliage before digging and
storing tender tubers like dahlias, but cut down foliage of
herbaceous perennials like peonies that will not add interest to
the winter garden.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to remove spent annuals. Clean any pots that held
diseased plants with a solution of one part bleach to nine parts
water. Leave vines like moonflower (Ipomoea alba) for its hard
fig-shaped seed pods and love-in-a-puff (Cardiospermum halicacabum)
for papery brown seed capsules that cling all winter to their stems
like little balloons.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful not to throw invasive species of weeds or any that
have gone to seed on a compost pile.

THE FUTURE ISN'T WHAT IT WAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)  
 (bl)  
 By FRANK DECARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a moment of national nostalgia. Cynicism was put on hold
for the five minutes it took the spacecraft to vanish from our
television screens. We prayed as we watched CNN last Thursday,
remembering the last time so many took such interest in a NASA
launch. This one, thank heaven, seemed to work.
</P>
<P>
   If you remember John Glenn's historic 1962 Mercury flight _ or
if, like me, you took Instamatic pictures of the television that
day in 1969 when man first walked on the moon _ you felt like a kid
again last week. That was when the
astronaut-turned-senator-turned-astronaut returned to space aboard
the shuttle Discovery at age 77. It was a feel-good media event.
</P>
<P>
   Add the enthusiasm for Glenn's latest mission to the Emmy Award
recently heaped upon the HBO miniseries ``From the Earth to the
Moon'' and one thing is clear: space age nostalgia runs deep among
baby boomers.
</P>
<P>
   For us, the space program of old promised not only real-life
outer-space adventures but also the hope of a brave new world back
home _ flying cars, plastic houses, Tang. Someday soon, it was all
going to be ours.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, NASA was the coolest of the cool, fueling the
imaginations of young Americans with each Apollo mission. ``The
great thing about the space program in those days was, it kept us
dreaming about the future, which had a very salutary effect in
maintaining national sanity,'' Walter Cronkite noted in last week's
TV Guide. Today we have St. John's wort for that, and a much
bleaker picture of what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Today when we imagine the future, we think of ``Bladerunner''
and ``Planet of the Apes,'' not the 1963-64 World's Fair and the
Carousel of Progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I miss,'' Andy Warhol wrote in his 1985 photo
journal ``America,'' ``is the time when America had big dreams
about the future. Every year there'd be a new scientific discovery
or new invention and everyone would think the future was going to
be even more wonderful than ever. Now it seems like nobody has big
hopes for the future. We all seem to think that it's going to be
just like it is now, only worse.''
</P>
<P>
   On Los Angeles area highways, that is especially true, even when
traffic is running smoothly. Billboards for Disneyland along the
roadsides proclaim ``The Future Is Now'' as they hype a re-imagined
Tomorrowland.
</P>
<P>
   The amusement park's future-focused area reopened last May after
some serious remodeling. Gone are the stark whiteness of modernism
and the cleanness of the late '50s futurism that graced the
original Tomorrowland. In its place are edible flora, a refurbished
rocket ride and a color scheme that leans more toward rusty bronze.
</P>
<P>
   The formidable Space Mountain, a cone-shaped structure that once
gleamed as the icy crown jewel on the Disneyland-scape, now looks
like a giant tarnished brooch. It is all supposed to be very Jules
Verne and H.G. Wells, but it feels instead like an apology for the
naive hope of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile in Las Vegas, a year-old tourist attraction called
``Star Trek: the Experience'' presents a future with more troubles
than Tribbles. Visitors to this science-fiction museum (and an
adjoining space-themed casino) not only see props and costumes from
the wildly successful television and movie franchise, but can also
read their way through a so-called history of the future. An
incredibly detailed timeline interweaves the mythology of all the
many permutations of ``Star Trek.''
</P>
<P>
   Most glaringly, it imagines as the great turning point in the
history of humankind a Third World War that nearly obliterates all
life on Earth. If that doesn't inspire nausea, the shuttlecraft
flight simulator you ride after you are done reading everything
will.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the vision of the future provided by the old
Tomorrowland (and the early days of NASA) was one of speed and
style; minimalism would remove the gewgaws of the past so we would
be ready (and dressed) for anything. It made the future seem fun,
but now we know too much to believe that that could be true.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the space age excesses of ``Velvet Goldmine,'' Todd
Haynes' filmic paean to the glam-rock era of the early 1970s, leave
one with a sense of loss and longing not only for glitter but for
the future. The past's love affair with tomorrow is as dead as
Ziggy Stardust. Aliens aren't fabulous bisexuals with snow-white
tans and platform boots anymore; they're the body-snatching
creatures of ``The X-Files.'' Scully and Mulder's big-screen debut
wasn't subtitled ``Fight the Future'' for nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The future we imagined when John Glenn first went up 36 years
ago was so different from what we knew that we could never hope to
achieve it. Not by the millennium anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Our lives have changed radically since the heyday of the space
age, but not in the revolutionary way we had hoped. Even with an
iMac on your desk and a shiny silver Volkswagen in your garage,
you're not George Jetson.
</P>
<P>
   The future is now, but the song we are singing isn't David
Bowie's ``Starman.'' It's Peggy Lee's ``Is That All There Is?''

AUTHORS TELL TRANSPARENT TALE OF GHOSTLY ENCOUNTERS 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARTY RACINE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ It's transparently clear: Ghosts do exist.
</P>
<P>
   You might agree after experiencing enough voices, apparitions
and unexplained movement to spook Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   The mysteries inhabit another dimension within ``Transparent
Tales: An Attic Full of Texas Ghosts'' (Best of East Texas
Publishers, $24.95) by Allan Turner and Richard Stewart. The book
will be in stores in mid-November.
</P>
<P>
   These are not flights of imagination told around shadowy
campfires or family lore handed down to impressionable children.
Turner and Stewart are Houston Chronicle reporters, and
newspapermen are cool, dispassionate gatherers of fact. From files
amassed over the years they tracked and interviewed ghost-seers and
corroborated their stories as if they were covering a flood or
investigating a public official.
</P>
<P>
   A few, Turner says, admitted they made up stories just to get
into the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a preponderance of cases, Richard and I believe that
these events happened to them,'' Turner says.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were Texas Parks &AMP; Wildlife staffers who heard
footsteps in a historical San Antonio home, a museum librarian in
Angleton who reported that items were moved in an upstairs bedroom,
and an Amarillo social worker who saw ghosts at Texas A&AMP;M
University-West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Their encounters seem beyond rational explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not theologians, we are not philosophers, we are not
parapsychologists,'' Turner says. ``We're reporters. Are `ghosts'
the disembodied spirits of the dear departed? Frankly, I think so,
but I don't know. Some people allude to passages of the Bible, to
demonic presences.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could be sunspots. It could be a 17th-century man
encountering radio waves. In a hundred years there may be a
physical explanation for this stuff. For now, you've got to kind of
say, what's going on here?''
</P>
<P>
   Ghosts often appear when least expected. Many claimants, in
fact, had never believed in the supernatural.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being struck by lightning,'' Turner says.
</P>
<P>
   Sightings varied geographically.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you say that ghosts exist, then you have to say they exist
everywhere,'' says Turner. ``Whether or not they are perceived is a
matter of individual and cultural predilection. There is not a
house in New Orleans that is not haunted. Same as Galveston, with
the water, the tragedy of the Great Storm. We found Galveston
(Texas) to be very good ghost-hunting ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The reporters found Czech ghosts, Hispanic ghosts,
African-American ghosts. Then there is Turner's hometown of New
Braunfels, Texas, in what he calls the ``German belt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are so rational that even if ghosts were to come sit down
on your dining room table, you're going to have a logical
explanation for that. And if you tell your neighbor, they're going
to start talking about you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not find any German ghosts.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does Turner believe in ghosts?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm chagrined to admit it, but I would say I believe in ghosts
at this point. Now, I could be mad but probably not.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Turner and his wife, Sarah, bought a vacation
house in Galveston several blocks from the water in the old West
End. The two-story bungalow was built in 1909 and had wrap-around
porches and leaded-glass windows.
</P>
<P>
   They closed the deal on a Friday. Sarah and daughter Charlotte
were to spend that night at a Girl Scout camp-out, while Turner
would stay in the new house alone.
</P>
<P>
   He awoke at dawn, fully alert, he says. When he ran water in the
bathroom, the old pipes vibrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing back in the hallway with my hands on my hips
thinking, `Oh, no, how much is it going to cost to fix that?' This
went on for maybe 10 seconds, and literally the absolute nanosecond
that the pipe stopped, I heard a middle-aged woman's voice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning,'' Turner replied, naturally. The voice sounded
as if it were coming from about 10 feet away. It was there, and it
was not there.
</P>
<P>
   He charged over to the windows. It was 6:30 a.m. No one was in
the adjoining yard or on the street.
</P>
<P>
   There is a category of ghostly entities called stay-behinds,
those who so love a place that they just can't bear leaving. Turner
learned that his house was built by a tinsmith, Albert Fedder, and
his wife, Susie. He was in his early 40s, she in her late 30s, and
they had no children.
</P>
<P>
   Albert died in 1943 from a heart attack. Susie continued to live
in the house by herself until 1956, when she was 85.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to venture to guess,'' says Turner, ``I would say
that the voice I heard was the voice of this lady. She obviously
loved this house; nieces have testified as to how this was just a
joyous place.''
</P>
<P>
   One trigger for ghostly encounters seems to be a change of
ownership of a business or home. Over the next year, weed-trimmer
twine mysteriously appeared in an upstairs suitcase, an antique
clock on the fireplace mantel changed time and double pocket doors
in the hallway moved _ unseen _ without assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Turner found himself trying to communicate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how silly you can be until you're standing in
an empty house talking to the air,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then the woman's voice returned. Possibly. He was running water
in the bathroom when he detected a whispery ``Bye ... bye.'' But he
has to qualify that; children were making noise in the street;
water was running. Nothing out of the ordinary has happened since.
</P>
<P>
   But there remained a presence. Whenever the house creaked at
night, Turner would turn on the lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt completely ridiculous. It's the fear of the unknown,
because you don't know what you're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   So he attempted to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly we have a reality gap here,'' Turner told ``Susie.''
``Please don't scare the kid, and if you don't mind, make your
appearances during daylight hours.''
</P>
<P>
   It was about 10:30 at night when Turner called Stewart to ask if
he wanted to contribute to a ghost book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Stewart replied. ``Have I ever told you about Aunt
Alice?''
</P>
<P>
   What he related gave Turner the chills.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1969 Stewart was between his sophomore and
junior years at the University of Houston. He traveled to Spain,
where his father, like many Americans who worked in the oil
industry in Algeria, kept an apartment in Palma de Mallorca, an
island village in the Mediterranean. The flat was in a
Canadian-American enclave at the end of a street.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great place to be 20 years old. But somewhat spooky,
too. Late at night a big wind blew down from the mountains and
rattled open the glass doors of Stewart's bedroom, billowing the
sheer blue inner curtains into his face. So on the third night he
shut the doors and shoved his heavy wooden bed up against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get in bed, and I'm a big guy. I go to sleep and something's
tickling my nose, and I reach up to get it, and it's fabric; it's
those curtains. I jump out of bed, turn on the light and that bed
has moved three feet with me in it. That scared the bejesus out of
me. I never stayed in that room again.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, however, keep his valuables there in a nightstand
drawer. ``I'd walk past that room and that stuff would be on top of
that table. Never anything missing. I'd say, why did I drag that
out? I'd put it back in the drawer. Then a week or two later it'd
happen again. I never liked that room.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of teen-age girls in the neighborhood liked to play
with a Ouija board, seeking telepathic messages through its
alphabet and other symbols. One night Stewart and the girls were
doing the Ouija and it said ``burn, burn, burn.'' It then spewed
out some nasty things that embarrassed them all.
</P>
<P>
   The next night the girls' mother, a ``seer'' from Calgary,
Canada, and an Englishwoman were in the next apartment trying to
contact spirits. There was no answer until Stewart dropped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is anybody there?'' they asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.'' The Ouija spelled out A-L-I-C-E. Stewart's Aunt Alice
had died in a fire two years earlier. They were close; like him,
she had studied journalism at the University of Houston. As Stewart
would later do, his aunt had worked for the Houston Chronicle and
the Bay City Tribune. Ask the spirit its last name, Stewart
suggested. It spelled M-R-A-Z.
</P>
<P>
   ``And these ladies kind of look at this thing, and one of them
grabs a pointer and moves it around and says, `Well, sometimes it
messes up. We'll try it again.' I said, well, no; her last name was
Mraz. It spelled it right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ouija knew Alice's middle name, Helen, and gave nicknames
his aunt used.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went on from there to be almost like a conversation with
her. I could even think things, and the answer would come that made
sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, this is my mother's sister, not my dad's, and neither of
these women had ever been to Texas. How they would have known that
I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ouija transmitted a warning about ``Nona's blue lady.''
Nona, the Canadian's 7-year-old daughter, often complained that a
woman wearing blue would appear to her at night. ``You were with
someone very evil last night,'' the board told Stewart, presumably
relating to the spirit that had said ``burn, burn, burn.''
</P>
<P>
   About a year after returning from Spain, Stewart recounted the
story at a dinner party. A woman suggested that Aunt Alice and the
blue lady were the same, that as Alice struggled to escape a house
fire, in which she died from smoke inhalation, her psyche split in
half, a good one (Aunt Alice) and a bad one (the blue lady).
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember driving home after that party,'' Stewart says.
``One of those deals where you don't want to look in the mirror
because you're afraid you'll see Aunt Alice in the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or worse, two Aunt Alices.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in his apartment, Stewart for the first time noticed that
his room had the same sheer blue curtains he had in Spain. He went
to sleep and fell into a dream. He dreamed a woman was in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wake up and there is. She's wearing a blue gown. I push on
her, roll onto my back and she's standing at the foot of my bed,
laughing, and it isn't ha-ha-ha; it's this wanton laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see her very clearly. There was a good deal of light
coming in from the street. Then she disappeared like a mist. I
jumped and turned on the light.''
</P>
<P>
   He never saw the blue lady again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, 30 years later almost, I can just about persuade myself
that the whole thing in Houston was a dream, except that I could
swear that I woke up and saw her.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no explanation for the Ouija encounter. He and Turner and
Houston Chronicle computer columnist Dwight Silverman _ not the
likeliest trio of occultists _ tried to re-contact Aunt Alice on
the board. They got nowhere, Stewart says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe you have to be 20 years old and it has be with
an Englishwoman and a Canadian woman and it has to be in Spain.'' &QL;

IMPEACHMENT BECOMES A GALVANIZING ISSUE ON ELECTION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)   (EDs: ADDs quotes on Democratic ad blitz, other edits; filed in the
``w'' and ``p'' categories)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was being called the ``Seinfeld election,''
something about nothing, a midterm yawner void of any galvanizing
national issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the launching of a last-minute Republican advertising blitz
highlighting the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal changed all that. No
longer a sleeper, this election will set the stage for the
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, who is accused of lying
and using his power to cover up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Any way it goes, the congressional election will have a major
impact on the impeachment process. With hearings likely to begin a
few weeks after Tuesday's balloting, leaders of both political
parties say they'll be happy to either gain a few seats or not lose
too many.
</P>
<P>
   Republican gains would embolden GOP lawmakers in their conduct
of impeachment hearings. If the Democrats do well in races for the
House and Senate or lose only a few seats, ``the hearings will be
brief,'' said political scholar Thomas Mann of the Brookings
Institution, an independent Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrated by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the $10-million
television effort is aimed at 30 districts, many in the South and
rural areas where animosity to Clinton runs high. The goal:
Energize conservatives disappointed by GOP budget compromises two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, say the backfire potential is so high that
the ads and ensuing news coverage might help bring out their
voters. Late last week, the Democratic National Committee announced
a $1 million ad blitz of its own. The aim is to convince voters
that Republicans are scandal-obsessed while Democrats want to move
forward on issues such as education and reining in managed care
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very obvious Republicans have said we can't win on the
issues, therefore let's try to gin up our hard-right, narrow base
with attack ads,'' said DNC national chairman Roy Romer, the
governor of Colorado. ``They're obsessed with investigations. I'm
glad our party is obsessed with education.''
</P>
<P>
   The dueling ad campaigns ``open up a Pandora's box of
uncertainty,'' said Curtis Gans, president of the nonpartisan
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Before they
aired, he added, ``we were heading into a low-turnout election.''
Still, Gans estimated turnout in the range of 36-to-38 percent of
eligible voters, down from the 38.8 percent turnout in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While candidates on the home turf may be talking about abortion,
health care and other issues, the ads put impeachment on the
electoral map as perhaps the closest thing there is to a
galvanizing national issue.
</P>
<P>
   The party controlling the White House always faces an uphill
battle in midterm elections. The last time the president's party
did not loose seats was 1934, just as President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, a Democrat, was launching the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   All 435 House seats are up, but only 50 to 60 are considered
competitive. Many of those are taking place in 34 districts where
the incumbent is retiring, leaving an open seat. The open seats are
evenly split _ 17 belonged to Republicans and 17 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-four incumbents are in uncontested races. Another 240 are
expected to be re-elected. Republicans now control the House
228-206, with one independent who generally votes.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Democrats appeared gleeful that the 11 seats needed to
retake the House seemed within reach. Now they concede that
scenario is virtually impossible. Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee executive director Matt Angle predicted ``plus five or
minus five'' for the party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, predicted the Republicans would gain
between 10 and 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties will watch whether House votes last month for or
against the impeachment inquiry resolutions affect incumbents'
re-election bids.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four Senate seats are up for grabs. With Republicans in
control 55-45, Democrats are given virtually no chance of retaking
control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are unlikely to pick up the five needed to reach 60,
a number that would enable them to defeat Democratic filibusters
that can kill legislation. More probable is that the Republicans
will gain two to three seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gender is less of an issue this year than in 1992, dubbed ``the
year of the woman'' because of strong electoral gains by women.
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., elected in 1992, has been
entangled in scandals ever since. She looks to be a goner.
</P>
<P>
   In California, after a tumultuous struggle against Republican
challenger Matt Fong, incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer is ahead in the
polls. And in Washington state, self-proclaimed ``mom-in-tennis
shoes'' Sen. Patty Murray, another Democrat elected in 1992,
appears to be headed for a slim victory over Republican Rep. Linda
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other hot races:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Kentucky, the Senate seat vacated by retiring Sen. Wendell
H. Ford, a Democrat, is a tossup between Rep. Scotty Baesler, a
Democrat, and Republican Rep. Jim Bunning.
</P>
<P>
   _ In New York, the mudbath between Republican Sen. Alfonse M.
D'Amato and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles E. Schumer,
remains close. Most polls put Schumer slightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Wisconsin, it's too close to call between Democratic
incumbent Sen. Russ Feingold, and Republican Rep. Mark Neumann. One
late poll shows Neumann moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   _ In North Carolina, Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth is in a
tight race against trial attorney John Edwards. Faircloth's poll
numbers are slipping, making him one of the few vulnerable
incumbent Republicans this November.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Republicans outdistanced Democrats in campaign
fund-raising. Democratic Party national committees raised $106.9
million, a 40 percent increase over the last midterm election in
1994. But they have a debt of $11.1 million, much of it left over
from the 1996 campaign. Their Republican counterparts raised $184.6
million and have a debt of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also beat Democrats in the war for ``soft'' money,
contributions for party building and voter turnout that are not
subject to Federal Election Commission limitations. Soft money
mostly winds up financing not-to-subtle party television
commercials that endorse candidates without specifically soliciting
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took in $93.7 million in soft money, a 144 percent
increase over 1994. Democrats received $78.8 million, an 84 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   The secret of the GOP's success: Business contributions.
Business interests have given Republicans $262 million, according
to research by the non-partisan Center for Responsive Politics.
Business also gave Democrats $198 million.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the race, the election this year is less about winning
converts than it is about getting out loyal followers and hoping
opponents' supporters take the day off.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University,
compared it to the staunch loyalty of pickup truck drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not anything that will make a Chevy pickup driver
drive a Ford,'' he said. ``But dealers still have the task of
getting them to dealership to buy their products every few years.''

</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO is spending $28 million, mostly to elect Democrats.
Some $14 million of that is for an on-the-ground campaign involving
telephone banks, leaflets at factory gates, union meetings and 392
organizers agitating to get organized labor's vote in 75 races.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense was that politics had become completely
impersonal,'' said AFL-CIO political director Steven Rosenthal.
``We thought we could personalize it on the ground better than we
could on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Also within the $28 million is $7 million for television
advertising, most of it geared to issues such as saving Social
Security and reining in managed health care. In 1996, the AFL-CIO
put most of its massive $35 million war chest into television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor also is contributing $35 million to Democratic
candidates. But money alone may not do it for labor. The AFL-CIO
gave $40 million to Democrats in 1994, the year Republicans took
control of Congress in an election widely interpreted as a
rejection of Clinton's first two years in office.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, not only did the Republican voter turnout surge, but
the number of Democrats heading to the polls declined. (Overall in
midterm congressional elections, turnout has declined since 1966,
falling from 48.6 percent that year to 38.8 percent in 1994.)
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and their supporters also are concentrating on
turnout. Linder said the campaign committee committed $5 million to
a get-out-the-vote drive, with $300,000 of that targeted to
absentee balloting in California.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Coalition is spending $3.1 million to distribute
45 million copies of its ``non-partisan'' voter guide in churches,
advising supporters on candidates' views on issues such as abortion
and school prayer.
</P>
<P>
   The Campaign for Working Families, a conservative political
action committee, is spending about $3 million on more than 200
candidates and on promotions to boost voter turnout.

NEW BIOGRAPHY SHEDS LIGHT ON `MR. CIVIL RIGHTS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   School children do not memorize his words or sketch his
portrait. Holiday festivities do not honor his birthday with
parades or sermons. That he was once widely known as ``Mr. Civil
Rights'' is largely forgotten now as Thurgood Marshall has quickly
faded behind the curtain of history.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Williams aims to change that. The 44-year-old national
correspondent for The Washington Post has marshaled compelling
evidence that Thurgood Marshall is the most important figure in the
struggle for equal rights in 20th-century America.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall is far less well-known than the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr. or Malcolm X, who both were assassinated young and soon
canonized, but Marshall's accomplishments, in Williams' view,
outstrip those of the two other historic black leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for people to have a sense of heroes and how
they affect social change and shifts in power,'' Williams said in
an interview. ``Marshall is, to my mind, the personification of how
power in race relations and individual rights shifted in the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams argues Marshall's case in his compelling new biography,
``Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary'' (Times Books, 404
pages, $27.50). This is a full-blooded account of a remarkable man
with an outsized, multifaceted personality _ a driven crusader,
committed pathfinder, cantankerous dissenter and an unrestrained
raconteur who possessed prodigious appetites for bourbon, women,
tobacco and song.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall may not be the sort of antiseptic leader that seems the
ideal in these times of rigid political and moral correctness. But
there is nothing idealized about Marshall's accomplishments, which
are written into the law of the land as a result of his
barrier-busting work as the point-man attorney for the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. He won a
phenomenal 29 of the 32 cases he argued before the U.S. Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``Separate but equal'' schools were outlawed because of
Marshall's work in the landmark Brown vs. Board of Education case
in 1954 from Kansas. All-white primary elections were outlawed
because of Marshall's work in a 1944 case from Texas. Segregated
facilities in interstate travel were outlawed because of Marshall's
work in a 1946 case from Virginia. Restrictive real estate
covenants against blacks and Jews were outlawed because of
Marshall's work in a 1948 case from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   All this was accomplished by the time Marshall was 46, and
almost 15 years before he was named the first black justice on the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   As a young lawyer in Baltimore, Marshall had hoped to become a
local judge, though no blacks held that position. So being named to
the high court was the capstone of a lifetime's work in law, which
also had seen him become the first black on the U.S. Court of
Appeals and the first black solicitor general, the top attorney
arguing for the government.
</P>
<P>
   But as Williams persuasively illustrates, it was Marshall's work
on the high court that would, ironically, cost him much of his
hard-earned reputation. His ego was so wrapped up in being a
Supreme Court justice that Marshall hung on to the post for 24
years, long after he could render useful service.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall became an embittered and reclusive figure, beset by the
afflictions of old age, given to outlandish public comments,
castigated for his lazy work habits, one of two embattled liberals
on the high court as it took a hard right in the Reagan era.
</P>
<P>
   It was during Marshall's waning days that he sat down with a
young reporter for The Washington Post, who was hoping to write a
profile for the paper's magazine. Williams still can readily recall
how he ``felt like Dorothy going to see the Wizard'' as he trudged
up the Supreme Court's broad marble steps, passed through its
imposing columns, entered its hushed mahogany world where he
expected the justice to check him out.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Marshall embarked immediately on the interview, then
invited the surprised Williams back for another interview.
Interviews continued on a weekly basis for six months, as he came
to know Marshall well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he was a man in some distress,'' Williams recalled.
``I think Marshall was an emotionally depressed man who felt
forgotten and unappreciated and misunderstood. Often, he would tear
up when he tried to read some paper right in front of his face
because of advancing glaucoma. He also had to go to the bathroom
frequently, where he walked with difficulty, using his cane and
wearing support stockings. Yes, he was definitely an old man.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Marshall remained a wonderful storyteller. At first, I was
reluctant to argue with him because I did not want to piss him off.
But I pretty soon learned that Marshall still loved to debate, as
he always had.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was pleased with Williams' profile when it finally was
published, but the reporter's attempt to turn his material into a
book met with a stone wall from the subject as well as his family
and compatriots. Many seemed concerned about what a full-scale
examination of Marshall's life might reveal, perhaps to the
detriment of his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Williams persisted. He had already honed his book-writing skills
with his best-selling companion volume to the civil rights series
on television, ``Eyes on the Prize.'' But Williams soon found
himself riddled with doubts as he confronted the years of work and
other demands of writing a biography of such a historic figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The times I thought about quitting were when I considered how
much material there was and how rich a story it was,'' Williams
remembered. ``Then my question was: Can I actually do this? I had
always thought my journalistic skills could get me through things,
but suddenly I found myself set adrift in an ocean of information,
much of it legalistic, and with characters from all the way back to
before the turn of the century.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' fascinating account of Marshall's life is particularly
strong in portraying his roots, the effects of his middle-class
upbringing in a racially mixed Baltimore neighborhood, and a strong
mother so intent on having her two sons succeed that she pawned her
engagement and wedding rings in order for Thurgood to enroll in law
school at all-black Howard University in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall helped pay for his education by working as a railroad
porter and as a waiter at an all-white country club on Chesapeake
Bay, jobs also held at various times by his father, who only had a
fourth-grade education.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Marshall's rise also owed much to the intervention of fate
and key people at crucial moments in his life. Marshall was a
hell-raising frat boy as an undergraduate until a truck accident
cost him one testicle and imparted new seriousness to his life _
this at a time when he increasingly came under the activist
influence of fellow student Langston Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What captured my mind about Marshall,'' Williams said, ``was
sensing how this character grew. This was not somebody who was
obviously marked a great man from the time he was a baby. He lived
in circumscribed circumstances as a child, and only much later
started to flower.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was at the peak of his powers in the 1940s and 1950s, a
relentless force for change as the NAACP's crusading attorney. He
fearlessly carried the cause to hostile Southern towns, despite
frequent threats and attempts at intimidation, including a close
encounter with death in a car where he was surrounded by angry
white men taking him down a dark country lane in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall's belief in the crucial importance of legal change kept
him motivated, as did his bedrock sense that integration was the
essential ingredient in achieving racial equality.
</P>
<P>
   So when much younger black leaders came to challenge those
assumptions with sit-ins or marches in the streets or cries of
``Black power!'' Marshall was not sympathetic. Until his death in
1993 at the age of 84, Marshall was convinced that his way of
challenging the law was the best way to affect social change.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams emphasized, ``This was an extraordinarily willful
man who had a strong, clear vision of what he wanted done, and he
went after it and he did it.''

STIPE SAYS `UP' SENDING R.E.M. IN NEW DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   R.E.M.'s new album, ``Up,'' could have been titled ``Upside
Down'' or ``Inside Out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're hearing on this record is the sound of a band
mutating faster than it should be,'' lead singer Michael Stipe said
in a phone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little like going from chrysalis to butterfly, but
skipping a few steps in between.''
</P>
<P>
   Work on ``Up,'' released this week on Warner Bros. Records, was
under way last fall when original drummer Bill Berry suddenly quit
the group that Stipe described as a ``four-cornered powerhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd been a four-piece for longer than most bands. We'd been
together for 17 years. And to have one guy leave really upset the
balance,'' Stipe said.
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who had also served as background singer, songwriter and
occasionally bassist, had his reasons for leaving the group he had
helped found in 1980 in Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   While on tour, Berry had suffered a life-threatening fever in
Germany in 1989 and a brain hemorrhage in Switzerland in 1995.
Unlike the others in the band, Berry didn't like being away from
the comforts of home.
</P>
<P>
   Devastated by his departure, Stipe, bassist Mike Mills and
guitarist Peter Buck, who lives in Seattle with his wife and twin
daughters, nevertheless continued to work on R.E.M.'s 11th studio
album with a disorienting sense of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were embarking on a very experimental record as a
three-piece for the first time ever, and without one of our core
songwriters and core group members present,'' Stipe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, it really tore us apart. But it brought us back
together in the end. I don't think we've ever been closer as
working musicians and as friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Known for its uncompromising integrity and lyrical brilliance,
R.E.M. had begun to experiment in the studio months before Berry
announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 40-odd song tracks recorded on demo tapes that had no
drums, that were all done with drum machines and very little
guitar,'' Stipe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the songs had synthesizers and keyboards and string
patches. So it was an experimental record to begin with,'' Stipe
said. ``It became even more so after Bill left and the dynamic of
our entire working lives completely changed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the studio, Stipe, Buck and Mills played musical chairs,
switching instruments and bringing in various musical guests.
Playing drums were Joey Waronker (of Beck's band) and Barrett
Martin (of Screaming Trees and co-founder with Buck of Seattle
group Tuatara).
</P>
<P>
   Providing a lot of guidance was co-producer Pat McCarthy, who
had engineered 1996's ``New Adventures in Hi-Fi'' and 1994's
``Monster.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What Pat brought to the album is what any great producer
brings to a project,'' Stipe said. ``He was able to provide an
objective outside opinion, yet still be in the creative swirl.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy and the group worked on the album for months, recording
in Seattle, San Francisco, New York and Athens, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonically, Peter and Mike were responding to our last record,
`New Adventures in Hi-Fi,' which was very much a live,
in-the-studio album,'' Stipe said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they felt like they had done the guitar-drum-bass
thing as well as they could. And they kind of naturally went off in
a different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Stipe regards ``New Adventures in Hi-Fi'' as R.E.M.'s best
album. ``It was very much an album with a rock-group feel, and it's
a record that we're all really proud of,'' Stipe said.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge was to make ``Up,'' which is available in a
limited-edition package including a 48-page booklet, an even better
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hold `New Adventures in Hi-Fi' in such high esteem,'' Stipe
said. ``I really wanted to do as good as or better than that
record, and I feel like I accomplished that. I'm very, very proud
of the new record. I think, in a way, the songs are smarter than I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   Stipe packed such songs as ``Lotus,'' ``Hope'' and the album's
first single, ``Daysleeper,'' with power and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted the emotions and the feeling of the songs to be as
extreme as possible,'' he said. ``If they were sad songs, I wanted
them to be really sad. And if they were hopeful songs, I wanted
them to make you jump up and grab somebody and shake them. I just
wanted the record to be direct.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, R.E.M. made a rare two-night appearance on ``The Late
Show With David Letterman.'' Last night, MTV aired an hourlong
concert taped last week at New York's Bowery Ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   The group is also scheduled to appear next month on ``Late Night
With Conan O'Brien'' and ``Rosie O'Donnell'' and in January on
``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   In mid-October, R.E.M. performed with Neil Young at the annual
Bridge School benefit in the Bay area. Stipe, Mills and Buck were
joined by Seattle musicians Scott McCaughey of the Young Fresh
Fellows and the Minus 5 and Ken Stringfellow of the Posies.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey (who has toured with R.E.M.) and Stringfellow are also
doing promotional shows with the band this week in England and in
early November on the European continent.
</P>
<P>
   But aside from random performances, R.E.M. has decided not to
tour in support of ``Up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us felt like tying ourselves up for a year on the
road,'' Stipe said. ``And it doesn't seem like the most opportune
time to see the band. I don't think we would have had all pistons
firing.''

SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARENA IS BROADENED, BINDING EMPLOYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Egregious sexual harassment usually brings titters from those
who hear about it. It's easy to recognize and condemn someone for
obviously offensive sexual remarks, or blatant unwelcomed sexual
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But most sexual harassment isn't so blatant, and figuring out
whether it has taken place and an employer should be liable for it
isn't so easy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, is it sexual harassment when employees are sitting
around talking about the Starr Report and making jokes about
cigars?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, ``It depends.''
</P>
<P>
   But two recent rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court have helped
clarify the responsibilities of employers in sexual harassment
cases. They also make it more imperative than ever for companies to
understand the nuances of sexual harassment in the workplace, said
Kathy Cooper Franklin, an attorney with Littler Mendelson in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In a case involving Burlington Industries Inc., for example, an
employee quit her job after enduring numerous offensive remarks and
gestures from her supervisor. Although she never complained about
the harassment, and she was never fired or demoted, the Court still
held that she had a right to sue her employer.
</P>
<P>
   An employer can be held liable for a supervisor's harassing
actions even if the employee who was harassed didn't suffer any
actual negative work consequences, said Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge change in the law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Burlington Industries case, the court held that even
though the employee wasn't fired or demoted, the offensive remarks
and gestures could be construed as threats to deny the employee
tangible job benefits, such as a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   In a second case involving the city of Boca Raton, Fla., the
Court ruled that an employer can be liable for the actions of one
of its supervisors, even if it never knew about the supervisor's
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boca Raton case, a lifeguard sued the city for failing to
protect her from lewd remarks and offensive touching by her
supervisors. The lifeguard never complained, but finally quit.
</P>
<P>
   An appeals court found the city was not liable, but the Supreme
Court reversed that decision, Franklin said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two cases actually expand liability for employers,
they also make it more clear how companies can protect themselves
and their employees against such claims, she said.
</P>
<P>
   First, a company has to have a solid harassment policy, and the
policy has to be distributed, she said. They also have to have a
clear, anti-retaliation policy so employees won't be afraid to come
forward with allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have policies, but they're stuck in a
supervisor's manual somewhere and employees never get to see them,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Next, companies need to invest in some kind of training to help
employers and supervisors understand harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Training is the only way to get this problem to stop,'' she
said. And if a company gets sued, it's ``also been a company's
ticket to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, companies need to respond quickly and effectively to
investigate complaints, she said.
</P>
<P>
   All these actions will help reduce the incidence of harassment
at work. They also put a company in much better shape if it has to
defend itself in a sexual harassment case, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sexual harassment suits can be very expensive, she said. M&AMP;M
candies cost one company $3.7 million, when an employee sued
because her supervisor made a game of dropping M&AMP;M's into her
breast pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, such suits come down to the judgment of ordinary
people, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is we don't get to the U.S. Supreme
Court with most cases,'' she said. ``We get to juries.''
</P>
<P>
   Juries have decided that even single remarks can constitute
severe harassment, she said. It depends on the context.
</P>
<P>
   One reason sexual harassment is difficult to eliminate is that
it encompasses such a wide range of behavior. At one end of the
spectrum are socially acceptable actions, such as hugging or
flirting. When repeated and unwelcomed, they can constitute
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are severe behaviors, such as
rape or vulgar remarks, that only have to happen once to constitute
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   And although many people think of men as the the chief culprits
in sexual harassment cases, it's not always true, she said. ``Women
can be harassers just as much as men.''

PATRIARCH OF SOCIOLOGY SEES HIS INSIGHTS BECOME JUST WHAT EVERYONE
KNOWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PATRICIA COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Bloomington airport had the feel of a dinky
Greyhound bus station in 1978 when Robert K. Merton arrived to
deliver a lecture at Indiana University. So Tom Gieryn, who had
studied the sociology of science with Merton, could wait outside
when his guest stepped off the plane. As they stood catching up by
the chain link fence, they could hear the puddle jumper Merton had
flown in on groan to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `My bag is still on the plane,' '' Gieryn remembers.
Don't worry, Gieryn assured him; after all, how could he have
noticed for certain that the baggage handlers hadn't carried off
his suitcase? But Merton was insistent. A few moments later, the
plane began rolling forward. In an instant, the rangy Merton
bounded past the gate, across the tarmac and onto the runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walks out in front of this plane that is beginning to
move,'' Gieryn said. ``I was scared that he was going to die.''
Confronted by the formidable Robert Merton, however, there wasn't
much choice. The plane stopped. ``He insisted they open it up,''
Gieryn continued, ``and sure enough, the bag was in there.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of Robert Merton's wayward suitcase has a lot in
common with the story of his career as one of the most influential
sociologists, if not one of the most influential theorists, in
America: The supreme self-confidence, the exacting attention to
detail, the knack for being right.
</P>
<P>
   Even if most people haven't heard of Robert Merton, they have
probably heard of his ideas. He coined the phrase ``self-fulfilling
prophecy'' and developed the idea of ``role models.'' He invented
the focus group interview, which has turned into the bedside tool
of every political consultant and advertising executive. He formed
a theory of ``deviant behavior,'' explaining why people broke the
rules when they couldn't achieve success playing by them.
</P>
<P>
   If those ideas have seeped into daily conversation, dozens of
other, less familiar ones have helped lay the foundations of modern
sociology and are still invoked in today's heated battles over the
nature of scientific truth. Indeed, before Robert Merton, there was
no sociology of science. Scientists were considered a breed apart,
singular geniuses who didn't conform to normal rules. But Merton
treated the scientific profession like any other social entity,
pulling it apart like a house made of Legos to figure out how
knowledge is produced and how scientists behave. In 1942, he laid
out the ``ethos of science'' and single-handedly founded a new
field, an achievement that contributed to his becoming the first
sociologist to win a National Medal of Science in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Merton works mostly out of his Riverside Drive
apartment. His narrow, overstuffed office is barely three paces
from wall to desk. Rows of black and white photographs _ of Freud,
of his first publisher, Alfred Knopf, of his former neighbor the
artist Jacques Lipschitz _ solemnly gaze out over greetings from
some of his nine grandchildren and his Mac computer. At 88,
Merton's face has grown thinner and his jawline juts out sharply
against his slender neck; his hands have an ever-so-slight tremor.
But he is still a lanky six feet with a patrician bearing and a
passion for conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past six decades, he has delved into everything from
the workings of a biracial public housing project to the
availability of baby-sitters in a New Jersey town of shipbuilders
to Kate Smith's skill at selling war bonds. All the time he was on
the lookout for the repeating threads, the patterns that could
illuminate how society operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objects are trivial,'' he explains, sitting erect at his
desk in a pressed checked shirt, argyle socks and polished black
shoes. But they offer what he calls ``strategic research sites,''
like using fruit flies to figure out the mysteries of heredity. The
example of a successfully integrated community was used in Kenneth
Clark's Supreme Court brief for the Brown vs. Board of Education
case; the surfeit of babysitters illustrated how trust develops in
a close-knit neighborhood; the war bond drive showed how telling
people you're close to a goal encourages them to give more.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. Merton taught sociologists to think about
the world in a different way _ not to focus on piddling minutiae or
to ponder some grand theory-of-everything, but to aim for the
``middle range.'' No one really cares, for example, when a
particular Harry met a particular Sally; and it is impossible to
devise a theory about when every Harry met every Sally; but one
might be able to figure out under what conditions some Harrys met
some Sallys, and then draw conclusions about their socio-economic
status or marriage and birth rates.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes Merton, then, is a remarkable ability not
only to identify a problem, puzzle out the research method and make
sense of the significant details, but also to articulate it all
with literary grace. As Eugene Garfield, an information scientist,
has written: ``So much of what he says is so beautifully obvious _
so transparently true _ that one can't imagine why no one else has
bothered to point it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Cole, a former student who is now the provost and dean
of faculties at Columbia University, said, ``If there were a Nobel
Prize in sociology, there would be no question that he would have
gotten it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, his son, Robert C., won the Nobel Prize in economics
last year. (More recently, the younger Merton _ who was introduced
to the stock market along with baseball by his father _ has been in
the press again as a founder of the notorious Long-Term Capital
Management hedge fund, which nearly collapsed with multi-billion
dollar losses.)
</P>
<P>
   The ``father of the economist'' (as he frequently signs himself)
is also the father of two daughters, Vanessa, an associate dean at
Pace University Law School, and Stephanie, an automobile safety
activist. They grew up with as many as 25 cats in the Westchester
town, Hastings-on-Hudson, that was populated by wire-and-cable
company employees and a handful of Nobel laureates.
</P>
<P>
   ``File cabinets and file cabinets filled with 3-by-5 and 4-by-6
cards, neatly typed,'' Robert C. says of his childhood home,
``endless files of them.'' Aside from research, they have enabled
the obsessively fastidious Merton to produce obscure articles with
the easy flourish of a nightclub conjurer. And like a magician who
graciously presents a patron with a spontaneously produced bouquet
of flowers, he sends colleagues copies of this or that story,
stamped with a kelly green finger pointing out where to read.
</P>
<P>
   Merton's vast collection of books now fills six libraries,
including the ones in the Upper West Side and Easthampton homes
that he shares with his second wife, the sociologist Harriet
Zuckerman, a former graduate student of his whom he has been with
since the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. is particularly close with his father. They have
talked at least once a day for more than 30 years. Still, he
admits: ``It wasn't always easy to have someone of his talent and
caliber around; to be surrounded by Pulitzer Prize winners and
laureates. It's nice, but it's a high bar.''

 NEW YORK: high bar.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One thing his father taught him, says Robert, is that a student
of people and science had to be ``sort of distancing.'' It is a
stance of reserve that the elder Merton has maintained throughout
his life. He rarely grants interviews; for a 1961 profile in The
New Yorker, he first demanded the writer take his course in
sociology. In 1982, 10 years after an operation for throat cancer,
he issued a ``Self-Emancipation Proclamation'': ``I hereby declare
that I shall not again agree to write, revise or edit a book;
deliver a public lecture; contribute to a symposium . . . '' and so
on for a page.
</P>
<P>
   Still, someone who has so intently studied the development of
other people's reputations is bound to develop an exquisite
sensitivity toward his own. For this article, there were extended
negotiations over an interview. All the while, he was sending over
packets of articles and books with the dependable green finger
insistently pointing the way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there may be better pointers to his character. Merton has
proposed the ``self-exemplifying character'' of the sociology of
science _ how the field itself may exhibit the same traits or
patterns as the subject it's studying. Perhaps the same can be said
of Merton. If so, then his various theories may provide a useful
road map to his own unusual life.
</P>
<P>
   Consider his work on the word ``serendipity.'' (He just this
year agreed to publish a 400-page manuscript on the word that he
collaborated on 41 years ago.) ``My coming upon `serendipity' was
itself an instance of serendipity,'' he has said.
</P>
<P>
   Serendipity has functioned as a silent partner in his life in
other ways as well. ``My life of learning has been largely shaped
by a long series of chance encounters and consequential choices,''
he has written. Even the name ``Robert K. Merton'' was something of
an accident. Born above his father's milk-butter-and-egg shop on
Philadelphia's rundown south side, this son of Jewish immigrants
was named Meyer R. Schkolnick. He aspired to be a made-in-America
magician, and so, in the style of that generation of assimilating
immigrants, called himself Robert K. Merlin at the age of 14. But
his next-door neighbor and future brother-in-law, Charles Hopkins,
advised him to consider something a bit less hackneyed; the ``l''
transmuted into a ``t''.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, a self-taught philosophical anarchist, pushed him to
supplement his education at the Carnegie Library, in the last six
rows of the Academy of Music, and at the Philadelphia Museum of
Art. Later, on a scholarship at Temple University, he wandered by
chance into a sociology class. Soon he was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   It was at Columbia University, his academic home since 1941,
that Merton began his ``improbable collaboration'' with Paul
Lazarsfeld. For years, the sociology department there was so riven
that it couldn't agree on whom to hire. Finally, the department
added two men _ Merton, the theorist, and Lazarsfeld, the
empiricist. An unplanned excursion to study a radio show began
their lifelong friendship and a professional partnership that gave
sociology a scientific edge. (The failure to use research to test
theory is one of the reasons Merton complains about focus group
research as ``being mercilessly misused.'' )
</P>
<P>
   Then there is his work on role models. Merton had his own series
of mentors: Houdini and Hopkins, in whom he found a ``surrogate
father'' after he was confronted by his own father's indifference;
his teachers at Temple, and in graduate school at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   More important, though, is how Merton himself has been the
classic role model, mentoring hundreds of students.
</P>
<P>
   Gieryn was one of the research assistants who inhaled the fusty
smell of aging books and were rationed a small clearing in Merton's
large Columbia office. They would fetch his Bulgarian pipe tobacco,
and later the candy mixture that a local shop invented especially
for him, or his single-malt scotch (Glendronach is a favorite). In
return, he would shepherd their research, help them publish and
subject them to his famously ferocious editing.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Cole remembers that when he misused ``stipend'' in a
paper, he received in return a six-page memorandum, single-spaced,
on the history of the word. (Origins are one of Merton's
compulsions: A letter to a friend on the origin of an aphorism
attributed to Isaac Newton _ ``If I have seen farther it is because
I have stood on the shoulders of giants'' _ ended up as a 290-page
book and earned him a footnote in ``Bartlett's Familiar
Quotations.'')
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is one of the four scientific norms, ``organized
skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Merton made his own reputation, in part, by taking on
sociology's sacred cows.
</P>
<P>
   And in the last couple of decades, he has found his own
pioneering work to be subjected to skeptical scrutiny. While Merton
studied scientists' systems of rewards and credit, a new generation
of sociologists began to shift the focus to knowledge itself,
questioning accepted definitions of truth. This school argues that
scientists don't discover truth, they construct it. (At one time,
for instance, it was a scientific fact that the earth was flat.)
Meanwhile, the field was changing in other ways as well. The new
sociologists started hanging out in laboratories and found many
scientists were failing to live up to the noble ethos Merton had
laid out.
</P>
<P>
   Merton disdains the bitter warring between the two schools.
Pressed, he does say that ``it is a vast misunderstanding of the
norms of science to imply that they are unchanging, as though I had
promulgated the four commandments as permanently etched in stone.''
He cites the recent partnerships between universities and
biotechnology companies as just one example of a development that
has the potential to undermine the practice of the free exchange of
scientific knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he maintains that ``the founding fathers are honored not
by zealous repetition.'' Gieryn, who has himself left the Mertonian
fold, insists: ``If his views were still unquestioned, that would
violate every Mertonian assumption of science. It would mean we're
dogmatic. We practice organized skepticism at every meeting when we
trash Merton _ and it was his idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as even Gieryn concedes, skepticism has its costs. The
sociology of science has lost some of the theoretical richness it
had during Merton's heyday. The post-modern reflex to question
whether anything can be known for sure has created an atmosphere of
doubt, replacing the fledgling field's sense of hopeful possibility
and self-confidence. The kind of self-confidence that enables a
scholar to have faith that he can distinguish fact from falsehood,
to believe his work can make a difference, or to walk in front of a
moving plane.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Hey, want to get some cake?'' William Gelman
whispered to a blonde who caught his eye at an evening of Bible
readings the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, another young woman, a brunette passing in a haze of
perfume, wriggled past Gelman to take a seat. ``Excuse me,'' she
said. Gelman, an entrepreneur in his 30s, dressed unassumingly in
khakis and a dark sweater, looked the brunette up and down; swirled
his finger, making note of her long brown curls, and then turned
back to the blonde. ``Or we can just go outside now and talk,'' he
offered.
</P>
<P>
   The blonde declined and walked on through the standing-room-only
crowd at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun on East 85th Street. But
Gelman didn't seem to mind. There were plenty of other fish in the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   That night, like every Tuesday evening, hundreds of single men
and women in their 20s and 30s had gathered for an hour and 15
minutes of Bible readings and discussions, and then for another
hour and a half of a ravenous singles scene. Around 9 p.m., the
meet-and-greet spills from an auditorium, where participants have
shared cake, soda and business cards, onto the street and into the
bars of the Upper East Side. Some simply skip the religious talk
and show up for the socializing.
</P>
<P>
   The cake is cut from one of several cakes presented each week to
couples who have met and then gotten engaged at the gatherings by
Rebbetzin Esther Jungreis, the evening's organizer. She is the
widow of a rabbi and the founder of Hineni, a Jewish outreach group
that promotes the faith among young Jews, often more secular than
observant but overwhelmingly single. A latter-day Dolly Levi, she
lives to ``make a match,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dara Wechsler, a 22-year-old teacher from Little Neck who
attends the Hineni evenings regularly, put it more directly. ``It's
a meat market,'' she said. ``Where else do we learn about how to be
a moral, ethical person while meeting cute guys?''
</P>
<P>
   Across the city, religious leaders, both Christians and Jews,
say they have noticed the most unlikely phenomenon: Bible-oriented
social groups have become popular singles scenes, in a late-century
reinvention of the traditional church social. Groups of 20- and
30-somethings are meeting for discussions of ethical issues and
Bible stories, often mid-week rather than on Saturdays or Sundays,
with the intent, sometimes more covert than expressed, of finding a
mate.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months one group has held parties at Rebar, a trendy
Chelsea disco, and at Doubles, a private club in the basement of
the Sherry-Netherland Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Religious leaders from nearly a dozen churches and synagogues in
Manhattan said that groups for young singles have grown
significantly in the past two years, while attendance at retirees
and parents' groups is flat.
</P>
<P>
   Focus, a group at the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church for
people in their 20s and 30s, mostly single, has doubled to 125
members in the last year, said the Rev. Dr. Greg Cootsona, an
associate minister. Focus holds a Super Bowl party, winter ski
trips, Broadway nights and a Christmas cider sing.
</P>
<P>
   Hineni, which had 500 members two years ago, now has about
2,000, and it has included a number of offspring of prominent
Jewish families, like Steven Perelman (whose father, Ronald
Perelman, is the chief of the Revlon empire), Charles de Gunzburg
(whose mother was a Bronfman) and Alison Cayne Schneider (whose
father, James Cayne, is the chief executive of Bear, Stearns).
</P>
<P>
   ``The new church social is kind of hot right now,'' said Wade
Clark Roof, a professor of religion and society at the University
of California at Santa Barbara, who is studying the religious life
of Generation X.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jay Leno has noticed the trend. During his ``Tonight'' show
monologue last Monday, he cited churches as the new singles bars
and joked: ``What kind of pickup lines are guys going to start
using in church? `Hey, let me guess _ your name's Grace because
you're really amazing'?''
</P>
<P>
   The church social has come a long way from its origins as a
source of comfort to weary prairie settlers, as portrayed in Laura
Ingalls Wilder's ``Little House'' series, where the dusty and
lonely of heart, circa 1881, would meet at ``the church sociable.''
</P>
<P>
   And the convention has grown from the gatherings held after
Sunday services at New England churches, where single folk were
relegated to a picnic table of their own heaped with potato salad
and casseroles.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Fingal, a model who was attending an inspirational
lecture at Marble Collegiate Church on Fifth Avenue the other
evening, heard her own sort of pick-up line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you joining the Connection?'' asked Brian Robinson, 32,
who works in advertising. He was referring to the church's group
for single people between 20 and 35, the Marble Connection. It
sponsors hikes, dances, and Thursday-night chicken dinners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure,'' replied Ms. Fingal, a newcomer to New York.
She said that whenever she moves to a new city, ``I join a gym and
find a church.'' She was checking out Marble Collegiate, the church
where the Rev. Dr. Norman Vincent Peale preached and where, more
recently, Donald Trump met Marla Maples.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not a ministry of nerds full of Lisa Loopners and
Todd,'' said the Rev. Kimberleigh Jordan, head of young-adult
ministries at the church. She was referring to the socially
hopeless characters on ``Saturday Night Live'' played by Gilda
Radner and Bill Murray. ``Not that they're not welcome,'' she
quickly added, ``but our folks are really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   She stressed that the Marble Connection not be called a singles
group, to distance it from overtones of a meat market. ``We've
taken the word singles out of most of our literature,'' she said.
``People do end up dating, but there's no pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, who has dated several women he met through the Marble
Connection, said: ``You get rid of all the status stuff here. If
you're making $200 grand, that's nice, but it wouldn't be the first
thing you'd talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Callan, a freelance writer and editor in her 30s,
recalled that during one of her first visits to the Connection,
people played word games designed to reveal personal traits. ``I
couldn't believe I was doing this,'' she said. ``I was talking
about personal things with people I didn't even know. It became
some sort of an icebreaker.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fingal, the model, said that she was looking to a church for
spiritual grounding and a quiet space to think, rather than to find
a boyfriend. But her friend Jannette Clemenceau, who had
accompanied her to the lecture, was more specific about her
interest in the Connection. ``I want to meet a man,'' she said,
adding that bars and clubs held no interest for her. ``I want my
partners to have the same spiritual values as me. When you're here,
you're open. You're more able to connect to someone who is also
trying to connect to a higher power.''
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments are widely echoed. ``I don't want to meet a man
walking around with a cell phone in a bar,'' said Avigail David, a
25-year-old student who was attending a Hineni evening. Her theory
was that any man who'd show up for lectures on ethics and the
Biblical perspective on the fear of commitment made a good
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Clergymen, sociologists and other researchers say that much of
the appeal of the new church social _ defined broadly as any
gathering outside conventional rites of worship, often by small
groups meeting on week days _ is generational, appealing to the
many people in their 20s and 30s who grew up without formal
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, people have found their way back to organized
religion after marrying and starting families, often so that their
children can get a spiritual education. But members of Generation
X, who grew up in the 1970s and '80s with no religious affiliation,
are venturing back before marriage and parenthood. Their port of
entry is often a social group, rather than a worship service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of people who are not returning to church, but
they are looking for a first encounter _ there's a sense where they
grew up completely disconnected,'' said the Rev. Dr. James Wind,
the president of the Alban Institute in Bethesda, Md, a
nondenominational research organization specializing in religion.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Brenda Husson, the rector at St. James' Episcopal
Church on Madison Avenue, said: ``The numbers are amazing. We are
getting lots and lots of newcomers in their 20s and 30s.'' She
attributed the influx to a seeking of spirituality and a longing
for community. Her parish's group for single people in their 20s
and 30s, the St. Jamesians, engages in Bible discussions but also
holds parties, dinners and trips.
</P>
<P>
   For newcomers with few previous religious ties, the mixing of
denominations, a feature of many social groups, is not an obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   Many Protestants attended a black-tie charity dance at Doubles
last spring sponsored by the junior wing of the Inner-City
Scholarship Fund, which raises money for Roman Catholic schools in
New York. At Marble Collegiate, which is affiliated with the
Reformed Church in America, Christians of many denominations
participate in the Marble Connection.
</P>
<P>
   An exception, however, is Judaism, which has long emphasized
marrying within the faith _ and in some quarters, concern is being
expressed since many Reformed and Conservative Jews have married
non-Jews. At Hineni, the whole point to the Tuesday night social is
to foster marriages between Jews. Rabbi Joshua Lookstein, an
assistant rabbi at Congregation Kehilath Jeshurun, which lets
Hineni use its synagogue but has no affiliation with the group,
said the encouragement of Jewish marriages is ``a survival
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much a Biblical commandment as it is a
sociological necessity,'' he said. ``If both parents are not
Jewish, the likelihood that that child will grow up with any kind
of significant Jewish identity is slim at best.''
</P>
<P>
   At the cocktail party following one Hineni evening, Lori Mark, a
34-year-old wine distributor, felt the same way. ``Jews should
marry Jews,'' she said to Doug Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But Miller, 35, a money manager, disagreed. ``Hey, you got to
get love where you can,'' he said with a shrug. Why was he
attending a Jewish singles party more crowded than a hot downtown
club? ``To find a woman, to be honest,'' he said. ``You know, I
never have any luck in bars.''
</P>
<P>
   A few nights later, young members of the Inner-City Scholarship
Fund gathered at Rebar. The pulsing music was so loud that the sea
of 25-year-olds in navy suits could hardly hear one another and
resorted to scribbling notes.
</P>
<P>
   Graeme Williamson, 26, a bond analyst for Lehman Brothers, said
he joined the group after a friend told him it would be a good way
to meet women. A member of the party-planning committee, he had
come up with the idea of holding a party at Rebar, on the
assumption that newcomers would attend. In fact, a throng of nearly
200 turned up, paying $35 each. William Goodloe, director of the
group, which was founded by Cardinal Terence Cooke in 1971, doubted
that most were Catholic.

<P>
   Williamson caught sight of an attractive woman he didn't know
just as she was leaving, and he approached her. At a fund-raiser
like this, ``I felt it's easier to talk to people,'' he said later.
``I felt I can be myself. We exchanged business cards.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to name the woman, for fear of jinxing the brand-new
relationship. ``We've actually gone out on one date,'' he said.
``We're still talking.''

PROSPERITY MAY CARRY D'AMATO YET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Advance for Sunday)   use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alfonse D'Amato is the Howard Stern of the US Senate,
a coarse, abrasive, in-your-face New Yawky character whose
behavior, and personality, I find it hard to believe, could survive
the election process in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   For 18 years, the self-proclaimed ``Senator Pothole'' bragged of
his ability to commandeer pork in D.C. and drag it back home. And
in crude, caveman-ish fashion, he did a lot of that. He also has a
habit of surviving close elections, despite a style resembling that
of the most offensive taxi cab operator who ever hijacked an
out-of-towner at La Guardia.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato won by an eyelash six years ago against a docile
Democrat, Robert Abrams, who could not adapt to the kind of
scorched-earth campaign it takes to win in New York. D'Amato is now
swallowing some of the same kind of napalm he is fond of spraying,
and US Representative Charles Schumer, who's been in the House as
long as D'Amato's been in the Senate, has edged ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked George Mitchell what pleasures he anticipated on
retiring from the Senate: ``Not having to listen to Al D'Amato''
was the first thing off Mitchell's lips. The distinctive voice of
the grim D'Amato can shift from a groan to a wheeze faster than the
drop of an insult. If there were a Junkyard Dog Award for the
Senate's nastiest campaigner, Senator Pothole would have retired
the trophy by now.
</P>
<P>
   But as a scrappy politico willing to go to the wall, over the
wall, through the wall, even if that wall is the wall of good
taste, he has no equal. So Schumer has plowed $13 million into a
yearlong, take-no-prisoners campaign of his own that may still fall
short of toppling the Senate's most abrasive individual.
</P>
<P>
   By trumpeting his push for more federal money for breast cancer,
and his knuckling Swiss banks for $1.25 billion for Holocaust
survivors, D'Amato hoped to submerge his absurdly high negative
ratings. A New York Times/CBS poll gave D'Amato 27 percent
favorablity to 36 percent unfavorability; Schumer's numbers were 22
favorable, 18 unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay State handwringers who decried the interruptions and
talking-over-the-other-guy of the Cellucci-Harshbarger debate would
have fainted in front of their TV sets during the last
D'Amato-Schumer slugfest. ``Gentlemen, gentlemen _ this is getting
out of hand,'' said moderator Gabe Pressman, referee of many an
11th-hour Manhattan television set-to.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Jewish voters, D'Amato defamed Schumer with a
Yiddish vulgarism, ``putzhead.'' When word got out, D'Amato first
issued a stammering denial, then was forced to admit the slur, and
his sputtering eventual admission was appropriated into a Schumer
campaign commercial. ``D'Amato _ too many lies for too long,'' or,
``After 18 years, when will the hypocrisy stop?'' are taglines for
Schumer TV spots. And D'Amato played right into that.
</P>
<P>
   The senator also called US Representative Jerrold Nadler ``Jerry
Waddler'' in a demeaning jibe at that Democrat's considerable
girth. These episodes came atop resentment over D'Amato's shameless
exploitation of the Holocaust _ claiming spuriously that Schumer, a
Jew who lost relatives in Nazi death camps, is insensitive to that
cataclysmic event. There are apparently some gambits that even the
jaded New York electorate will not tolerate. And playing games with
the Holocaust seems to be one.
</P>
<P>
   All this cost D'Amato some Jewish votes. D'Amato will win big
upstate, and Schumer will win big in New York City, where about 30
percent of voters live. D'Amato leads among whites, trails among
minorities and the elderly. The popular governor, George Pataki, is
touring with the senator, and D'Amato's negative ads cast Schumer
as a ``Brooklyn liberal Democrat'' with all the anti-New York City
baggage that implies.
</P>
<P>
   The race will be decided in the suburbs. Because New York is
still relatively Clinton-friendly, both the president and Al Gore
were to make last-minute hits for Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato opposes abortion on demand and gun control. These two
hot-button issues merge with the ghastly sniper assassination in a
Buffalo suburb of Dr. Barnett Slepian, a doctor who provided his
patients with abortions. Slepian was slain in his kitchen on the
night he came home from a Jewish remembrance service for his
father. Democrats think that will hurt -D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   It's also get-even time for Hillary Clinton. D'Amato chaired
Senate hearings investigating Whitewater, till his radar picked up
the beginning of the backlash in the Empire State. Hillary, now
arguably the most popular Democratic campaigner in the land, made
several campaign trips for Schumer, a leading gun control advocate.
Knocking off D'Amato would give Clinton &AMP; Clinton a warm, fuzzy
feeling election night, no matter what else happens.
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato is also the Freddy Krueger of the Senate; he won by
a sliver last time out, and it is widely believed in New York that
he gets votes from people who don't like telling pollsters they're
for this abrasive, divisive figure. He'll outspend Schumer down the
stretch. As chairman of the Banking Committee, he had little
difficulty collecting $22 million in ``contributions.''
</P>
<P>
   If he gets knocked off, Texas Senator Phil Gramm inherits the
chairmanship, and along with it, the lion's share of the mother
lode of campaign cash that is funneled to the Banking Committee's
top dog.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudy Giuliani is back in bed with Senator Pothole. In '94,
Rudy said, ``If the D'Amato crew ever get control, ethics will be
smashed'' in New York politics. Now? Rudy's with Al.
</P>
<P>
   New York's economic boom was exaggerated by the explosion of
wealth on Wall Street, and D'Amato bathes in that lingering
economic glow. At dusk last Saturday night near the spruced-up
Times Square, I walked past a gentleman clad in oversize Army
fatigues, combat boots, hair down to his shoulders. He was clearly
under the weather due to some sort of chemical ingestion, because
he held himself partially erect only by keeping one arm stiffly
propped against the fender of a parked car. But he was not so far
gone he could not mumble into the cell phone plastered to his ear.
</P>
<P>
   When even the homeless-looking guys have cell phones, that's
prosperity. If D'Amato survives, he'll have prosperity to thank.

 &HT;    GATES EMBODIES A MACHIAVELLIAN PRINCE AT MICROSOFT TRIAL
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Nov. 1.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To comprehend what's taking place at the federal
antitrust trial of Microsoft Corp., it's handy to be up on both the
latest workings of cyberspace and the dowdy universe of antitrust
law. But to get the full flavor of the historic trial, which enters
its third week Monday, you'll need to blend in the politics of the
Italian Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is necessary for a prince, who wishes to maintain himself,
to learn how not to be good, and to use this knowledge and not use
it, according to the necessities of the case,'' Niccolo Machiavelli
wrote in ``The Prince.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast-forward nearly five centuries and you'll recognize the
business philosophy of software prince Bill Gates. In 23 years,
Gates has parlayed Microsoft's Windows monopoly for personal
computers into a leviathan whose stock is worth $260 billion,
trailing General Electric by only a few billion on the leader
board.
</P>
<P>
   The flood of once-secret documents pouring out of the trial
depicts Gates _ who could retire in his early 40s to a princely
life on just a fraction of the interest on his $58 billion wealth _
as a hands-on boss. ``Bill's blessing,'' as one e-mail that popped
up at the trial puts it, means it's a cinch that a proposed deal
would move forward.
</P>
<P>
   But the slew of electronic messages also reveal a dark edge to
Gates.
</P>
<P>
   There was, for example, the time he ``just exploded'' at
Tele-Communications Inc. Chairman John Malone ``as part of their
scheduled one-on-one meeting, threatening to bury this company, buy
up (rival) cable operators, and do whatever it took to crush At
Home, since we are obviously so anti-Microsoft that it's
criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   That 1996 e-mail from a senior official of At Home, a high-speed
Internet provider partly owned by TCI, was put into evidence to
bolster the federal claim that Microsoft has sought to use its
Windows-based market dominance to pressure its many business
partners to standardize on its own Internet Explorer browser.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the Gates tirade had a happy ending: Microsoft
and At Home have since formed a strong working partnership _ one
that calls for Microsoft's Windows CE software to run At Home's
cable set-top boxes. Moreover, that alliance has matured even
though Netscape Communications Corp. chief executive Jim Barksdale,
the government's opening witness at the trial, sits on At Home's
board.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader plane, the episode illuminates how in the
fast-paced, high-tech corporate arena, ``strategic alliances'' form
only to eventually fail when competitive juices start to flow.
Similarly, bitter rivalries are quickly set aide whenever common
opportunities for market shares and profits suddenly appear on the
horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Shifting alliances has been an underlying theme at trial. An
America Online executive testified last week how AOL dumped its
browser deal with Netscape when, as a colleague put it, Microsoft
``made us an offer we couldn't refuse.'' But Microsoft's lawyers
also noted that AOL is now back in bed with Netscape in developing
another deal for so-called instant messaging services, an Internet
text version of a phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The overall portrait of Silicon Valley business life that
emerges from the trial perfectly suits the city-states of the
Italian Renaissance _ a time when rulers would often hold out olive
branches to their wary neighbors while hiding daggers behind their
backs.
</P>
<P>
   At the government would have it, Microsoft plunged a digital
dagger into Netscape on Dec. 7, 1995, which was referred to at the
trial by Barksdale as ``our own Pearl Harbor Day.''
</P>
<P>
   On that date, Gates announced that Microsoft was ``hard core''
about the Internet and planned to ``embrace and extend'' it across
all the company's products and platforms, including Windows 95, its
then-new flagship operating system. For openers, Gates said
Internet Explorer would be forever free to all comers.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape stock promptly fell nearly 30 percent. It has yet to
recover. The Justice Department took notice.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the still-raging browser wars is told in
``Competing on Internet Time: Lessons from Netscape and Its Battle
with Microsoft,'' a soon-to-be published book by Massachusetts
Institute of Technology management professor Michael Cusumano and
Harvard Business School's David Yoffie.
</P>
<P>
   ``A classic battle was looming,'' the authors write. ``Netscape
and its 700 or so employees were cast as David against Gates'
Goliath, which had more than 17,000 employees and almost $6 billion
in sales in 1995. ...At the end of 1997, Netscape was forced to
declare a fourth-quarter loss of $88 million and its share of the
browser market had dropped close to 50 percent by the middle of
1998.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Emboldened by their success and wealth, Microsoft's executives
thought they could break the rules with impunity,'' the government
has charged. Gates has misrepresented his own actions, they
maintain, by claiming no recollection of deals that court documents
reveal he in fact closely steered.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has adopted a ``business culture'' defense in the
trial, arguing that its actions faithfully mirror those taken by
its corporate accusers. But as Machiavelli wrote in his day, and as
Gates may be learning now, a prince must try to win the day in ways
that avoid making gratuitous enemies.

GAMES OF THE WEEK  
(JT)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SATURDAY'S TOP GAMES
</P>
<P>
   No. 19 Georgia 6-1
</P>
<P>
   No. 8 vs. Florida 6-1
</P>
<P>
   at Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Florida should get by here, although it is prone to close calls.
Georgia upended the Gators last year, and as Orantes Grant, the
Bulldog linebacker, said, ``People say we kind of snuck up on them,
but they're not saying that anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 13 (tie) Oregon 6-1
</P>
<P>
   No. 17 at Arizona 7-1
</P>
<P>
   Oregon is averaging 44 points a game, but its killing schedule
and tailback Reuben Droughns' broken leg may take a toll. Arizona
held Northeast Louisiana to 205 yards in total offense last week,
and its home-field advantage could decide this Pacific 10 game.
</P>
<P>
   No. 18 Texas 5-2
</P>
<P>
   No. 6 Nebraska 7-1
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Williams of Texas, with 259 yards against Baylor last
week, leads the nation in rushing, averaging 212 yards a game. But
Nebraska has more guns, although it too often must be bailed out by
backup quarterbacks. A former walk-on quarterback, Monte Christo,
will start.
</P>
<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh (2-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Syracuse (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   This should be easy for Syracuse, the only team unbeaten in Big
East play.
</P>
<P>
   Temple (1-6)
</P>
<P>
   at Rutgers (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers is an underdog at home to another Big East weak sister.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Columbia (2-4)
</P>
<P>
   Princeton's offense (460 yards against Harvard) is better than
Columbia's defense.
</P>
<P>
   Yale (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   at Penn (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   Both teans had monster running games last week, thrusting them
into a four-way tie for the Ivy lead.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Virginia Tech (6-1)
</P>
<P>
   The difference may be Al Clark, who returns as the Tech
quarterback after five weeks away with a sprained right foot.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   at Miami (4-2)
</P>
<P>
   If Boston College can gain 610 yards against Navy and still
lose, how does it beat a good Miami team?
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 Tennessee (6-0)
</P>
<P>
   at South Carolina (1-7)
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's offense, which thrived against Georgia and Alabama,
should have an easy time.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina (3-3)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 5 Florida State (7-1)
</P>
<P>
   Florida State's defense (212.3 yards a game) ranks first in the
land.
</P>
<P>
   No. 12 Arkansas (6-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Auburn (2-5)
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, off to its worst start since 1952, can still be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   No. 13 (tie) Georgia Tech (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   vs. Maryland (2-5)
</P>
<P>
   at Baltimore
</P>
<P>
   Maryland doesn't beat anyone in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
   No. 21 Virginia (6-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Wake Forest (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   Virginia, despite a banged-up and erratic defense, should coast.
</P>
<P>
   MIDWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 2 Ohio State (7-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Indiana (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has the offense (524 yards last week) and defense
(229.1 yards a game, second best in Division I-A).
</P>
<P>
   No. 4 Kansas State (7-0)
</P>
<P>
   at Kansas (3-5)
</P>
<P>
   A breather for Kansas State before it finishes against Baylor,
Nebraska and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor (2-5)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 15 Notre Dame (5-1)
</P>
<P>
   The Irish cannot get careless the way they did last week against
Army.
</P>
<P>
   No. 24 Michigan (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Minnesota (4-3)
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota keeps getting beaten up by the better Big Ten teams.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHWEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Texas A&AMP;M (7-1)
</P>
<P>
   at Oklahoma State (3-4)
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies should win, but State has scared some good teams.
</P>
<P>
   No. 23 Missouri (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   at Texas Tech (6-2)
</P>
<P>
   A tight game. Missouri gained only 166 yards against Nebraska
and almost won.
</P>
<P>
   FAR WEST
</P>
<P>
   No. 16 Washington (5-2)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 25 Southern California (5-3)
</P>
<P>
   Southern Cal, despite a pallid offense, is two field goals and a
safety away from a 7-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Methodist (3-5)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 11 Air Force (6-1)
</P>
<P>
   Air Force, first in the nation in rushing (306.7 yards a game),
should roll up first downs.
</P>
<P>
   MISMATCHES
</P>
<P>
   Stanford (1-6)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 1 UCLA (6-0)
</P>
<P>
   As Al Borges, UCLA's offensive coordinator, said, ``We've
reached a point where we don't expect to lose, and that's where you
want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Illinois (2-6)
</P>
<P>
   at No. 10 Penn State (5-1)
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's offense is getting better, its defense much better.

JUDGE'S INTERVENTION FOR PEDOPHILE PRIEST RAISES QUESTIONS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1)  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a distinguished group that met for lunch at Shreveport's
Petroleum Club one day in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost was Judge Henry Politz, head of the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals and one of the country's most respected jurists.
He was joined by the chief of the Louisiana prison system, several
attorneys and one other man, a guest of Politz's.
</P>
<P>
   The guest was middle-aged, small, quiet, inconspicuous in any
crowd and obscure beside the garrulous Politz.
</P>
<P>
   He was Gilbert Gauthe, former priest and ex-convict and one of
the nation's most infamous pedophiles, a man who had molested
hundreds of boys before his arrest in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He was a man who but for good fortune, influence and expert
legal counsel would have been eating his lunch from a steel counter
in state prison rather than a linen tablecloth in the Petroleum
Club.
</P>
<P>
   He was a man who owed a great deal to Judge Henry Politz.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthe would seem an odd choice as a dinner companion for a
federal judge, particularly one who had been a member of the
Judicial Conference of the United States and its Committee on Codes
of Conduct, the national ethics committee for federal judicial
officers and employees.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly, they have only the southern Louisiana town of
Napoleonville in common. In that rural area, the two men's families
worked as sharecroppers for generations.
</P>
<P>
   There, the similarities end. Politz, Gauthe's senior by 12
years, is a powerful, well-educated raconteur, a family man with 11
children who was divorced in the early 1990s, and a man with a
record so spotless that he was once considered as a potential
nominee for the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthe, an introvert who never attained a college degree, is a
failed priest, a criminal with a past so horrendous that he has
been called a monster.
</P>
<P>
   On the day that he joined Politz's group in the Petroleum Club,
it had been only a little more than a decade since Gauthe had
shocked the nation when he was exposed for seducing and assaulting
scores of Louisiana altar boys. It was less than a year since he
had been convicted in another child abuse case in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gauthe had become notorious when it was shown that
church officials were aware of his pedophilia and had moved him
from one parish to another whenever his abuses became known.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those dissimilarities, more recent developments _ a
deposition given by Gauthe Oct. 5 in a civil lawsuit and an
investigation by the Houston Chronicle culminating in an interview
with Politz _ have shed some light on why two seemingly disparate
individuals would be socializing in public.
</P>
<P>
   These developments give some indication of the depth of the
relationship between the 64-year-old federal judge and the
54-year-old pedophile.
</P>
<P>
   That relationship reaches back at least to 1985, when Gauthe was
arrested in Abbeville, La., and became the first of a number of
such priests throughout the country. His conviction on 34 counts of
child molestation began an avalanche of civil lawsuits against the
Roman Catholic Church that continues today.
</P>
<P>
   Luck and the Catholic Church had kept him out of jail for years.
He had been an active pedophile since his youth, when both he and
his younger brother, Richard, a Boy Scout leader, had molested
scores of children. Richard Gauthe, who had been ousted from the
Air Force and the Scouts for abusing children, had subsequently
married a woman with three children in the late 1970s and,
according to her, molested all three.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gauthe's former wife, Dixie Diez, said she had caught
him molesting her son in 1980, years before Gilbert's arrest, and
forced a confession from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard told me both he and Gilbert had been doing this for
years,'' she said. ``I knew Gilbert was a priest and had access to
all those kids and I tried to turn him in, but the police didn't
believe me. They said that, even if it was true, what I knew was
hearsay and they couldn't arrest him.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gauthe was eventually convicted and jailed for molesting
children in Great Britain. Gilbert, however, would remain free for
five years after his sister-in-law alerted police to him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gilbert Gauthe was more than just a luncheon guest of Henry
Politz's. He has been under the judge's protective wing for more
than 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Politz has intervened in Gauthe's criminal cases and has been a
regular visitor to him in prison. The judge has arranged for the
best attorneys to represent the child molester in three of his four
criminal cases, all at no charge. Politz has squired Gauthe to
social functions, interceded with police on his behalf and loaned
him money.
</P>
<P>
   By Gauthe's own account, Politz is his ``legal and moral''
counselor. By Politz's account, he has simply assisted a younger
man whose grandfather befriended Politz's widowed mother.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe that assistance has gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   It began as soon as Gauthe was convicted the first time. That
conviction was to have sent Gauthe to prison where he was to
receive Depo-Provera, a sexual inhibitor, and serve 20 years
without parole or early release. Ray Mouton, Gauthe's attorney at
the time and the man who drew up the plea bargain, believed that is
what would happen, as did the children Gauthe had molested.
</P>
<P>
   Then Politz entered the case.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthe had already been convicted when Mouton first heard of
Henry Politz. At the time, Mouton was attempting to have Gauthe
transferred from Wade Correctional Center in Homer, La., to serve
his sentence in a medical facility in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``On several occasions Gauthe mentioned that there was a judge
from his hometown who could help us, and he wanted me to call the
judge,'' said Mouton. ``I ignored the information and must have
mentioned to Gauthe that we needed no help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilbert called me a number of times from Wade, insisting I
contact Judge Henry Politz, who Gauthe said could help him. When I
failed to contact the judge, Politz got in touch with me and I told
him we didn't need his help.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point I was confused because I felt it is a violation
of judicial and legal ethics for a federal judge to be personally
involved in the affairs of a state prisoner whose appeal might well
come before his court.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, said Mouton, he learned that Politz had ordered a
transcript of the case. Mouton then spoke to the district attorney,
the late Nathan Stansbury, and learned that Politz had visited
Stansbury and discussed overturning Gauthe's plea on grounds that
Mouton was incompetent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then (Stansbury) said Judge Politz told him he had talked with
the bishop in Lafayette, the archbishop in New Orleans, Paul Phelps
(former head of the state prison system) and Gov. Edwin Edwards
about Gauthe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind it was clear that whatever was going on was
wrong,'' Mouton said. ``I wrote a letter to both Gauthe and Judge
Politz and I quit, withdrew as Gauthe's attorney and never again
had any contact with either Gauthe or the judge.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Gauthe no longer wanted to be moved from Wade
where Richard Stalder, current head of the state prison system and
a man who describes Politz as ``a friend and a mentor,'' was then
warden.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthe was given special status there. Despite the terms of his
conviction, he was never given Depo-Provera at Wade. He was housed
in a maximum-security area where he was assigned one of the few
air-conditioned rooms in the building as his ``office.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a glass enclosure in which he did oil painting and made
signs for Stalder; those paintings soon covered the windows, hiding
Gauthe from view. Behind those paintings, current and former guards
say, Gauthe was allowed to carry on sexual trysts with teen-age
prisoners he chose as assistants. He was given his pick among the
juveniles who had been tried as adults and were housed in Wade's
maximum-security area.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, Gauthe would be visited by Politz and Monsignor
Murray Clayton of Shreveport, La. The pair became regular visitors
to Gauthe and the late Robert Melancon, another convicted pedophile
priest who has since died of AIDS. Also present during those
meetings were Gauthe's friends, murderer Johnny Smead, who was one
of Gauthe's teen-age assistants, and William Tiner, an adult
prisoner then serving time for robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gauthe's favorable treatment extended beyond the
walls of Wade. He was granted extended furloughs to visit his
ailing mother. These furloughs ranged from weeks to a month, during
which he spent his nights in the Napoleonville jail and his days at
his mother's bedside.
</P>
<P>
   According to prison guards, Gauthe was exempt from many of the
rules in Wade. Several of those officers requested anonymity,
although one, retired Lt. Greg Faust, said he conducted a search of
Gauthe's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had written him up at least 20 times for various
violations,'' said Faust, ``mostly putting his hands on other
prisoners, fondling them in the halls, and nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Officers would tell him to keep his hands off the other
prisoners and he'd just look at you and tell you to leave him
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, one night, several of us decided to have a look in that
office of his.''
</P>
<P>
   In a desk, said Faust, he found pornographic cartoons drawn by
Gauthe and a plastic bag filled with pubic hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stapled the bag and the drawings to an infraction report and
turned it in,'' said Faust. ``Not only did nothing happen to
Gauthe, the next day I was told (by a superior officer) to stay out
of his personal effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did Gauthe spend 20 years or even half that time in prison.
With the aid of attorneys secured by Politz, Gauthe was released in
1995 after serving less than nine years.
</P>
<P>
   That release was based on good-time credit of two days for each
day actually served, a policy instituted by the state shortly
before Gauthe's conviction. In Gauthe's case, however, his lawyer
was seeking credit for more than a year that Gauthe had spent
voluntarily being treated in a New England mental hospital at
diocese expense prior to his conviction.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That request was first denied by Henry Goins, the records system
administrator for the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and
Corrections.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, Richard Stalder, Gauthe's former warden and
Politz's friend, had been promoted to secretary of prisons. At the
request of an attorney secured by Politz, Stalder ordered a special
review of Gauthe's case, though he said he never ordered that the
good-time credit be awarded.
</P>
<P>
   Goins, however, subsequently gave Gauthe credit for the time
spent in voluntary commitment in a mental hospital, two days
good-time credit for each day served, and released him in September
1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthe collected $15,000 in ``retirement'' pay from the Catholic
Church and moved to the rural community of Ace, in Polk County,
Texas, near Livingston. There he lived in a small house owned by
his sister and posed as a retired paramedic.
</P>
<P>
   He had been there only a few months when he struck up a
friendship with Karen Munson, mother of a 3-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always wanted to paint my son,'' said the mother. ``He
wanted to put him in a pair of overalls and have him kneel as
though he were praying and paint a picture of him.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gauthe asked to take the child for an ice cream cone, the
boy's mother agreed. When they returned, the boy's pants were
twisted and, upon questioning, he said Gauthe had fondled his
genitals.
</P>
<P>
   Munson called police, and Gauthe was arrested and charged with
sexual assault of a child. It was July 19, 1996, less than a year
after his release.
</P>
<P>
   When he was taken to jail he made two phone calls, one to his
sister in Houston and the other to Politz.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual assault charge could have resulted in a lengthy
sentence for a repeat offender, but not for Gauthe. Sheriff's
deputies who arrested Gauthe learned that he was a convicted child
molester from Louisiana, but Polk County's requests for Gauthe's
records _ rap sheets that showed his prior convictions _ were
ignored by Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Polk County authorities made little effort to retrieve those
records, however; no one was sent to Louisiana to get them.
Ultimately, said prosecutor Lee Hon, the case was considered weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mother didn't want to put the child on the stand,'' he
said. ``Without him, we didn't have much.''
</P>
<P>
   So, despite having a videotape in which the boy, using an
anatomically correct doll, described the fondling to a sheriff's
investigator, prosecutors reduced the charge to ``injury to a
child.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Politz had arranged more free legal counsel for
Gauthe: Marjorie Meyers, a public defender in Houston and a former
clerk for Politz, and Robert C. Bennett, a well-known Houston
attorney who most recently has defended Houston City Councilman
John Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett would not return repeated calls, and Meyers refused to
comment about Gauthe.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthe pleaded no contest to the reduced charge for a seven-year
probationary sentence in March 1997 and moved to Waskom, just
across from Shreveport, La., on the Texas border.
</P>
<P>
   He did not remain in Waskom, however, even though he maintained
a house there. Instead, he lived in a house in Shreveport owned by
Clayton and worked in the Shreveport jail as a paid counselor to
sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   And during this time, he would visit Politz. Gauthe, in his
deposition in a civil lawsuit arising from his assault of Munson's
child in Polk County, said he would periodically ``drop by'' the
judge's office to ``chat.''
</P>
<P>
   In that deposition, taken by Munson's attorney, Tony Fontana of
Lafayette, La., Gauthe described his relationship with Politz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the legal man that, you know ... would know what to
do,'' said Gauthe. ``I rely on him a lot for, you know, not only
legal advice, but a lot of just moral support, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fontana then asked about any sexual relationship between the
judge and Gauthe or Gauthe's friends, Tiner and Smead, in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir, absolutely. That would be _ I mean, I don't understand
where that's coming from,'' said Gauthe. ``I mean, that would be
impossible. You'd have to go to some kind of secluded area and we
never were like that.''
</P>
<P>
   It also was during the period in 1997 when Gauthe was living in
Shreveport that he accompanied Politz and Clayton to the opening of
a new prison near Wade. There, he chatted with Stalder and stood by
with various judicial dignitaries as a ribbon was cut to celebrate
the opening of Forcht Wade Prison.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, however, New Orleans television station WWL
began airing stories about Gauthe's release. As a result,
Shreveport police began patrolling Gauthe's neighborhood regularly
and eventually told him to leave the city.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted a call from Politz to Shreveport Police Chief
Stephen Prater, in which the judge told Prater, ``This is not the
Wild West. You can't order people out of town.'' Politz
acknowledges making the call.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Clayton wrote a letter of support for Gauthe
to the Shreveport Times, defending both Gauthe and Politz.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthe, wrote Clayton, had pleaded guilty to ``something that
never happened'' in Polk County.
</P>
<P>
   ``No good, only evil has been generated by those responsible for
the tragedy of this recent media feeding frenzy,'' wrote Clayton,
who now refuses to return calls about Gauthe.
</P>
<P>
   ``A quiet, mild-mannered man struggling to redeem his life has
been smashed down.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few weeks later, in December 1997, a new victim came
forward, saying the ``mild-mannered'' Gauthe had raped her at
gunpoint over the hood of a car when she was a child, 20 years
before and a few years before the offenses for which Gauthe was
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Lafayette Parish District Attorney Mike Harson charged Gauthe
with rape.
</P>
<P>
   The former priest learned of the charge while in Shreveport.
Once again, after calling his family, the first person he called
was Politz.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew more about it than I did,'' said Gauthe in his civil
deposition. ``I told him, `I'm going to go ahead and turn myself
in.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Police, who were waiting at Gauthe's residence in Waskom, poised
to arrest him and search his house for child pornography, left the
neighborhood after learning he was in custody. With no warrant to
serve, they lacked probable cause to search his home.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Gauthe's neighbors in Waskom watched as a man
driving a car registered to William Tiner, Gauthe's former
prisonmate, arrived and removed a computer and several boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Tiner, who later moved to Wyoming, could not be located for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently an additional sexual assault charge, brought by a
former altar boy, has been added to the rape case. Gauthe has been
in the Lafayette Parish Jail since December.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, however, he has been provided with expert legal
representation at no fee. Jack Martzell, a New Orleans attorney who
has represented a number of state legislators and once defended
boxer Mohammed Ali, joined public defender Paul Marx on Gauthe's
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   That is only one aspect of Gauthe's case that has puzzled many,
including Louisiana state Sen. Donald Cravins, who headed a
committee investigating the Louisiana prison system.
</P>
<P>
   The committee questioned prison system administrators and others
connected to the Gauthe case. But, lacking subpoena power and the
authority to demand sworn testimony, it never succeeded in
questioning Politz.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also reached few conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every instance in which the rules could be applied or bent
in Gilbert Gauthe's favor, they have been,'' said Cravins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, `Why?' We never succeeded in finding the
answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after beginning a probe of the Gauthe case, Cravins was
removed as head of the committee with the admonition that he was
not ``reform-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Gauthe business contributed to that,'' he said.
``But I couldn't prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder why a judge who once helped decide ethical conduct
for the entire federal judiciary would choose to protect a pariah.
</P>
<P>
   Politz is a giant in his state's legal community, a former
president of the Louisiana Trial Lawyers Association, an
officeholder on numerous boards and a man in whose name a
scholarship has been established at the Louisiana State University
law school.
</P>
<P>
   It puzzles Professor Robert Shurwurck of the University of
Houston's School of Law. Shurwurck believes Politz's actions could
be a violation of the American Bar Association's Code of Ethics.
</P>
<P>
   That code prohibits a judge from ``lending the prestige of the
office to advance the private interests of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the event that Politz's association with Gauthe does
violate the code, it would appear unlikely that any disciplinary
action will follow. It notes that ``although numerous dicta
indicate that judges may be disciplined merely for `close and
intimate association' with criminals, there is no reported
incidence of punishment ever being imposed in the absence of more
palpable misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the group that would determine such a violation is
under the authority of the 5th Circuit, which Politz heads.
</P>
<P>
   Politz's explanation does little to satisfy Shurwurck and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father and his grandfather sharecropped together in
Napoleonville,'' said Politz. ``When my father died at a very early
age, Gilbert's grandfather befriended my mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gilbert's mother and my sister were best friends. It's as
simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Politz said it was at his sister's request that he contacted
Gauthe and that he'd never met the man before he was jailed.
</P>
<P>
   The near certainty that Gauthe would molest children again if he
had access to them is something the judge termed ``a legitimate
concern,'' but not a factor that has kept him from helping Gauthe
gain freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the concern always about someone who has this
problem,'' said Politz. ``It's one that society's trying to find an
answer to, and it's a difficult question.''
</P>
<P>
   But not one that prevents Politz from continuing his
relationship with Gauthe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable that anyone who knows anything about Gilbert
Gauthe would help set him free around children,'' said Jason Berry,
author of ``Lead Us Not Into Temptation,'' an exhaustive book about
the Gauthe case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a monster.''
</P>
<P>
   Politz's interference angers Karen Munson and Gauthe's former
lawyer, Ray Mouton, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My little boy didn't have the church and a federal judge to
protect him,'' Munson said.
</P>
<P>
   The boy has had continuing psychological and physical problems
since his encounter with Gauthe, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Mouton also said he cannot understand Politz's involvement with
Gauthe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know enough about Gilbert Gauthe and Judge Henry Politz to
know that there is no apparent commonality between them,'' said
Mouton. ``I can't imagine a man in Politz's position _ holding one
of the highest judicial positions in the United States _ extending
aid and support to a serial child molester, acting in a way which
enabled (him) to live in such a destructive pattern.''
</P>
<P>
   That pattern may well continue.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange twist of circumstance, it appears that Mouton may
be the one most instrumental in setting Gauthe free again. A judge
has ruled that Mouton must testify for the prosecution in the
current rape case against Gauthe, a case which is expected to come
to trial in December.
</P>
<P>
   When he does, said Mouton, he will have to testify that Gauthe
was granted immunity for any cases which occurred prior to the ones
listed in his original indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one undisputable agreement which existed between the state
and Gauthe, Stansbury and myself, is the explicit, clear,
unmistakable understanding that no charges arising out of conduct
which allegedly occurred prior to the indictment of Gauthe would
ever be accepted by the district attorney and filed against
Gauthe,'' said Mouton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given that, these cases against him are no good.''
</P>
<P>
   Mouton has little doubt that, once freed, his former client will
molest again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were things about Gil I deplored and things I admired,''
said Mouton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that when I represented him, Gauthe was sincere about
remaining in whatever medical regime might provide the optimum
chance for his recovery,'' said Mouton. ``He was under the care of
the best doctors in the country, taking (Depo-Provera), the only
medication known to have an impact on his condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Judge Politz entered the picture, things changed. Gauthe
expressed contentment with Wade and seemingly had no desire to move
to another facility where treatment would be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what his relationship with Judge Politz is or
what the history of that relationship is, (but) I feel Judge Henry
Politz has a lot to answer for.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems in helping Gauthe so much, Politz did not help him at
all.'' &QL;

A LOSS IN CALIFORNIA COULD HAUNT REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Republicans often voice a proprietary attitude
about real estate. In the early 1950s, they asked: ``Who lost
China?'' In the late 1990s, in the Taiwan of their dismay, they can
bitterly debate: ``Who lost California?''
</P>
<P>
   GOP gubernatorial candidates are ahead in most big states:
Texas, New York, Florida, Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan. But here in
the biggest state, Dan Lungren is not. He is lagging partly because
of his self-managed campaign and partly because of the skill of his
opponent, Democrat Gray Davis. But his most daunting obstacle is
the public perception of his party as a rich white man's
fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren is a likable fellow, as the former speaker Tip O'Neill
once admitted. ``You have the qualities I admire in a politician,''
the late House speaker wrote to Lungren in 1983. ``You love your
country, and you love politics.''
</P>
<P>
   In California, 36 percent of voters are registered Republicans,
but 47 percent are Democrats. In an off-year election, the party
needs to do more than jump-start its zealots, especially against
savvy, well-financed Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Fong, the Republican state treasurer, was leading Senator
Barbara Boxer two weeks ago until President Clinton's fund-raising
helped Boxer finance an avalanche of negative ads depicting Fong as
a fan of assault rifles and toxic waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of her attacks have gone unanswered,'' exults Democratic
consultant Bill Carrick. ``Matt Fong is the Mike Dukakis of this
campaign. He doesn't fight back.'' At a small rally on the Capitol
Mall here, Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee praised Fong, who
then read a speech on crime, in which he declared himself against
it. Boxer, who riles Republicans the way Jesse Helms rankles
Democrats, has a 9-point lead in the Field Poll.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are reaping the whirlwind of divisive tactics that
once energized their base but alienated others. Governor Pete
Wilson, the godfather of ``wedge issues,'' pushed ballot questions
against illegal immigration, affirmative action, and bilingual
education, angering Hispanic voters and creating future trouble for
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, a gubernatorial candidate eagerly denounces the
legislative leadership of the other party. When the Los Angeles
Daily News endorsed Lungren for governor, it said, ``He offers a
good counterbalance to the Democrat-controlled state Legislature.
We like the notion of continued checks and balances on state
government.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lungren rarely mentions state senate president John Burton
of San Francisco or Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa of Los
Angeles, two of the state's most liberal legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows who they are,'' says Mike Schroeder, chairman of
the Republican State Committee. ``We tested their name ID
statewide, and they test below 20 percent. If you attack somebody
like Villaraigosa, whom nobody knows, it sounds like you're beating
up on him because he's Mexican-American.''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has made Spanish-language commercials wooing Latinos,
but Davis now commands a 70 percent share of Hispanic voters in a
poll. When that chicken comes home to roost, it will sport the
feathers of Pete Wilson, but Lungren himself carries the lethal
Republican virus of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   In his last debate with Davis, his opening statement was a
rambling tribute to Ronald Reagan, ``who understood what being an
American was all about.'' Reagan was a hot commodity in 1966, when
he first ran for governor. But the Gipper thrived by focusing on
the future. Lungren's campaign is stuck in the 1970s, lambasting
Davis because he worked for Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   California's vote will have a profound effect on the national
debate among Republicans. Their social-issue, quasi-religious,
ideological squabbles will intensify if Lungren and Fong lose. In
1949, when China fell to the Communist, Republicans leapt on the
issue. In the winter nights of 1999, they will be leaping on each
other.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Not to scare you on Halloween or anything, but there is such a
thing as a sea monster.
</P>
<P>
   It is elusive, powerful, and huge. It is menacingly muscled.
With eyes as big as hubcaps, sinewy tentacles carrying toothed
suckers (the better to grasp you with, my dear), eight writhing
arms, and a strong birdlike beak (located between its arms, no
less) that cuts flesh into chunks. And there is no head where a
head should be. (Talk about brain food: Everything this monster
eats passes through its brain on the way to its stomach.)
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't want to meet this beast in a dark alley of the
ocean _ unless you were part of a team of curious scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The sea monster we're talking about is Architeuthis
(ark-ih-TOOTH-is), the giant squid. This is the animal that danced
in the nightmares of sailors for centuries, the elusive quarry of
marine biologists who hope to study them, and the subject of marine
artist and writer Richard Ellis's latest book, ``The Search for the
Giant Squid: An Authoritative Look at the Biology and Mythology of
the World's Most Elusive Sea Creature'' (Lyons Press, $35).
</P>
<P>
   From the 200 or so specimens that have landed in fishermen's
nets or washed ashore, we know that these creatures are indeed
monstrous: The largest ever recorded was found in 1887 on the coast
of New Zealand. It was 57 feet long from the top of its mantle to
its tentacle tips. Its archenemy, the sperm whale, reaches a length
of 60 feet. It is believed that giant squid could grow larger than
that.
</P>
<P>
   But we don't know.  &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Though they show up regularly in fiction (Jules Verne's
``20,000 Leagues Under the Sea,'' for one), there hasn't been one
confirmed sighting or photograph of a living, healthy giant squid.
That means no one has really seen them tossing a tentacle or two
over the prow of a boat to snack on seagoers. They may come to the
surface of the water only when they're really not feeling well. All
the ones seen onshore are dead, and the ones hauled up in nets are
dead or dying.
</P>
<P>
   The less we know, of course, the scarier they seem. And
zoologists are trying to do something about that.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stone, the director of conservation for the New England
Aquarium, was part of a prestigious team of scientists with
sponsorship from National Geographic Television, the Smithsonian
Institution, and the New England Aquarium that prowled the waters
off the South Island of New Zealand in January and February 1997.
They brought high-tech equipment to gain a glimpse of deep-sea
life, which they hoped would include giant squid. We know that
sperm whales feed on giant squid (the evidence being large numbers
of indigestible squid beaks left in sperm whale bellies). And so
this group even attached a ``critter-cam'' to a sperm whale in
hopes of catching a giant squid on tape. ``We saw some really neat
stuff,'' Stone reports, ``but we knew the chances of seeing a giant
squid were slim.'' And indeed, no squid made the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being dropped into the middle of an Indian jungle
because you want to see a tiger,'' author Ellis says; it wouldn't
be fair to conclude after a few minutes, ``Well, there are no
tigers in India.''
</P>
<P>
   The hunt for the living giant squid will take more time. But
people will keep trying. Ellis describes the quest as ``the
ultimate zoological quest'' for the ``quintessential monster.''
</P>
<P>
   But as we all know from movies, monsters never show up when
scientists want them to. And considering that one washed ashore on
Plum Island, near Newburyport, in 1980, those of us who swim around
here should hope they don't show up when they're unwanted, either.
</P>
<P>
   Happy Halloween.

 IT'S SHOW TIME FOR 1999s  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   The New England International Auto Show begins Saturday,
signaling the beginning of the New Year _ that may be Jan. 1 for
most people, but in the auto business, a new year begins with the
unveiling of the new models. So, happy 1999, everybody.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities actually got under way Friday with previews of
new models for the New England Motor Press and last night's
Massachusetts State Automobile Dealers Association celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Acura led off at 11 a.m. with its vice president of marketing,
Jeff Conrad, pulling the cover off the 1999 3.5RL, the flagship of
the luxury line. Next came Joel Manby, president of Saab Cars USA,
to unveil the new 9-5 Saab station wagon, a radical departure for
the Swedish maker that has previously offered spacious hatchbacks
which did about what wagons do. Then it was Saturn's turn _ Don
Hudler, Saturn president, introduced the new three-door coupe.
</P>
<P>
   The annual New England Motor Press Association lunch was up
next, with Mark Hutchins, president of Ford's Lincoln Mercury
division, offering the keynote address outlining a look at the
challenges ahead in the auto market, LM's hopes for the new LS
model, and the reasoning behind its corporate shift to California _
to create a truly American car, he said, a combination of
California imagination and New England practicality. A couple of
awards highlighted the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   NEMPA presented its Charles Dole High Road Award to Ken Gross,
an automotive journalist whose work appears in national magazines
and who is currently director of the Peterson Auto Museum. The
award, named for retired Christian Science Monitor journalist
Charles Dole _ its first recipient _ recognizes career
professionals in auto journalism or the automotive industry who
have set an example of high ideals, integrity, and professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   MSADA also cited one of its own, Quincy, Mass., dealer Dan
Quirk, winner of Time magazine's Quality Award for Massachusetts; a
national winner is to be chosen from among the state winners. The
Quirk family operates dealerships selling Ford, Chevrolet, Nissan,
Mazda, Mitsubishi, and Volkswagen vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Karen Makris, Mercedes-Benz product manager,
offered a look at the new C230 Kompressor, a supercharged
performance model. Ed Hightower of BMW introduced that company's 5
Series Sport Wagon; Chrysler unveiled its new Jeep Grand Cherokee
for 1999, and Volvo's Jim Borsch wound up the afternoon with a
presentation of Volvo's 1999 S80.
</P>
<P>
   That's a short list of the newest, but everything is new at the
show _ if not totally new, at least freshened for the new year. To
keep things interesting, there are concept cars from a variety of
manufacturers and this year automobiles sculpted in sand.

MORE TO FOOD THAN MEETS THE TONGUE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., N.Y., Ohio)  (js) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is it about New York Jews and Chinese food?
During a recent rainy afternoon in a basement classroom at New York
University, graduate students were discussing why Jewish immigrants
from Eastern Europe were originally drawn to such an alien cuisine
and how Chinese restaurants became integral to the experience of
Jewish assimilation.
</P>
<P>
   The class, called ``Culture and Foods,'' is part of the
Department of Nutrition and Food Studies at New York University's
School of Education, which for the last two years has been training
students in nutrition, food studies and food management.
</P>
<P>
   It was once thought that you are what you eat; now it also seems
true that you study what you eat. While NYU remains one of the few
schools with a formal food studies program, courses are
increasingly being offered at colleges across the country.
Meanwhile, scholarly journals and books are increasingly dealing
with food issues, like Calaloo, an African-American literary
journal, and the journal Southern Folklore and Food and Culture: A
Reader.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is because food is one of the great universals and
one that people can relate to as a source of pleasure. Perhaps it
is because food studies taps into larger scholarly trends. The
development of women's studies has taken areas that were once
relegated to the realm of mundane domesticity _ like food _ and
examined them for clues to the larger culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a trend in scholarship and academia in general
to pay more attention to the contemporary and the everyday,'' said
Lucy Long, an assistant professor in the department of popular
culture at Bowling Green State University in Ohio. ``Food is an
everyday kind of item that everyone can relate to, but you can
extract from this very, very theoretical ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Long, who has a background in folklore, said she studies
``how food is being used to express personal identity, how it is
being used to affirm the place of an individual or a group within
society, how food is used in rituals to help individuals find
meaning in everyday activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the topics she has explored, for example, are how Friday
night pizza parties have become occasions for parent-child bonding;
how the very unwieldiness of the Thanksgiving turkey demands
extended family socializing; and whether Americans' acceptance of
Mexican food translates into a more general acceptance of Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Long also cited the work of another scholar, George H. Lewis
of the University of Pacific in California, who has examined the
image of Maine lobster, how it changed from a poor man's food to a
national delicacy and thereby alienated the local people.
</P>
<P>
   At the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, Warren Belasco,
a professor of American studies, also examines the folklore of food
and questions of agriculture, business and the environment. In a
senior seminar on the American food chain, for example, Belasco's
students trace a single food product from farm to factory to
supermarket to kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Belasco said this kind of analysis encourages students to think
about the consequences of their food choices: ``When I eat this
hamburger, what chain of events am I taking part in here?'' he
said. ``We talk about the ethics of meat and agricultural products;
who picks our food, raises it, grows it, transports it, what goes
into it; the relationship to big business.''
</P>
<P>
   Belasco is vice president of the Association for the Study of
Food and Society, a group of sociologists, historians and
nutritionists who meet annually in conjunction with a group of
rural sociologists, agronomists and philosophers.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, the New School in Manhattan, together with its
journal, ``Social Research,'' plans to have a three-day conference
to examine the connections between food and culture, featuring 25
scholars, scientists and policy makers. Everything from the impact
of environmental changes on food production to the food and drink
of ancient Egypt will be discussed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although NYU's department has been around since 1926, when it
taught home economics, it has shifted its focus over the years.
Nutrition, food and hotel management were emphasized in the early
'90s; in 1996, the school began emphasizing the roles food plays in
culture, health and commerce. ``I was hearing an enormous interest
in learning more about the role of food in society and the role of
food in culture,'' said Marion Nestle, a professor and chairwoman
of the department.
</P>
<P>
   The course Culture and Foods, for example, explores how crayfish
became an ethnic emblem of the Cajuns; how the Molokans, a Russian
Orthodox group in Los Angeles, buy food only from stores that are
owned by other Molokans; how culture is transmitted throughout
community cookbooks; how the Hare Krishnas limit what foods they
eat and how much, yet use food as a way to proselytize, having an
elaborate weekly ``love feast'' for the public.
</P>
<P>
   In class the other day, students seemed most interested in the
discussion of Jews and Chinese food. They had read ``New York Jews
and Chinese Food: The Social Construction of an Ethnic Pattern'' by
Gaye Tuchman and Harry Levine, an essay included in the book ``The
Taste of American Place: A Reader on Regional and Ethnic Foods,''
published this year by Rowman &AMP; Littlefield.
</P>
<P>
   In the essay, the authors argue that Jewish New Yorkers were
attracted to Chinese food because they viewed it as cosmopolitan, a
way to move beyond their greenhorn status. What's more, the
overcooked vegetables and chicken soup typical of Chinese fare were
more familiar and less threatening than other types of food: safe
treyf (Yiddish for nonkosher food). By the second generation, the
authors said, Jews had come to identify Chinese food as ``a New
York Jewish custom, an aspect of group identity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a passionate interest in food and health, taste,
travel,'' Ms. Nestle said. ``It used to be more about how to make
this or that, but the quality of the writing about food has
dramatically improved. It is much more connected to what's
happening in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, she noted, ``Everybody eats.''

   Winter storm warnings were in effect Friday for the San Juan
Mountains in southeastern Colorado, with more than a foot of snow
forecast to fall at elevations above 9,000 feet. Saturday, snow
will continue to fall in the mountains of northeastern New Mexico
and southeast Colorado as a cold, upper-level low pressure system
forges slowly eastward.
</P>
<P>
   Father north, pockets of steady rain, perhaps mixing with snow
at times, are likely along the Front Range and foothills of the
Colorado Rockies as moist winds from the southeast are forced to
ascend the sloping terrain. To the east, rainfalls will exceed 2
inches in parts of western Kansas and northwest Oklahoma as a surge
of moist air from the Gulf of Mexico glides over a warm front.
Moderate to heavy rains are also possible across parts of north and
west Texas and the rest of Oklahoma as showers and thunderstorms
erupt after moist air is lifted ahead of the upper-level low over
New Mexico. Showers and storms will arrive in Arkansas later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Windy, chilly and damp weather will persist across northern New
England as Atlantic moisture wraps inland around a stalled low
pressure system over the Gulf of Maine. However, spokes of low
clouds rotating around the low in the Gulf of Maine could spiral as
far south as Boston. With high pressure anchored over Quebec
causing steering winds to detour around the low, the inclement
pattern will persist for most of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, wet weather will be the tenor of the day west of the
Cascades in Washington and Oregon.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Frost Above Freezing &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frost glazed parts of the Susquehanna River Valley in
Pennsylvania early Friday even though air temperatures stayed above
32 degrees. Official air temperatures are measured about 5 feet
above the ground in order to avoid the extreme variations that
often occur next to the ground. On a clear, calm autumnal night,
for example, the ground cools very rapidly as it radiates its
energy skyward while receiving little energy back from the dry,
cloudless atmosphere. In turn, air temperatures next to the ground
can fall to 32 degrees or below while readings higher up are above
freezing. &QL;

CRITICS OF MEGA-MERGER OF AT&AMP;T AND TCI COMPLAIN TO THE FCC 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)   (EDS: Filed in ``w'' and ``f'' categories.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest long distance
carrier, is betting heavily on transforming cable TV from an
entertainment-oriented medium into a telecommunications pipeline
that will penetrate local phone market monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T says its pending $48 billion merger with TCI Corp., the
nation's No. 2 cable TV provider, will allow consumers one-stop
shopping _ local and long distance telephone services, Internet
access, e-mail, high speed data transmission _ all through cable TV
hookups and all itemized on one monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this local phone capability offers the consumer is a
choice of local phone companies, a choice of local services, and a
choice of local prices,'' said C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's CEO and
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong's vision isn't shared by consumer advocacy groups
and an array of telecommunications companies with interests as
diverse as local and long distance service, Internet access, direct
broadcast and wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
   They asked the Federal Communications Commission last week to
stop the merger unless AT&AMP;T is required to give competitors equal
access to TCI's cables that connect to about 14 million U.S.
households.
</P>
<P>
   Among those filing formal petitions challenging the merger were
AOL Inc., Ameritech, the Consumer Federation of America, Echostar
Communications Corp., GTE Corp., the Independent Cable and
Telecommunications Association, Mindspring Enterprises Inc., SBC
Communications Inc., Sprint Corp., the Wireless Communications
Association International, US West, and MCI Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   GTE assaulted the merger for being ``brazenly
anti-competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   US West officials said the union ``poses grave risks to
competition in a number of markets.'' The merger would result in a
giant ``with combined revenues of nearly $60 billion and with
leading positions in fields spanning virtually the entire
communications industry.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL, the nation's largest online service, said consumers
potentially could benefit but warned that competition might suffer
unless the FCC steps in.
</P>
<P>
   Echostar, a direct broadcast satellite distributor and a cable
TV competitor, said AT&AMP;T's exclusive control over what runs over
TCI's cables ``would be a sufficiently serious anti-competitive
concern standing alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Federation of America charged that, despite AT&AMP;T's
assurances to the contrary, ``consumers will certainly face
spiralling cable TV rates and discriminatory practices restricting
customer choice and competition in telephone, video, Internet and
other advanced services.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the complaints focus on the fact that cable TV providers
and telephone companies face different levels of federal
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, two wires carrying commercial services enter most
American homes _ the phone line and the cable TV line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradoxically,'' GTE said, the phone wire ``is subject to a
host of regulatory requirements that open their lines for consumers
and competitors while the cable broadband line is under no such
constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in regulations is apparent in Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC requires that phone companies, or common carriers, allow
consumers to have access to any Internet provider they choose. This
allows the 25 million U.S. Internet subscribers with telephone
connections to select from among numerous providers.
</P>
<P>
   Cable TV operators aren't subject to that FCC requirement. As a
result, an estimated 300,000 consumers who gain access to the
Internet through cable TV hook-ups are forced to use their cable
company's preferred Internet provider _ usually Time Warner's Road
Runner or At Home, which is partly owned by TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritech called on the FCC to ``promote a level regulatory
playing field and dismantle regulatory distinctions based on
technology and industry segments.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, MCI said ``there should be no regulatory distinction
between telecommunications services provided over cable facilities
versus the traditional telephony structure.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials argue that the merger will bring competition to
local phone markets, which are dominated by the so-called Baby
bells such as SBC, US West, Ameritech, Bell South and Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong argued that the Baby Bells and their new corporate
alliances pose a serious threat to competition that increases the
rationale for AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed mergers between Bell Atlantic and GTE, and SBC
and Ameritech threaten to create a Ma Bell East and a Ma Bell West
controlling more than a third of all homes in America _ 55 million
phone lines,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their version of our communications future is very different.
It's built not on consumer choice but on extending their local
monopoly,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Peterson, a telecommunications analyst with the Yankee
Group _ a Boston-based consulting firm _ believes the merger
ultimately will be approved because it promises competition in
local phone markets, a major reason Congress deregulated the
telecommunications industry in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal gives credence to the concept of using cable for some
of the services that were traditionally offered by the monopolies,
namely voice communication and Internet access,'' said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger must be approved by the FCC, and a decision
is expected by next spring. In addition, the Justice Department is
examining the merger for anti-trust implications.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Diane Von Furstenberg surely had the most
photographed cheekbones of the 1970s. A woman who could flirt with
the camera in ways that helped shape her career, she flaunted her
formidable bone structure for the leading image makers of her day:
Francesco Scavullo, Ara Gallant and, most memorably, Andy Warhol.
Warhol snapped the Polaroid that would become the model for his
well-known serial portrait of Ms. Von Furstenberg, capturing her
with lips slightly parted and one arm flung dramatically over her
head.
</P>
<P>
   So it was jolting, after the recent premiere of ``Life Is
Beautiful,'' Roberto Benigni's emotionally wrenching fable set in
Italy during the Holocaust, to see those famous contours soften.
What's more, Ms. Von Furstenberg was waxing effusive, pronouncing
Guido, the hero, a loser, albeit one who succeeds in defying his
fate. ``So sad,'' she said in her satiny continental drawl, ``sad,
but I can identify. There are moments that I feel my life is
glamorous, and I love it, but. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Her words trailed off, leaving unspoken the notion that beneath
her privileged, high-gloss image there are depths unknown.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ms. Von Furstenberg who had suggested that a reporter
interview her around a screening of a film about the Holocaust.
What could she have had in mind, this consummate image maker, if
not to downplay the popular perception of ``DVF,'' the glamourpuss
and social gadabout, in order to highlight ``Diane,'' the woman of
substance and soul?
</P>
<P>
   A picture of sobriety, dressed in black, her makeup carefully
understated, Ms. Von Furstenberg offered an assessment of Benigni's
film. ``Love wins, that's the point, at least that's how I
interpret it,'' she said, piercing straight to the movie's
sentimental core. In it, the hero, played with great comic verve by
Benigni himself, saves his small son from the terrors of Auschwitz
by persuading him that his cruel keepers are only playing a game.
Smiling through a glaze of tears, Ms. Von Furstenberg went on to
characterize the plot as the triumph of not just love, but of will.
</P>
<P>
   To hear her tell it, Ms. Von Furstenberg, 51, has always
possessed a surfeit of both. One couldn't be sure, however, whether
by love she meant the flattering attentions of former boyfriends
like Richard Gere and Alain Elkann, an Italian journalist and
novelist, or the string of sycophants who kept filing by after the
screening to pay her court, addressing her as princess more than
once.
</P>
<P>
   More likely she was referring to the devotion of her daughter,
Tatiana, 27, a writer, who sat smiling affectionately at her side;
or of her longtime companion, Barry Diller, the chairman of USA
Networks, whom she called ``almost a husband.''
</P>
<P>
   Although they live on opposite coasts, they are in touch by
phone several times a day, Ms. Von Furstenberg said. Their
relationship, long assumed to be platonic, is ``very intimate,''
she said tersely. ``More than that, I'm not going to tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Her steely will is the legacy of her mother, Lily Halfin, a
survivor of Ravensbrueck and Auschwitz, and clearly the designer's
most inspiring role model. A woman of stunning resilience, Mrs.
Halfin insists to this day on putting a gloss on even her most
harrowing experiences, as described in Ms. Von Furstenberg's new
memoir, ``Diane, A Signature Life'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Von Furstenberg said her mother never tires of dispensing
homilies for her children to live by: ``Something that's bad,
you've got to turn into a positive.'' ``Believe in it and it will
go.''
</P>
<P>
   And those credos have served Ms. Von Furstenberg well. Any
student of DVF lore _ and after three decades of being in and out
of the spotlight, there are many _ can recite Ms. Von Furstenberg's
high points: an escape to boarding school from the stultifyingly
middle-class girlhood in Brussels; an early marriage to Egon Von
Furstenberg, an Austrian prince with a 500-year old title, and the
birth of her children, Alexandre and Tatiana, while she was still
in her 20s.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the vertiginous climb up New York's social
ladder, culminating in a gust of scandal with a 1973 New York
magazine cover story with the headline: ``The Couple That Has
Everything. Is Everything Enough?'' It looked askance at the louche
life style she and her husband led.
</P>
<P>
   And there was, of course, Ms. Von Furstenburg's fashion
business, which got its powerful jump-start when Diana Vreeland,
Vogue's formidable editor in chief, agreed to take a look at a
dozen or so dresses that Ms. Von Furstenberg had been peddling
around town in a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by the success of her wrap dress, a close-fitting,
patterned jersey worn by suburban matrons, socialites and
secretaries alike, that business could justifiably be called an
empire by the end of the 1970s. In 1979, annual retail sales of all
products bearing Ms. Von Furstenberg's name, from eyewear to
luggage and home furnishings, totaled $150 million. Ms. Von
Furstenberg's promotion of her label played against a backdrop of
parties, premieres and opening nights spent rubbing shoulders with
the self-venerating likes of Halston, Bianca Jagger, Ian Schrager
and Kenneth Jay Lane.
</P>
<P>
   But to bring up those days now is to make the designer squirm.
``I've really been to Studio 54 only a few times,'' Ms. Von
Furstenberg insisted, still bent, it seemed, on editing the past _
never mind that her memoir had already reached the stores. ``I
don't go to clubs and parties much.'' .
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Is this the same Diane Von Furstenberg who put off
this reporter for several days because, as she explained, nothing
could keep her from the celebrity-studded party last month to open
Bellagio, the hotel and casino in Las Vegas?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be there _ it's something you just can't miss,'' she
said with a laugh that nearly succeeded in masking her urgency. The
same Diane who confided in her memoir that, at one time, she
routinely prowled Studio 54 unaccompanied because ``I love the
feeling of walking in alone, like a cowboy walking into a saloon.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It is the same woman, indeed. Reminded of such passages, Ms. Von
Furstenberg, who has over the years chased notoriety and
respectability by turns, admitted: ``Walking into clubs by myself _
I thought it was so hot. I loved the rush. I loved to break taboos.
I very much wanted to have a man's life in a woman's body. Even now
I think of myself as very much the aventuriere.''
</P>
<P>
   She amended, ``But it's only an image,'' one among many that
over the years she has tried on and discarded like costumes. There
was feral Diane, who stalked by night, a switchblade in her
handbag. ``All I did with it was peel apples,'' she wrote. ``But I
liked the idea of having it.'' There was Diane the island goddess,
sashaying through Cloudwalk, her Connecticut estate, swathed in the
sarongs she had acquired in Bali, along with Paulo, her swarthy
boyfriend, who inspired her perfume, Volcan D'Amour, introduced in
the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   And not least, there was Diane the tycoon, who cultivated a
swagger befitting her status, striding through airports, as she
wrote, ``wearing fishnet stockings and impossibly high heels,
smiling at my shadow.'' And glorying in her success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the guys, it was so much fun,'' she recalled.
``But I never made the man feel small.'' Nor, conversely, was she
about to let any man make her feel insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   Diller, speaking by car phone from Los Angeles, said: ``It isn't
that she's competitive with men, or with anybody. But I don't think
she carried any mythology about men. And that frees her, of course,
to do what she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   According to her memoir, Ms. Von Furstenberg has emerged
chastened but toughened by many brushes with financial and personal
ruin.
</P>
<P>
   But even in her most humiliating hours, she was sustained by her
penchant for play-acting, performing the choicest parts for herself
and spooling them back in her head like a flim. The good times were
registered there: drifting on a gondola like Silvana Mangano in
``Death in Venice,'' strolling insouciantly as Dorothy Lamour along
a Balinese beach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, her empire reduced to a fistful of cheapened licensees,
she found herself pleading with executives at Wal-Mart for a chance
to revive her brand. ``Everyone was polite,'' she writes, ``but it
was quite clear from their looks and the way they talked to me that
they considered me something of a has-been.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing such nadirs in her career, she said, ``Sometimes I
feel like Willy Loman. He was such a loser _ but I completely
identify. He touches me so much because I see the enthusiasm, then
the rejection. I tell that to Barry all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1990s, with Diller cheering her on, she had
recovered sufficiently to embark on a career in telemarketing,
launching her Silk Assets line on QVC, the Home Shopping Network,
which Diller eventually purchased. ``Her resilience is bred in the
genes, it's in her very bones,'' Diller said.
</P>
<P>
   The same grit prompted her to reinvent herself once more. More
than a year ago she bought a 15,000-square-foot Greenwich Village
carriage house, which now serves as her home and fashion
headquarters. About the same time, she noticed that young women her
daughter's age were buying the wrap dress in vintage shops and flea
markets, and she promptly reintroduced the style as the mainstay of
her newly revived label.
</P>
<P>
   Never quite the runaway hit Ms. Von Furstenberg anticipated, the
dress was spotted late this past summer languishing on racks at
Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdales. ``The stores simply bought too
many,'' Ms. Von Furstenberg said, adding that Saks alone had
ordered 15,000 pieces. The fashion trade press has reported that
she has been looking for a financial partner for her business, and
in an interview she did not deny it.
</P>
<P>
   She has countered the narrowness of the wrap's appeal by
expanding her collection, offering a range of new dress styles and
prints. Her show on Tuesday, at her downtown headquarters, will be
replete with colorful day and evening dresses in her trademark
sinuous jerseys and silks.
</P>
<P>
   Removing a slinky, bias-cut sample from a rack the other day,
she glowed, clearly transported back to the '70s, a time when many
women of her generation were living out ``Fear of Flying''
fantasies of torrid encounters with strangers on trains. ``Look at
this,'' she said, running a hand appreciatively along the dress'
slippery surface. ``No zipper, no buttons, nothing. It doesn't make
a sound when you take it off.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the wrap, it is still thriving in small specialty stores,
with which Ms. Von Furstenberg says she hopes to do a small but
exclusive business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dress has tremendous cachet with girls in their 20s,''
Nicole Fischelis, Sak's fashion director, said. ``To them getting a
Diane Von Furstenberg is a big status thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lounging elastically in her living room _ a haute Bohemian
pastiche of zebra patterned chairs, sisal rugs, Balinese carvings
and gilt-threaded throws _ Ms. Von Furstenberg confided that the
dress' appeal to the young mystifies her at times. ``These girls
think of the wrap as sexy, young and daring,'' she said. ``I find
that amazing. Why? Because it speaks of my own culture.''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled, remembering that the wrap, a perfect meld of
sexiness and propriety, had in its heyday been the chic uniform of
a roster of celebrities. One of her fondest recollections, however,
is of the woman she met while making one of her countless personal
appearances at Saks. ``She was a call girl,'' the designer said,
``She told me that it was such a good dress for walking in and out
of the Regency hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was 20 years ago,'' Ms. Von Furstenberg added
resignedly. ``We certainly are much squarer than that now.''

AN OK GALANT AND SOME SERIOUS TRAINING WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is Saturday, a day usually reserved for the mundane chores of
a single householder _ laundry, errands, etc. _ but I am heading to
school instead. At an airport. Not to learn how to fly but to get a
lesson in the technique of taming teenage testosterone on the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   This is a course dedicated to teaching inexperienced
16-year-olds the basics for survival behind the wheeel _ probably a
lot riskier than flying.
</P>
<P>
   The car chosen for the excursion is a Mitsubishi Galant ES, a
car with good looks and no other particular distinction, unless a
list price less than $18,000 is your idea of distinction. The
Galant is a family of automobiles, starting with the under-$17,000,
four-cylinder DE fairly well equipped, and graduating to the
$24,250 (plus $435 delivery) LS.
</P>
<P>
   The marque has been through a counter evolution of sorts, having
once been a techno-wonder with infinitely adjustable electronic
suspension guaranteed to induce mal de mer devolving to, depending
on price and engine, either a tame little inoffensive car or a
zippy little bit of fun. This ES is in the inoffensive class, doing
nothing particularly well but certainly nothing badly.
</P>
<P>
   The trip today is a roughly 50-mile jaunt to an airport at
Concord, N.H., starting with a pleasant stretch of winding road
past some still blazing patches of autumn color, through some
construction, onto interstate and finally into city traffic.
Approaching the airport, arrows mark the way to the Stevens
Advanced Driver Training School, Sandy Stevens proprietor,
currently in session for newly-minted young drivers _ drivers who
haven't really mastered elementary driving yet.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate arrow points to a hole in the fence around the
perimeter of the airport; there is no gate, no driveway, merely an
opening _ and of course there is the curbing to climb. In the
distance, I see the familiar white Tauruses of the Stevens School;
between me and them is an overgrown field. This is a small sedan,
not a sport/utility!
</P>
<P>
   I ease over the curb _ nothing scrapes _ and head into the tall
grass, hoping. I hear the sound of water underneath, then realize
it is merely grass rushing against the undercarriage as we bump
along together, the Mitubishi and I. Bud Stanley of the driving
school greets me, explains the drill.
</P>
<P>
   It is basic brake-and-steer instruction, frst with antilock
brakes, then without. It is necessary to teach the use of ABS,
Stanley says, but because so many youngsters drive older cars
without it, it is also necessary to give a grounding in what is
called threshhold braking _ how to do what ABS does for you.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is set up on an unused runway; far away, aircraft drone
on and off a working runway. ``Forget school parking lots, will
you?'' Stevens tells me. There isn't room enough, he says, to
ensure safe operation. There are plenty of underused airport
runways around within easy reach of high schools, Stevens says.
``If there's enough room to land an airplane safely, you know it's
safe enough for driver training.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has a trailer equipped as a classroom _ TV monitor,
overhead projector and all _ parked at the side of the runway. His
students have already done the classroom portion and are driving.
Some parents are participating, too.
</P>
<P>
   I climb into the back seat of a Taurus; up front Stanley is
coaching Paul, 16, through an exercise I last saw Stevens use in a
police training course. Paul heads the car down a cone-marked lane
at 45 miles per hour toward a solid wall of cones. At either end is
a light and a gate _ an open space. When a light is triggered, Paul
must brake, turn toward the gate nearest the light, go through the
gate, turn the opposite way, then turn again to pass through
another gate in line with the original course on the other side of
the cone barrier. With ABS, it's fairly easy _ as long as you brake
before you turn with the ABS. But this time it's with the ABS
turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Paul isn't very smooth first pass, but makes it _ he would not
have crashed. At 50, it's harder, but Paul is thinking, executes
fairly well. At 55, momentum is multiplied, the exercise more
difficult, more ... exciting. Later, I watch as Paul's father, an
experienced driver, brakes sqealing, tires smoking, blows through
the barrier sending cones flying. ``What do you bet the kid asks to
drive home?'' somebody says.
</P>
<P>
   This training session is a joint operation of Stevens, a New
Hampshire-based driver trainer of long experience and solid
credentials, and Co-operative Insurance, a small underwriter in
Vermont and New Hampshire. Co-op is new to the car insurance
business, having dealt mainly in farm insurance; Harold F. Burke, a
special investigator for the company and a booster of the program,
fills me in. Co-op, he says, takes a different view from the
conventional _ why charge the inexperienced driver high premiums,
in effect charging him for what he hasn't done yet? Why not train
the inexperienced to reduce risk and consequences?
</P>
<P>
   Co-op figures it costs $250 per day per driver in the course and
will pay approximately half the cost for the teen applicant. Having
completed the training, the teen is then qualified for a discounted
premium on his auto insurance _ that alone pays for his share of
the training. So far, about 140 youngsters have successfully
completed the course.
</P>
<P>
   The company saves even when accidents occur, Burke said. The
average cost of a young driver's first accident is around $4,000.
Young drivers with advanced training sometimes have accidents, too,
but the cost averages around $800, according to company figures.
</P>
<P>
   The session is over and it's back into the Galant and through
the tall grass once more. The 2.351-liter four-banger is somewhat
restrained by the automatic transmission, a smooth four-speed;
acceleration isn't great. The brakes are good. Handling is so-so,
not great, not bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's bottom-of-the-line, perhaps, but not bottom-feeder _ it's
fairly well-equipped. To speak of back-seat room in this car is to
gild the lily _ there isn't much head or knee space and the rear
doors are quite narrow at the bottom making entry/exit tight. Radio
controls are mixed _ too many too-small bits on the control panel.
One of the two cupholders up front is obscured by the armrest that
doubles as lid for a small but deep bin. Fuel mileage is very good
_ 26.66 miles per gallon overall for 560 miles measured.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it important to brake first with ABS, then turn?
Because, as Stanley demonstrated so well with yours truly hanging
on in the passenger seat, with ABS you can brake and turn. But, if
you turn first, as weight shifts when you brake, all the force is
directed to the outside front wheel. Now the ABS is reading the
other three lightly loaded wheels as about to lock up _ so the
brakes on those wheels are off more than on. The brunt of the
braking effort is borne by that lone front wheel, thus stopping
distance is significantly lengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is no substitute for knowledge.

CRITICS OF MEGA-MERGER OF AT&AMP;T AND TCI COMPLAIN TO THE FCC 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ AT&AMP;T Corp., the nation's largest long distance
carrier, is betting heavily on transforming cable TV from an
entertainment-oriented medium into a telecommunications pipeline
that will penetrate local phone market monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T says its pending $48 billion merger with TCI Corp., the
nation's No. 2 cable TV provider, will allow consumers one-stop
shopping _ local and long distance telephone services, Internet
access, e-mail, high speed data transmission _ all through cable TV
hookups and all itemized on one monthly bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this local phone capability offers the consumer is a
choice of local phone companies, a choice of local services, and a
choice of local prices,'' said C. Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's CEO and
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But Armstrong's vision isn't shared by consumer advocacy groups
and an array of telecommunications companies with interests as
diverse as local and long distance service, Internet access, direct
broadcast and wireless communications.
</P>
<P>
   They asked the Federal Communications Commission last week to
stop the merger unless AT&AMP;T is required to give competitors equal
access to TCI's cables that connect to about 14 million U.S.
households.
</P>
<P>
   Among those filing formal petitions challenging the merger were
AOL Inc., Ameritech, the Consumer Federation of America, Echostar
Communications Corp., GTE Corp., the Independent Cable and
Telecommunications Association, Mindspring Enterprises Inc., SBC
Communications Inc., Sprint Corp., the Wireless Communications
Association International, US West, and MCI Worldcom Inc.
</P>
<P>
   GTE assaulted the merger for being ``brazenly
anti-competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   US West officials said the union ``poses grave risks to
competition in a number of markets.'' The merger would result in a
giant ``with combined revenues of nearly $60 billion and with
leading positions in fields spanning virtually the entire
communications industry.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL, the nation's largest online service, said consumers
potentially could benefit but warned that competition might suffer
unless the FCC steps in.
</P>
<P>
   Echostar, a direct broadcast satellite distributor and a cable
TV competitor, said AT&AMP;T's exclusive control over what runs over
TCI's cables ``would be a sufficiently serious anti-competitive
concern standing alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Federation of America charged that, despite AT&AMP;T's
assurances to the contrary, ``consumers will certainly face
spiralling cable TV rates and discriminatory practices restricting
customer choice and competition in telephone, video, Internet and
other advanced services.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the complaints focus on the fact that cable TV providers
and telephone companies face different levels of federal
regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, two wires carrying commercial services enter most
American homes _ the phone line and the cable TV line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paradoxically,'' GTE said, the phone wire ``is subject to a
host of regulatory requirements that open their lines for consumers
and competitors while the cable broadband line is under no such
constraints.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity in regulations is apparent in Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC requires that phone companies, or common carriers, allow
consumers to have access to any Internet provider they choose. This
allows the 25 million U.S. Internet subscribers with telephone
connections to select from among numerous providers.
</P>
<P>
   Cable TV operators aren't subject to that FCC requirement. As a
result, an estimated 300,000 consumers who gain access to the
Internet through cable TV hook-ups are forced to use their cable
company's preferred Internet provider _ usually Time Warner's Road
Runner or At Home, which is partly owned by TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritech called on the FCC to ``promote a level regulatory
playing field and dismantle regulatory distinctions based on
technology and industry segments.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, MCI said ``there should be no regulatory distinction
between telecommunications services provided over cable facilities
versus the traditional telephony structure.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T officials argue that the merger will bring competition to
local phone markets, which are dominated by the so-called Baby
bells such as SBC, US West, Ameritech, Bell South and Bell
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong argued that the Baby Bells and their new corporate
alliances pose a serious threat to competition that increases the
rationale for AT&AMP;T's purchase of TCI.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed mergers between Bell Atlantic and GTE, and SBC
and Ameritech threaten to create a Ma Bell East and a Ma Bell West
controlling more than a third of all homes in America _ 55 million
phone lines,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their version of our communications future is very different.
It's built not on consumer choice but on extending their local
monopoly,'' Armstrong said.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Peterson, a telecommunications analyst with the Yankee
Group _ a Boston-based consulting firm _ believes the merger
ultimately will be approved because it promises competition in
local phone markets, a major reason Congress deregulated the
telecommunications industry in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal gives credence to the concept of using cable for some
of the services that were traditionally offered by the monopolies,
namely voice communication and Internet access,'' said Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger must be approved by the FCC, and a decision
is expected by next spring. In addition, the Justice Department is
examining the merger for anti-trust implications.

THEME PARKS FIND PROFIT IN FRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., Ind., La., Mass., Mich., Mo.)  (mk) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Strange things are going on at Universal Studios
Florida. Roving bands of chain-saw-brandishing hoodlums pursue
fleeing customers through darkened streets. Zombies and demons
lunge from every nook and cranny. Shrieks and foul odors emerge
from haunted houses. Basically, in the words of one Universal
employee, the theme park wants ``to try to make you scream until
there's no sound left.''
</P>
<P>
   Confused? Look at your calendar. It's the night of that annual
visit from creepies and crawlies and things that go bump in the
night. For Universal, though, the more compelling reason is
financial: For 19 nights starting on Oct. 2, the park has been
harvesting millions of dollars from its Halloween Horror Nights _
perhaps as much as $11 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   A crucial part of the financial equation, of course, is that the
fall is normally the worst season for tourism in Orlando and this
was once a fairly slow month here. Or, as Tom Williams, chief
executive of Universal Studios Escape, which includes both Florida
parks, put it recently in an interview in his office on a backlot
in the park, the Halloween Horror Nights have transformed ``what
would otherwise be a sleepy Thursday in October.''
</P>
<P>
   And that transformation is stark. ``We make no claim to be sweet
or family-oriented during our Halloween nights,'' said Tom
Schroder, a park spokesman. ``We pride ourselves on having an
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement would not surprise any of the nightly multitudes
who alternately watch and shrink from the Festival of the Dead
Parade, a macabre march in which even the stiltwalkers exude
diabolical intent. Park publicity advises customers: ``Due to
certain adult themes and the intensity of this event, parental
discretion is advised for children ages 3 to 9.''
</P>
<P>
   But older kids, and sometimes their parents, love it. ``This is
our second year celebrating Halloween at the park,'' said Robert
Cohen, visiting from France with his wife, Brigitte, and their son,
Michael, 13. ``It's very scary, but that's why Michael and I love
it. We want to be frightened.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost every year the family spends two weeks in Orlando. Mrs.
Cohen, less enthralled by the scary stuff, accompanies them to the
park _ she prefers that to sitting alone in their hotel room _ but
she keeps a sharp eye out for the stalkers and axe murderers while
avoiding the haunted houses. She hates being cooped up.
</P>
<P>
   A half hour away, Walt World Resort also has Halloween events,
but for only three days. And in an apparent dig at Universal, it
bills its celebration at the Magic Kingdom as Mickey's Not-So-Scary
Halloween Party, adding that Mickey and his friends ``host a
delightful, rather than frightful'' event.
</P>
<P>
   Universal, whose Halloween celebration is in its eighth year, is
not the first theme park to discover the nexus between fright and
finance; Knotts Berry Farm in Buena Park, Calif., is celebrating
its 26th Annual Halloween Haunt. Universal, though, stretches the
theme a bit further: Its celebration runs 19 nights this year,
compared with Knotts' 16, and it wants to make it a monthlong
event.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly seems feasible, considering that since it began
in 1991, over one weekend with one haunted house, it expanded to
eight nights in 1995 and now encompasses five weekends, with five
haunted houses. ``We've had double-digit growth every year,''
Williams said. ``And once you've designed all the attractions, the
incremental cost is insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the 19 nights, big crowds pay as much as $42 apiece,
their autos and vans creating bumper-to-bumper traffic for miles on
nearby Interstate 4. ``We pretty much limit attendance to 25,000 so
people can have a good time,'' Williams said. Halloween Horror
Nights, when the park closes at 6 p.m. and reopens an hour later,
with an additional admission, ``is like 19 extra days in the
calendar,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   How profitable are these scare-fests? On the subject of money,
Universal executives here are almost as tight-lipped as
Frankenstein's monster, who was brought to the screen in a number
of Universal films.
</P>
<P>
   But assuming the park averages 17,000 visitors a night, at
perhaps a $28 average admission price (discounts abound), Halloween
Horror Nights would bring in about $9 million this year, plus $2
million or so for food and souvenirs. One must, of course, subtract
from that figure what the park would take in if it were running
normally, but in October that would be modest.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated $11 million may be a drop in the bucket for the
$9.8 billion Seagram Company, the parent of Universal Inc., which
owns the park jointly with the Rank Group, the $1.2 billion
London-based leisure and entertainment company. But for a park this
size _ its 8.9 million visitors last year were a distant second to
the 39.6 million at Disney's Magic Kingdom, Epcot Center and MGM
Studios at Walt Disney World _ it is a nice bit of extra income.
</P>
<P>
   While an estimated 90 percent of horror night crowds hail from
central Florida, a good many come from Georgia, and from as far
away as Indiana, Louisiana and Missouri. Some out-of-staters no
doubt come here to visit Disney World and the area's many other
attractions, but many also come expressly for this event.
</P>
<P>
   Denise and Eric Chamberlain come here from Detroit, just to be
scared. ``This is our third year,'' said Mrs. Chamberlain, a
28-year-old computer operator for EDS Inc. ``But we only attend
Halloween Horror Nights one night, because I scare very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   The other day Jay Canter and a companion arrived here from Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. ``I drive up in the morning and go back the next
day,'' said Canter, 22, who has attended Horror Nights three other
years. As for his 430-mile round trip, ``The haunted houses are
cool,'' he explained, ``and I like getting scared.''

</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios Vacations, the company's travel arm, has two
Halloween packages _ the One Night Spooktacular, starting at $69 a
person, double occupancy, which includes a hotel for one night and
an admission, and a Two-Night Gory Getaway, from $115 a person.
</P>
<P>
   Universal spends months planning, recruiting and rehearsing for
the monthlong show. ``This is the biggest event we have,'' said
Skip Sherman, senior vice president for entertainment. ``It takes
an entire year. And since we're part of a movie company, people
expect to see something of quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that movie company, Universal Studios, also gave cinematic
life to Dracula and the Creature from the Black Lagoon, everything
from prosthetics to mummies to blood-spattered victims is created
in meticulous detail. Each haunted house takes about a month to
build.
</P>
<P>
   The odors of decay, rotten flesh, mold and formaldehyde are
formulated in New York especially for the park. Rope, dripping
water, varied floor elevations and heat blasts are intended to
divert and discombobulate the hordes who stumble through the
haunted houses, hoping to avoid the ghouls who materialize from
behind pictures or peer down from overhead vents _ not to mention
the slashers, mutants, madmen, and even a deranged dentist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goblins and ghosts don't do it for our audience, which is very
demanding,'' Bill Hartnett, director of entertainment production,
said between showing visitors through the haunted houses. To try to
bring new twists to the terror, Universal employees have traveled
to New Orleans to learn about vampires and voodoo, and visited
Salem, Mass., a town rich in witchery, whose own three-week
Halloween celebration is called Haunted Happenings.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the haunted houses, hundreds of actors stalk the
artificially fog-shrouded streets, lunging at unsuspecting visitors
while delivering frequent blood-curdling screams. Grungy-looking
members of the Chain Saw Drill Team rev up real, working chain saws
(sans blades) that sound like amplified squadrons of killer bees.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should see the look of terror in some people's eyes, even
when you just pretend to start up the chain saw,'' said David
Johnson, who works in the park's entertainment department during
the day but wields a chain saw at night. ``It's always fun when you
phone friends back home and they say, `You're doing what?'''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Universal, the perennial Avis to Disney's Hertz in
Orlando entertainment, is working full tilt to have its new park,
``Islands of Adventure,'' open next summer. It too will have a
separate admission.
</P>
<P>
   Five islands, all built around different themes, will be linked
by boat or a bridge from the park's CityWalk, a retail center with
a Nascar Cafe, Jimmy Buffett's Margaritaville, a Hard Rock Cafe, a
Bob Marley Tribute with Jamaican cuisine and reggae music, even a
Motown Cafe with live entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In another move emulating Disney, Islands of Adventure will also
have the first hotel at a Universal site, a 750-room Loew's
property.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's investment in a second Orlando park is mainly
intended to entice visitors to lengthen their stay from the usual
one day to five or six days, even if it means sharing some of those
days with other Orlando theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   No one here has suggested as much, but a visitor to Islands of
Adventure cannot help thinking that the Universal executive suite
must have given some thought to the possibility that at least three
of the islands would be pretty good sites for Halloween
celebrations of their own. With separate admissions, of course.

 FOR REITs, A FUTURE ACCORDING TO DARWIN  
(For release Sunday, Nov. 1) 
(af) 
 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the mid-'90s, Wall Street has had two main ways to invest
in real estate: mortgage-backed securities for big institutional
investors and real estate investment trusts for retail investors.
Now, the mortgage-backed market is paralyzed, as is much of the
world of bond investing. What about REITs?
</P>
<P>
   For three years, these companies poured the money of
enthusiastic investors into hotels, office buildings and shopping
malls. Their market capitalization jumped from $44.3 billion in
1994 to $140.5 billion in September.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 174 so-called equity REITs _ which buy properties,
not mortgages _ showed growth rates approaching 20 percent and
traded at 20 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But with investors concerned that the real estate market may
have peaked, REIT stocks have fallen on average about 21 percent so
far this year. Shares of trusts that buy hotels have declined 50
percent; those that buy office buildings are down nearly 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of go-go growth for REITs are gone,'' said Thomas J.
Barrick, chairman of Colony Capital, a real estate investment fund
based in Los Angeles. ``REIT's will go on, but you're going to have
unbelievable consolidation. You'll go from 170 REITs to 10, all
first-class operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say REIT stocks will come to be regarded more like
utility stocks, growing slowly and throwing off ample dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Whyte, a Morgan Stanley Dean Witter analyst, calls REITs
``fabulous utility substitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The capital markets' big role in real estate during the '90s, he
said, has imposed a new discipline on the industry, cutting off
financing for development deals that might have led to oversupply.
</P>
<P>
   So rents should continue to rise, driving up the REITs cash
flows, Whyte said. He expects real estate stocks to generate
earnings growth of 6.5 percent to 7 percent annually, as well as to
pay, on average, a 6.8 percent dividend _ much better than the 3.7
percent average yield on utility stocks.

 &HT;    MOVEMENTS AGAINST MALARIA BEGIN TO STIR
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The World Health Organization (WHO), the World Bank
and two United Nations agencies unveiled a ``Roll Back Malaria''
campaign Friday aimed at getting control of the rapidly spreading
disease.
</P>
<P>
   One of humanity's deadliest and stubbornest scourges, malaria
kills an estimated 2.7 million people a year, nearly half of them
small children and pregnant women.
</P>
<P>
   Yet efforts to control it have failed, and in recent years the
spread has accelerated. In the African nation of Senegal, deaths
have increased sevenfold in just five years, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of WHO, the World Bank, the U.N. Development Program
and UNICEF, the U.N. fund for children, said the new campaign would
concentrate on strengthening the ability of local public health
agencies and nongovernmental organizations to respond to outbreaks
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, newly elected director general of the
World Health Assembly and former prime minister of Norway, said
human suffering and economic burden of malaria are
``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to using satellite mapping and climate data to
pinpoint the presence of malaria, the initiative will increase
funding for research and support of community-level public health
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF officials said the fund will increase the use of
pesticide-soaked mosquito nets. Research funded by WHO and the U.S.
Agency for International Development demonstrated that this simple
and inexpensive measure can significantly reduce the incidence of
the disease among children.
</P>
<P>
   The latest attempt to confront malaria comes at a time when
other groups, ranging from a civic club in Normal, Ill., to the
National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., have also begun to
take action the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Drake Zimmerman, a member of the Normal Rotary Club, is pushing
a plan to get individual Rotary clubs to buy and distribute the
mosquito nets. He said other Rotary members in Switzerland and
Australia have independently started similar campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Rotary clubs were a driving force behind the global campaign to
eradicate polio, a project for which Rotary International has
raised hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman thinks mass purchasing and other private sector
approaches could cut the cost of nets and biodegradable pyrethroid
insecticides in half. He has set up an Internet site
(http://www.bednet.org) to promote the idea.
</P>
<P>
   But the nets keep the female Anopheles mosquito and the
plasmodium parasite she carries away from only some potential
malaria victims, and the research indicated the resulting reduction
in deaths ranged as low as only 25 percent in some areas.
</P>
<P>
   A possibly more effective, but so far elusive, measure would
involve immunization. Efforts to develop a vaccine received a shot
in the arm Oct. 16 when a team of Navy doctors in Bethesda reported
that by injecting malaria genes into human volunteers, they
stimulated strong immune responses.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reported in the journal Science that the gene
they stripped from plasmodium caused no serious side effects among
the 20 volunteers, while stimulating them to develop more
antibodies against the disease than a natural infection would have.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to antibodies, the naked DNA vaccine stimulated the
second half of the immune response system, spurring the development
of ``killer T-cells'' capable of destroying infected cells.
</P>
<P>
   Trials to determine if persons given the vaccine are resistant
when exposed to the malaria parasite have yet to be attempted.

LABOR OF LOVE: 53-YEAR-OLD WOMAN SERVES AS SURROGATE, DELIVERS
DAUGHTER'S TWINS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
 
By JEANNIE KEVER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ In family lore, it already has become known as simply
``the story.''
</P>
<P>
   As in, the story of how 53-year-old Joan Stein served as a
surrogate mother for her daughter and son-in-law, delivering the
couple's twins _ her own grandchildren _ in late September at St.
Luke's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not particularly conventional,'' Stein says.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Jayme Morgan, agrees. ``She's unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Enter Ella Rose Morgan and Sax Avery Morgan as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   For Stein, it was a way to pass the torch of motherhood to her
only daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have really enjoyed my children. That's it,'' she says.
``And I just wanted her to enjoy the same opportunity. I never
thought about grandchildren. I don't work. I was in pretty good
shape and ... it didn't seem that hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Avrum Stein, was supportive, although as a
physician he first had to be convinced that such a late-in-life
pregnancy wouldn't be too risky for his wife of more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   That accomplished, the couples embarked upon an
intergenerational adventure unconventional even in the high-tech
world of baby making.
</P>
<P>
   None of them ever dreamed it would come to this, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Jayme, the oldest of Joan and Avrum Stein's three children, had
the most traditional of expectations when she married Scott Morgan,
an executive with his family's Houston-based real estate
development company, the Morgan Group, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   They enjoyed two carefree years before deciding to start a
family.
</P>
<P>
   Six months passed, and she wasn't pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   And so the Morgans entered America's infertility pipeline,
officially joining the estimated 15 percent to 20 percent of
married couples unable to conceive a child without medical
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   This new life centered around powerful, mood-altering hormones
and invasive surgeries.
</P>
<P>
   Hope and disappointment. Big money.
</P>
<P>
   As with most couples seeking treatment for infertility, the
Morgans' health insurance didn't cover the cost. Scott Morgan
estimates that they spent about $200,000 on their baby quest.
</P>
<P>
   Infertility treatments range from drugs to boost ovulation or
treat an underlying infection or hormone deficiency to a number of
high-tech procedures. The American Society for Reproductive
Medicine estimates that Americans spent $197.7 million on in vitro
fertilization in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In vitro is the original assisted reproductive technology, now
20 years old, and is used to create ``test tube babies'' by
stimulating the woman's ovaries to produce multiple eggs, which are
then removed and combined with the man's sperm to create embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The embryos are transferred back into the woman in the hope that
they will attach to her uterus, resulting in pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Jayme Morgan were young and healthy, and doctors
deemed them good candidates for in vitro fertilization. Over the
next few years, they enrolled in a variety of infertility programs
in Houston and elsewhere, trying in vitro eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Three times, the pregnancy test came back positive.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, it was an ectopic pregnancy, with the embryo lodged
in the fallopian tube rather than descending into the uterus.
</P>
<P>
   Jayme Morgan, 29, says it was never clear exactly why she
couldn't sustain a pregnancy; she eventually underwent several
surgeries to increase her odds of success.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing worked.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors suggested using donor eggs. The Morgans resisted, saying
they were willing to have a child who wasn't genetically linked to
each of them but were not convinced that they wouldn't succeed on
their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   They also considered adoption but ranked it as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   Through each disappointment they kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a mindset,'' Jayme Morgan says. ``We had a goal.
We knew the only way to get there was to be aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   With every failure, they allowed themselves a one-day ``pity
party'' _ he would stay home from work, she would rage and cry.
</P>
<P>
   Then they'd start another round of hormone shots.
</P>
<P>
   Having children, 30-year-old Scott Morgan says, ``wasn't an
option, it was a requirement. Family is everything to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Stein, a trim, healthy woman who has always been athletic,
first broached the idea of serving as a surrogate several years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, `Wouldn't that be incredible?' But ... no way,''
Jayme Morgan says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't worth it to us to risk her (health),'' Scott Morgan
adds.
</P>
<P>
   But as the months passed, they did begin to think about hiring a
surrogate to carry their child.
</P>
<P>
   There are no generally accepted statistics on the use of
surrogate mothers _ having another woman carry a child, either by
conceiving it or by having an embryo implanted in her uterus. In
1995, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 65
babies were born in the United States to surrogate mothers through
in vitro fertilization, according to the American Society for
Reproductive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Many surrogate arrangements involve relatives or close friends
of the infertile couple, but the practice of hiring strangers to
serve as surrogates has grown in the past decade. Commercial
agencies have sprung up to match would-be parents with potential
surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   By the summer of 1997, the Morgans were ready to consider it.
They spent the summer in San Diego, where Scott Morgan was involved
in a business deal, and discussed the idea with a doctor there.
</P>
<P>
   Surrogacy is legal in all states, but case law in California
already had established a precedent favoring the rights of genetic
parents over the birth mother. That lessened the fear that a
surrogate mother would back out of the deal and try to keep the
baby.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor referred them to an agency, and they began to sift
through lists of potential surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   None seemed right. Many were in their late 30s or early 40s, and
some were overweight or had other health problems. The Morgans
worried about having no control over the surrogate's diet and
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, Stein noticed an article in The New York Times
about women older than 50 giving birth, and once again mentioned
the idea of serving as a surrogate.
</P>
<P>
   Not so long ago, it would have been unthinkable. Women in their
50s rarely had babies, and certainly not by high-tech means. That
began to change as older women urged infertility clinics to push
the boundaries, proving that even postmenopausal women could
sustain a healthy pregnancy using donor eggs and hormone
injections. The idea gained notoriety last year, when doctors
announced that a 63-year-old Southern California woman had given
birth to a healthy daughter in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If few women older than 50 give birth, it is even less common
for a woman older 50 to serve as a surrogate. ``You're getting into
a really low number,'' says Heather Kowalski of the American
Society for Reproductive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But it's not unprecedented for a woman to carry her own
grandchildren. The first case in the United States occurred in
1991, when a 42-year-old librarian in South Dakota gave birth to
twins produced from her daughter's eggs, fertilized with sperm from
the daughter's husband.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgan family contacted the Pacific Fertility Center in San
Francisco, which was mentioned in the article, to see if it was
plausible.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors there accepted Stein as a patient but also suggested a
ninth attempt at helping Jayme Morgan get pregnant through in vitro
fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   When the time came, they implanted embryos created from Jayme
Morgan's eggs and Scott Morgan's sperm in both women.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan's pregnancy test came back negative. Stein's test was
positive.
</P>
<P>
   At age 52, she was pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   The younger couple had always been open about their frustrating
attempts to have a baby, but Joan and Avrum Stein were more
circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 52, you wonder how you're going to tell your mother you're
pregnant ... with your grandchildren,'' says Joan Stein, who
celebrated a birthday before the babies' birth.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Avrum Stein, a pathologist, says he told
``virtually no one, because I didn't want to explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the pregnancy progressed, they took the quizzical looks
of strangers in stride. The reaction from most people ``has been
fabulous,'' Joan Stein says.
</P>
<P>
   Their two sons, neither of whom lives in Houston, were
supportive, knowing the lengths to which their sister had gone in
her efforts to have a child.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Stein's parents, who also live out of town, took the news
with aplomb, although both worried about the physical toll,
fretting through frequent telephone calls to check up on their
daughter's health.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, who hadn't yet entered menopause, endured 10 weeks of
hormone therapy before and during the first weeks of pregnancy to
prepare her body, until the placenta had formed and was ready to
take over supporting the twins.
</P>
<P>
   She continued to work out for the first five months, despite
nausea during the first trimester. The last three months were
marked by indigestion, but she insists that ``it was absolutely the
easiest pregnancy. I really wasn't limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Carpenter, the Houston obstetrician who cared for
Joan during the pregnancy and delivered the babies, said, ``Joan
had as nice a pregnancy as you could ever want, both for her age
and for twins.'' She was his first patient to serve as a surrogate
for her own daughter, and Carpenter says he expects the situation
to remain rare.
</P>
<P>
   But Stein's age didn't make her unique.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter has delivered babies for a number of women in their
50s, including a 51-year-old and a 52-year-old earlier this year.
Like Stein, they became pregnant through in vitro fertilization,
using donor eggs. But most of his fiftysomething patients have
gotten pregnant naturally, including a 54-year-old woman who was
pregnant for the 17th time.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter grew close to both couples during the pregnancy,
coming to view Stein's decision as an act of love and generosity.
</P>
<P>
   Their story, he says, is important not only because of what it
says about modern science but also because of its message about
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's a very neat and special person,'' he says. ``It
took a lot of sacrifice for her and her husband to choose to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein gained 12 pounds during the pregnancy, trying to eat only
nutritious foods. ``I probably ate better than I have in years and
years,'' she says. ``It's a heavy responsibility. It's one thing
when you're pregnant with your own children, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   The low point came last summer, when her oldest son got married.
She isn't exactly the pink polka dot type, so shopping for a
mother-of-the-groom dress in a maternity shop wasn't a lot of fun.
Still, she and her husband figure it gave the wedding guests a hot
topic of conversation.
</P>
<P>
   And if they occasionally would have preferred to avoid the
curiosity _ they report with a mix of bemusement and exasperation
that Joan Stein's mother insisted on telling ``the story'' to
everyone they met at the wedding _ they also saw it as a natural
extension of family love.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans accompanied Stein to most of her doctor's
appointments, sharing the excitement of learning their children's
gender _ they are fraternal twins, one boy and one girl _ and
watching them squirm during ultrasound examinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun, and it went really fast,'' Jayme Morgan says of
the pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   In August, she and her husband even moved into her parents'
River Oaks home while waiting for their own to be remodeled.
They've promised to move out before the babies' first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans were declared the legal parents before the birth,
allowing their names to be placed on the birth certificates
immediately. The Steins' health insurance covered the delivery; the
babies were covered by their parents' insurance after the birth.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the four planned the delivery room protocol, devising
a way for the Morgans to participate without compromising Joan
Stein's privacy. ``After all, he's still my son-in-law.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it was time for the delivery _ Wednesday, Sept. 23,
about 3 { weeks before Stein's due date _ she began having chest
pains and the babies developed signs of distress. They were born by
emergency Caesarean section; everyone recovered nicely.
</P>
<P>
   Ella weighed 3 pounds, 5 ounces; Sax weighed 5 pounds,1 ounce.
They spent nine days at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston,
demonstrating their individual personalities almost immediately:
Ella is calm and easygoing; Sax is demanding and temperamental,
``the devil child,'' say his parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``But no complaints,'' Scott Morgan quickly adds.
</P>
<P>
   Stein, meanwhile, went home after three nights in the hospital.
Hours later, she was eating a steak dinner at a local restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, she was thinner than she had been before the
pregnancy, telling everyone that she felt great.
</P>
<P>
   And getting quite a kick out of the reactions she encountered as
the news spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``People would say, `Are you going on Oprah?' ''
</P>
<P>
   They'd joke that they're holding out for Jerry Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Now between endless feedings and diaper changes and hastily
snatched sleep, Scott and Jayme Morgan reflect on the long road
that brought them to parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Each round of in vitro fertilization was ``this little piece of
hope,'' Jayme Morgan says, and hope has been rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Stein insists she has had no trouble separating her roles as
surrogate and grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I don't like them,'' she says of the twins. But
then again, it feels good to relax downstairs, listening to the
twins wailing overhead and knowing that her daughter and son-in-law
are rushing around with bottles and diapers, feeding and burping.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, `Are you going to nurse them?' No. I nursed my
own children. These aren't mine,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The Morgans say they will tell the twins the circumstances of
their birth as soon as they're old enough to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such an incredible way of getting here,'' Jayme Morgan
says. ``We'll just tell them, `We wanted you so badly, and this is
how we could get you.' '' &QL;

AN OK GALANT AND SOME SERIOUS TRAINING WHEELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is Saturday, a day usually reserved for the mundane chores of
a single householder _ laundry, errands, etc. _ but I am heading to
school instead. At an airport. Not to learn how to fly but to get a
lesson in the technique of taming teenage testosterone on the
highway.
</P>
<P>
   This is a course dedicated to teaching inexperienced
16-year-olds the basics for survival behind the wheeel _ probably a
lot riskier than flying.
</P>
<P>
   The car chosen for the excursion is a Mitsubishi Galant ES, a
car with good looks and no other particular distinction, unless a
list price less than $18,000 is your idea of distinction. The
Galant is a family of automobiles, starting with the under-$17,000,
four-cylinder DE fairly well equipped, and graduating to the
$24,250 (plus $435 delivery) LS.
</P>
<P>
   The marque has been through a counter evolution of sorts, having
once been a techno-wonder with infinitely adjustable electronic
suspension guaranteed to induce mal de mer devolving to, depending
on price and engine, either a tame little inoffensive car or a
zippy little bit of fun. This ES is in the inoffensive class, doing
nothing particularly well but certainly nothing badly.
</P>
<P>
   The trip today is a roughly 50-mile jaunt to an airport at
Concord, N.H., starting with a pleasant stretch of winding road
past some still blazing patches of autumn color, through some
construction, onto interstate and finally into city traffic.
Approaching the airport, arrows mark the way to the Stevens
Advanced Driver Training School, Sandy Stevens proprietor,
currently in session for newly-minted young drivers _ drivers who
haven't really mastered elementary driving yet.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate arrow points to a hole in the fence around the
perimeter of the airport; there is no gate, no driveway, merely an
opening _ and of course there is the curbing to climb. In the
distance, I see the familiar white Tauruses of the Stevens School;
between me and them is an overgrown field. This is a small sedan,
not a sport/utility!
</P>
<P>
   I ease over the curb _ nothing scrapes _ and head into the tall
grass, hoping. I hear the sound of water underneath, then realize
it is merely grass rushing against the undercarriage as we bump
along together, the Mitubishi and I. Bud Stanley of the driving
school greets me, explains the drill.
</P>
<P>
   It is basic brake-and-steer instruction, frst with antilock
brakes, then without. It is necessary to teach the use of ABS,
Stanley says, but because so many youngsters drive older cars
without it, it is also necessary to give a grounding in what is
called threshhold braking _ how to do what ABS does for you.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is set up on an unused runway; far away, aircraft drone
on and off a working runway. ``Forget school parking lots, will
you?'' Stevens tells me. There isn't room enough, he says, to
ensure safe operation. There are plenty of underused airport
runways around within easy reach of high schools, Stevens says.
``If there's enough room to land an airplane safely, you know it's
safe enough for driver training.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has a trailer equipped as a classroom _ TV monitor,
overhead projector and all _ parked at the side of the runway. His
students have already done the classroom portion and are driving.
Some parents are participating, too.
</P>
<P>
   I climb into the back seat of a Taurus; up front Stanley is
coaching Paul, 16, through an exercise I last saw Stevens use in a
police training course. Paul heads the car down a cone-marked lane
at 45 miles per hour toward a solid wall of cones. At either end is
a light and a gate _ an open space. When a light is triggered, Paul
must brake, turn toward the gate nearest the light, go through the
gate, turn the opposite way, then turn again to pass through
another gate in line with the original course on the other side of
the cone barrier. With ABS, it's fairly easy _ as long as you brake
before you turn with the ABS. But this time it's with the ABS
turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Paul isn't very smooth first pass, but makes it _ he would not
have crashed. At 50, it's harder, but Paul is thinking, executes
fairly well. At 55, momentum is multiplied, the exercise more
difficult, more ... exciting. Later, I watch as Paul's father, an
experienced driver, brakes sqealing, tires smoking, blows through
the barrier sending cones flying. ``What do you bet the kid asks to
drive home?'' somebody says.
</P>
<P>
   This training session is a joint operation of Stevens, a New
Hampshire-based driver trainer of long experience and solid
credentials, and Co-operative Insurance, a small underwriter in
Vermont and New Hampshire. Co-op is new to the car insurance
business, having dealt mainly in farm insurance; Harold F. Burke, a
special investigator for the company and a booster of the program,
fills me in. Co-op, he says, takes a different view from the
conventional _ why charge the inexperienced driver high premiums,
in effect charging him for what he hasn't done yet? Why not train
the inexperienced to reduce risk and consequences?
</P>
<P>
   Co-op figures it costs $250 per day per driver in the course and
will pay approximately half the cost for the teen applicant. Having
completed the training, the teen is then qualified for a discounted
premium on his auto insurance _ that alone pays for his share of
the training. So far, about 140 youngsters have successfully
completed the course.
</P>
<P>
   The company saves even when accidents occur, Burke said. The
average cost of a young driver's first accident is around $4,000.
Young drivers with advanced training sometimes have accidents, too,
but the cost averages around $800, according to company figures.
</P>
<P>
   The session is over and it's back into the Galant and through
the tall grass once more. The 2.351-liter four-banger is somewhat
restrained by the automatic transmission, a smooth four-speed;
acceleration isn't great. The brakes are good. Handling is so-so,
not great, not bad.
</P>
<P>
   It's bottom-of-the-line, perhaps, but not bottom-feeder _ it's
fairly well-equipped. To speak of back-seat room in this car is to
gild the lily _ there isn't much head or knee space and the rear
doors are quite narrow at the bottom making entry/exit tight. Radio
controls are mixed _ too many too-small bits on the control panel.
One of the two cupholders up front is obscured by the armrest that
doubles as lid for a small but deep bin. Fuel mileage is very good
_ 26.66 miles per gallon overall for 560 miles measured.
</P>
<P>
   So why is it important to brake first with ABS, then turn?
Because, as Stanley demonstrated so well with yours truly hanging
on in the passenger seat, with ABS you can brake and turn. But, if
you turn first, as weight shifts when you brake, all the force is
directed to the outside front wheel. Now the ABS is reading the
other three lightly loaded wheels as about to lock up _ so the
brakes on those wheels are off more than on. The brunt of the
braking effort is borne by that lone front wheel, thus stopping
distance is significantly lengthened.
</P>
<P>
   Technology is no substitute for knowledge.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ In her first year at Stanford
University's business school, Ann Livermore submitted the winning
plan to manage the student snack bar. Soon she was persuading
corporate recruiters to buy doughnuts from her to serve at
presentations. The companies thought nothing of paying 50 cents for
doughnuts that cost her a nickel.
</P>
<P>
   Following tradition, she was allowed to keep her profits.
Breaking tradition, she made a small fortune _ enough, in fact, to
pay for her entire MBA education. The next year, the administration
took the business back for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Livermore has always set her sights high, and now she is
suddenly in a position to scale the peaks of one of the most
male-dominated industries in America. Two weeks ago, she was named
to head the new Enterprise Computing Solutions organization at the
Hewlett-Packard Co., the world's second-largest computer maker.
</P>
<P>
   The promotion thrust her into the company of America's most
powerful women executives. Enterprise Computing Solutions, which
markets all of Hewlett-Packard's computers except for desktops, has
44,000 employees and estimated annual sales of $15 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a handful of women, including Carly Fiorina at Lucent,
Jill Barad at Mattel, Andrea Jung at Avon and Lois Juliber at
Colgate, have assumed operating roles of this size, scale and
complexity,'' said Caroline W. Nahas, managing director for
Southern California of Korn Ferry International, the executive
search firm. ``It's a significant announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new job has made her a contender to succeed Lewis E. Platt,
Hewlett's chief executive, when he reaches the company's retirement
age of 60 three years from now. But Mrs. Livermore, who is 40,
played down the significance of her sudden proximity to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, what I'm worrying about is how I'm going to learn
17,000 new names,'' she said with a laugh. Turning serious, she
added, ``I have never in my HP career thought about what my next
job is going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   That may not be spin. The secret of her success seems to be the
intensity of purpose she gives to whatever task is at hand. Until
she got her new assignment, she was vice president and general
manager of the company's software and services group, which handles
everything from Internet commerce and consulting to telephone
support.
</P>
<P>
   There, she set a goal for her businesses to grow at twice the
industry average. And for each of the last four years, they
expanded by 20 percent or more, meeting or exceeding her target.
</P>
<P>
   She has also earned a reputation as an iron-willed manager, and
considers herself a disciple of Jim Arthur, a now-retired
Hewlett-Packard executive whose intimidating manner has made him
something of a company legend.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mrs. Livermore has a gracious manner that has made her one
of the most popular bosses at Hewlett-Packard. She remembers a
colleague once telling her that she was ``one of the few people who
can tell you to go to hell and you'd look forward to the ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether she is really material for the top job remains an open
question, of course. A 16-year veteran at Hewlett-Packard, she is
not a technology buff. Even so, those who work with her say she is
a quick study on almost any topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ann can take a complex business situation and really
understand the implications,'' said Joe Beyers, a Hewlett-Packard
executive who worked for her in starting several Internet
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   She views customer satisfaction as the key to growth. She breaks
down the concept into three components, to which she gives equal
weight: customers' pure satisfaction with a product; the likelihood
that they will buy it again, and the likelihood that they will
recommend it to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Livermore _ nee Martinelli _ grew up in Greensboro, N.C.
When she was 8 or 9, her father, an insurance company executive,
showed her some ``big old IBM mainframes'' in his office and
explained how they worked. She was so taken with them that she
became a volunteer key punch operator, entering data for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time I didn't realize I was cheap labor,'' she said.
``But I'd sit down with pages and pages of stuff that had to be
key-punched, thinking that this was the greatest thing in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't love of computers that brought her to Silicon
Valley. As a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, she made trips to both Harvard and Stanford to decide where
to go to graduate school. It was no contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``In March, I visited Harvard and it was wet, cold, snowy,
ugly,'' she said. ``I came to Stanford and people were sitting out
by the swimming pool looking at their accounting books.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before her recent promotion, her stature had grown. Last
year, she became a member of the board of United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   She likes nothing more than spending the day alone with her
husband, Tom, an executive at a Bay Area packaging company, and
their 9-year-old daughter, Emily. An avid skier and a fledgling
golfer, she says she can still unplug more completely than some of
her associates when she is away from work. More than most
companies, Hewlett-Packard operates on voice mail _ but she says it
hasn't taken over her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm on vacation,'' she says, ``I don't listen to
voice-mail messages.''

AHOY, CHIC PEACOATS: NOT FOR SAILORS ONLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 1) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID COLMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the peacoat first appeared on the backs of mod
Londoners in the early 1960s, it was an integral part of the
biggest fashion revolution of the decade. Reaching only to
mid-thigh, its brief shape was in keeping with what Vespa-riding
Italians had ordained to be the new length for outerwear.
</P>
<P>
   The warm, woolen navy coat, which rightfully belonged to
sailors, became a favorite among style makers, who found that it
had a perverse chic, a working-class inelegance. And it shielded
them from the cold when few of their other plastic, mini,
see-through clothes could.
</P>
<P>
   The peacoat's macho appeal was forever compromised when a young
designer named Calvin Klein introduced a far more stylish model, in
white, which appeared on his first Vogue magazine cover. Almost 30
years later, the peacoat is once again checking (that's selling
well, in retail lingo). While its short style has a perennial
appeal, the sporty length is particularly suited to men who want a
single overcoat that looks equally appropriate with business or
casual clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the peacoat's universal appeal, it has been hard in
recent years to find one at anywhere other than an Army-Navy
surplus store.
</P>
<P>
   This year, a variety of designer versions have dropped anchor.
Polo Ralph Lauren on Madison Avenue has an archetypal peacoat, in
rigid wool, roomy enough for a brawny deckhand and with an anchor
etched onto each plastic button, for $297.50.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Jacobs in Soho did one in a cashmere and mink blend for
$1,800. (Stevedores, take note: the mink is said to help waterproof
the fabric.)
</P>
<P>
   At Bergdorf Goodman, there are traditionally cut peacoats from
Michael Kors in navy cashmere, for $1,295, and peacoats in black or
camel wool by the young designer Matt Nye, for $995.
</P>
<P>
   At Saks Fifth Avenue, there are two versions from Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana _ a nubby royal blue wool, for $895, and a gray blanket
wool from the designers' D &AMP; G line, for $695. But both of these
designs pose a potential rub. Cut close to the body, for a manly,
military look, they afford little leeway for anything more than a
sweater underneath. A suit jacket would be a problem. Any peacoat
that is meant to double as an overcoat should be tried on with a
jacket and without.
</P>
<P>
   The peacoat master, Klein, is offering one this season that
strays from the classic. Cut slightly larger, the coat, which costs
$895, provides a neat fit when worn with a blazer underneath, but
with anything less, it takes on a slightly slouchy, trench-coatish
silhouette. While the coat, made of a wool blend, may be too
lightweight for the bounding main, it's OK for braving a sea of
cabs.

A STYLISH JOE AND HIS JOE'S MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 1) 
(bl) 
 By RICKY LEE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stylists are the pillow-plumpers of the fashion
industry. They make models and celebrities look their best by
dressing them up for catwalks, awards shows and magazine shoots.
But there is also an elite corps of super-stylists too important to
merely accessorize. They work with photographers and designers to
create a concept, a mood or a vision.
</P>
<P>
   One such stylist is Joe McKenna, a collaborator with some of
fashion's most sought-after photographers. In a field of normally
behind-the-scenes types, McKenna even has his own magazine, Joe's
Magazine, which is named after himself, putting it in a field with
other publications named for their creators like Forbes and Jane.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike these high-profile efforts, Joe's Magazine is a super
glossy, photo-driven coffee-table publication for the fashion
cognoscenti. Contributors include the photographers Bruce Weber,
Craig McDean, Steven Klein and Jurgen Teller, who are also
McKenna's friends.
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of Joe's Magazine might drive a subscriber around
the bend. The first issue came out in 1992. The second is scheduled
to appear this week.
</P>
<P>
   Known for understatement, McKenna, who was dressed in a gray
sweatshirt and jeans at a Greenwich Village cafe the other day,
offered little explanation for the six-year hiatus. ``I kept
meaning to do it,'' he said. ``It's just that I never really found
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   He does stay busy. He looked jet-lagged, having flown in from
Hamburg, Germany, where he helped Jil Sander with her spring 1999
collection.
</P>
<P>
   It might seem like a busman's holiday for McKenna and his circle
to spend their off-hours doing the same stuff they do for their day
jobs _ only for no money and a smaller audience. Their incentive,
they say, is the freedom to work without commercial constraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like it would be nice to do pictures where we didn't
really have to worry about whether or not that person had a movie
coming out, or an exhibition opening or whether we had to worry
about getting certain clothes into the sitting,'' McKenna said.
</P>
<P>
   His magazine is filled with images that often seem strikingly
unstyled. A fashion feature by Teller shows the model Kristen Owen
curled in a fetal position in a flower bed wearing grungy corduroys
and New Balance sneakers. Daniel Meadows' simple photographs
capture young, working-class English people wearing their own
matching plaid suits and other accidentally fashionable outfits.
Weber shot Kate Moss topless, blowing bubbles.
</P>
<P>
   ``What separates Joe from other stylists is that he is open to
exploring his fantasies,'' said Weber, who also contributed
portraits of Hubert de Givenchy, the French couturier, and Carolyn
Bessette Kennedy. ``He's interested in a lot of things: art,
literature, music.''
</P>
<P>
   When the first issue of Joe's Magazine came out, its 3,000
issues sold out at $45 each in a matter of weeks. There were
pictures of Paul Cadmus by Bruce Weber, stories about the actor
Dirk Bogarde and the French singer Vanessa Paradis and a portfolio
of the designer Azzedine Alaia. The new issue is bigger than the
last, 200 pages, and McKenna plans to print 5,000 copies to be sold
for $80 at bookstores.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the last time, there is almost no text this time, apart
from a brief interview with Miuccia Prada, whose advertising
campaigns McKenna often styles. ``I just decided in the end that
maybe articles weren't that necessary,'' McKenna said. ``I didn't
want to write things just to fluff up the pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenna, who was raised in Glasgow, has been reading fashion
magazines since he was 11. His entree into the fashion elite came
when Weber noticed his work in the English magazine Tatler and
invited him to New York. In 1986, he became the fashion editor of
Vanity Fair, followed by a brief stint at Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   McKenna finances the magazine himself and isn't looking for
further backing to increase its frequency. ``I haven't gotten that
far,'' he said. ``But I do think I'd like to do another one.'' Plan
to look for it it 2004.

HOT RACES TO WATCH ON TUESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 1.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The hot races to watch on Tuesday will determine
the fortunes of seven scions of the nation's most prominent
political families, six long-serving incumbents and four women who
won Senate seats in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest race of all, of course, will affect the fate of a
politician who isn't even on the ballot. The aggregate results of
the contests for 34 Senate seats and many of the 435 House seats
will influence the breadth and timetable of the House impeachment
inquiry into President Clinton's sex and cover-up scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But the nation's political future also depends on which party
controls the 50 statehouses. Republicans hope to expand their
domination beyond the 32 governorships they already hold _
including those in 8 of the nation's 10 most populous states. Of
the 36 governorships up for grabs, 24 are already in GOP hands.
</P>
<P>
   The two sons of former President George Bush are heading into
their gubernatorial races with commanding leads, according to
pre-election polls.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is expected to trounce Democratic
challenger Garry Mauro with important help from Hispanic voters.
His victory could propel the former part-owner of the Texas Rangers
baseball team into the Republican presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   His brother, Miami businessman Jeb Bush, appears to be staging a
comeback from his 1994 defeat in Florida at the hands of Democratic
Gov. Lawton Chiles. In this year's contest, Bush is ahead of Lt.
Gov. Buddy McKay by about 10 points in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, a fourth-generation representative of the politically
prominent Taft family _ Ohio Secretary of State Bob Taft _ appears
headed for victory in his race against Democrat Lee Fisher, a
former state attorney general, for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Taft's father and grandfather represented Ohio in the Senate.
His great-grandfather was President William Howard Taft, who also
served as chief justice of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, name recognition is helping Democratic Attorney
General Hubert H. Humphrey Jr., son of former Vice President Hubert
Humphrey, in his tight race against Republican Norm Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   Second-term Democratic Gov. Evan Bayh is running far ahead of
Republican rival Paul Helmke in his bid to represent Indiana in the
Senate. Bayh's father Birch Bayh served in the Senate for 18 years
until Dan Quayle beat him in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, Republican Sen. Judd Gregg, son of former
Republican Gov. Hugh Gregg, a kingmaker in New Hampshire
presidential primaries, holds a 40-point lead over a little known
Democratic challenger, civil engineer George Condoemetraky.
</P>
<P>
   In Rhode Island, Democratic Rep. Patrick Kennedy, youngest son
of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, faces three unknown challengers in his
all-but-certain bid for a third two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Other well publicized governorship races have nothing to do with
political dynasties.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where the stakes are formidable, Democratic Lt.
Gov. Gray Davis is leading Republican Attorney General Dan Lungren
in a bid to succeed two-term GOP Gov. Pete Wilson. With the state
legislature in Democratic hands, a Davis victory would assure
Democrats a sweet prize _ domination in redrawing boundaries of the
state's 52 House districts for the 2002 election. The state
controls 20 percent of the electoral votes needed to win the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   And in Michigan, second-term Gov. John Engler is well ahead of
his challenger, Democrat Geoffrey Fieger, a lawyer for Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, the practitioner of doctor-assisted suicide. Fieger has
committed a series of gaffes that have contributed to Engler's
32-point lead in the latest survey. In one news conference, Fieger
offered _ and then withdrew _ a proposal for a $450 million state
tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual development for a midterm election, the Texas
lieutenant governor's race is taking on added significance.
Politicians are watching it closely because of the possibility that
George W. Bush will run for president in 2000. In the second-spot
battle, Democratic state comptroller John Sharp is running
neck-and-neck with Republican agriculture commissioner Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Six political veterans face challenges of varying intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who has served in the Senate for 18
years, faces a stiff challenge from Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.,
an 18-year veteran of the House. D'Amato's hopes for a fourth
Senate term may turn on voters' reaction to D'Amato's denigration
of Schumer as a ``putz head,'' which is Yiddish for penis and in
American slang means fool or jerk.
</P>
<P>
   With 32 years of service in the Senate, Fritz Hollings, D-S.C.,
is locked in a tight race for re-election against Republican Bob
Inglis, a third-term congressman.
</P>
<P>
   Three longtime House members are fighting for political survival
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Brown, D-Calif., a 34-year veteran, is seeking an
18th term in a tough race against Republican businessman Elia
Pirozzi.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, Democratic Rep. Charlie Stenholm, a 20-year House
veteran, is struggling for an 11th term against Republican San
Angelo Mayor Ruddy Izzard. Stenholm is hoping his support for the
GOP's wide-ranging impeachment inquiry will help offset Texas
Republicans' generous financial support for Izzard.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lane Evans, D-Ill., who has served in the House for 16
years with strong support from organized labor, is trying to hold
off a stiff challenge by Republican Mark Baker, a former television
anchorman.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, who has occupied the state house
for 12 years, appears headed for a fourth term despite the
challenge of Republican Ed Garvey. Thompson, listed by GOP
presidential nominee Bob Dole as a possible vice presidential
running mate in 1996, could play a key role in the presidential
sweepstakes in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's outcome also will determine whether the stunning 1992
``year of the women'' Senate victories by Democratic Sens. Barbara
Boxer of California, Patty Murray of Washington and Carol
Moseley-Braun of Illinois will be repeated. Sen. Barbara Mikulski,
D-Md., who won her second term in 1992, is expected to win another
one this year.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Boxer pulling slightly ahead of California Republican
state Treasurer Matt Fong and Murray leading her GOP challenger,
second-term Rep. Linda Smith.
</P>
<P>
   But Moseley-Braun, the first African-American woman to serve in
the Senate, is lagging behind millionaire Republican state Sen.
Peter Fitzgerald, whose attacks on her ethics have forced her to
air an apology. ``I know I've made some mistakes and disappointed
some people,'' Moseley-Braun says in a campaign ad. ``But I want
you to know that I've always tried to do what's best for
Illinois.''
</P>
<P>
   In yet another hot race, Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., is well
ahead in fighting off a comeback effort by former 11-term Rep. Bob
Dornan, the fiery California Republican who waged a bitter 15-month
campaign to deny Sanchez her 1996 victory by disputing the legality
of some ballots. The House ultimately rejected his claim.

BIG MONEY POURS INTO CALIFORNIA ELECTION

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ More than $34 million poured into California
political compaigns in the last week, with a tobacco industry
effort to stamp out a cigarette tax leading the way, an analysis of
campaign finance reports shows.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos. Inc. contributed almost $6 million from Oct.
20-28 to the effort to defeat Proposition 10 _ making it the
biggest giver in the campaign's final days, the analysis by the San
Francisco Examiner showed.
</P>
<P>
   More than $4.7 million went to both sides in the other
high-stakes state measure on Tuesday's ballot, Proposition 5, which
would allow expanded gambling at Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   And more than $10 million was reported to campaigns for state
office and the state propositions on a single day _ Oct. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was based on records filed in the secretary of
state's office of contributions of $1,000 or more made after Oct.
19, the end of the last campaign finance reporting period.
</P>
<P>
   The infusion of money drives the escalating advertising wars in
the days leading up to Tuesday's election and has renewed debate
over the need for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   The real action was in the ballot measures, where big tobacco is
trying to turn voters against what started as a popular move to
fund childhood development and anti-smoking programs through a new
50-cent-per-pack cigarette tax.
</P>
<P>
   And, in what is expected to be the most expensive ballot measure
in state history, Indian tribes are going toe-to-toe with Nevada
casinos and organized labor over allowing expanded gambling on the
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco giants, led by Philip Morris, contributed $7.6 million
over the eight days, records show.
</P>
<P>
   During the last two weeks of a campaign, contributions of $1,000
or more must be reported to the state. Candidates for federal
office aren't covered by the state law.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions by the tobacco companies to defeat the
cigarette tax made the No on Proposition 10 campaign the biggest
recipient of late money.
</P>
<P>
   A representative for the anti-Proposition 10 campaign said the
money would fund ads to encourage voters to decide the measure on
its merits, rather than as a referendum on an unpopular tobacco
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been encouraging voters to carefully read this
initiative, and the ads simply point out the obvious flaws with
this big government program,'' said Matt Taggart, spokesman for the
No on Proposition 10 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devil is in the details, and if it passes, ultimately
voters will be left with more encumbered spending, a bloated,
shadow bureaucracy and no accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 10 would create state and county commissions to
decide how to divvy up an estimated $750 million annually from the
new levy on smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Roos, the former Democratic assemblyman from Los Angeles
heading the pro-Proposition 10 campaign, said the cigarette makers
were putting in cash late in the campaign in hope of avoiding
detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to hide the true source of the money,'' Roos said.
``They know the business they are in and they know people have
caught on to the fact that every year 300,000 people die because of
their product. They know that people don't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 5, the measure to loosen regulations on
reservation-based casinos, received more than $3.2 million in
contributions, disclosure reports show. The measure's financial
supporters are mainly California tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Money also has been pouring into the governor's race, in which
Democrat Gray Davis and Republican Dan Lungren are expected to
spend a combined $50 million _ a record. The Davis campaign
reported $2.2 million in late contributions, and the Lungren camp,
$2.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``For whatever reason, people have decided to contribute,'' said
Michael Bustamante, the Davis campaign spokesman. ``People like a
winner. It is hedge-your-bet time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We met our budget and we have significantly curtailed our
fund-raising activity, but money keeps coming in,'' Bustamante
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren campaign representatives didn't return telephone
messages seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state recorded 3,156 separate contribution
reports from candidates and campaigns between Oct. 20 and
Wednesday. No reporting was recorded Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients reported taking in an average $4.3 million per day as
the election drew near _ including a single $5.9 million donation
from Philip Morris to the No on Proposition 10 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Voters passed a ballot measure in 1996 imposing severe limits on
contributions to candidates for state office and ballot measure
campaigns. But a court threw it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy behind late contributions is (to allow campaigns)
to do last-minute damage attacks without the opportunity for a
response. That is the real modus operandi,'' said H. Eric Shockman,
a professor of government at the University of Southern California.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With bank credit tightening and the market for initial public
offerings bone-dry for all but the biggest deals, cash-starved
small and midsize companies are hunting for alternative sources of
money. Galloping into the breach are firms called factors, which
buy companies' accounts receivable or lend against them.
</P>
<P>
   Factors see an opportunity to break out of the niche markets
they have traditionally served _ mainly garment and textile makers
_ and venture into industries like health care, construction and
technology.
</P>
<P>
   And in a growing number of instances, factors are gaining
customers and working in business partnerships with an unlikely
ally: banks, their main competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to see that more and more,'' said Leonard Machlis,
executive director of the Commercial Finance Association, an
industry trade group for factors and other asset-backed lenders.
``When things start to tighten up, as banks lose money in emerging
markets and hedge funds, some businessmen will not be able to get
refinanced'' by banks and will turn to factors, Machlis said. Some
association members, he added, have already seen an increase in
such business.
</P>
<P>
   Floor Concepts, a commercial flooring company in Saddle Brook,
N.J., offers a case in point. When Len Gleeson and Fred Renshaw,
partners in the company, needed money to keep their business
running, they knew better than to turn to a bank.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a local branch of First Union Bank turned them down
for a loan, Gleeson said, because the company did not have the
collateral the bank required, such as ownership of its headquarters
building. And with the climate change in the financial markets
since then, the odds of getting a yes this time were probably even
worse.
</P>
<P>
   But without a cash infusion, Floor Concepts could not afford to
increase staff and buy supplies for jobs already under way or about
to start.
</P>
<P>
   So the company sold the right to collect $220,000 it was owed by
customers to Quantum Corporate Funding, a factor based in New York.
Quantum advanced Floor Concepts about 60 cents on the dollar up
front, and took over responsibility for collecting from the
customers. Quantum gets its money back as the customers pay what
they owe, and keeps a further 3 percent, called a discount, for its
profit; after that, Floor Concepts gets the balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had plenty of business, but what we really lacked was cash
to fund our business,'' Gleeson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it cost Floor Concepts considerably more to get cash
from Quantum than it might have paid in interest on a short-term
bank loan, Quantum was prepared to advance funds without insisting
on collateral that banks usually demand. With its coffers refilled,
Floor Concepts was able to bid on and win more new contracts, and
the profits from the new work should more than offset the cost of
factor financing, Gleeson said.
</P>
<P>
   Banks base lending decisions on the borrower's creditworthiness.
But to a factor, the creditworthiness of the borrower's customers
is what counts. In Floor Concepts' case, Quantum sized up the
likelihood that clients like Barnes &AMP; Noble or Hackensack
University Hospital would pay their bills.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of funds for the client _ akin to the interest rate
charged on a bank loan _ is the discount, which can vary from 2 to
4 percent on current invoices due within 30 days, to 15 percent or
more if payments are overdue or are not payable for several months,
or there is much doubt about the customers' ability to pay.
Discounts are also affected by whether a client promises the factor
a minimum amount of future business or just wants one deal, and by
how much effort the factor expects to expend to collect what is
owed.
</P>
<P>
   A 3 percent discount on 30-day receivables is equivalent to an
annual interest rate of about 42.5 percent, assuming invoices are
paid on time.
</P>
<P>
   In its current form, factoring has been around since the 1960s,
but it has been growing rapidly lately. According to a survey of
its members by the Commercial Finance Association, factors had $205
billion in outstanding advances at the end of 1997, a 21 percent
increase from 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Though garment industry-related business still accounts for 80
percent of all factoring in the country, factoring is spreading to
new industries, Machlis said, partly because of new cooperation
between banks and factors. Instead of just saying no to applicants
who cannot meet their lending requirements, some banks now steer
customers toward factors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Craig Sheinker, Quantum's president, says that every week he
receives marketing calls and visits from bank officials who are
looking to line up factors for client referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Quantum's bank, Sterling National, a unit of Sterling Bancorp,
also sends clients Quantum's way, said Michael Gallina, a senior
vice president for corporate lending at Sterling. ``If a company
doesn't have the ability to generate a profit, we probably wouldn't
do business with them'' right now, Gallina said, but the company
may grow into a profitable future customer. ``If I'm not able to
help them directly, I can refer them to somebody who can help them.
And who knows the benefits of that down the road?''
</P>
<P>
   Factors can also be useful to banks by monitoring the
creditworthiness of receivables for bank clients, or by helping the
bank keep track of collateral. ``It gives banks some comfort in
lending to companies that are having some difficulty in troubled
times,'' said Richard Romer, executive vice president of CIT Group
Commercial Services, a factor based in Livingston, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the country's largest factors are owned at least in part
by banks. Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank has a stake in CIT; Fuji Bank is an
owner of Heller Financial of Chicago, and Nationsbanc and the Bank
of New York each have big in-house factoring operations. Banks have
gotten into factoring because they like its high profit margins
compared with traditional lending, said Stewart Long, president of
Nationsbanc Commercial, the bank's factoring arm. Bank factors tend
to offer easier terms than independents but stick to the least
risky customers.
</P>
<P>
   A chance to cut financing costs led Philip Knight-Sheen,
president of Medrec Inc. of San Antonio, which places physical,
occupational and speech therapists in temporary positions at
hospitals and nursing homes, to switch from an independent factor
earlier this year to the factoring arm of Security National Bank in
San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Knight-Sheen's company, which has about $3.5 million in annual
sales, had been a client of Advantage Funding, an Atlanta-based
factor, since 1995, when his efforts to line up bank financing
proved futile. But as the company grew and its finances
strengthened, ``the interest rates became prohibitive,''
Knight-Sheen said.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement with Advantage required Medrec to finance a
large portion of each month's invoices whether or not it needed
cash that month, and the financing costs were eating up 35 percent
of his company's revenue. Now that he is using the bank, he factors
invoices only occasionally, at a lower total cost.
</P>
<P>
   Another disadvantage of using the independent factor was that
the involvement of Advantage led some customers to think Medrec was
in financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But initially, the pros outweighed the cons. ``The reason we
went with them is we didn't have the money to pay our therapists,
and the government was taking longer and longer'' to reimburse,
Knight-Sheen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advantage saved our life. For small companies that need to get
going, it's a godsend.''

U.N., WORLD BANK TEAM UP AGAINST MALARIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Three major U.N. agencies and the World Bank
said Friday that they were joining forces in a coordinated campaign
against malaria, a leading killer of the world's poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria, which is reaching epidemic proportions in Africa and
parts of Asia, Latin America and the southern fringe of the former
Soviet Union, kills about a million people a year, and children are
especially vulnerable. Experts say one child dies of malaria every
30 seconds. Around the world, malaria kills 3,000 children under 5
every day, a higher mortality rate than AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Research on prevention and cures for malaria has been all but
nonexistent in big pharmaceutical companies for more than two years
because the drugs proved not to be money-makers, experts said
Friday. At the same time the parasites that cause malaria and the
mosquitoes that carry them have alarmed public health officials
with their fast-evolving resistance to most known medicines and
insecticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing here with just about the cleverest pathogen
that's known to human medical science,'' said Dr. David Nabarro of
Britain's foreign aid agency, who will become manager of the
anti-malaria program in January.
</P>
<P>
   The project will be coordinated by the World Health Organization
in Geneva, in cooperation with the U.N. Development Program, UNICEF
and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The new drive against malaria is the first big project
undertaken by the World Health Organization's new director general,
Dr. Gro Harlem Brundtland, a former prime minister of Norway and a
public health specialist. She took over the huge agency in May,
vowing to shake it up and make it more responsive to immediate
needs.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday she called malaria a cause of rising
human suffering that targets the young and the weak, and said her
project, to be called Roll Back Malaria, was prompted in large part
by calls for help from African leaders. Experts say 90 percent of
malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brundtland also said that this project will be a
``pathfinder'' in better U.N. cooperation. The anti-malarial drive
will draw on each participating agency's special expertise, pooling
resources in an effort to eliminate costly overlaps. It is a policy
in line with Secretary-General Kofi Annan's management reforms,
which seek to streamline the way the organization works and make it
more effective.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the cooperating agencies said Friday that the
anti-malaria drive will include efforts to generate new research in
the pharmaceutical industry and to raise money from reluctant
governments, as well as local efforts to provide health centers
with insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets for village beds and
packets of fast-acting pills or suppositories for malaria
sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the first year has been estimated at about $19
million for the organizations involved, with additional money being
sought from governments where the disease is rampant and the labor
force is weakened or reduced as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funding is less of an issue than getting governments to focus
on malaria,'' said James Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank,
at Friday's news conference. ``We are trying to make the case to
financiers that this is central to the economic development of
Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   James Gustave Speth, administrator of the U.N. Development
Program, said his agency was well placed to look at the
environmental situation in countries struck by malaria _ issues of
sanitation, for example. He said the ``social fallout'' of malaria
was also of concern to his agency.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF, the U.N. children's
fund, said her organization would focus, as it already does, on
local-level work in poor communities, where malaria contributes
significantly to a high maternal mortality rate and to a high
incidence of anemia among women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Nabarro, now strategic director for human development at
Britain's Department for International Development, said in an
interview Friday that ``collective brainpower'' was necessary if
health officials had any hope of even halving malaria deaths in a
decade. He said wiping out malaria is an impossible goal.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nabarro, who has worked in Iraq and Nepal as well as Africa, and
taught international community health at the Liverpool School of
Medicine, explained that the project did not have a single goal,
like some public health campaigns. ``What we're instead trying to
do is approach an incredibly complicated health issue that's
associated partly with the way in which people have to live, partly
with a parasite that has one of the best disguises that we know _
in the face of any threat it can change its coat _ and an insect
vector that seems to be able to shake off insecticides almost as
quickly as we produce them.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Tore Godal of Norway, a tropical medicine expert who is now
acting director of the anti-malaria program, said in an interview
that one of the best hopes of finding medicine to cure the disease
may be in a plant cultivated in China and used there and in Vietnam
as a very effective treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The plant is the ching hao su. ``The Chinese have used it for
more than 2,000 years against fevers,'' Godal said.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization has been encouraging China to make
medicines from the plant to standards that would meet international
requirements, Godal said. He said that the compound in ching hao su
attacks malaria so quickly and at so many levels that it also seems
to help curtail the spread of the disease by destroying parasites
before they can be passed on.
</P>
<P>
   Godal has also been involved in trying to persuade
pharmaceutical companies to invest in anti-malarial drugs. He said
only one, Smith Kline Beecham, has showed much interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese war actually made the U.S. Army invest big in
malaria drug development, and so some pharmaceutical companies took
up leads from that effort,'' he said. But today, he said, ``There
is no sufficient commercial market for the drugs,'' so
pharmaceutical companies are shying away from projects like this
that would take years to show a profit.

BOLIVIA TO END PRISON ARRANGEMENT ALLOWING CONVICTS' WIVES,
CHILDREN TO MOVE INTO JAILS 
 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1) 
 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   COCHABAMBA, Bolivia _ Instead of marching off to choir practice
or to the mall like other junior high students, 13-year-old Marysol
Rojas has a different after-school agenda: She goes to jail.
</P>
<P>
   She's no criminal. Yet every afternoon, Marysol checks into her
father's tiny cell at San Sebastian prison in the central Bolivian
city of Cochabamba.
</P>
<P>
   There, amid the shouting, drinking and carousing of 450 inmates,
she curls up on the cement floor and tries to concentrate on her
homework.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came here, I didn't like it at all. It was full
of scoundrels,'' said Marysol, who has lived in the prison for four
years. ``But now I'm getting used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In Bolivia, prison is a family affair. Thousands of down-and-out
wives and children of Bolivian convicts have moved into the jails,
often spending years behind bars in order to survive difficult
economic times.
</P>
<P>
   Some prison experts cautiously endorse this unique,
hard-time/time-share arrangement because they say it helps to keep
families together and improves inmate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But Bolivian officials contend that drug traffickers,
pickpockets and sex offenders are dangerous role models.
</P>
<P>
   After the murder of an 11-year-old girl in a prison in January,
Bolivian President Hugo Banzer announced plans to remove all
children from the jails by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jail is not a home,'' said Mario Prada, a spokesman for first
lady Yolanda Banzer, who is leading the prison-reform campaign.
``It's not the place for a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with U.S. prisons, Latin American jails are loosely
regulated. Prisoners have more freedoms and conjugal visits are
routine. In women's jails, infants usually are allowed to stay with
their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Bolivia, however, is the only country that has allowed large
numbers of women and children to move into its jails, according to
Joanne Mariner, a prison expert with Human Rights Watch in New York
who has toured Bolivian penitentiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors led to this unofficial policy. For one thing,
the Bolivian government largely ignores the prisons. Inmates must
fend for themselves, pay rent for their tiny jail cells and even
buy their own food. Thus, family support is a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about (Bolivian) prisons is that they allow
more family contact. But the flip side is that the prisoners are
dependent on their families for a lot of basic requirements,''
Mariner said.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem was a surge in the prison population after the
passage of a draconian anti-drug law in 1988 that mandates the
immediate detention of Bolivians suspected of drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, guilt is assumed. Those detained must prove their
innocence in Bolivia's slow, often corrupt judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, 175 new prisoners entered San Sebastian prison,
compared with just eight in 1987, according to the Andean
Information Network, an independent research group that has
published a survey on Bolivian prisons.
</P>
<P>
   About 430 of San Sebastian's 450 inmates are charged with drug
trafficking. Most are small-timers, peasants who were nabbed while
trying to earn extra money by transporting a few pounds of coca
paste, which is used to make cocaine. Bolivia is the world's second
largest producer of cocaine, behind Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   With the main income earner of the house behind bars, family
members often have trouble finding work and making rent payments.
</P>
<P>
   Many simply move into the jails. For some children, jail is the
only alternative because state-run orphanages are overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear that kids are living in the jails, you might
think: `Oh my God, that's horrible!' But when you look at the
options, it might not be the worst thing,'' said Lee Cridland, of
the Andean Information Network.
</P>
<P>
   At San Sebastian prison, which is home to 175 children, freshly
showered youngsters wearing blue and white uniforms and backpacks
file through the main gate each morning, past rifle-toting guards,
and walk to school.
</P>
<P>
   Wives often leave for jobs in Cochabamba or help their husbands
build furniture in the jail's woodshop for sale to the public.
Preschool children go next door to a day-care center. Nearly
everyone is back inside the walls by 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, a shirtless inmate brushed his teeth
while holding his infant son on his shoulders in the crowded prison
courtyard. Others played volleyball or snacked on chicken and fried
bananas sold at rickety wooden food stands.
</P>
<P>
   It all gives San Sebastian the feel of an open-air market rather
than a penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   Rene Ochoa, who was jailed for drug trafficking, said that this
tranquil, Sunday-picnic atmosphere lifts his spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel the support of your family,'' Ochoa said, as he
sipped a soft drink on the second-floor balcony of the jail. ``We
try not to talk about (prison). We try to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point last year, about 2,200 children lived in Bolivia's
jails. Most are younger than 10. Adolescents are encouraged to move
out to reduce the threat of sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   Rose Marie de Acha of the Bolivian Information Center, a private
think tank in Cochabamba, contends that the policy has improved the
behavior of inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Some prisoners argue that it may actually be safer for kids to
live in jail because parents can keep an eye on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel responsible for the safety of the children,'' said
Oligario Vega, an inmate at San Pedro jail in the capital city of
La Paz.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one believes that it's an ideal arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's so humanizing, then other countries would put the
policy into practice,'' Prada said.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1994 survey at San Sebastian jail by the Andean Information
Network, nearly half of the families interviewed said they would
prefer their children to live elsewhere because they had developed
a more aggressive behavior or felt jail was a dangerous
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolivian government finally took notice after an 11-year-old
girl was raped and smothered to death by a deranged inmate in a La
Paz prison in January.
</P>
<P>
   The story was covered extensively by the Bolivian media, and
first lady Yolanda Banzer organized a publicity campaign dubbed:
``Don't imprison my childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   The outrage led to a new law that states that all women and
children must leave the jails by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   They will be sent to live with other family members or to
government shelters set up especially for them, said Jose Orias,
director-general of Bolivia's penal system.
</P>
<P>
   The forced evictions began earlier this year and sparked a
series of protests in the jails due to fears that some children
will end up on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family means everything,'' said 14-year-old Ximena Medran,
whose father has been jailed in San Sebastian for a year. ``I
wouldn't want to be separated from my father. Everyone should be
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariner, of Human Rights Watch, an independent human-rights
organization, said one justification for removing children is the
lack of prison classifications. There are no minimum security
facilities in Bolivia, thus the children must share space with all
kinds of criminals.
</P>
<P>
   But because prisoners have long been dependent on their
families, under the new policy the government will have to provide
much more support for inmates, Mariner said.
</P>
<P>
   Others say the move is part of a larger government plan to turn
the prisons into harsh symbols of punishment in order to deter
would-be criminals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to reform the jails along the lines of the
North American model without taking into account Bolivian
realities,'' said Isabelle Roger, who runs the day-care center next
to San Sebastian prison.
</P>
<P>
   Orias retorts that if inmates are so concerned about their
families, they should have stayed out of trouble in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, the prisoner should think about that issue
before committing a crime,'' he said.

 &HT;    COLUMN: It's `Heaven Bound' time at Big Bethel
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL NOVEMBER 1: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Heaven Bound,'' the classic story of erring human beings'
struggle to reach the Pearly Gates, will be presented for the 800th
time at Big Bethel AME Church on Nov. 13 and 14 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen this folk story almost every November since I came
to Atlanta _ first at the suggestion of former Atlanta Constitution
editor Ralph McGill _ and I have tried not to miss it ever.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the colorful and moving events on Atlanta's
calendar, and this year I have been given an assignment. As the
first honorary recipient of angel wings at the conclusion of the
performance a couple of years ago, I have been assigned to present
wings this year to the second honorary recipient, U.S. Rep. John
Lewis (D-Ga.).
</P>
<P>
   Congressman Lewis has been called a saint a few times lately,
principally because of his support of President Clinton, but this
will be the first concrete proof that members of his race also
regard him as saintly.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, I expect the performance of colorfully clad sinners
trying to make it to heaven and the singing of a really spectacular
choir will be pretty much the same as it was in 1930 when it was
started to raise funds to rebuild Big Bethel after it was destroyed
by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Coleman, an Atlanta lawyer and a lifetime member of the
cast, told me that Mills B. Lane, who headed the Citizens &AMP;
Southern Bank, later NationsBank, suggested a benefit performance
of some kind to raise money for rebuilding the church. He admired
the singing of the choir and suggested a concert, but two Sunday
school teachers were already at work on the allegory that became
``Heaven Bound.''
</P>
<P>
   They have been a remarkably durable group of performers. One of
the original cast is Esther McDonald, who except for one time, has
been in all the performances of ``Heaven Bound'' since 1930. She
joined Big Bethel in 1909. Cora Wofford, who joined the cast in
1936 as a saint, died this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Coleman's book, ``We're Heaven Bound,'' about the history of
the performance, published in 1992 by the University of Georgia
Press, is about to make its appearance in paperback. It is loaded
with pictures and is a treasure for all Atlantans.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the author is working on a book about the history of
the church, which is colorful itself. It was started in 1855 by
white Methodists who admitted slave members. L.P. Grant, the
engineer who designed the defenses of Atlanta for the Civil War,
contributed land down on Jenkins Street, now called Auditorium Way
because it is next-door to the old municipal auditorium.

   When the white members withdrew, turning the church over to
slaves, it was still mandatory that a white attend all services.
Once, Mr. Coleman tells me, the congregation met without a white in
attendance and a nursemaid, determined to meet the legal
requirement of the day, went and brought a white baby to sit
through the service.

   During the occupation of Atlanta by Gen. William Sherman's
forces, the little church served as a hospital for smallpox

church sanctuary at 220 Auburn Ave. N.E.

 &HT;    Definition of `tailor-made' suits debatable, but concept
catching on
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL NOVEMBER 1: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's a war of words waging wherever better menswear is being
sold.
</P>
<P>
   All over Atlanta there are marketers arguing over the definition
of a custom-made suit. The debate's combative because of the money
involved: Whereas better ``off-the-rack'' suits cost a few hundred
dollars, suits that carry the ``custom-made'' designation sell for
a base price of about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who say they make custom clothing don't even know
what `custom' means,'' contends Edgar Pomeroy, Atlanta's famous
merchant of customized suits.
</P>
<P>
   Pomeroy has detractors _ other suit-makers, mainly _ who say his
suits don't fit under the heading of ``custom-made'' either. He
refers to his $1,800-and-up suits as ``bespoke,'' and says the term
means, ``made by hand, for an individual, with (a series of)
fittings.''
</P>
<P>
   But R. Mauryce Vick, who coordinates custom suit services for
Alexxandro's Authentic Tailors, a division of Guffey's stores in
Buckhead and Marietta, says ``bespoke'' is a term that people use
far too loosely and one that should be thrown out of the menswear
vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bespoke simply means `too good to be described,''' Vick says.
``And nobody makes anything that's that good anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Between the competing commercial interests of clothiers such as
Pomeroy and Vick stand the growing number of men willing to pay
more _ much more _ for suits tailored to their specific proportions
and tastes. Vick says some of these men are being bamboozled by
clothiers who play on the public's ignorance of what a custom-made
suit entails.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you walk into a shop, and they take your measurements and
send those measurements off to some plant to make the suit, it's
not a custom-made suit,'' Vick explained. ``That's a
made-to-mmeasure suit made, custom suits provide unique degrees of
satisfaction. It's that added appeal _ the prestige factor _ that
leads clothiers to believe that custom suit sales will increase.
</P>
<P>
   Said Vick: ``I get excited about it because I know, without a
doubt, that it's going mainstream.''

 &HT;    Sopping has never sounded so good
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL NOVEMBER 1: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey

<P>
   History remembers Ross Barnett as the Mississippi governor who
stood in the way of desegregation at University of Mississippi in
1962. The folksy old cuss once suggested a less controversial
remembrance for himself:
</P>
<P>
   When I die, you can bury me deep.
</P>
<P>
   Put a jug of molasses at my feet,
</P>
<P>
   With nine biscuits in each hand,
</P>
<P>
   I'll sop my way to the Promised Land.
</P>
<P>
   Sopping, like politics, isn't as easy as it sounds. Experienced
soppers strive for the simultaneous sensation of butter, syrup and
biscuit melting in the mouth. They accomplish this by letting the
butter sit out to soften, then swirling it with slightly warmed
syrup, through which they dredge hot biscuits. Sorghum syrup is
said to taste better if you pronounce it ``sarg'm surp,'' as
old-timers do, which is the way it naturally comes out when your
mouth is full of syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other ways to use sorghum.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Sorghum Apple Stack Cake
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 cake, up to 10 layers, serving 16 Preparation time: 40
minutes Cooking time: 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   This may be the most famous Appalachian dessert. Stack cakes are
assembled from layer upon layer of thin, biscuitlike cakes mortared
together with apple filling. Joseph Dabney, author of a new book on
mountain cooking, ``Smokehouse Ham, Spoon Bread &AMP; Scuppernong
Wine'' (Cumberland House), tells a story about stack cakes: At
old-time weddings, neighbors would bring layers to make a cake, and
a bride could measure her popularity by how tall the cake was. This
version has 10 layers, so she must be very popular.
</P>
<P>
   1/2cup butter

   and cover bottom of skillet equally. Bake for 12 minutes. Loosen
cake layer with spatula and place on a dinner plate, then spread
with a thin layer of hot apple filling (recipe below). Continue
baking layers and stacking them with apple filling. Do not cover
the top layer. Cover with plastic wrap and let set overnight.

vegetables.

   Clarise Shepherd of Jamestown, Tenn., grew up in a large
Appalachian family and remembers what an event it was every fall
when the first sorghum syrup was made. ``We knew there would be
gingerbread soon in the kitchen,'' she says. The name of her
recipe? Farm wives used to make gingerbread to sell at the polls on
Election Day.

knead lightly until the stickiness is gone and dough can be handled
easily by hand. Form each tablespoonful into a biscuit shape. Place
on lightly greased cookie sheets and bake for about 18 minutes. Do
not flatten the dough on the cookie sheet, and they will hold their

 &HT;    The Mennonites of Tennessee, known for old-time religion, are
making some old-time sorghum syrup, too
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL NOVEMBER 1: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey

   MUDDY POND, Tenn._When the Mennonites moved into this rocky
corner of the Cumberland Plateau, so many people drove out to look
that a neighbor posted a sign christening their gravel road the
Muddy Pond Interstate. It was 1965, and the newcomers seemed rather
peculiar to the local crew cuts and beehives. The women wore
bonnets like pioneers. The men wore beards that looked as thickety
as the mountain underbrush.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have thought we were hippies,'' laughs John
Guenther, the head of the first family to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend tourists are still coming today, but for a different
reason: They want to sop, not gawk. The Mennonites, known for their
old-time religion, are practicing some old-time cooking as well,
making sorghum syrup the way highland Southerners have been doing
for generations.
</P>
<P>
   On a warm autumn Saturday, a couple of dozen customers sit under
the shade of an oak tree and watch as the grinding wheel turns. Two
horses, harnessed to a long, weathered log, plod in a wide circle
around a man who stands on a platform feeding stalks of cane into a
press. A stream of green liquid gushes out the other end of the
machinery, through a burlap filter and into a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you mind if I took a stalk?'' asks one of the
spectators, Clarise Shepherd of nearby Jamestown. ``I'd like to
take some back to my granddaughter. I don't think she's ever seen
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of us these days probably haven't seen sorghum. For decades
now, refined white sugar has been America's sweetener _ as
universal as salt and pepper. It wasn't always that way. Before
granulated sugar became widely available around the turn of the
century, it was too expensive for most people. Americans relied on
other, more distinctive sweeteners such as molasses, honey and
maple syrup. In the South, people made their own syrups from
sorghum and sugar cane and used them to sop biscuits and flavor
everything from cakes to collard greens.
</P>
<P>
   There is something of a divide in this region when it comes to
syrups. In the lower South _ especially the sugar country of
Louisiana _ people swear by cane syrup. The South Georgia town of
Cairo, home of the Roddenberry syrup factory, is so identified with
cane that the local high school team is called the Syrup-makers.
</P>
<P>
   In the hills and mountains of the upland South, on the other
hand, syrup has traditionally been made from sorghum, a grass that
grows in spearlike stalks reaching as high as 15 feet. Sweet
sorghum (not to be confused with a variety widely grown for fodder
in the Midwest) is cultivated for syrup on small farms from
Virginia to Kansas, with the greatest acreage in Kentucky and
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the acreage is all that great. While cane syrup has
held its own, sorghum has dwindled. When the Georgia mountain town
of Blairsville held its first sorghum festival 28 years ago, there
were perhaps 30 syrup mills in the area. Now there are fewer than a
third that number.
</P>
<P>
   Changing tastes are one reason. For palates raised on white
sugar and maple-flavored pancake syrups, sorghum can have an
unpleasant off-flavor _ a little grassy, sometimes downright
bitter. It's not unusual for the schoolchildren who tour the Muddy
Pond sorghum mill to crinkle their noses when they sample the amber
syrup.
</P>
<P>
   John Guenther never turned up his nose at sorghum. The leader of
the Muddy Pond Mennonite community grew up on the Canadian plains
of Saskatchewan in a poor family that ate blackstrap molasses, the
harshest-tasting syrup. When he moved away and tried sorghum for
the first time, it seemed sweet by comparison. Settling in
Tennessee as a young man, he thought sorghum would be a fine thing
to build a farming village around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if we could make it at first,'' he says. Not
only did he burn his first batch of syrup, but he had trouble
communicating with the local folk. Guenther was raised in a
German-speaking family and still has a curious Canadian-Teutonic
accent. Tennesseans sounded just as funny to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't understand them,'' he says. ``I'd go down to the
store, and they'd be telling these jokes, and I'd come back home
crying, thinking they were laughing at me. But these people have
really accepted us. These hillbillies around here are all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Guenther certainly acts like one of the boys now. During sorghum
season, from Labor Day through the end of October, you can usually
find him holding forth among the visitors at the mill, a perpetual
look of amusement on his face. At 58, he has a long, gray-flecked
beard that falls into twin forks, like Yosemite Sam's, and wears a
pair of overalls that seem to have putty-colored dirt woven into
the fabric. He is the patriarch of an extended family of 25 that
works and lives together on 740 acres of farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The Guenthers started out as old-order Mennonites, members of a
back-to-the-roots Protestant church that practices nonconformity to
the point of eschewing modern technology. They cleared their land
at Muddy Pond with horses and crosscut saws, and for years refused
to drive or use electricity.
</P>
<P>
   But they have made allowances. Guenther gave in and bought a
couple of used pickup trucks. And though there's still no
electricity in his house, he couldn't get by without it at the
sorghum mill.
</P>
<P>
   The syrup-making process starts in the fields where the sorghum
is cut by hand and left to dry two or three days. Most of the juice
is extracted on site with portable presses run off tractor engines.
But they always save some cane to crush the old-fashioned way, with
horses, for the tourists. The juice is then piped into the mill, a
shedlike structure with screened windows and clouds of sweet steam
that make it hard to see from one end to the other. The sap pours
into a 20-foot-long pan where it boils for 20 or 30 minutes, as men
stand over the sides skimming green scum off the top. The juice
loses perhaps 90 percent of its volume to evaporation before
emerging, thick and golden, from a tap where bonneted women fill
jugs and jars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking this to my mother,'' says one customer, Arthur Hart
of Chattanooga, as he walks out with a freshly filled quart jar
that feels as warm as a napping cat. ``I want a stack cake for my
birthday, and she can't make it without sorghum.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guenthers don't sell stack cakes, but they sell just about
everything else made with sorghum, from fudge to gingerbread. The
chief baker is John's wife, Emma, a no-nonsense woman with a flat
Indiana accent who doesn't see eye to eye with her husband on
technology. She dislikes it so much that when visitors aim a camera
in her direction, she sometimes shoos them away like yellow
jackets. In fact, she wishes her husband had never bought a pickup
or a tractor. She's a horse-and-buggy Mennonite, even in the
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about this cool weather is that I can cook on
my wood stove,'' she says. ``I always feel like it's Sunday morning
when I can use my wood stove.''
</P>
<P>
   She does all this wonderful baking on a wood stove?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' she says, after a moment's hesitation, ``I actually do
my baking on a gas stove.''
</P>
<P>
   Sin never tasted so sweet.

AIR FORCES SQUARE OFF IN `DEFENDER CHALLENGE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SIG CHRISTENSON  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Some of the world's top troops gather here Sunday
for what one general described as the ``Pro Bowl'' of
anti-terrorist and security forces competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tackling runners or throwing footballs, the nearly
200 uniformed personnel from the United States, Great Britain and
Canada _ battling for top honors at ``Defender Challenge '98'' _
will compete with rifles, machine guns and grenade launchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the one time each year that the `best of the best' of
security forces compete against each other in the craft and tools
of our trade,'' said Brig. Gen. Richard A. Coleman, commander of
the Air Force Security Forces Center, based at Lackland Air Force
Base.
</P>
<P>
   The contest, which ends Nov. 7, is being held at Lackland and
Camp Bullis for the first time. It follows the center's move to San
Antonio last year.
</P>
<P>
   Previously named ``Peacekeeper Challenge'' and held at Kirtland
Air Force Base in Albuquerque, N.M., the contest is rooted in a
1952 marksmanship competition sponsored by the old Strategic Air
Command.
</P>
<P>
   It went international in 1981, when the Royal Air Force joined a
dozen other teams at Kirtland. Since then the contest has focused
on likely terrorist and enemy scenarios, and this year has been
given a new name, Defender Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's based on fire team tactics with heavy emphasis on
physical fitness, weapons application and patrolling which requires
demanding teamwork,'' Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The base defense and anti-terrorism tactics are ``overall
security measures that one could be expected to be called on to
perform anywhere in the world to defend Air Force resources,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman likened the event to the NFL's Pro Bowl, held each
January in Hawaii, saying Defender Challenge is ``the place where
the Security Forces display their best.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the 168 team members arrived here Friday, they
endured competition within their commands, much as Olympians do,
Security Forces Center spokesman Denton Lankford said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this the `Olympics' of security forces competition,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Security force teams from 12 Air Force commands, the Royal Air
Force Regiment and Canadian Forces Air Command will square off
starting Monday at Lackland and nearby Camp Bullis, where the Air
Force maintains a $20 million anti-terrorist training facility.
</P>
<P>
   Rifles with infrared sights, grenade launchers and an iron
constitution are key elements of the contest, which kicks off
Monday. Team members will thread their way through a 1.1-mile
obstacle course over hilly terrain. Among the 21 obstacles they
must negotiate are a row of X-shaped logs dubbed ``the tough nut''
and a trench covered by mesh and barb wire.
</P>
<P>
   A new computer-driven handgun course filled with pop-up steel
targets is part of the handgun competition, as is a first-ever
nighttime M-16 rifle marksmanship course.
</P>
<P>
   Capping the event is the ``chief's challenge,'' a showdown where
one team member from each unit works Lackland's ``confidence
course.''
</P>
<P>
   Teams and individuals will be honored with gold, silver and

 &HT;    Fringed gentian
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   McCaysville, Ga._Call it a walk on the wild side.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Patrick, a botanist with the state Department of Natural
Resources' Georgia Natural Heritage Program, had come to help me
find out what grows on this land. I had invited him to visit
because so many of the plants are new to me _ and because I wanted
to know if any were among the state's rare or endangered ones.
</P>
<P>
   Looking through ``Protected Plants of Georgia,'' the fascinating
book published in 1995 by the department (Patrick is one of the
authors), I noted several that had been seen in Fannin County,
including two sedges (Blue Ridge purple and Fraser), both of which
were designated as threatened. Also threatened was the small
whorled pogonia, a perennial herb.
</P>
<P>
   Cited as endangered was goldenseal, while pink and yellow
lady-slippers were listed as unusual.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with the book, I had searched for any of these plants _
and others that might have shown up from other counties (entirely
possible, as they cannot read and thus do not know where their
official homes are).
</P>
<P>
   Since winter, the only listed plant I'd found was pink
lady-slipper, which grows near the cabin in a shaded area under
pines and hardwoods, amid drifts of ground cedar.
</P>
<P>
   However, I'd seen much that I didn't recognize _ protected or
not. I needed help.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick gave me a lot, including a simple way of telling a red
oak from a white one: ``The leaves. Red oaks' lobes are pointed;
white oaks' are rounded.'' This I learned on a chilly October
morning as we stood on the back porch, where we were almost at eye
level with the tops of several oaks.
</P>
<P>
   We headed for the woods and hit the ground rushing, as a shower
was blowing in; as it turned out, the welcome rain just released
the woods' wonderful fragrances, leaving us unsoaked under
leaf-thick trees.
</P>
<P>
   Good water and good plants are inextricably linked, Patrick
noted, explaining that springs, for example, ``need vegetation to
protect water quality'' _ a view reflected in broad-based
endorsements of Amendment 1 in Tuesday's vote on funding
acquisition of wild lands.
</P>
<P>
   What delightful discoveries on my wild land. Patiently, Patrick,
who must have seen plants like mine a million times, explained what
they were, when they bloom, their habits, sometimes, their lore.
</P>
<P>
   Ground cedar puts up spores, which, Patrick said, are so
flammable that photographers many years ago put matches to them to
light subjects.
</P>
<P>
   We saw sweet goldenrod, aster, sassafras, hearts-a-bustin',
trailing arbutus, Christmas fern, New York fern (tapered at top and
bottom, it, like Big Applers, ``burns its candle at both ends''),
trillium, rattlesnake plantain, broom sedge (Big Momma used it to
make brooms) _ and so much more.
</P>
<P>
   We saw no endangered plants on my land, not even any rare ones.
But they're all special to me.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick did say fringed gentian, an herb producing lovely blue
flowers, has been seen in two neighboring counties, Union and
Towns. I hope to see these threatened plants, hope too that they
decide to move onto my land. Meanwhile, Patrick lent me pictures.

 &HT;    Watt's new
 &HT;    By Danny C. Flanders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The next time you switch on a lamp, take a good look at the
piece.
</P>
<P>
   Is the base that same old ginger jar or brass cylinder you
bought years ago? Is it topped by your basic ribbed white shade _
maybe minus the cellophane wrapper your mother insisted on keeping
to cut down on the dust?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people tend to forget the importance of lighting as they
decorate,'' said Sid Fleishman of Ohio-based Kichler Lighting
Group. ``They'll start with the larger furniture pieces, then the
auxiliary pieces, then the carpet, wallpaper, etc., and finally the
lighting. But you want to know how important lighting is? Turn off
all the lights in your home one evening, and you'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, consumers are seeing the light _ enough to provide
a burgeoning market for lamp designers, who are creating shades and
bases for every taste. Artists are also drawing on a seemingly
endless variety of materials to create one-of-a-kind lamps for a
generation of buyers demanding something unique among the
mass-produced. Even mainstream lighting manufacturers are
recognizing that consumers are willing to pay more for a lamp that
makes a statement _ not just light.
</P>
<P>
   Lamps made from costume jewelry. Lamps made from junk parts.
Lamps made from natural materials. Lamps made from pieces of old
lamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many small companies out there pushing the
boundaries for what a lamp can be,'' said Ben Goldstone of Fire
Farm, an Oakland, Calif., lighting manufacturer. ``No longer is
something that blasts this huge amount of wattage quite right in
the home. For our parents, furniture was furniture, but for this
new generation with disposable incomes, there are so many options
that are so much more playful in terms of shape, color and
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sales of table lamps, which totaled $365 million last year, are
projected to increase 5 percent in 1998, in large part because of
design trends, according to the American Lighting Association.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years since opening Eclectic Electric, an Atlanta
lighting gallery on Highland Avenue, Kim Smith has seen the
evolution in the way consumers are embracing lighting as art.
``It's gotten crazy,'' said Smith, who represents some 100 artists
throughout the country. ``There are so many artists doing custom
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Max Birnkammer, for example, crafts lamps with metal bases and
rice paper shades in 20 colors from which buyers can take their
pick. Allowing buyers to customize their lamps makes them more
special than selecting ones off the department store shelf,
especially for those who can't afford to pay thousands for a piece
of lamp art.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for many artists' lamps has grown so large that
designers _ resisting the urge to sign on with a manufacturer _ are
creating limited editions of their work.
</P>
<P>
   It's a move New York artist Dez Ryan made last year. After 10
years of creating one-of-a-kind pieces from the parts of old lamps,
she began making collections from which consumers can order.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I would haunt the flea markets and junk shops to
collect old lamps, which I would then cannibalize, reconfigure and
reassemble into sculptural things,'' said Ryan, who previously
worked as a sculptor and art historian.
</P>
<P>
   She describes her pieces, which combine handblown glass orbs and
handsewn silk shades, as ``elegantly eccentric,'' for a look that's
part funk, part Grandma's attic. ``They're sort of 'Queen Victoria
meets Buster Keaton,' though someone said they're more like 'Dr.
Seuss meets Versace,''' Ryan said. ``My intention is for them to be
sophisticated but with a sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Her latest creations, introduced at Atlanta International Gift &AMP;
Home Furnishings Market in July, include a collection dubbed ``Rare
Birds'' _ seven lamps with curvaceous shades in lacy velvets, sheer
chiffons and shimmery jacquards topping bases of smoked glass orbs
and ribbed necks.
</P>
<P>
   ``By rearranging the classic forms and embellishing them . . .
I'm aiming to breathe new life into an old form,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   The thing she likes best about her work is that while it looks
eccentric, it blends with traditional settings. ``That's kind of
the magic, in that it's not 'the trendy,' '' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Even large manufacturers have gotten the message that consumers
want something a little different.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are looking at lamps now more as collectible items,''
said Bob Davis of Miami-based Van Teal lighting. ``We say our
products are similar to the earrings and necklace on a beautiful
woman in a simple black dress. Until you have the accessories, the
decor is incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   At the fall International Home Furnishings Market in High Point,
N.C., Van Teal emphasized color, with high-gloss, automotive-type
finishes covering tripod bases in metallic reds, blues and yellows.
</P>
<P>
   Others played off the Old World look with heavy ironwork, the
Arts and Crafts period with Mission styling, retro influences with
glass-beaded shades and Asian motifs with mosaics.
</P>
<P>
   For Fire Farm, Elizabeth Meredith designed a new ``Heaven and
Earth'' lamp that features a silk-paneled shade floating over a
metal base pan holding river rocks. Another of the company's lines,
``Puck,'' offers consumers the option of picking and choosing among
several colors of ``slipcover shades,'' including beige, sage
green, coral, yellow and lavender.
</P>
<P>
   David Landis, a New York designer, went for the oversized look
with ``classic retro'' lamps _ brass and cast zinc bases, topped by
tall white shades. ``I'm going after more of the mainstream market
with larger pieces that make a statement,'' he said. ``You can get
a stylish lamp for less than you used to at places like Pottery
Barn and Crate &AMP; Barrel. I think that just shows that Americans, as
a whole, are getting a little more design conscious.''

 &HT;    Laity embracing long-term Bible study
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two factions are clearly divided: One supports a monarchy as
a unifying presence; the other sees royalty as outmoded,
unnecessary and a drain on the public treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The debate is not about the Great Britain of today but the
Israelites of the Hebrew Bible. And the discussion is taking place
in a classroom at a Snellville church.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen people meet here at St. Matthew's Episcopal Church for
two hours every Sunday night for an intensive study known as
Education for Ministry, or EFM. Conversation ranges from the
esoteric to the practical, with illustrations thrown in from opera,
film and politics. In between classes, there is homework to do.
</P>
<P>
   John Bennett, 55, a Georgia Department of Labor job counselor
and member of St. Edward's Episcopal Church in Lawrenceville,
recently finished the four-year program. ``It was a lot of work,''
he said, ``but I do miss the structure of the weekly
get-together.''
</P>
<P>
   Long-term studies such as EFM are sweeping mainline Protestant
churches, drawing lay people into the ancient prophets and obscure
genealogies of the Scriptures and adding context to the most
familiar Bible stories. Housewives and doctors, stockbrokers and
maintenance workers faithfully spend time every day reading the
Bible and supplementary material to prepare for class discussion.
Hauling their books, workbooks and multicolored highlighters, they
trek off to class once a week to test their theories and
perceptions on their classmates.
</P>
<P>
   Some churches have several groups at different levels going on
at once. At Atlanta's Cascade United Methodist Church, a dozen
groups are studying levels 1, 2 or 3 of the Disciple program from
the United Methodist publishing house. Each Wednesday, the church's
staff has its own group study, now in its second year. The Rev.
Walter Kimbrough, the church's senior minister, participates as a
student.
</P>
<P>
   'Hunger' for study
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important for us to be intently involved in Bible
study because the people of God shouldn't be biblically
illiterate,'' said Kimbrough.
</P>
<P>
   Both EFM and Disciple have spread beyond their own
denominations. At least 14 different denominations, from Adventists
to United Church of Christ, have congregations sponsoring Disciple
study groups, said Madge Yoke, the Nashville-based office
coordinator for the program. Presbyterians, Catholics and Lutherans
are enrolled in EFM groups alongside Episcopalians in metro area
churches.
</P>
<P>
   The reception has surprised the studies' founders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say we were really caught off guard by the overwhelming
willingness of people to commit,'' said United Methodist Bishop
Richard Wilke, author with his wife, Julie, of workbooks for the
Disciple Bible study, the largest of the programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dream was very small,'' Wilke said. ``Our dream was in
nine months to read most of the Bible and to try to get a few
thousand people to do that. That was the extent of our dream.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half a million people have completed at least a year
of the study since its inception in 1986. People who finished the
first book demanded more. Two subsequent studies are now available,
with another on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Winters, the now-retired University of the South
professor who wrote the EFM material, was asked by the theology
school's computer department what the maximum enrollment would be.
``I took a wild guess and said 1,000,'' he said. Twenty-three years
later, more than 40,000 people have participated, 13,000 have
finished the full four-year program, and more than 7,000 are
currently enrolled.
</P>
<P>
   Both Wilke and Winters said they had sensed a ``hunger'' for
study among the laity of their denominations but failed to see how
deep and wide it reached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced the main ministry of the church is the ministry
of the laity to the world,'' said Winters, who now lives in
Asheville, N.C. ``To have lay people do their ministry, I thought
they needed to be educated and trained. We train people to be
ministers with a great deal of Scripture and theology to prepare
them to make ethical decisions. But it seems to me the lay people
have to make more difficult ethical decisions than clergy face.''
</P>
<P>
   Education of the laity makes for stronger leadership in the
churches, said Wilke, bishop-in-residence at Southwestern College
in Winfield, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people hesitant to teach adult Sunday school or work
with the youth or even teach the children because they felt they
were not adequately prepared,'' he said. ``Our enemy was ignorance
of the Scripture, and so our goal was to ground people in the
Scripture.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilke and Winters also said their programs are intended to give
people a new way of looking at their life and the culture in which
they live. The Disciple program, as Wilke puts it, should result in
``not merely information, but transformation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Kemph, a member of Mount Bethel United Methodist Church in
Marietta, has taken Disciple 1, 2 and 3 and repeated 1 ``as a
refresher'' at North Springs United Methodist Church in north
Fulton County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was an adult Sunday school teacher and as a kid and a teen
had been really active,'' she said. ``I went to church a lot, but I
had never spent a lot of time studying on my own. I enjoyed the
challenge of making sure I could do my reading every week, and the
discussions that come out of the reading are invaluable.''
</P>
<P>
   Her study has given her more confidence in her own beliefs, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me challenge authority, or people who really believe
they're authorities and don't like to be questioned,'' she said.
``A lot of times, people are just regurgitating what people told
them..''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, ``in Sunday school classes or even if I hear
something on the radio or on television, when people are trying to
manipulate the Scripture, grab something out and try to make it say
what they want it to say, I immediately go to my own Bible and see
what's before it and what's after it. That's not something I would
have done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Disciple studies, Kemph has taken two years of
supplemental work under the Rev. Bob Winstead of North Springs
United Methodist. Winstead compiled a church history study, based
on the Disciple format, when he found people still wanting more
after exhausting the Disciple material.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most churchgoing folk don't have a sense of the biblical
timeline,'' said Winstead. ``What I'm trying to do is help them lay
it all out on the table and try to make some sense of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he encourages each class to ask three questions about
every text they study: ``What? So what? and Now what?''_ or What
does it say? What does it mean? And, how does it apply today?
</P>
<P>
   Winstead's average Sunday congregation is 150 to 300 people.
Since the church has more than 150 people who have had at least a
year of Disciple training, that means half the regular churchgoers
have been exposed to the study, he said. ``In a biblically informed
congregation, I can use images and stories and references much
freer, making connections and expecting the congregation to follow
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Communal experience
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the study itself, many long-term study participants say
they are profoundly changed by the communal experience of
small-group Bible study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting story after story about someone getting cancer,
maybe a mother dies, a baby is born, life moves on, and here are
people studying together,'' said Wilke. ``It becomes a biblical
fellowship. These people become very close. We were surprised by
the power of the bonding. We shouldn't have been. (Jesus) says when
two or three of you are gathered, I will be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell Killebrew, 45, a member of St. Matthew's in Snellville,
was involved in EFM when his wife died of breast cancer in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dynamics of being part of a small group, the mutual
support has been tremendous,'' he said. ``Having this group of
folks to get with every week has been a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   Killebrew's classmates include computer programmer Wally Watson,
54, and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientist Rob
Merritt, 34.
</P>
<P>
   Watson said she and her husband, Bob, 53, a sales
representative, decided to take the class together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I've sort of struggled with a lot of people I know
taking the Bible very literally,'' she said. ``I never have. And
I've struggled with some guilt _ was I strange or unusual for not
having a literal interpretation?''
</P>
<P>
   Learning how and when the Bible was written, ``it's making sense
to me,'' she said. ``My faith is being reinforced.''
</P>
<P>
   Merritt said he entered the program ``to discover what my
ministry is in the church community and the community at large.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy people with different perspectives,'' he said. ``We
get a diversity of ideas and experiences that contribute to the
discussion. It's quite different than just reading something for
yourself, but it's not spoon-fed.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday night, with books, Bibles and pens spread out
around them, they and their classmates reviewed the stories of
Samuel and Saul from the Old Testament with the Rev. Jim Johnson,
St. Matthew's rector, then went on to discuss the technique of
``theological reflection,'' a major component of EFM. They will
practice looking at major and minor events of their lives through
the Scripture, the tradition of the church and their own beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point is to help you see how your life intersects
with God,'' Johnson said. ``This is education for ministry. This is
getting y'all ready to go out there and do something. It's where
the rubber hits the road in this class.''

 &HT;    6 ways to give
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Thanksgiving is nearly a month away, it's already that
time of year to start thinking about helping others.
</P>
<P>
   Who among us doesn't find satisfaction in feeding the homeless
and hungry a lavish Thanksgiving meal or providing Christmas
presents for a needy child?
</P>
<P>
   Many people, focused on family and career, find this time of
year a perfect time to reach out to others in need.
</P>
<P>
   For Connie Sabo of north Fulton County, the holidays would not
be complete without involving the entire family in Operation
Christmas Child, a project that provides gifts to needy children
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never too early to teach your kids about compassion,''
says Sabo, who has been involved with the project for five years
with her husband, Frank, and daughters Chelsea, 13, and Taylor, 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the theme of kids helping kids. One of the things we
are trying to do as a family is to get away from the old traditions
of getting to traditions of giving. We want to emphasize values.''
</P>
<P>
   For some organizations, the volunteer onrush during the holidays
can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use about 25,000 volunteers a year, and more than half of
those come between October and December,'' says Kathleen Kelly,
volunteer program co-manager for the Atlanta Community Food Bank.
</P>
<P>
   While Thanksgiving or Christmas may seem a long way off,
volunteer opportunities with many popular organizations are already
filled or nearing capacity. For example, the Atlanta Union Mission
already has enough volunteers to handle its Thanksgiving Day
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The message is clear: If it's something you really want to do,
register now before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at nonprofit organizations also point out that
problems like hunger and homelessness don't disappear after one big
party or meal. They suggest volunteers pledge their services for
other times of the year as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't just hungry at Christmas,'' says Mack Barnes of
the Feed the Hungry Foundation in Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes it's helpful to think small. While the projects
detailed below need large numbers of volunteers, many small
agencies often have difficulty finding people willing to help.

 &HT;    Spiritual journey tied to service

<P>
   Helping others is as important as helping ourselves. That's one
of the messages that will be delivered by several of the nationally
known lecturers and authors at this weekend's Whole Life Expo in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a certain point, the search for self-awareness can become
self-preoccupation,'' says Marianne Williamson, author of ``The
Healing of America'' and a leading advocate for social conscience
in the spiritual movement. ``Ultimately, a spiritual journey that
does not include service to the outer world disintegrates into
narcissism and self-indulgence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Millman, in his new book ``Everyday Enlightenment,'' details
12 ``gateways'' to enlightenment, the last of which is Serve Your
World. ``Service is very selfish,'' he says. ``We cannot uplift
someone else without uplifting ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Millman is certain that material success doesn't provide
happiness. ``There must be more to life than having everything,''
he says, quoting noted children's author and illustrator Maurice
Sendak.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``if you are working for money, power, prestige,
celebrity or a bigger car, then you are in trouble,'' says Bernie
Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, a retired surgeon whose books on humanizing medical care
are full of inspirational stories of how people have dealt with and
overcome life-threatening illnesses, has become a household name in
the self-help field. His new book, ``Prescriptions for Living,''
expands his principles to embrace the physically healthy.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ``giving unconditional love from your heart, you
improve your health,'' Siegel says. ``That's why volunteers live
longer, healthier lives. They are giving a gift to themselves as
well as those around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel thinks it's important to find a cause that you believe in
and a task that gives you satisfaction. ``If you are doing
something where you lose track of time, when your aches and pains
and illnesses and worries disappear,'' Siegel says, ``then you know
you are on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   And Millman thinks a little bit of service is ``better than a
lot of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Start where you are,'' he says. ``Say a few kind words to
someone at the supermarket or pay the toll for the car behind
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping others is of such critical importance to , will have its
first major conference Nov. 20-22 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson's hope is to create ``a new politics, a positive
politics, centered around people helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-help lecturers make service 'a way of life'
</P>

`WITHOUT WORDS': EVEN THE CURTAIN CALLS ARE INVENTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In their flesh-toned attire, the eight dancers in
American Ballet Theater's latest premiere, ``Without Words,'' are
like clay figurines molded and remolded into countless
configurations by their sculptor-choreographer, Nacho Duato.
</P>
<P>
   Duato, a 41-year-old Spaniard, is a hot ticket on the European
dance scene and ``Without Words'' advertises his gift for the
startling image. Everything about this inventive work, which had
its premiere on Thursday night at City Center, looked experimental
_ right down to the curtain calls. When did you last see a
choreographer come onstage and distribute bouquets to his own
dancers?
</P>
<P>
   The score that Duato uses consists of six Schubert songs, but it
is heard as instrumental music without words, as the title says.
Like the songs, the dancing has been stripped bare of overt
Romantic aura. Love and death are themes in the ballet derived from
the music, but Duato has given us his contemporary take on a
19th-century obsession.
</P>
<P>
   The spare setting uses large dreamlike photographs of the
dancers by Nancy Ellison to introduce each section. It speaks of a
not-so-brave new world, yet even within the 20th-century blackness
of an existential stage space, Duato presents a universal life
cycle with all its naturalness, free of alienation as well as of
frills.
</P>
<P>
   To say he has swept away all period atmosphere is not accurate.
His own choreography is indebted here to the style developed in the
late 1970s by Jiri Kylian, director of the Netherlands Dance
Theater, where Duato was once a leading dancer. In ``Remanso,'' the
exciting male trio he created last year for Ballet Theater, he used
more original movement, seemingly inspired by the bravura of the
great dancers at his disposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Words,'' more sophisticated, finds him in the familiar
vein seen in 1994 with his own troupe, National Dance Company of
Spain, at City Center (131 W. 55th St.). The idiom is not classical
and the women are not on toe. Yet ballet training and classical
placement is essential for the swift partnering and concealed
virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   As a title, ``Without Words,'' refers to feelings that can be
conveyed in more than one way and in the music, the vocal line was
transcribed by Mischa Maisky for cello in a recording where his
pianist was Daria Hovora. On this occasion, the cellist in the pit
was Scott Ballantyne and the pianist, Barbara Bilach. There is no
question that from the first song, ``Der Mueller und der Bach,''
the cello, surrogate for the words, is meant to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   The no-cartilege physicality of the choreography comes into play
with the first trio. Sandra Brown is outstanding in various
convolutions with her two partners, Angel Corella and Maxim
Belotserkovsky. Slides of Ms. Ellison's images from the
choreography are often striking as they amplify the emotions
expressed by the bodies below.
</P>
<P>
   Duato is no slouch at opening up new dimensions of a dancer's
performance, and if there is any proof that Paloma Herrera is a
20th-century dancer, it is in her twisting and stretched duet,
beautifully danced, with Corella. The movement phrases are packed
with surprises, including cartwheels and pendulum swings.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Mau then enters to hold her hand over Keith Roberts' eyes
for a turbulent sequence that incorporates Vladimir Malakhov,
powerful as ever, and Julie Kent.
</P>
<P>
   The full cast, now a lonely crowd, assembles onstage. The
women's typical silhouette, doll-like with flexed feet, is expanded
in the gymnastic contours of the final and imaginative duet, danced
excellently by Ms. Kent and Malakhov (the everyman who curls up at
the close). Brad Fields' lighting, following Duato's concept,
enhanced the production.
</P>
<P>
   On the same program, Anton Dolin's ``Variations for Four,'' to
music by Margaret Keogh, switched dancers around from a previous
performance. Even this new cast still has to reach the top level of
the Harkness Ballet production of the 1960s, when the choreography
was somewhat different. Jose Manuel Carreno was now first in line,
and Ethan Stiefel looked at ease in the second solo, with his
previous jumping variation coherently rendered by Corella.
Belotserkovsky had the adagio solo.
</P>
<P>
   In the main duet from Antony Tudor's ``Leaves Are Fading,''
Amanda McKerrow and John Gardner, two true Tudor dancers, movingly
expressed the rapture of young love. Tudor's satirical ``Gala
Performance'' had Giuseppe Picone, new as a very romantic hero,
effectively playing off against Christine Dunham's tragic Italian
ballerina. As her two rivals, Anna Liceica (Russian) and Ashley
Tuttle (French) had the right catfight spunk.

NO LUCK OF THE IRISH HERE IN `INISHMAAN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
OUR RATING: 3 1/2 STARS  
 
  
By REED JOHNSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Anglo-Irish playwright Martin McDonagh has a word
for all those Hollywood Technicolor fantasies of an emerald-green
Ireland populated by lovable eccentrics.
</P>
<P>
   That word, to put it far more politely than McDonagh ever would,
is ``blarney.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, if your image of Ireland conforms to the misty-eyed
picturesqueness of, say, ``The Quiet Man,'' seeing McDonagh's ``The
Cripple of Inishmaan'' at the Geffen Playhouse in Westwood may be
like tasting your first pint of Guinness after years of drinking
nothing but milky cups of tea. Some people undoubtedly will find
that taste more abrasive than robust, devoid as it is of any
sweetening or consoling sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   But if you stick with it, you hardly can fail to be startled,
mightily amused and, at last, deeply shaken by the Geffen's
marvelous ensemble and by McDonagh's deft, Swiftian skewering of
the romantic falsehoods that for centuries have disfigured not only
the outside world's view of Ireland, but Ireland's view of itself.
</P>
<P>
   Did we say ``disfigured''? It's no coincidence that the play's
title character is the aptly nicknamed Cripple Billy (Fred
Koehler), who in many ways personifies his homeland's plight. While
Billy has been handicapped since birth, what quickly emerges in the
play is that everyone in Billy's village on the island of
Inishmaan, off Ireland's west coast, bears some sort of
debilitating impairment.
</P>
<P>
   Raised by his doting, shopkeeper aunts _ the fatalistic Kate
(Barbara Tarbuck), who talks to rocks, and Eileen (Dearbhla
Molloy), who indulges in clandestine candy binges _ the bookish
Billy is the frequent butt of the locals' jokes, even from his sly
friend Bartley (J.D. Cullum). He's particularly intrigued by
Bartley's sister Helen (the splendid Derdriu Ring), a caustic
redhead who returns Billy's fumbling advances with scornful
mockery.
</P>
<P>
   One typically dull day in 1934, the meddlesome town gossip
Johnnypateenmike (Max Wright) interrupts these exchanges with the
momentous news that the American filmmaker Robert Flaherty has come
to the seafaring region to make a documentary, ``Man of Aran.''
(This really happened.) Hoping to impress Helen, Billy begins
scheming how to meet the Yanks and get ``discovered'' by Hollywood,
as do several other villagers. Like Samuel Beckett's tramps in
``Waiting for Godot,'' the people of Inishmaan start pinning their
hopes on a salvation that probably will never arrive, with results
that are savagely comic and tragic, but never, ever predictable.
</P>
<P>
   McDonagh writes dialogue with an exaggerated, hyper-realistic
quality that rises to a sublime absurdity. His style owes much more
to the British postwar comic traditions of Monty Python and Spike
Milligan than to Sean O'Casey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shark (that) ate daddy, but Jesus said you should
forgive and forget,'' says Johnnypateenmike's scruffy, dear old
Irish Mammy (Rosaleen Linehan), a dead ringer here for Beckett's
great female interpreter, Billie Whitelaw.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from a woman who's merrily drinking herself to death _
with her son's deliberate help _ that line gives you a feel for
McDonagh's facility. It also gives you a feel for his mean side: He
enjoys kicking the crutches out from under an audience's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring's much-hyped New York production of ``Cripple,''
which closely followed McDonagh's U.S. debut hit, ``The Beauty
Queen of Leenane,'' was panned by some critics who found its vision
too ugly and Jerry Zaks' production too slapsticky. It probably
didn't help that McDonagh had been touted as the most important new
English-language playwright since David Hare.
</P>
<P>
   The Geffen's production, steathily directed by Joe Dowling, is
better attuned to McDonagh's satiric frequency. At first, you don't
see it coming. As Act 1 dawns on Billy's tiny village _ designed by
Frank Hallinan Flood as a claustrophobic jumble of crude,
dun-colored houses and monolithic outcroppings _ it looks as though
we might be in for ``How Green Was My Valley'' by the sea.
</P>
<P>
   How quickly that illusion evaporates. Eggs get smashed over
heads. Bad things happen to cats and sheep. Helen rants about the
lecherous priests who prey on female choir singers. These people,
even the long-suffering Billy, aren't what they seem, and neither
is their community, resting as it does on evasions, myths and
colorful half-truths.
</P>
<P>
   In painting this cruelly self-deluded populace with such
painfully funny and incisive strokes, ``The Cripple of Inishmaan''
transcends its provincial locale and becomes something more
universal and stirring. As mythical in its own way as Brigadoon,
McDonagh's rural Ireland is a place where people despair of their
squalid existence yet embrace their misery as if it were a holy
grail.
</P>
<P>
   Playing it beautifully straight, Koehler becomes the strangely
unsettling eye of the storm, surrounded by slyly expert comic
performances from Wright, Cullum, Molloy and Lineham in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Though Koehler's Billy is no victim, it's hard not to flinch as
the final blackout falls on him, examining his blood-stained
handkerchief, a portent of the fearful, non-Hollywood dreams that
yet may come. In this moment of appalling irony and brutal poetry,
McDonagh proves that sometimes the best way for a playwright to
stir an audience's heart is by pretending not to have one himself.

`MARRIAGE OF FIGARO': JEWELS OF TALENT STUD MET'S NEW PRODUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: Production notes at end of review) 
(bl) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everybody knew it would be good; the question was how
good? Rarely does an opera company assemble the ingredients that
went into the Metropolitan Opera's new production of ``Le Nozze di
Figaro.''
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's opera seen afresh opened Thursday night and what a
cast: Bryn Terfel as Figaro, Renee Fleming as the Countess, Cecilia
Bartoli as Susanna, Susanne Mentzer as Cherubino and Dwayne Croft
as the Count.
</P>
<P>
   There to hold all the talent together was Jonathan Miller, the
director; and making music in the pit was the estimable Met
orchestra conducted by James Levine.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's sense of detail, Terfel's utter naturalness and the
swift buoyant virtuosity of the orchestra playing accounted for the
evening's unequivocal successes. Elsewhere, the big vocal talents
onstage remade Mozart's roles in their own image and asked a lot of
questions along the way.
</P>
<P>
   First question: what is Susanna's nature? Ms. Bartoli's dark
voice is certainly up to the part, and goodness knows she works
hard enough at it. Ms. Bartoli, the opera performer, is slowly
revealing herself to New York audiences, and the picture is of a
physical comedian pure and simple. Given the opportunity, she will
invest that property in every role.
</P>
<P>
   In a situation where there is no room to clown _ for example,
``Deh! vieni'' in Act IV _ the singing can be deeply touching.
Elsewhere Ms. Bartoli creates a buzz-saw trail of mugging, eye
rolling, spastic comedic gestures and near-pratfalls. Her energy is
engaging, but until Act IV we have no idea that Susanna is anything
more than a purveyor of farce. Ms. Bartoli seems to be giving us
the same character every time out, like the Hollywood stars of old
who played themselves whether the movie was ``Hamlet'' or ``Billy
the Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller has staged the ensemble numbers with wondrous depth and
exactitude, but he seems to have let players like Ms. Bartoli go
their own way. Maybe on purpose. Perhaps audiences have brooded too
long and seriously over the upstairs-downstairs sociology of
Susanna's life. Maybe broad comedy plays well against the travails
of Ms. Fleming's Countess. I for one missed Susanna's emotional
frailty and ambiguous loyalties in the early acts.
</P>
<P>
   This begs the second question: who is the Countess? Ms. Fleming
would make her a purveyor of vocal luxury. ``Porgi amor'' was a
flood of beautiful sound; the climactic tones of ``Dove sono'' made
the body tingle. For those of us who imagine the role in terms of
austere yet injured dignity, Ms. Fleming's soft, vulnerability _
frail and fragile _ made an interesting contrast: a wounded dove in
place of a moral presence. Some will argue that it is the duty of
the Countess, melancholy as she is, to impose, to occupy a rather
larger spiritual space than Ms. Fleming's lovely presence can.
</P>
<P>
   Another question: Why was Ms. Mentzer's absolutely seamless
singing attached to such frantic behavior? The voice conveyed so
much of Cherubino. Was all that racing about, arm waving and
bug-eyed reaction to every opposite reaction a necessary adjunct to
things already conveyed in musical terms?
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Terfel for whom there is no question at all.
So confident was he in himself and the easy power of his voice that
nothing was exaggerated. No phrase was pushed, no movement
oversold. It is hard to imagine a more satisfying performer for the
role.
</P>
<P>
   Croft, whose beautiful baritone can sometimes drift into
blandness, was as lively here as I can remember him. I also liked
Anthony Laciura's sly and delicate Don Curzio. Making an excellent
first impression was Danielle de Niese as Barbarina. The production
is as simple and reticent as Miller's direction. Peter Davison's
peeling paint and tilted interiors imply declining grandeur and
impending upset. Levine's up-tempos prodded everything in their
path.
</P>
<P>
   One cannot say enough about the septet ending Act II and the
final ensemble of Act IV: episodes in which theater and music
merged as they rarely do, and where each player was made
exquisitely aware of every other.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart operas move on the wheels of their ensembles, and Miller
_ with no coups de theatre and many acts of self-effacing care _
made them turn. It was an intriguing evening: with much that was
pure Mozart, much that was pure singing and periodic meetings of
the two.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    WITH 'CLINTON FACTOR' AN UNKNOWN, PARTIES LAUNCH A FINAL DRIVE
 &HT;    720&AMP;adds. For release Sunday, Nov. 1.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The heart of an election is mostly invisible,
millions of people making millions of decisions for untold _ and
unpolled _ reasons. Tuesday's voting will be no exception.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood of the American electorate, unusually puzzling in
this fall of peace, prosperity, space heroism and scandal, has both
political parties retreating to what they know best: demonizing
each other and their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high: all 435 seats in the House of
Representatives, 34 seats in the U.S. Senate, 36 governorships, and
more than 6,000 seats in state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   The election is local, with results in many races, hinging on a
highway, a waste site or a school bond. But it is also national,
portending the future of Social Security, health care, the
environment, education _ and, perhaps, the outcome of the
impeachment inquiry against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the voting's importance, expectations are that only
about 36 percent of the electorate will participate. But with the
impeachment investigation ``hovering over this election like a
five-ton elephant,'' in the words of Curtis Gans, a leading scholar
of voting behavior, experts are shying away from hard predictions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the uncertainty, both parties and their interest
group allies are waging mammoth television advertising campaigns
designed to rally their most faithful supporters.
</P>
<P>
   They are airing unprecedented numbers of generic ``issue'' ads
that are not regulated by federal election law. The number of
negative ads is up as well, with 6 out of every 10 TV ads attacking
the sponsor's opponent in one 30-state study by media expert
Kathleen Hall Jamieson.
</P>
<P>
   For voters immune to the ads, the parties and interest groups
are waging ambitious get-out-the-vote drives by mail and telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties are running scared,'' said William Schneider, a
political analyst for the Cable News Network (CNN) and the American
Enterprise Institute, a business-oriented research center in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Only weeks ago, as the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal engulfed the
president, it appeared the Republicans would add dozens of seats to
their 21-seat majority in the House, win the five seats necessary
to have a filibuster-proof Senate majority of 60, and expand their
majority of 33 governorships.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the effects of Clinton's self-made problems, the
Republicans had history on their side. The average number of House
seats gained by the party in its sixth year of controlling the
White House is 43, and the average number of Senate seats gained is
eight.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP failed to recognize that the American people
rendered their judgment on Clinton long before the midterm election
heated up. Since the Lewinsky scandal broke last winter, more than
six out of 10 Americans have approved of the job Clinton is doing
as president. Throughout this fall, a solid majority has opposed
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   And before Congress adjourned in October for electioneering, the
GOP leadership caved in to Clinton on social spending and added
pork-barrel giveaways to the budget, angering some conservatives
enough to threaten war on their own party once the election is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton, already having claimed credit for the first budget
surplus in 29 years, brokered a Middle East peace agreement,
producing statesmanlike images that were broadcast worldwide for
days. And within a week he was in Florida, basking in the televised
nostalgic, can-do glory of Democrat John Glenn's historic return to
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans had a bad month,'' former Bush White House
pollster Robert Teeter noted in the release of this week's Wall
Street Journal/NBC News poll, which indicated that Democratic
congressional candidates have rebounded and are even with
Republicans in the final stretch of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Now, any Republican dreams of a mandate-sized gain in the House
and a filibuster-proof Senate have all but vanished. The best guess
among experts is that the GOP will gain 10 or fewer House seats and
two or three Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   Anything less than the historic gains by the party out of the
White House will be ``a tremendous victory'' for Democrats, claims
Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman of the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The GOP, which currently holds 33 governorships, is close to
equaling its previous record of 34 governorships, in 1921-22, with
the most important addition likely to be Jeb Bush in Florida. With
his brother, George W., cruising to re-election in Texas, the GOP
would control the two pillars of a White House strategy for 2000: a
combined total of 57 electoral votes, more than a fifth of those
needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But the GOP is likely to suffer a tremendous loss in California,
where Democratic Lt. Gov. Gray Davis is poised to end 16 years of
Republican control of the governor's office and GOP hopes of
controlling the redistricting of the state's congressional
districts, now totaling 52.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure even modest gains in Congress, the GOP has launched a
$10 million TV campaign in the final days of the election to keep
their core supporters outraged over Clinton's misconduct with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It's a risky strategy. Democrats have responded with a $1
million campaign portraying Republicans as ``obsessed'' with
Clinton's sexual conduct. The ads feature their favorite campaign
whipping boy, House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen an increase in the intensity of Democrats,'' said
Ed Goeas, a Republican pollster who is involved in nearly 100 races
around the country. But loyal Republicans, especially religious
conservatives, have energized for months, he added, and
``Republicans in Congress as a check on Bill Clinton is a good
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not on the ballot anywhere, of course. And the
last-minute GOP ad campaign is not an attempt to nationalize the
election about him, the way the GOP did in 1994. The ads are airing
in only a handful of House districts with close races.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party's strength is not in the ``air war,''
however, where the GOP is outspending it by $20 million in the
final two weeks alone. Democrats are depending on organized labor
to wage a $14 million ``ground war'' of mail and telephone banks to
get out the vote in 40 House races, 10 Senate contests and 12
gubernatorial elections.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also expect to gain from get-out-the-vote pushes with
African Americans, the party's most loyal constituency. The
president and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton planned final
weekend events to rally black voters in Illinois, where Democratic
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun is trailing badly, and in Maryland, where
Democratic Gov. Paris Glendening has a razor-thin lead.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   However, there is only ``a modest interest'' in the election
among African Americans, said David Bositis, the chief researcher
at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a public
policy organization specializing in issues of importance to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties have targeted Hispanics, an increasingly important
voting bloc. Democrats are pursing Latinos in California, trying to
capitalize on the lingering anger over anti-immigrant initiatives
championed by outgoing Republican Gov. Pete Wilson. But they have
ceded the Latino vote in Texas and Florida to the Bush brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP also is banking on voters reached by the 45 million
voter guides the Christian Coalition planned to distribute in
churches throughout the country this Sunday, the organization's
most ambitious election-year effort ever. The guides compare the
voting records of candidates on issues central to the beliefs of
conservative Christians: abortion, homosexuality and vouchers for
religious schools.
</P>
<P>
   But two favorites of the Christian Coalition are in political
trouble: Gov. Fob James of Alabama and Gov. David Beasley of South
Carolina face serious challenges from Democrats in the South, a
region that otherwise seems on the verge of a complete political
realignment to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   For all the efforts of both parties, though, a survey last week
for Project Vote Smart, a nonprofit organization that maintains
databases on political candidates, found that 31 percent of
American voters do not trust any level of government to make the
best decisions for the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, unfortunately, a sad reflection on the nature of how
candidates campaign for office,'' said Richard Kimball, the
organization's president. ``After months of negative and often
useless campaigns, voters can't help but feel their elected
officials are not to be trusted.''

 &HT;    PEROT PETITION DRIVE SETS SIGHTS ON DEC. 7 DELIVERY
 &HT;    EDS: UNBUDGETED
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The resurfacing of the Monica Lewinsky affair as a
campaign issue just before Tuesday's elections may have energized a
drive launched by Texas businessman Ross Perot to collect petitions
seeking President Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the petition drive were regrouping this weekend, as
CNN's Larry King Live was rebroadcasting Saturday an appearance by
Perot from late September when he termed Clinton too ``erratic'' to
hold office and called for the petition drive.
</P>
<P>
   The effort, loosely coordinated through Perot's Dallas-based
Reform Party, has more than 140,000 people circulating petitions,
said the party's executive director Russell Verney. He said he had
no estimate of the number of signatures collected.
</P>
<P>
   Planners backed away from Perot's proposal to have petition
gatherers at the polls on Election Day, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be more organized after the election,'' said Anne
Merkl, a Newnan, Ga. Reform Party activist. ``You'll see us after
the election in parking lots and Wal-Marts.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida organizer Pauline Klein, of Key Largo, said that she has
just begun contacting hundreds of volunteers. ``I'm swamped,'' she
said of the stack of mail from the state. However, she also said
the focus will be after the election.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they are aiming for a truck caravan that will
bring the petitions to Washington on Dec. 7.

were young and upperwardly mobile Russians enjoying all that the
post-Soviet economy had to offer: new furnishings for their
apartment and country house, vacations abroad and a private tutor
to teach English to their nine-year-old son, Anton. Now, the good
times have vanished. He lost his job as a corporate marketing
director. She believes her layoff as an executive headhunter is
just a matter of time. The brighter future is on hold. Russia's
economic crisis is squeezing out the middle class. While small, the

   NIGERIA-WOLE _ Abdulsalami Abubakar, who met with Nelson Mandela
on Friday, has revived hopes for a return to democracy in Nigeria.
But to compare the general who has pledged an end to despotism with
the anti-apartheid leader who has become emblematic for democracy
in Africa is a gigantic stretch. Nigeria is still far from a South
African-style success story, Wole Soyinka said Friday. The
Nobel-winning writer, who teaches at Emory University in Atlanta,
suggested another event from the recent news as a more apt symbol
for Nigeria today: The gasoline-fed pipeline inferno in the village
of Jesse last week that killed an estimated 700 people. (Graham,

   TECH-AUSTERITY _ WASHINGTON _ Last spring, when Internet

Vignette Corp. public, they had visions of raising an amazing $30
million overnight. Their Austin, Texas, company, they hoped, would
join the ranks of such Internet blockbusters as Yahoo! and
Amazon.com. But before the team could even plan a road show to
advertise its initial public offering (IPO) of stock, their Morgan
Stanley bankers brought sobering news: In only 45 days, comparable
Internet companies had lost as much as 50 percent of their
valuations. Institutional investors were balking at new offerings.
In short, the IPO window was slamming shut. The Vignette team has
joined the legions of executives across the country postponing or
shelving plans to sell stock to the public. (Regan, Cox News

   SPACE-PRIVATIZE _ WASHINGTON _ As Americans relive the past
glories of a space race through the return to orbit of astronaut
legend John Glenn, a different sort of race for space is quietly
heating up. This time the competition is not between international
superpowers, but among a handful of scrappy startup U.S. companies
who are vying to build space planes and rockets that would fly so
cheaply that costly government vehicles would be left in the dust.
Even as NASA continues to rely on its huge and complex shuttle
system, costing $400 million to $600 million per flight, these lean
and mean space entrepreneurs are developing small, reusable
vehicles that could haul satellites and other cargo into orbit at
bargain-basement rates. (Malone, Cox News Service 880&AMP;add).

   GOP-ADS-GEORGIA _ A late-rounds gut punch of Republican Party
television attack ads seems to have most parties reeling in the
political ring of Georgia's Second Congressional District. In
Georgia, the ad campaign is intended to help the Republican
first-time candidate for Congress, Albany businessman Joe
McCormick, unseat three-term incumbent Democrat Sanford Bishop.
This district is one of about two dozen congressional races
targeted around the country in the $10 million effort. But it's
hard to tell who's getting hurt the most. McCormick sought to
distance himself from the ads last week. (Osinski, Atlanta

   INITIATIVES _ When voters nationwide go to the polls Tuesday,

Voters in Michigan, home state to Dr. Jack Kevorkian, will

decided Tuesday. (ABrice, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   GA-GOV-MONEY _ ATLANTA _ Roy Barnes has raised more money ($9
million) from more contributors (9,000) than any politician in
Georgia history, much of it from lawyers and doctors. Guy Millner,
who's used $11.5 million of his own money, raised about $3.5

   GA-ATTYGENL _ ATLANTA _ Nineteen of the state's 41 DAs depart

general candidate and endorse Thurbert Baker. They say he was there

David Ralston, saying it misrepresents what his office did in a
North Georgia death penalty case. (Rankin, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   TEX-HOUSE-RACE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The Republican Party's push to
capture the Texas House has become an all-out battle of big money.
Texas-sized bucks, in fact, from both sides. Instead of the
$125,000 or so it has taken to mount a House campaign in the past,
double and even triple that amount is being spent in some races
this year _ all for a job that pays just $7,200 a year plus
fringes. One Republican challenger likely will spend more than
$400,000. ``In my 18 years in this business, I've never seen this
much money being spent on state House races,'' said Brian Eppstein,
a Fort Worth political consultant. (Ward, Austin
American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TEX-GOV-RACE _ Gov. George W. Bush, campaigning Friday in North
Texas, said he hopes the Republicans can take over the House but
refused to talk about what should happen to Democratic House
Speaker if they do. We ask Democrat Garry Mauro, campaigning in
Dallas-Fort Worth, what he thinks of the GOP prospects. (Herman,
Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   TEX-LTGOV-RACE _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Most of the campaign between
Democrat John Sharp and Republican Rick Perry has demonstrated how
alike they are on many issues. But the two differ on some key
issues that the lieutenant governor could hold sway on next
session: abortion, tax cuts, educational vouchers and annexation
are among them. (Elizondo, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   OHIO-GOV-MONEY _ Bob Taft and Lee Fisher have spent nearly $10
million on their hotly disputed ads since June, according to the
latest campaign finance reports, with Fisher slightly outspending
Taft. (Gulliver, Dayton Daily News)

   OHIO-GOV-DEBATE _ CLEVELAND _ The final governor's race debate.

   NORLEANS-GUNSUIT _ NEW ORLEANS _ The mayor of New Orleans is
suing gun manufacturers to put safety devices on guns, and suing
them and some pawn shops for contributing to this city's crime
problem. He is doing this in conjunction with the Center to Prevent
Hangun Violence and he is the first mayor in the country to do
this. Apparently the prospect of such litigation was all the talk
at the last national mayor's conference, but New Orleans is first
out of the chute with an actual lawsuit. (Konigsmark, Atlanta

   COMMUNITY-POLICING _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Former L. A. police chief
speaks at a a national conference on community policing and
recruitment of minority officers. (Banta, Austin

<P>
   OHIO-BATS _ Tonight is Halloween for the rest of us, but at a
former limestone quarry in Darke County furry black animals wrap
their wings around and hang upside-down everynight. You see, this
is a true bat cave, home to 25,000 bats, the largest colony in Ohio
and Pennsylvania, according to biologist Jackie Belwood, who runs
the bat program from the Cincinnati Nature Center. It is also home
to about 9,300 Indiana bats, which have been on the endangered
species list since 1967. This time of year the bats share the cave
with various ghosts and ghouls, when the Lewisburg Boy Scouts put
on a Haunted Cave. It is also here where they will hibernate for
the winter. (Dempsey, Dayton Daily News) WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   HALLOWEEN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Without question, Halloween is a
yearly celebration of candy and Power Ranger costumes. In fact this
year, retailers are expected to set a new record selling $1.76
billion worth of candy. Rooted in a yearly ritual that included
masquerading as the dead to hide from evil spirits, Halloween has
changed a lot over the years from the yearly Sam Hain celebration.
A University of Dayton professor who teaches courses about
literature and the occult notes that ``Halloween has turned into
such a mild event. It's been turned into a collection of treats. It
has lost all sense of evil.'' (Dayton Daily News)
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA _ AUSTIN _ In Sierra Blanca, an ongoing fued between
Hudspeth County Judge James Peace and County Attorney Tom Chellis
has shut down all misdemeanor prosecutions in the county _ for a
year. Chellis, angry that Peace and county commissioners have
steadily cut his budget, stopped accepting new cases a year ago,
which means drunk drivers, assault suspects and others arrested on
class A and B misdemeanors get their cases quickly dismissed. Not
that it matters, because Peace, who presides over all misdemeanor
cases, stopped holding court a year ago, about the time that
Chellis filed criminal charges against him for official oppression,
which is another story altogether. A tale of border un-justice.
(Harmon, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   NURSING _ AUSTIN _ It's been a year since the board that
disciplines nursing home administrators passed new rules to crack
down on the industry. The board had sanctioned only one
administrator in four years, despite glaring inadequacies
documented at many homes. Over the past year, the board has
disciplined 50 administrators, including one who's been fired.
(Gamino, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   AIRPORT _ On a cool, overcast morning in southeast Travis
County, construction crews attach the first passenger loading
bridge to Gate 4 at Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. For the
toiling crews, it's just another step in a job that has spanned
four years already. But in a sometimes cynical city where ideas are
born, then changed, debated (and debated), shelved and maybe even
born again, that loading bridge, which will carry passengers to and
from waiting planes, is also proof positive of something many
Austin residents have doubted for years: we're getting a new
airport. In just six months passenger planes will _ barring natural
disaster or unexpected construction delays _ fly out of
Austin-Bergstrom International Airport. (Hiott, Austin

   BOUNTY-HUNTERS _ ATLANTA _ Police file criminal charges against
two bounty hunters who broke down the door of the wrong house
earlier this week, terrifying the 14-year-old girl who was home
alone. Bonding companies claim bounty hunters have broad powers to
track down fugitives, and since they thought they were at the right
house, there was no criminal intent, these guys should not be
charged. Talking to legal experts, the district attorney etc. over
the legal questions here. (MacDonald, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   BOUNTY-GEORGIA _ Bounty hunters like to say the courts have
given them virtually unlimited powers to bring in the bad guys, but
some legal experts disagree. The Georgia attorney generals office,
for example, says they have no more rights than anyone else to make
a citizens arrest. These guys are in fact just citizens _ they
aren't licensed in Georgia. Anyone can be one. (Torpy, Atlanta

   SIDI SAYE, Libya _ This spot marks an end point of the Great
Man-Made River, a $25 billion project that some have suggested may
be either a financial folly or a military undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing is clear: the enterprise, believed to be the
largest civil- engineering project under construction, has begun to
succeed in its declared mission _ delivering vast quantities of
fresh water hundreds of miles across a barren desert to residents
of Libya's parched coast.
</P>
<P>
   In Tripoli, the capital, whose residents until two years ago had
to make do with unreliable supplies of brackish water from sources
invaded by the sea, that has been cause for considerable
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``What used to be salty is now as sweet as can be,'' exulted
Daoud Tayeesh, 53, a shopkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that there have not been any problems. Ever since the
water began to flow in September 1996, Tripoli's old water mains
have burst, one after another, unable to withstand the pressure of
water that tumbles into the capital's colonial-era water system
from a storage tank here in Sidi Saye, which is about 400 feet
above sea level.
</P>
<P>
   On countless occasions, local residents say, the flooding has
transformed parts of the capital into lakes, with geysers spewing
water into the air from corroded Italian-made iron pipes. And
though the Tripoli branch of the project is supposed to carry 660
million gallons of water a day, the amount flowing now is still a
relative trickle.
</P>
<P>
   Libyan engineers say the current volume is just 106 million
gallons, only two-thirds of what Tripoli needs every day for
nonagricultural purposes alone.
</P>
<P>
   The vast project is also running behind schedule, slowed by
financial constraints that foreign experts say have forced the
Libyan government to postpone some essential projects.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Libyan engineers said in interviews here that 87 percent
of the work on the Tripoli section of the project had now been
finished, and they expressed confidence that all of the work would
be completed in early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   In a country without a single free-flowing river of its own,
water flowing at full stream through the pipe, more than 12 feet in
diameter, would be enough to irrigate vast new agricultural
projects.
</P>
<P>
   It is intended to fulfill the dream first sketched in 1974 by
Col. Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, who said his plan was not
only to provide Libyans with a sure supply of water, but also to
make the desert bloom.
</P>
<P>
   The line that ends in Sidi Saye, about 15 miles northeast of
Tripoli, begins about 600 miles to the south, at a station deep in
the Sahara that serves as a collection point for water drawn from
more than 100 underground aquifers, some more than 1,500 feet
beneath the sands.
</P>
<P>
   The line that reaches Tripoli is part of the second phase of the
two-part Man-Made River Project. The first, which begins deep in
another part of the desert hundreds of miles to the east, ends near
the coastal town of Benghazi. It began to carry water in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But even that section still requires additional construction and
drilling, and it is providing only 1/8 of the 530 million gallons
of water a day that is its maximum capacity.
</P>
<P>
   In the Tripoli section, among the work that remains unfinished
is a section of the pipeline that is supposed to end at Tarhuna,
about 40 miles southeast of Tripoli, where U.S. officials have said
Libya has been building what would be the world's largest
underground chemical weapons plant in a hollowed-out mountain.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1996, U.S. officials warned that the weapons
plant might be completed as early as this year, but they have since
suggested that work on that project appears to have stopped. Libyan
officials have insisted that the work at Tarhuna is an irrigation
project to be fueled by the Man-Made River.
</P>
<P>
   The planned link between the underground pipeline and whatever
might be under construction at Tarhuna is among the reasons that
some former workers and others have said they suspect that the
Man-Made River might have a military purpose. They have suggested
that the sturdy pipes, buried about 15 feet beneath the ground,
could be used to store chemical weapons or even to move military
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But Libyan engineers and several high-ranking Western diplomats
called that theory nonsense. The Libyans allowed an American
visitor to inspect sections of the pipeline, in which no evidence
could be found that it was being used for anything other than its
stated purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is just to carry water,'' declared Adel Bakir,
the manager of the Tripoli section of the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics of the vast project have suggested that it may be a
monumental waste of money, suggesting that it would have been far
cheaper for Libya to build coastal desalting plants or even import
water from a country like Turkey to meet its needs.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Western diplomat here said he understood that the
underground reservoirs in the desert could run dry in 50 years. But
Bakir spoke for his government in saying that even ``very very
conservative estimates'' by Libyan and foreign experts held that
the supply would last at least four centuries.
</P>
<P>
   He said the project was ``the most feasible and most
cost-effective alternative available to us.''

 &HT;    APPLE EXECUTIVE CITES MICROSOFT THREATS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microsoft forced Apple Computer to dump Netscape's
Web browser for its own product by threatening to drop support for
an Apple version of Microsoft's popular word processing program,
according to testimony of a senior Apple executive released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In 46 pages of written testimony released in the ongoing federal
antitrust trial, Senior Apple Vice President Avadis Tevanian Jr.
also recounted how Microsoft had allegedly blocked Apple's
development of software to play sound and video because it would
compete with Microsoft's own multimedia offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian is due to take the witness stand Monday and to be
cross-examined by Microsoft defense lawyer John Warden for much of
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Warden is expected to portray his client as having come to
Apple's rescue in August 1997 through a deal under which the
software giant made a critical $150 million investment in Apple,
which pioneered the graphical approach to personal computing that
has become the hallmark of Microsoft's Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Under that deal, Microsoft and Apple also agreed to
cross-license their patents and to settle their outstanding patent
disputes over that so-called ``interface.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry studies currently give Apple's about 5 percent of the
overall market for operating systems that run on personal
computers. Microsoft Windows accounts for more than 90 percent of
these programs, which control such applications as word processors
and spreadsheets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressures exerted by Microsoft compelled Apple to resolve
(their) disputes on terms that gave significant advantages to
Microsoft's operating system,'' Tevanian wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bargain, Apple agreed to bundle Internet Explorer on
all of its Macintosh computers and its operating systems for the
next five years. While Apple is free to also bundle Netscape's
competing browser, it is barred from promoting any browser other
than Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Tevanian joined the then beleaguered company last
year, he met with an unnamed software developer who was working on
a product that would complement Apple's multimedia reader, known as
Quicktime, which also runs on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The developer urged Apple to quit producing any products for
Windows. Otherwise, he told him, ``Microsoft would take any
necessary action to drive Apple out of that business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I found his comments to be odd,'' Tevanian wrote.
``Eighteen months later, after the events described (in my direct
testimony), I appreciate the prophetic import of his words.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the testimony, Microsoft said it ``competes with
Apple to make Windows the innovative platform of choice, but we
also cooperate in many ways to ensure that our respective tools and
applications interoperate for the benefit of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The 1997 agreement between Microsoft and Apple is widely seen
as a major boost in restoring consumer confidence in Apple and
continuing the process of Apple's turn-around,'' the company said.

   Augusto Pinochet soon may be back in Chile, or free on bail in
London, having frustrated the efforts of Spanish and subsequently
French, Swiss and Swedish magistrates and citizens, as well as the
wishes of most of his countrymen, who according to recent polls
want to see the dictator tried somewhere, anywhere, for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But his arrest will still have served a purpose, beyond warming
the hearts of the thousands of friends, relatives and colleagues of
his victims _ men and women who have waited nearly a quarter of a
century for justice and solace.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond its ethical and legal implications, the dictator's
detention will have revealed many of the contradictions and deeper
truths about how societies move from authoritarian to democratic
rule, and how they settle scores with a past that never should have
existed.
</P>
<P>
   Both in general and in specific reference to Chile, Pinochet's
predicament raises far more questions than answers _ questions that
years ago should have been asked in Chile and Latin America, and in
countries as dissimilar as Mexico and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called transitions to democracy in Latin America during
the 1980s, in eastern Europe in the late '80s and early '90s, as
well as in Asia and Africa, all rested on a few basic premises that
at the time seemed self-evident. Dictatorships do not just fade
away; military rulers do not simply walk into the sun when they get
bored or tired. Achieving their departure and the overall
dismantling of their regimes, as of one-party systems, implied
providing them with a way out: a safe departure, to a safe haven,
for a safe future.
</P>
<P>
   On some occasions, the political golden handshake of explicit
amnesty or tacitly letting bygones be bygones was accompanied by a
willingness to know, if not to punish. Truth Commissions, Never
Again Commissions, White Books and the like were created and
supported.
</P>
<P>
   But the implicit understanding always was that the personal and
financial integrity of the dictators remain protected and that
details of their policies _ economic in some cases, geopolitical in
others _ be preserved by their democratic successors. In Chile, in
Argentina, in Uruguay, in a certain sense initially in Nicaragua
with Somoza, in South Korea, South Africa and even in some cases in
eastern Europe, this was the deal _ formal and institutionalized in
some cases, de facto in others _ that made democracy possible. It
seemed a small price to pay, a pill not too bitter to swallow, a
necessary and sufficient condition for moving on.
</P>
<P>
   But too many questions simply went unanswered. Who made the
deals? Who did the political leaders truly represent and were those
people ever truly consulted? How freely did the leaders and the led
consent to the deals and how well informed about them were the
countries' most interested parties, that is, the citizens?
</P>
<P>
   Would the arrangement withstand international and historical
scrutiny, particularly of a passionate and critical nature? How
would skeptical or frankly adverse local minorities react? Would
they be able to compromise on the understandings reached by others?
Would those agreements resist the test of time, further
investigations and new revelations? Today's situation in at least
two other countries illustrates the many pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   By now, South Africa's Truth and Amnesty Commission has released
its findings _ albeit, in the absence of all of the nation's
political parties while in the presence of tensions and discomfort
between two old friends and heroes who are true role models for
transitions everywhere: Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   Among the reasons for today's disenchantment with the
commission's report, its very existence and premises, one fact
clearly stands out. The idea that inspired its creation and work
was that the spirit of national reconciliation guiding the shift
from apartheid to majority rule in South Africa should also prevail
in dealing with the country's past. But this is no longer as
relevant or widespread as when the commission was set up.
</P>
<P>
   What then seemed fair, prudent and tolerant, today appears
callous and cynical; what today is deemed unacceptable and
insensitive then felt cautious and moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was better to demur in asking too many questions back
when Mandela was freed, when negotiations with the white minority
were in full swing and hanging by a thread, when civil war or a
mass exodus by the white community seemed imminent. Perhaps then
was the time to formulate those doubts, rather than now, when
resentment and discontent have set in.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly for Mexico. The country is painfully, desperately,
slowly proceeding with its move toward democratic rule, and while
settling scores with the past is certainly not the most pressing
task, it is one of the most delicate ones. From the student
massacre in Tlatelocolo in 1968 to the localized ``dirty war'' of
the 1970s to the electoral fraud of the 1980s and the corruption of
the 1990s, the PRI has a great deal to answer for.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe, sincerely, that the best solution is to bury the
past, the dead and the bank accounts and move forward. Others think
that some degree of accountability and punishment is indispensable
to ensure that impunity cease being a leitmotif of Mexican
political life.
</P>
<P>
   But no one really knows the cost of each option: whether
forgiving and forgetting is possible, or if burrowing into the past
is unavoidable. The Chilean precedent confounds everyone willing to
think the matter through.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chile has left its friends and its people perplexed,
perhaps undeservedly. For the past decade, the conventional wisdom
about the country was simple. Moderation and sensibility had
prevailed, national reconciliation had been achieved, successful
economic policies had been pursued. The past decades of
revolutionary turmoil and bloody repression had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Today we know that while Chile is a more prosperous nation than
before, it is as unequal in wealth and income distribution as ever,
and the polarization of its society is as acute as 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For the country's left, and center, and sympathizers and allies,
as well as for much of international public opinion, Pinochet is
the personification of evil: The man with the dark glasses is as
bad as they come. Yet for a large minority of the population, he is
still the saviour of a nation threatened by heathen communism and
inflationary socialism.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably preferable for Chileans to have uncovered this,
and for the rest of the world to begin to grasp that dealing with
the past is a very complicated matter, and that easy solutions, as
brisk and painless as they may seem, generally do not work.
</P>
<P>
   We can thank the dictator for this, but for nothing else.

VATICAN CONDUCTS FIRST INQUIRY INTO THE INQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ For the first time ever, the Vatican is conducting its
own inquisition of the Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   And, perhaps appropriately, the initial investigation of the
church's centuries-long effort to root out heretics is being held
behind closed doors. Visiting scholars attending the symposium are
being fed and housed in St. Martha's Residence, which was recently
completed to house the cardinals who will gather in conclave when
the time comes to elect a new pope.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the desire to keep the discussion at a cultural level
appropriate to the importance of the initiative which led us to
close the sessions to the public,'' Cardinal Roger Etchegaray, who
heads the Vatican's main committee on the year 2000, said in his
opening statement, which was issued by the Vatican. The cardinal
made clear that while the symposium would seek to separate fact
from myth about the Inquisition, it would not try to evade the
church's overall responsibility. Noting that efforts to distinguish
Inquisitions in Spain and Portugal from those in Italy had allowed
some to ``make apologetic arguments and lay responsibility for what
Iberian tribunals did onto civil authorities,'' Etchegaray said
such factors ``do not change the ecclesiastical character of the
institution.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-day symposium, which is to end Saturday night, is part
of the long and painful process Pope John Paul II began when he
called for the church to undertake a general ``examination of
conscience,'' as Christianity prepares to enter its third
millennium. At the same time last year, a similar symposium was
convened to examine, among other things, the role of Christian
teaching in the spread of anti-Semitism. That symposium was part of
a process that led John Paul to issue an ``act of repentance'' in
March for the failure of Catholics to deter the mass killing of
Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   This symposium, which gathered well-known Inquisition experts
from around the world, is intended to provide the pope with a
historical basis on which to decide whether in 2000 the church
should also repent for acts committed during the Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are preparing material based on historical truth which will
present the facts,'' said Msgr. Rino Fisichella, an official with
the Vatican's Commission for the Jubilee of the Year 2000. ``Then
it is up the the pope to decide.'' He quickly added that the pope's
conclusion was not predetermined. ``There are several ideas about
the Inquisition,'' he said. ``One is the result of research. The
other is the result of cliches and romances.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inquisition was established by Pope Gregory IX in 1231 as a
special court to curb the spread of heresy. In 1252 Pope Innocent
IV officially sanctioned the use of torture to extract the truth
from suspects. The papal tribunals took different forms in
different countries over the centuries, investigating and stamping
out various forms of heresy, from witchcraft to Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Inquisition established in 1478 by Queen Isabella
and King Ferdinand, with Rome's approval, mostly focused on
forcibly testing the sincerity of Jewish converts, though the
secular authorities also used torture to eliminate political
enemies. The Spanish Inquisition was not formally abolished until
1834.
</P>
<P>
   The Roman Inquisition, founded in 1542 as a Vatican agency to
battle the Reformation, still exists. Since 1965 it has been known
as the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, and is headed by
Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger.
</P>
<P>
   In January Ratzinger for the first time made the archives of the
Roman Inquisition available to scholars. ``We know all the sins of
the church,'' Ratzinger dryly said at the time. ``And I hope more
will not be added to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who in 1992 admitted that the church had erred in 1633
when it condemned as a heretic the astronomer Galileo, one of the
best-known victims of the Inquisition, seemed prepared to go even
further in a 1994 apostolic letter that laid out his plans for the
millennium. In it the pope deplored the ``acquiescence given,
especially in certain centuries, to intolerance and even the use of
violence in the service of truth.''
</P>
<P>
   He ascribed blame for ``acquiescence'' to individuals rather
than the church as an institution. But he said historical
circumstances did ``not exonerate the church from the obligation to
express profound regret for the weakness of so many of her sons and
daughters who sullied her face.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But some participants in the symposium said the brutality and
reigns of terror commonly associated with the Inquisition had been
exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much has been written in the past about the methods used by
the Inquisition, often based on erroneous or unreliable data,''
Agostino Borromeo, a historian who holds a church knighthood, said
in a statement distributed by the Vatican. ``The most recent
studies seem to indicate that torture and the death penalty were
not applied with the pitiless rigor that, according to some,
characterized the activity of the tribunals until their
disappearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of the outside historians expressed doubt that the
symposium would produce a tidy conclusion for the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ``My impression is that we were brought together to clear the
air, but without any specific aim,'' Henry Kamen, a professor at
the Higher Council for Scientific Research in Barcelona, said in an
interview between sessions. ``There are so many papers, and so many
diverse views and perspectives that one can easily lose one's
way.''

 &HT;    Internet reporter takes Microsoft, U.S. to task
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Lewis has a front row seat at the Microsoft
trial. He's filing regular dispatches for Slate
(http://www.slate.com), the subscription-only ($19.95 per year),
Microsoft-owned online magazine. While some might accuse him of
being a shameless Microsoft shill, it is nice to see someone from
the Microsoft side of the trial write about it in a colorful and
interesting way.
</P>
<P>
   He also appears to be the only online journalist writing about
the trial in some detail on a fairly regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   It's important to note Lewis isn't reporting _ he is painting an
impressionist portrait of the courtroom, the witness, the lawyers
and even the relative comfort of the chairs and benches in the
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``Trial Fever,'' is
mindful the man signing his checks is also the defendant in the
case he is covering. But his colorful articles are not straight
journalism, they focus on personal impressions and general
observations.
</P>
<P>
   This type of writing gives Slate _ which has vowed to remain
neutral in all things Microsoft _ just the wiggle room it needs
with a story like this.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' ``dispatches,'' posted to the site in the form of e-mail
messages, tries to give readers a ``you are there'' feeling.
Descriptions such as this from Day One are typical:
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why the wheels of justice must grind slowly.
But must they also grind unpleasantly? The district court in
Washington, D.C., has the charm and efficiency of a Soviet customs
office.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis takes Microsoft and the government to task sometimes on a
very personal level. He fires potshots at the Justice Department
lawyers prosecuting the software giant including David Boies, who
Lewis notes was wearing his signature cheap suit on opening day.
</P>
<P>
   However dissing the prosecutor's wardrobe choices and his New
Jersey homeboy accent (Lewis devotes as much time to how people
says things as he does to what they actually say) is just one of
Lewis' tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Of Microsoft lawyer Warden, Lewis describes him in his
cross-examination of Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale as a man ``intent
on booming out as many insults as possible in the rudest possible
tones ... if Warden were naturally so repellent he could hardly get
through life; he'd spend his days being tossed out of taxicabs and
restaurants.''
</P>
<P>
   Is this an indictment of Warden as a belligerent trial lawyer or
a portrait of a shrewd legal mind, staging a calculating
cross-examination. It's hard to tell. And maybe Slate and Microsoft
like it that way.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Lewis' best nugget of courtroom drama comes in his
description of Gates, in his taped testimony ``looking as if he had
swallowed a bad oyster,'' Lewis writes, ``denying much of what he
had written.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also unimpressed with the Microsoft legal team and
concludes the Microsoft defense so far ``is not much more than a
gloriously indiscriminate, flailing attack on Netscape.''
</P>
<P>
   When the trial ends, this will surely make a great book. Lewis
understands the trial for what it is: a tangle of legal and
economic deeds and misdeeds that nobody, not even those involved,
can quite make sense of.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end,'' Lewis says, ``I'd like to think that after the
facts are out, other things being equal, the judge will favor the
lawyer who minimizes the workload.''

 &HT;    Soyinka finds reports of Nigerian democracy unsatisfactory
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nelson Mandela traveled to Nigeria on Friday to spread
the word: Nigeria is on the march toward restoring democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But in Atlanta the most outspoken critic of Nigeria's long and
brutal domination by the military was sounding much less joyous.
</P>
<P>
   Wole Soyinka, who just returned from a visit to his homeland
last week, said the country still remains far from the kind of
success story Mandela has engineered in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela went to Nigeria for the annual summit of the Economic
Community of West African States and added his voice to a chorus of
praise for Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar. Abubakar's plans to turn over
power to an elected government are a ``courageous step by a man of
true vision,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   It was a meeting of real symbolic value for the government. But,
citing numerous tensions and unresolved issues, Soyinka pointed to
another event from the recent news as a symbol for Nigeria today:
The gasoline-fed pipeline inferno in the village of Jesse last week
that killed an estimated 700 people.
</P>
<P>
   The 64-year-old author is currently the Robert W. Woodruff
Professor of the Arts at Emory University, and his recent visit
home was his first since Abubakar's government lifted trumped-up
treason charges against him as a gesture to the democratic
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   While there, Soyinka, who is widely regarded as his nation's
most famous exile, made several ``thunderbolt-heaving speeches,''
according to press reports.
</P>
<P>
   Soyinka chuckled at the description: ``Let's say that I went
there specifically _ because of the timing _ to set what I hope
will be a direction of genuine debate toward the new nation, the
new Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was clearly not satisfied with what he witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to power after strongman Sani Abacha's death from a
heart attack in June, Abubakar has released many political
prisoners and begun a process leading to elections to restore
democracy. As Mandela's visit suggested, reaction to the
government's change of direction has been generally favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Also Friday, the European Union decided to lift most of its
anti-Nigeria sanctions enacted in 1995. The EU said it would begin
easing the sanctions Sunday because of the new government's moves
toward democracy and economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   But Soyinka, best known as a playwright whose works have delved
into such issues as colonialism and the forces that allow
dictatorships to exist, said that during his visit he was depressed
to find many enemies of democracy have yet to come around.
</P>
<P>
   Cobbled together by the British, the ethnically-diverse country
has long suffered because people's differences have been
``shamelessly exploited by a power hungry minority,'' Soyinka said.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's oil-rich south, several ethnic groups are
fighting each other for control of local government and oil
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Civil war remains a possibility, Soyinka said: ``I think that
threat will become very real if segments of the country refuse to
accept the necessity of restructuring.''
</P>
<P>
   As outlined by Abubakar's government, the path to a restored
democracy begins in earnest in December with local elections. A
series of elections will follow, leading up to a vote for a new
president in February. Abubakar has taken himself out of the
running for that post.
</P>
<P>
   But Soyinka said reform of the military _ which has dominated
Nigerian life for much of its modern history _ has not moved as
quickly as he would like. ``Genuine reform will not take place
until the military goes back to barracks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He criticized Abubakar for rejecting calls to step aside for ``a
national unity government'' while a new constitution could be
adopted and for failing to acknowledge the need for a truth
commission, much like the one headed by Archbishop-emeritus Desmond
Tutu in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Like South Africa, Nigeria needs a truth panel probing into what
went awry in its history, Soyinka said. Like the South African
commission, the proposed Nigerian panel would hear from both
victims and their torturers. But, unlike fellow Emory professor
Tutu, Soyinka did not stress the idea that such a process leads to
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that reconciliation is something we must leave to
people themselves,'' Soyinka said. ``We just want to make sure that
memory is kept alive. Justice for me is paramount, but first we
must have memory.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there have been calls for him to seek the presidency,
Soyinka said he has no plans to be a candidate. And, despite his
reservations about the election process, he did not rule out the
possibility that a leader could emerge who could unite the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria ``has the potential to be a viable entity,'' he said,
explaining that the regional and ethnic differences that have been
exploited in the past are really the kind of plurality that makes a
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one reason to be optimistic,'' he added. ``And that is
the evidence of the resiliency of the Nigerian people. One thing I
found when I was there: The indomitable spirit of the people has
never been touched.''

 &HT;    Voters to decide wide-ranging intitiatives; pot use most debated
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When voters go to the polls nationwide on Tuesday,
they'll do more than elect candidates. In 44 states, including
Georgia, voters also will decide 235 ballot initiatives on such
wide-ranging issues as medicinal marijuana, campaign finance and
animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Michigan, home state to suicide advocate Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, will determine whether that state becomes the second in
the nation to allow doctor-assisted suicide. And voters in Alaska
and Hawaii will have a say on same-sex marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are fewer ballot initiatives this year than in
1994 or 1996, the trend for voters to decide controversial issues
directly has increased significantly during the 1990s. This year,
citizens initiated 60 ballot questions in 24 states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a general dissatisfaction that people have been
expressing about government,'' said Jennie Drage, a research
analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, a
bipartisan lobbying group with offices in Washington and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most controversial measures this year involves
allowing the legal use of marijuana for medical purposes, which is
on the ballot in Nevada, Oregon, Washington and Alaska. A marijuana
initiative also could be on Colorado's ballot, depending on a
judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unbelievable controversy here,'' Drage said of the
Colorado measure.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of legal use want doctors to be able to prescribe
marijuana for the treatment of cancer, AIDS, glaucoma, chronic
pain, seizures and muscle spasms. Opponents say there's no credible
medical evidence to support legalization.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's drug czar, Barry McCaffrey, garnered some
powerful support last week when former presidents Bush, Carter and
Ford publicly declared their opposition to legalization.
</P>
<P>
   Polls, nonetheless, indicate that voters support the marijuana
initiatives in Alaska, Oregon and Washington. The Nevada vote could
go either way.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to medical use, Oregon also is considering a measure
that would make possession of small amounts of marijuana a
low-level misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona has a measure that would require Food and Drug
Administration approval before doctors could prescribe such
Schedule I drugs as heroin, LSD and marijuana. That effort is
lagging in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Voters in Arizona also will consider an initiative to enact
voluntary campaign finance and reporting guidelines. Massachusetts
voters will consider a similar measure. Both initiatives mirror
Clean Elections Acts passed in Maine and Vermont that provide for
public financing but which have not gone into effect yet.
</P>
<P>
   On a related political front, voters in Alaska, Colorado and
Idaho will consider measures on term limits for elected officials.
These so-called scarlet-letter laws, because candidates often have
to declare their position on term limits and that information is
placed on ballots next to their names, usually do not survive legal
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Term limits in the '90s have been up in some shape in every
election,'' said Drage. ``Campaign finance has been out a lot in
the '90s also. They are two measures that voters tend to pass. I
suspect it has to do with all the frustrations people feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Initiatives related to the environment and animal rights also
are popular this year.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska has measures prohibiting billboards as well as outlawing
the trapping of wolves with snares. In Arizona, voters will weigh
in on cockfighting, and California will consider banning certain
traps and poisons. Ohio will decide whether to outlaw the hunting
of mourning doves. New Jersey will vote on setting aside $98
million a year to preserve open space and farmland.
</P>
<P>
   Montana residents will decide whether to ban the use of cyanide
in most open pit gold and silver mining. The poison is prized by
miners for its ability to extract gold and silver from rock, but
spills that contaminated water sources have caused concern among
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon environmentalists placed an initiative on the ballot to
prohibit many current timber harvest practices and to impose more
restrictive regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion, a divisive issue for the past 30 years, is on the
ballot in Colorado, where voters will consider measures on
partial-birth abortions and parental notification. Washington
voters also will consider an abortion measure.
</P>
<P>
   Another controversial issue _ same-sex marriages _ will be
decided in Alaska and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska will vote on a constitutional amendment passed by the
legislature that reads: ``To be valid or recognized in this state,
a marriage may exist only between one man and one woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii, which nearly allowed same-sex marriages through the
courts recently, will consider amending the constitution to give
the legislature authority ``to reserve marriage to opposite-sex
couples.''
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists reportedly are more hopeful about their chances in
Hawaii than Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina also will look at the institution of marriage,
with an initiative to remove the section of the state constitution
that outlaws marriages between blacks and whites. According to
Drage, the state hasn't enforced that provision since the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled a similar law illegal 30 years ago in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   On another controversial subject, Michigan voters will look at
doctor-assisted suicide. Oregon has passed a similar measure, but
Michigan's chances are hindered by Kevorkian's stigma, little
financial support and disorganized support.
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action will get a hearing in Washington, where
Coretta Scott King has implored voters to maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' she said in an open letter, ``we do not live
in a society that is truly color-blind, and until that day comes,
affirmative action remains a necessary and vital tool towards
equality.''
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters say the vote is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia has 10 measures, none considered controversial. Among
them are initiatives on property taxes for churches and veterans
and a measure to exempt former prisoners of war from having to pay
ad valorem taxes on their motor vehicles. Other measures would
create a Land, Water, Wildlife and Recreation Heritage Fund, a
Brain and Spinal Injury Trust Fund and a Roadside Enhancement and
Beautification Fund.

U.S. ECONOMY DEFIES EXPECTATIONS, MAY BE HEADING FOR A `SOFT
LANDING' 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's economy steamed ahead in the third
quarter, defying expectations the economic crisis in Asia and Latin
America would prompt a more dramatic slowdown here.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. gross domestic product _ the sum of all goods and
service produced in the country _ grew at a robust 3.3 percent for
the three months ending Sept. 30, the U.S. Commerce Department
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That was nearly twice the 1.8 percent rate for the second
quarter and substantially better than the 2.2 percent most
economists were predicting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means the economy still has a lot of life in it, still
has a lot of momentum behind it,'' said Bryan Jordan, economics
analyst for Banc One Investment Advisors in Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in growth, however, does not mean the economy has
completely shaken the effects of an economic crisis that has
ravaged much of the rest of the world, several economists said. The
quarterly growth numbers include volatile inventory figures, which
were skewed by the end of the General Motors strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some cause to celebrate, but you don't want to go
overboard,'' said Bob Brusca, chief economist for Nikko Securities
in New York. ``There are things that should slow the economy
down.''
</P>
<P>
   The economy is no longer chugging along at the hefty 4.2 percent
growth rate of year ago or the 5.5 percent pace of the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But with a growth rate of 3.3 percent a ``recession is not in
sight,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis. Instead, the economy may be heading for the kind of
``soft landing'' experts have been hoping for, Sohn said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hailed the Commerce Department data Friday as
evidence his administration has helped create ``an American
economic renaissance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy is continuing to grow in a strong manner, at a
solid 3.3 percent,'' Clinton said from the White House's South
Portico. ``It is continuing to expand opportunity, to create
wealth, to lift the hopes of working families. In the face of
worldwide economic turmoil, our economy remains the strongest in a
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered Friday, with the Dow Jones Industrial
Average rising 164 points during the day before settling up 97.07
points to close at 8,592.10. By the end of trading, the Dow had
racked up its best monthly advance in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices retreated on fears the upbeat economic report,
coupled with figures showing wages rising at their fastest pace in
eight years, would give ammunition to those at the Federal Reserve
Bank reluctant to cut interest rates further.
</P>
<P>
   The central bank reduced its overnight lending rate by a quarter
of a percentage point on Sept. 29, and then cut it by another
quarter point on Oct. 15. Federal Reserve policy-makers are slated
to meet again on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department report, however, did not suggest a
return of inflation. The GDP deflator _ a broad measure considered
a more accurate indicator of inflation than the better-known
consumer price index _ grew at a mere 0.8 percent in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, inflation is nowhere to be found,'' Jordan said.
``That's as close as you can get to price stability.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence the economy is slowing down, some economists pointed
to a drop in personal spending growth from 6.1 percent in the first
half of the year to 3.9 percent in the third quarter, which is
still a healthy rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little bit like going from 80 miles per hour to 70;
you're still north of the speed limit and really moving,'' Brusca
said.
</P>
<P>
   Home sales fell for the third month in a row in September, the
Commerce Department said in a separate report Friday. Sales of new,
single-family homes dropped 1 percent to 822,000 units, after
falling 4.9 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the economy is slowing much more dramatically. With
energy prices languishing below $15 a barrel, a number of energy
service companies have cut hundreds of jobs in recent weeks,
including Nabors Industries, Baker Hughes and Cooper Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Between July and September, Houston lost 3,700 jobs, compared to
an average increase of 11,000 jobs in the same period over the past
three years. &QL;

<P>
   Paying corporate employees with stock options is promoted as a
way to align the interests of executives and other workers with
those of shareholders. But while investors are encouraged to stick
with a stock for the long term and to hold on tight if prices
slide, many companies have developed a hair-trigger response to
market dips when it comes to options pricing.
</P>
<P>
   In October alone, more than 100 companies revealed options
repricings, either in announcements or in filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, a review of these documents
found, and analysts expect many more companies to join the parade.
</P>
<P>
   By moving quickly when the market was down temporarily, some of
these companies gave employees a boost to their wealth when the
market leaped back to life _ one that would be shared only by
investors who bought new shares during the market dip.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies that have announced repricings are tiny, like
Interactive Flight Technologies of Phoenix, which makes in-flight
entertainment systems for airlines. It went public in 1997 at $8 a
share and gave employees options at that price. But when its stock
plummeted this fall, Interactive repriced all its options down to
87{ cents. The stock now trades at 62{ cents.
</P>
<P>
   A few better-known companies have also repriced options,
including Ziff-Davis and CMP Media, the magazine publishers;
Reebok, the shoemaker, and Republic Industries, H. Wayne Huizenga's
network of car dealerships. Ziff-Davis repriced options for all
employees; the other three excluded senior management.
</P>
<P>
   An option is the right to buy shares in the future at a preset
price. If the stock rises in value, the holder can profit from the
difference between the preset _ or ``strike'' _ price and the
market price when the option is exercised.
</P>
<P>
   Options have become an increasingly important part of corporate
compensation, sometimes creating hundreds of millions of dollars in
wealth for executives. Many companies have begun extending options
plans to lower-ranking managers and rank-and-file workers, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if a stock's market price falls below the strike
price, the options are ``underwater'' and cannot be exercised
except at a loss. That is supposed to be the chance the holder
takes.
</P>
<P>
   But in this year's market turmoil, many companies have rewritten
options terms to spare their holders from getting wet.
</P>
<P>
   Robert G. Monks, a principal in Lens Inc., an investment firm
that has long pressed to reign in executive pay, predicted that by
next May, when the majority of companies will have filed proxy
statements, ``repricing options will be virtually universal.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is extreme, said David L. Yermack, an associate
professor of finance at New York University's Stern School of
Business. His research, published earlier this year, found that
smaller companies repriced about 2 percent of executive options
annually from 1992 to 1995. He expects 10 percent to 20 percent of
companies to reprice options by next May.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are enough firms that know how much institutional
investors object to repricing options and would not do it under any
circumstances,'' Yermack said. ``A clear third of the Fortune 500
would see it as morally reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the filings in October, Yermack said that ``you would
think people would wait more than a month or two after the price
drops before doing this.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue was addressed last Monday by John Bogle, the senior
chairman and founder of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds, during
a speech at a conference sponsored by the Investor Responsibility
Research Center. Bogle urged colleagues to ``take a firm stand''
against repricings that are ``grossly unfair'' to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Monks said options repricings, especially when extended to
senior executives, showed that ``the market in executive
compensation has been contrived and is not an honest market.'' He
denounced what he called ``the fraud of options that are a one-way
street _ I win when I win and I still win when my shareholders
lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Salwen of the Executive Compensation Corp., a consulting
firm in New York, said two recent calls from clients suggested that
companies were of two very different minds these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first call was from a company suffering underwater options
that wanted advice on repricing,'' Salwen said, ``and the next call
was a company that wants to grant out-of-the-money underwater
options as an incentive to executives to bring up the stock price.
I've never experienced that juxtaposition before.''
</P>
<P>
   A review of the filings with the SEC also found two significant
trends in options repricing. One is to award options that vest, or
become eligible to be exercised, in monthly rather than annual
increments. That gives employees at least some of their options
much sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The other trend has showed up at companies like Royal Gold, a
Denver concern with royalty interests in Nevada gold-mining
operations. Royal Gold repriced all its outstanding options, but
reduced their number by 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Employees were left with the same potential economic value they
had before, based on an option-valuation technique known as the
Black-Scholes method, said Stanley Dempsey, the company's chief
executive. (Some 54 percent of the affected options belong to him.)
</P>
<P>
   For options holders, there is an upside and downside to such a
repricing: If the stock price rises to a level between the old and
new strike prices, the holder will now profit. But if the stock
price soars above the original strike price, the profit potential
is limited by the reduced number of options.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologically, however, many workers feel that they are better
off with such a repricing: They stand to gain even if the company's
prospects are not as rosy as they once might have seemed. Salwen
said he expected many companies to adopt this approach, which is
more palatable to institutional investors than a straight
repricing.
</P>
<P>
   But in highly competitive job markets, he said, ``it will not be
enough to calm the waters and keep people from walking'' to a rival
offering a bigger options package.

POLITICAL MODERATION PREVAILS IN STATE WITH POLARIZED TRADITION

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When this election year began in California, the
big political questions were whether the Republican nominee for
governor, state Attorney General Dan Lungren, a staunch foe of
abortion, was too conservative to appeal to swing voters in this
diverse and giant state, and whether Sen. Barbara Boxer was too
liberal to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the election season winds down here, Lungren trails his
Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by double-digits in the
polls. And Boxer finally appears to have opened a solid lead over
her Republican challenger, state Treasurer Matt Fong _ but only by
outspending him 2 to 1 in television advertisements that paint him
as extremist.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, moderation is the watchword in the Golden State this
year, and Davis, a 23-year veteran of state government widely
mocked as the dullest politician in his party, appears on the verge
of a major victory that will put him in charge not only of the
world's seventh largest economy but also of the political
redistricting of the nation's largest state _ and thus, a big chunk
of Congress _ two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   That blandness has become the dominant political virtue in a
state that not so very long ago produced the polar partisan
opposites of Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown _ and at a time when
partisan divisions are deeper than ever in many aspects of national
political debate _ says much about current feeling in a place long
viewed as an incubator of American trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like bookends,'' said Bill Carrick, a South Carolinian
who has been a Democratic political consultant in Washington and,
for nearly a decade, here in Los Angeles. ``On the one hand, you
have a national Republican Party increasingly dominated by Southern
politicians, with a unique, Southern-fried Republicanism
exemplified by Trent Lott, Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and Tom
DeLay.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrick added, ``California has a big pile of Republican
moderates who are pro-choice, very sensitive to environmental
protection, worried about the coast and offshore oil drilling,
afraid of random violence and therefore more supportive of gun
controls _ basically 25 percent of the party with a political
philosophy that is more like the philosophy of independents than it
is like other Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Davis, a decorated Army veteran of the Vietnam War
who supports the death penalty, has relentlessly exploited those
tensions in the Republican Party in a state where party
registration is about evenly divided but where Republicans have
controlled the governorship for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has succeeded to such a degree that in the most recent Los
Angeles Times Poll on the election last week, he led Lungren 53
percent to 42 percent among people it considered likely to vote,
and drew nearly 5 in 10 of the voters who described themselves as
moderate Republicans. By contrast, more than 5 in 10 moderate
Republicans had an unfavorable impression of Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   In a particular bit of bad news for Lungren, a higher percentage
of voters viewed Lungren negatively than they did Brown, for whom
Davis worked as chief of staff in Sacramento and whom Lungren has
tried to turn into a hot-button liberal by association in this
race. Instead, Davis has made Lungren's old voting record as a
conservative congressman _ against creating the Department of
Education, against reparations for Japanese-Americans interned in
World War II _ stick against him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Boxer, an outspoken liberal from Marin County
north of San Francisco, was locked for months in a tight race with
Fong, a soft-spoken, fresh-faced political newcomer, because voters
perceived her as out of step with California's prevailing political
order. In her six years in the Senate she has not managed to expand
her base of support, and only broke 50 percent in her job approval
ratings for the first time last week.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent weeks, with a series of television commercials
attacking Fong's opposition to new gun control laws and accusing
him of opposing tougher environmental standards, did Boxer gain the
upper hand in the campaign give-and-take. A statewide Field Poll
made public Thursday showed her leading Fong 51 percent to 42
percent among people it regarded as likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's biggest break came when The San Francisco Examiner
disclosed this week that in June, Fong gave $50,000 in campaign
funds left over from a past race for state treasurer to the
Traditional Values Coalition, an Orange County-based group that
opposes abortion, birth control and gay rights and favors school
prayer and tougher obscenity laws.
</P>
<P>
   That disclosure so angered Fong's gay supporters that he
promptly signed a letter agreeing to support most of their
legislative priorities, including a series of bills outlawing
discrimination against homosexuals in employment and housing and
working to increase funds for AIDS research. And that, in turn,
angered Fong's conservative religious supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fong has damaged himself terribly,'' said Sherry Bebitch
Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate School.
``Barbara Boxer is a very polarizing politician, but the reality of
it is, she is closer to the views of those moderates on issues that
Democrats have skillfully made wedge issues, particularly gun
control and abortion rights. What she has managed to do is push
those buttons that concern moderate and independent voters.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Boxer basked in the glow of the most popular
politician in the state, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who in her six
years in office has managed to build broad appeal with her
sponsorship of controls on assault weapons and a tough anti-crime
stance. At a joint appearance in Santa Monica, which has recently
seen an unusual wave of gang-related shootings, Boxer and Feinstein
complained that Fong opposes new gun control measures, including a
ban on junk guns and a requirement for child safety locks.

 LOS ANGELES: safety locks.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has helped that Fong, a former Air Force officer and member
of the state Board of Equalization and Assessment, has been
tentative in debates and has not drawn the unalloyed support of the
national Republican Party, which can get a bigger bang for its
advertising dollars in battleground states where television time is
less costly.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief appearance in Los Angeles' Chinatown on Thursday,
intended to rally support among Asian-American voters, Fong left
without taking any questions. Instead, he turned the podium over to
his campaign manager, who played videotapes of new television
commercials, including one featuring the candidate's mother, March
Fong Eu, the longtime former Democratic secretary of state here,
saying Boxer ``should be ashamed'' of her attacks, and another
branding the senator ``too liberal and ineffective for
California.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lungren has been hard-pressed to move his campaign
much beyond the issue of crime. On a visit to the Robert E. Lee
Elementary School in a minority neighborhood in his hometown of
Long Beach on Wednesday, Lungren read a Halloween story but spoke
listlessly to parents and teachers about education, never
mentioning his main proposal: giving government vouchers to allow
parents of children in troubled public schools to send them to
private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Only the next morning, at a ceremony honoring crime victims in
which Mayors Rudolph Giuliani of New York and Richard Riordan of
Los Angeles participated, did Lungren seem to come alive.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem for the Republicans here, Ms. Jeffe said, is
that their own base of party activists is increasingly dominated by
conservatives who produce candidates like Lungren, while elections
are won in the center. President Clinton showed the national appeal
of that brand of centrism two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carrick, the Democratic consultant, noted that Californians of
both parties tend to migrate here from other states in search of
one kind or another of freedom from their old worlds, ``and that by
definition makes them more open-minded and far less judgemental''
than voters in many other regions. But he predicted that
California's penchant for moderation could become its latest
export.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a big influence in and of itself, just because
of its size,'' Carrick said. ``But in terms of the ability of the
political trends here to translate to other places, I think there's
going to be a continuing counter-reaction to the increasingly
conservative brand of Republicans in other parts of the country,
and then we're going to look back in 10 years and say it started in
California.''

`THE TEMPTATIONS': A SMASHING SUCCESS WITH A SOLE SURVIVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1965, the No. 1 pop record in the United States was ``My
Girl,'' a sugary ballad sung by five young men from Detroit who
called themselves the Temptations. The tale of how they reached
that exalted moment, and of the tragic letdown that followed, has
been dramatized in ``The Temptations,'' a four-hour film that NBC
is presenting Sunday and Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
   The group, with changing membership, continued to make top-rated
records for 10 years, then kept right on singing. The pasteurized
rhythm-and-blues sound of hits like ``Get Ready'' and ``Papa Was a
Rollin' Stone'' will be warmly familiar to the baby boomers who
keep oldies acts, including the Temptations, in business.
</P>
<P>
   But these greatest hits cannot compensate for the movie's bland
storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   At least 19 men have blended their voices as Temptations since
the group was welcomed under the wing of Berry Gordy, the master of
Motown, in 1961. But only one singer, Otis Williams, has been part
of the act every precision dance step of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Williams still singing with the Temptations, but he
is also the sole member of the original quintet still alive.
History may be written by the victors, but it is certainly edited
by the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is listed as a co-producer of the film, which was based
on his autobiography. And while he played a background role onstage
and on record, he describes himself as the glue that held the group
together, sometimes at painful personal expense. The film ticks off
the terrible sacrifices made by Williams and the other Temptations,
who were ultimately destroyed by their dalliances with fame. But
this real-life drama is hammered into flat melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Portraying Williams, Charles Malik Whitfield is called upon to
age some 30 years, from a teen-ager with a heart full of dreams to
a middle-aged man with a head full of memories. The passage of time
is represented by changing clothes and hair styles; one looks in
vain for any deeper consequences of time's passing. But what can
any actor do with a script that conveys youthful hope with a line
like ``We ain't got nowhere to go but up''?
</P>
<P>
   As written by Kevin Arkadie, Robert P. Johnson and Alan
Landsburg and directed by Allan Arkush, the film is the grandchild
of the oversimplified Technicolor show-biz biopics of the 1940s. It
rushes through a dizzying series of vignettes, giving them all
equal weight, before rushing on to the next snippet of song.
</P>
<P>
   The most fascinating of the early Temptations, self-destructive
David Ruffin, played by an actor known simply as Leon, is reduced
to a catlike swagger.
</P>
<P>
   A few actors do manage to move beyond the cryptic script into
flesh-and-blood characterizations. As the bass Melvin Franklin,
Williams' only real friend among the Temptations, D.B. Woodside
locates the essence of a mama's boy who matures into a man. Along
with the film's two mamas, Jenifer Lewis as Melvin's mother and
Tina Lafford as Otis', he suggests the kind of heartfelt film that
might have been.

GETTING TIME OFF FOR GOOD EXCUSES  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, NOV. 1)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost everyone appreciates a little time away from the job, but
some people take more than their fair share. In some cases, fate
takes a hand and extends a vacation or otherwise accounts for an
absence. But sometimes an employee's sheer creativity carves a few
extra days from the work calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Did you ever run across one of those people who never really
takes a conventional vacation _ you know, the kind who says, ``I'll
just take Mondays and Fridays off instead''?
</P>
<P>
   R. James Aber of Glen Rock, N.J., tells of a colleague who once
received permission to take Mondays and Fridays off in lieu of a
week or two at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Aber says months went by before anyone realized that his
colleague's Mondays and Fridays had long since exceeded his
allotted vacation days.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, according to Aber's postscript, the company
went bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many years ago, as a young and slightly irresponsible
employee, I took a four-day ski trip to Aspen, Colo., with a
roommate,'' writes Leila Meresman of Manhattan. On the third day,
they met some young men.
</P>
<P>
   On the fourth day, when Miss Meresman and her roommate were
supposed to catch a midday flight back to New York, the men talked
them into ``missing'' it and staying in Colorado for another day.
Miss Meresman called her office and said she was snowed in but
would be certain to catch the first flight in the morning. In fact,
snow hadn't fallen for more than a week.
</P>
<P>
   Lo and behold, the next morning, a major blizzard swept in. The
airport was closed for four days.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Meresman says she was lucky to have a job when she got home
and has never again messed with Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   There's a P.S.: ``Still know the guys. Have a new job.''
</P>
<P>
   Beth Searing, who lives in Basking Ridge, N.J., and works as
secretary, went to Florida for a few days with a friend. Upon their
arrival, they smashed up their rental car and had to be taken to
their hotel by the police. At midnight, fire broke out in the
hotel, and Ms. Searing and her friend ended up on the street in
their pajamas. Then, she said, her return home was delayed by court
appearances related to the car accident, and she missed two days of
work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Searing didn't rid herself of the stress that had driven her
to Florida in the first place, but she did lose something besides
those two workdays: 10 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   John McInerney, a real-estate executive on Long Island, can
still quote the best excuse he has ever heard from an employee:
``Look, I'm having the best time of my life at this place, and your
choice is to let me have another day here, or I swear I will make
your life a living hell.''
</P>
<P>
   McInerney writes, ``I let her have the day.''
</P>
<P>
   She had her doubts about hiring the overqualified young man from
Peru but was desperate to fill an entry-level position in the area
she supervised, writes Florence McDermott of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks on the job, the newly minted employee ``called
to tell me he received a draft notice from the Peruvian army and
needed a day off to consult an uncle in Queens about his options.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bad news the next day,'' she writes. ``The Fujimori government
meant business, according to Uncle, who suggested pleading with the
Peruvian ambassador.''
</P>
<P>
   Another day off was granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even worse news the next day. The ambassador hinted that
family property in Peru would be confiscated'' if the young man
didn't show up for induction. The employee begged for a few more
days' leave so he could plead his case in Lima. Again, the request
was granted. A few days later, his mother called to say that he was
still in Lima, negotiating with the army, and that she was praying
for him.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Ms. McDermott writes, a co-worker ``spies him
leaving an office building in Manhattan and then runs smack into
him on Metro North.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He admits that he's working as a financial analyst at another
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``My co-workers and I now refer to absent job-hunting colleagues
as `joining the Peruvian army.' ''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A 61-year-old woman smiles reassuringly into the
camera and tells viewers that Kenneth (Buddy) MacKay, the Democrat
running for Florida governor, is an all-around great guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should know,'' says the woman, Anne MacKay, in a commercial
that has been on television for eight weeks. ``We've been married
39 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. MacKay is among the new stars of this year's campaign ads:
political wives offering testimonials that their husbands can be
counted on. Candidates' spouses have appeared in campaign
advertisements before, but they usually sat silently alongside
their neatly dressed children in family portraits.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for the first time, the wives of a number of
candidates, Democratic candidates in particular, are out in front,
with greater prominence and a new purpose. Many have speaking
roles, and almost all talk about their husbands' values.
</P>
<P>
   None of the wives featured in this season's commercials come out
and say it: ``Hey, no Clinton problem here.'' But in the year of
Monica Lewinsky, the subtext is clear, according to some of those
who make and study these advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Barnes, a Democrat running for governor of Georgia, has made
a number of advertisements prominently featuring his wife of 28
years, Mary Barnes. And Raymond Strother, the Washington political
consultant who made the commercials, said they are a tactful but
necessary way for Democrats like Barnes to inoculate themselves
from any hint of sexual scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character is a big question this year, and the family values
issue is a tricky one for Democrats because of what's been going on
with the head of the Democratic Party,'' Strother said. ``So we're
all trying to portray them as having a long-term commitment. People
are thinking more about the personal lives of the candidates this
year, and it would be foolish to deny that's a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You have wives on the air as a subtle way to say, `I'm not
Bill Clinton,''' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg
School of Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. ``And
what's new is the number of wives _ many more this year _ in so
many prominent races, and so many talking, and saying, `We've been
married 12 years'; `We've been married 24 years,' `We've been
married 39 years.'''
</P>
<P>
   (The husbands of female candidates occasionally appear in
commercials, too, but only to smile in the style long ago perfected
by feminine helpmates.)
</P>
<P>
   Even before Republicans began broadcasting commercials that
refer to the sex scandal directly, Strother said, ``most of us were
buying insurance policies against that kind of thing by showing the
spouses.''
</P>
<P>
   In Barnes' case, Strother said, the advertisements have dual
purposes, contrasting Barnes' personal life both to the president's
and to that of Barnes' Republican opponent, Guy Millner, who has
been married three times.
</P>
<P>
   This year's preoccupation with the sex lives of public officials
was recently parodied in a series of mock campaign advertisements
on ``Saturday Night Live,'' in which a candidate admitted that his
chief qualification for office was that a fire had left him unable
to cheat on his wife. ``I get phantom pains when I even think about
sex,'' he said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the real campaign advertisements are only slightly less
obvious. And almost always, they try to tie the candidate's
personal life to his public performance.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Republicans have done commercials highlighting
their happy homes. An advertisement for Mike Simpson, speaker of
the Idaho House who is running for Congress, shows his wife pouring
lemonade at a family picnic. The voiceover says, ``Mike married his
high school sweetheart, Kathy, 28 years ago.'' The commercial
continues, ``Later, Dr. Mike followed in his father's footsteps and
joined the family dental practice. Kathy's mom is part of the
family now, passing Idaho values from generation to generation.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the advertisements are for Democrats like Evan Bayh,
senatorial candidate from Indiana, whose wife, Susan Bayh, narrates
a commercial in which she and her husband are shown playing with
their twin sons, who will be 3 in November. Mrs. Bayh says, ``Evan
and I are working hard to instill in our boys the right type of
values, the same set of Hoosier values Evan fought for as
governor.'' In closing, she says, ``Evan will bring Hoosier values
to Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bayh said her appearance in the advertisement had nothing
to do with Clinton's problems. ``We had planned this way back in
July,'' she said, the month before Clinton admitted the affair,
though half a year after most Americans had, according to polls,
already concluded it took place.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Squier, the Washington consultant who made the
advertisement in which Mrs. Bayh appeared, allowed that ``with
20/20 hindsight, I'm glad we ran that spot, and I'm sure a lot of
other people are, too, with Republicans once again trying to turn
things to Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bayh said that such commercials work only if the image that
the wife is pitching happens to be accurate. ``You can't create a
new image,'' she said. ``It can only solidify a person's feelings
if you're saying something people already believe to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants who have made similar commercials said they feel
they have to be careful, and right, when they tacitly advertise a
man's fidelity, because a wife's testimonial could easily backfire,
potentially even smoking out stories about long-past affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, many Americans responded to news of the president's
affair with a former White House intern by saying that if Hillary
Rodham Clinton was sticking by her husband, they would, too. So
voters might feel comforted by a wife's support even if her
publicly sworn faith in her husband turned out to be undeserved.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In either case, the appearance of a devoted wife is not always a
help, and has already proved a serious miscalculation for at least
one Democratic congressional candidate. John Rose was heavily
favored to win the Democratic primary for the open seat in
Kentucky's 6th Congressional District until he began broadcasting
an advertisement narrated by his much younger and very pregnant
blond wife, who was shown sitting on a couch rubbing her swollen
belly while he looked on, grinning.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement is widely considered the most likely reason he
lost in the Democratic primary to Ernesto Scorsone, a slightly more
liberal candidate who is given less chance of winning the election
in the conservative-leaning district.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. MacKay, whose commercial in the Florida governor's race has
generated more positive calls from supporters than any of MacKay's
other advertisements, said she was not trying to make any point
larger than that she thinks her husband would be a better governor
than his opponent, Republican Jeb Bush.
</P>
<P>
   (And Mrs. MacKay's commercial is at least as subtle as a recent
Bush advertisement that shows a burglar at work, apparently
thrilled with news that MacKay supports a tax on burglar alarms.
While making off with a television, he pauses to say, ``Way to go,
Buddy.'')
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. MacKay said she hopes the trend of wives in the forefront
endures beyond this year's focus on wives as protectors of their
husbands' honor. ``Because women's roles have changed, a woman is
seen more as a partner'' whose word about her husband counts for
something, Mrs. MacKay said.
</P>
<P>
   And women other than political wives do seem to figure more
prominently in this year's campaign advertisements, Dr. Jamieson
said: A few moms have cropped up, too.
</P>
<P>
   One is Doris Chabot, who appears in a commercial for her son,
Republican Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio. ``He understands the
importance of keeping promises,'' Mrs. Chabot says in the
commercial, referring to her son's pledge to protect Social
Security. ``After all, Jerry and I raised him right.''

seen more as a partner'' whose word about her husband counts for
something, Mrs. MacKay said.
</P>
<P>
   And women other than political wives do seem to figure more
prominently in this year's campaign advertisements, Dr. Jamieson
said: A few moms have cropped up, too.
</P>
<P>
   One is Doris Chabot, who appears in a commercial for her son,
Republican Rep. Steve Chabot of Ohio. ``He understands the
importance of keeping promises,'' Mrs. Chabot says in the
commercial, referring to her son's pledge to protect Social
Security. ``After all, Jerry and I raised him right.''

ECONOMIC VIEW: BANKS ARE LENDING, BUT WILL THEY KEEP IT UP? 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 1) 
(bl) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As everyone surely knows by now, the global financial crisis has
frightened lenders, making them very reluctant to buy Corporate
America's IOUs. Unless a company is among the elite _ an IBM or a
General Electric or an AT&AMP;T _ borrowing money has become an ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Such tightfistedness on the part of lenders can dry up economic
activity. Companies borrow, for example, to buy new machinery and
computers, and then pay off the debt from revenue the new equipment
produces. Or they stockpile raw materials and finished merchandise,
and repay the debt as the goods are sold. Shrink such activity long
enough and a recession could ensue.
</P>
<P>
   So it comes as pleasant news that banks are not pulling back in
their lending to large corporations as other lenders are _ in fact,
they are lending more, partly offsetting the pullback by the
others. These other ``lenders'' are the mutual funds, the pension
funds, the insurance companies, the Wall Street investment houses
and the wealthy individuals who usually buy corporate IOUs, in the
form of long-term bonds and short-term commercial paper issued by
the nation's large companies. Lately, scared by the world financial
turmoil, these investors have been sticking to risk-free Treasury
securities instead.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's banks are not as skittish. According to new Federal
Reserve statistics, bank loans to business, adjusted for seasonal
variations in lending, rose by $11.3 billion in September, compared
with a rise of $7.6 billion in August, the month the credit crisis
started. Then, in October, bank loans to all business rose by $25
billion in the first three weeks, to a total of $940 billion. Much
of this $940 billion is going to smaller companies, which come to
banks for most of their financing. But large companies account for
the recent surge in loans _ companies like Seagram,
Bridgestone/Firestone and Jefferson Smurfit, a paper manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in bank lending has not been enough to offset entirely
the decline in the sale of corporate IOUs. New offerings of
commercial paper have fallen by nearly $20 billion in recent weeks;
on top of that, the sale of high-yield corporate bonds, sometimes
called junk bonds, has almost disappeared. These sales normally
raise $20 billion a month for companies that lack top-of-the-line
credit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the rise in bank lending ``is somewhat alleviating what
would otherwise be a severe credit crunch, and the question is, How
long will it keep doing that?'' said Alan Blinder, a Princeton
University economist.
</P>
<P>
   The great hope is that the global financial crisis will lift
early next year. Or by then, the people who used to invest in
corporate IOUs, which pay higher interest rates than the Treasuries
they are investing in now, will cease to be so nervous and start
buying again. Until the crisis lifts, companies can somehow get by,
everyone hopes, either by postponing projects or by borrowing from
banks _ if not all the money they want, then at least some of it.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a concern that, even in these final weeks of 1998,
the rise in bank lending may be less than meets the eye, and less a
support of the national economy than the Federal Reserve's
statistics might indicate.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than signaling a flow of new loans, much of the lending
appears to be borrowers' drawing on existing lines of credit
established months ago. What's more, while bank loans for general
business activity are rising much faster than in the first half of
the year, real estate lending is weak. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bank real estate loans are rising much more slowly now than in
the first half of the year. Home mortgages are flowing fast enough,
but loans for the purchase or construction of office buildings,
plants and other commercial structures are not.
</P>
<P>
   Banks like to sell to others the real estate loans they
originate, and thus limit the amount of risk they bear in the event
of defaults. That is easy for home mortgages, because federal
agencies are big purchasers of these loans. But commercial real
estate loans must be sold into a market of private investors, and
investors are not buying these commercial bank loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Applications for commercial mortgages are way up, but the
banks are not increasing what they have on the books, not yet,''
said Dennis Yeskey, regional managing director of real estate
services for Deloitte &AMP; Touche.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ceiling is likely to limit the growth of bank lending
for standard business activity, despite the recent surge in such
lending, because banks do not like to carry huge loans on their
books. So they syndicate corporate loans, parceling out portions of
a big loan to other banks. And loan syndication is not rising.
Jefferson Smurfit, for example, sought recently to borrow $4
billion in new bank loans, but had to settle for just $550 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks are not going to take that kind of risk,'' said
James Davis, president of Loan Pricing Corp., which monitors bank
lending. And that is why the banks, for all the current surge in
corporate lending, are not likely to sustain the U.S. economy
through a financial crisis that lasts past January.

<P>
   Consumers have long complained about unexpected bank and
credit-card fees. But far from scaling back their assault on
householders' pockets, banks are apparently dipping their hands in
even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   A new survey of 177 banks and credit unions by Siefer
Consultants in Storm Lake, Iowa, showed that their reliance on fees
and other ``noninterest income'' surged to 24 percent of their
total income last year, from 18 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the survey data show that banks became more likely to
sharply increase routine charges for some services, and to reject
customers' requests that fees be waived.
</P>
<P>
   The median annual rental price for a safe-deposit box, for
example, soared 61 percent, to $26.82 from $16.67 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just that fees are often higher; they can also be
maddeningly confusing. Peter Clough, a longtime customer of the
First National Bank of Maryland, was unpleasantly surprised when he
opened his August statement to find $8.50 in charges for using
automated-teller machines, including $1 just for looking up his
balance.
</P>
<P>
   The bank had recently reclassified his account from ``value
checking'' to ``everyday checking'' and increased the monthly fee
from $8 to $10. At first, he tolerated this because he became
eligible for all sorts of monthly rebates, including $2 if he had
his payroll checks deposited directly and $2 if he never used a
teller.
</P>
<P>
   The brochure announcing the changes, however, never explained
that Clough, 40, a marketing consultant in Baltimore, would be
charged $1.50 each for the three ATM transactions a month that used
to be free. That information appeared only on page 22 of a separate
disclosure statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``They default you into a program where you have to knock down
their fees by using fewer of their overpriced services, and hide
the fact that if you are using another bank's ATM you'll pay a fee
you didn't pay before,'' Clough said.
</P>
<P>
   First National, a unit of First Maryland Bancorp, did not
respond to repeated telephone and e-mail requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a scramble to become less dependent on lending, banks have
created a mind-bending array of fees _ 100 identified by Consumer
Reports in 1996 and many more now, specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can pay extra not only for writing a check that
bounces but also for unwittingly depositing somebody else's check
that bounces; for withdrawing money from their account or for
putting money into it; for replacing a personal identification
number.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ness Judy, consumer affairs manager for the American
Bankers Association, said that the fees reflect the increased
number of products being offered, and added that ``the notion that
disclosures have become less clear is simply not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of fees has attracted repeated congressional
scrutiny. The House recently passed a bill to force banks to offer
bare-bones accounts for those who want them, but the Senate killed
it last month.
</P>
<P>
   Some practices seem to verge on the misleading. Consider Summit
Bank, a unit of Summit Bancorp of New Jersey, whose ATM withdrawal
receipts include an amount called the ``available balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Many customers assume that this figure reflects money on
deposit; it actually lumps that together with whatever credit the
bank has authorized for overdrafts. A customer who then unknowingly
uses some of the overdraft amount has actually taken out a loan,
with interest rates of 12 percent to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Horn, a Summit vice president, said the bank was
``reviewing alternative ways of displaying the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to do something about this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, most fees are disclosed by banks, though often in
small type and unclear language. Banks and credit card companies go
heavy on the term ``changes'' but often &UR;  &LR; avoid the word
``increases,'' for example, in describing new policies on fees; as
a result, consumers might assume they are referring to a mere
technicality.
</P>
<P>
   PNC Bank in Pittsburgh recently began charging Jay and Cindy
Galbraith of Bellefonte, Pa., a $2 monthly service fee on a savings
account, even though they had several other accounts and a mortgage
at PNC.
</P>
<P>
   In January, PNC told savings-account customers with balances
under $1,500 that they would get only three free withdrawals a
year, instead of an unlimited number.
</P>
<P>
   A PNC official defended the policy by saying that the bank was
``trying to put people into the appropriate accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't appease Mrs. Galbraith, a clerical worker at Penn
State University, &UR;  &LR; who has decided to close the smaller savings
account. ``With all the accounts and the business we do with
them,'' she said, ``it's ridiculous.''

NASAL-SPRAY FLU VACCINE IS NOTHING TO SNEEZE AT
</HEADLINE>
 (EDS: Corrects spelling of Belton in second graf)

<P>
   No needle, no tears. For Rhonda Powell, an elementary-school
social worker in Temple, Texas, the decision to have her 8-year-old
son vaccinated against the flu was easy this year.
</P>
<P>
   Powell's son is one of 15,000 children in the Temple-Belton area
eligible to receive a new nasal-spray vaccine that promises to
protect children against the flu and painful middle-ear infections.
The free nasal inoculations are part of a five-year National
Institute of Health study involving doctors at the Influenza
Research Center at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are trying to determine whether widespread
immunization of children 18 months to 18 years old will provide
communitywide protection against influenza. The nasal spray being
used is FluMist, a product developed by the Aviron pharmaceutical
company that may hit the consumer market by next fall, pending Food
and Drug Administration approval.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, like many parents, has a flu shot each year. But she
didn't consider giving her child the annual vaccine until she heard
about the new no-pain alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought of giving my son a flu shot until the nasal
spray became available,'' she said. ``I watched him take it, and it
was quick and easy. He said he would much rather have it than a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayla Herschler, coordinator of the study in Temple, has
observed hundreds of children being immunized (about 1,900 of the
15,000 targeted children have been given the spray), including her
3-year-old granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just sat there and smiled the whole time. My daughter was
laughing because she says when kids get shots, she has to be
prepared to hold them down,'' Herschler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the children blink their eyes and react with a little
surprise when the spray suddenly hits their noses, but they do just
great. It's amazing. I tell people, you need to come and watch us
vaccinate. You won't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The flu vaccine is important for children for several reasons,
according to Pedro Piedra, pediatrician and associate professor of
microbiology and immunology at Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Preschool and school-aged children are at high risk and play
an important role in the transmission of flu to family members and
the community,'' Piedra explained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need universal immunization to reduce the impact in
children, which we tend to underestimate. Children have the highest
infection rate and one of the highest medically attended illness
rates. The hospitalization rate is comparable to that of the
elderly. Children just don't die from flu at as high a rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Pediatricians see a lot of children with flu problems, plus a
lot of ear and sinus infections that are flu complications, Piedra
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a pediatrician, I support universal immunization,'' he
said. ``For universal immunization, you need a very good vaccine
that is accepted by the public. If children and parents are afraid
of it, they are less likely to receive it. It must be safe,
well-tolerated and something children don't dread receiving. Where
the vaccines are equally good, I prefer the one that doesn't have
pain associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Herschler says most children have had no reaction to the spray.
``A few have had a little runny nose and slight fever that develop
the second day after receiving it,'' she said, but that goes away
in four to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three years of the study, the vaccine has been 93
percent effective in preventing the flu and 98 percent effective
against influenza-associated ear infections in children.
</P>
<P>
   It is estimated that there were 30 million doctor visits last
year for acute ear infections, a 300 percent increase in office
visits since the mid-'70s. It is the most common illness for which
parents take their children to see a pediatrician. By age 3, more
than 80 percent of children have had at least one episode of acute
otitis media, and nearly 50 percent have had three or more
episodes.
</P>
<P>
   The nasal-spray flu vaccine surprised researchers last year by
protecting not only against the anticipated flu strains to which it
was targeted, but also against A/Sydney, an unanticipated strain
not found in the vaccine.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, flu shots provided virtually no protection
against A/Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got broader protection than could have been expected,''
Piedra said. ``We need more data, but right now, the studies are
very supportive of the notion that nasal spray may provide a
greater breadth of protection than the injected vaccine.''
</P>
<P>
   The primary difference between the traditional shot and the new
spray, other than method of administration, is that the injected
vaccine is made from killed viruses and nasal spray is derived from
weakened strains of live virus. The spray is easier to produce in
large amounts, and easier to administer. Both types of vaccine are
grown in eggs, but the injectable vaccine needs one egg per dose,
and one egg can produce 1,000 doses of the nasal vaccine.

KOPPERL, TEXAS, FOOTBALL FANS HOPE FOR STADIUM OF THEIR OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
KOPPERL, Texas _ The town of Kopperl dares to dream.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The dream in Kopperl is no secret: ``Get a football field,''
said Denice Humphries, mother of Jessie Humphries, the Fort
Worth-area's most productive Class 3A-A quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Kopperl is a town with a home football team and a football team
without a home.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams are all that superintendent Rock McNulty, football coach
Clint Lowry and school board president Duane Hutson have. If not
original, then at least apt, they've named their dream, ``Field of
Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And it really does exist _ 100 acres of barren ranch land the
school district recently purchased at the corner of Texas 56 and
Farm Road 1251. McNulty draws the location on a piece of paper with
the care of an architect sketching the beginnings of a visionary
masterpiece. He puts his pencil down, raises his eyebrows and
sighs.
</P>
<P>
   That's where one day _ ``we don't know when or how,'' Hutson
says _ a shining football stadium will welcome the Kopperl Eagles
under the lights on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, locked on 55 mph, the big, yellow school bus hauls the
team an average of 100 miles one way every Friday. The trips
journey down two-lane highways as wide open as the land that
Kopperl's dreamers believe one day will spawn a football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the hopes and dreams stage right now,'' Hutson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' chimed McNulty, ``we are praying for a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   It might take a miracle the likes of winning the lottery to
afford the construction of a football stadium. Kopperl, a town of
maybe 150 folks tucked away off Texas 174 on the north end of Lake
Whitney, is wading through the muck of a serious financial crunch
with no real end in sight. Ten football road trips year-in and
year-out don't help ease the purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight students attend Kopperl High School from a sparse
108-square mile radius in Bosque County. Forty-three percent of
Kopperl's residents are economically disadvantaged, living in the
shadow of massive working ranches sitting on hundreds, sometimes
thousands of acres of nearby land. Most of Kopperl's adult
population goes to work beyond the city limits in cities such as
Cleburne or Waco. The tax base is low, and so too are the funds
that the school receives from the state.
</P>
<P>
   But, there's a bigger, more troubling, more expensive problem.
</P>
<P>
   Kopperl is an unincorporated city. Households rely on wells for
water. Bob's Rural Garbage collects the town's trash. There are no
city taxes, no mayor, no fire department and no police department.
But the root of all evil as far as Kopperl's football backers are
concerned is the city has no septic system.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the Kopperl school district to install its own
sanitation system. The project will cost an estimated $250,000,
roughly $1,000 per student in the elementary through high school
grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use more than 5,000 gallons of water a day, you have to
have a septic system,'' McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   Before a population boom _ in relative terms _ hit the area,
Kopperl's current system worked fine. The school has set aside the
funds to pay for the septic system, if only the Texas National
Resource Conservation Commission would get around to approving
Kopperl's year-old application. They're still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the septic problem has left the school's
only practice field off limits. Rains cause sewage to seep through
the ground. So just like on Friday nights, the Eagles load into the
yellow school bus and take to the road. They wind up about a mile
away at a baseball field that includes overgrown grass and an
obstacle course of fire-ant mounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it,'' said wide receiver Corey Pick, the area's
Class 3A-A leading receiver with 33 catches for 901 yards and 12
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry understood the situation when he accepted the head
coaching position, and he took on the challenge for several
reasons: he was raised in small-town Gordon; it was his first head
coaching opportunity; his wife was hired on as the girls
basketball, volleyball and softball coach; and it's where they want
to raise their 21/2-year-old son Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I would leave is if I was run out of town and
they tarred and feathered me,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the heartaches and struggles, Kopperl, a heavy-duty
basketball town, is determined to succeed at football. The gridiron
program rose out of the ashes six years ago after a 50-year
absence. No one seems to know why the Eagles stopped playing
football around World War II. This is the fourth year that the
school has played 11-man, varsity football, where six-man might be
a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   Even the players weren't so sure about this season, since they
had a new coach and had tasted victory only once in the past two
seasons. Nine players showed up for Meet the Coach Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked for one thing. I was disappointed,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, McNulty left for military reserve duty in
Seoul, South Korea, for two weeks. Eager to begin his first
football season as a head coach, Lowry was left with a critical
ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If you don't have 20 kids, there will be no
football,' '' McNulty told his coach. ``When I got back, he had 20
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry mailed letters to every male student in the high school.
Slowly they trickled out to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting in English class and I said, `Let's just play
football,''' Pick said. ``Jessie said, `I'll play if you play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen players, including eight seniors, one-third of the
entire senior class, finally filled out the team roster. One player
is out for the season with an ankle injury. The Eagles are 3-4
overall and 0-2 in tough District 23-A, a record that already gives
them claim to a successful season. Another long road trip awaits
today, this time to district foe Axtell.
</P>
<P>
   The school board supports the program all the way. McNulty says
football is in Kopperl to stay, stadium or no stadium. The plan is
to reach the playoffs in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Kopperl will own its own sanitation system. Maybe
then, the slate will be cleared for a more refreshing project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a football field,'' Lowry said. ``The kids deserve
that. I think it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, dreams can come true.

   KOPPERL, Texas _ The town of Kopperl dares to dream.
</P>
<P>
   The dream in Kopperl is no secret: ``Get a football field,''
said Denice Humphries, mother of Jessie Humphries, the Fort
Worth-area's most productive Class 3A-A quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Kopperl is a town with a home football team and a football team
without a home.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams are all that superintendent Rock McNulty, football coach
Clint Lowry and school board president Duane Hutson have. If not
original, then at least apt, they've named their dream, ``Field of
Dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   And it really does exist _ 100 acres of barren ranch land the
school district recently purchased at the corner of Texas 56 and
Farm Road 1251. McNulty draws the location on a piece of paper with
the care of an architect sketching the beginnings of a visionary
masterpiece. He puts his pencil down, raises his eyebrows and
sighs.
</P>
<P>
   That's where one day _ ``we don't know when or how,'' Hutson
says _ a shining football stadium will welcome the Kopperl Eagles
under the lights on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, locked on 55 mph, the big, yellow school bus hauls the
team an average of 100 miles one way every Friday. The trips
journey down two-lane highways as wide open as the land that
Kopperl's dreamers believe one day will spawn a football stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the hopes and dreams stage right now,'' Hutson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' chimed McNulty, ``we are praying for a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   It might take a miracle the likes of winning the lottery to
afford the construction of a football stadium. Kopperl, a town of
maybe 150 folks tucked away off Texas 174 on the north end of Lake
Whitney, is wading through the muck of a serious financial crunch
with no real end in sight. Ten football road trips year-in and
year-out don't help ease the purse strings.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-eight students attend Kopperl High School from a sparse
108-square mile radius in Bosque County. Forty-three percent of
Kopperl's residents are economically disadvantaged, living in the
shadow of massive working ranches sitting on hundreds, sometimes
thousands of acres of nearby land. Most of Kopperl's adult
population goes to work beyond the city limits in cities such as
Cleburne or Waco. The tax base is low, and so too are the funds
that the school receives from the state.
</P>
<P>
   But, there's a bigger, more troubling, more expensive problem.
</P>
<P>
   Kopperl is an unincorporated city. Households rely on wells for
water. Bob's Rural Garbage collects the town's trash. There are no
city taxes, no mayor, no fire department and no police department.
But the root of all evil as far as Kopperl's football backers are
concerned is the city has no septic system.
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the Kopperl school district to install its own
sanitation system. The project will cost an estimated $250,000,
roughly $1,000 per student in the elementary through high school
grades.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you use more than 5,000 gallons of water a day, you have to
have a septic system,'' McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   Before a population boom _ in relative terms _ hit the area,
Kopperl's current system worked fine. The school has set aside the
funds to pay for the septic system, if only the Texas National
Resource Conservation Commission would get around to approving
Kopperl's year-old application. They're still waiting.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the septic problem has left the school's
only practice field off limits. Rains cause sewage to seep through
the ground. So just like on Friday nights, the Eagles load into the
yellow school bus and take to the road. They wind up about a mile
away at a baseball field that includes overgrown grass and an
obstacle course of fire-ant mounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to it,'' said wide receiver Corey Pick, the area's
Class 3A-A leading receiver with 33 catches for 901 yards and 12
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry understood the situation when he accepted the head
coaching position, and he took on the challenge for several
reasons: he was raised in small-town Gordon; it was his first head
coaching opportunity; his wife was hired on as the girls
basketball, volleyball and softball coach; and it's where they want
to raise their 21/2-year-old son Matthew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way I would leave is if I was run out of town and
they tarred and feathered me,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   For all the heartaches and struggles, Kopperl, a heavy-duty
basketball town, is determined to succeed at football. The gridiron
program rose out of the ashes six years ago after a 50-year
absence. No one seems to know why the Eagles stopped playing
football around World War II. This is the fourth year that the
school has played 11-man, varsity football, where six-man might be
a better fit.
</P>
<P>
   Even the players weren't so sure about this season, since they
had a new coach and had tasted victory only once in the past two
seasons. Nine players showed up for Meet the Coach Night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked for one thing. I was disappointed,'' Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after that, McNulty left for military reserve duty in
Seoul, South Korea, for two weeks. Eager to begin his first
football season as a head coach, Lowry was left with a critical
ultimatum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `If you don't have 20 kids, there will be no
football,' '' McNulty told his coach. ``When I got back, he had 20
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowry mailed letters to every male student in the high school.
Slowly they trickled out to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sitting in English class and I said, `Let's just play
football,''' Pick said. ``Jessie said, `I'll play if you play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen players, including eight seniors, one-third of the
entire senior class, finally filled out the team roster. One player
is out for the season with an ankle injury. The Eagles are 3-4
overall and 0-2 in tough District 23-A, a record that already gives
them claim to a successful season. Another long road trip awaits
today, this time to district foe Axtell.
</P>
<P>
   The school board supports the program all the way. McNulty says
football is in Kopperl to stay, stadium or no stadium. The plan is
to reach the playoffs in three years.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Kopperl will own its own sanitation system. Maybe
then, the slate will be cleared for a more refreshing project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want a football field,'' Lowry said. ``The kids deserve
that. I think it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, dreams can come true.

HAVEN FOR REBELS SHOWS SCARS

<P>
   MALISEVO, Yugoslavia _ The Albanian separatists of the Kosovo
Liberation Army used to strut around this town like they owned it.
In some ways, they did.
</P>
<P>
   But in July, the Serbs took back the town _ and did so with a
vengeance, shelling houses and shops with abandon. And last week,
as they were leaving, the Serbs torched parts of town, even the
local hospital. Malisevo was punished mercilessly for being a haven
for the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Malisevo today looks like a ghost town. Nearly every window pane
in town is broken. A shopping plaza that once marked the town
center is now rubble. About 15,000 people lived here before July,
but only a few have returned, and then only to survey the damage
and shake their heads. The only people who stayed in town for more
than a cursory look around were the police officers tucked behind
sandbags at a heavily-fortified police station that might as well
be called Fort Apache.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the 2 million people living in the Serbian
province of Kosovo are ethnic Albanians who have no allegiance to
Yugoslavia. Here in central Kosovo, where the bulk of the fighting
took place during the nine months that the KLA mounted attacks on
the Serbs and the Yugoslav forces responded with a brutal
offensive, there are mostly two kinds of Albanians: those who are
too afraid to return to their homes, and those who don't have homes
to return to.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday and Tuesday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
ordered an accelerated withdrawal of Serb troops from Kosovo to
avert threatened air strikes by NATO. But while there has been a
steady flow of some 300,000 Albanians displaced by the fighting who
are heading back to their homes, few are staying, either because
they fear the Serb police and soldiers will attack them or because
their homes look like those after a tornado has passed through.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 miles outside of Pristina, the provincial capital, the
devastation begins in Lapushnik, once the KLA's front line. The
Serb checkpoint is gone, lifted on Tuesday as part of Milosevic's
concessions to NATO. But houses with the roofs blown off and huge
shell craters in their sides dot the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look up there,'' said Zekeria Cana, a teacher, pointing to a
hill not far from Lapushnik. In the distance was the outline of
Serbian vehicles, including a wagon that carries a rocket-propelled
grenade launcher. ``How can our people return to their homes when
the Serbs are up there, ready to shell us?''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with dozens of Albanian refugees suggest that most of
them believed the deal reached two weeks ago between US special
envoy Richard Holbrooke and Milosevic called for the complete
withdrawal of all Serb forces from Kosovo. In fact, it called for a
reduction of the forces to levels similar to last February, when
the KLA began attacking police and Milosevic responded with a
brutal crackdown that killed an estimated 700 Albanian civilians,
some of them in horrific circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   That reduction in forces is not good enough for most Albanians,
who either saw the results of Serb atrocities firsthand, or, more
likely, heard accounts that, in a time-honored Balkan tradition,
get worse with each retelling.
</P>
<P>
   At an abandoned gas station, on the road between Pristina and
Malisevo, an ambulance was parked. The policeman behind the wheel
said he could not talk to reporters. In the back of the ambulance,
two Serbian soldiers fingered their rifles nervously. It was
unclear why the soldiers were sitting there, hidden from view.
</P>
<P>
   The gas station had been occupied by Serb forces until they left
this week. On one wall there was a crudely painted picture of a
Serb soldier raping a woman dressed in a KLA uniform. On another
wall, there was graffitti aimed at the rebellious Albanians: ``If
you'll be good, we'll leave.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the point, say Albanians. The Serbs won't leave,
and it seems to be a recipe for disaster, somewhere down the road.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the fighting does not resume, UN officials believe
they can head off a giant humanitarian disaster this winter.
Sitting in his Pristina office, Fernando del Mundo, a spokesman for
the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, said there were few people
still living in the hills of central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said his agency's main concern was to get emergency kits with
plastic sheeting and hammers to families so they can have at least
one warm room. He said the unsanitary conditions in makeshift
refugee camps had led to cases of dysentery and other health
problems, but that there was no sign of major disease which would
have developed had the crisis continued much longer. Nor did hunger
appear to be a major problem yet, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mundo said that nearly 300,000 people were forced out of their
homes because of the fighting this year. Of that figure, 200,000
were displaced somewhere in Kosovo, while about 42,000 fled to
Montenegro, 20,000 each to Albania and Bosnia, and 10,000 to
Serbia. Except for those who fled to Serbia, nearly all of those
displaced are Albanian, he said. Mundo said most of the 200,000 in
Kosovo were living with relatives or friends, but said an
undetermined number remain in the hills and woods, afraid to come
out.
</P>
<P>
   In the village of Carraluka, Avni Kastrati, 26, a farmer,
assessed the damage done to the home of his friend, Rrusten Hoti.
Hoti and his extended family of 24 have been living with Kastrati
and his extended family of 10 for nearly three months. It is
crowded and uncomfortable, Kastrati explained, and he hoped to
repair his friend's house enough in the next month so that the Hoti
family can move back.
</P>
<P>
   The field that leads down to Hoti's home has two clearly
delineated foot paths, the grass patted down. Normally, people
would walk across the field any which way they chose, but they have
been warned about mines left behind by the Serbs. A man was killed
by one on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As a knot of young men stood around discussing Hoti's
predicament, a boy looked toward the field and nodded, saying,
``Oochicka.'' _ the phonetic sound for the acronym UCK, which in
Albanian stands for KLA.
</P>
<P>
   A man dressed in battle fatigues, a Kalishnakov rifle slung from
his shoulder, was approaching. The guerrilla introduced himself as
Soldier Struga, and declined to be more specific. He came down
because he noticed the Belgrade license plates on the car and
wanted to make sure the locals were all right. He stood in the
open, unfazed by the Serbian police cars that had been routinely
passing on the road above.
</P>
<P>
   Over what seemed to be a brand new Motorola two-way radio
attached to his uniform, Albanian voices crackled about patrols.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are worried about the mines,'' Soldier Struga said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the KLA can do for all the displaced people, Soldier
Struga shrugged his shoulders and said, ``We can only morally
support them.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the KLA will honor its cease-fire, but when asked if it
bothers him to see Serbs still moving freely through what was a KLA
stronghold, he replied, ``There will come a day when they won't
move so freely.''
</P>
<P>
   As a group of villagers clustered around the mysterious
guerrilla, it became obvious that to them he is not a terrorist, as
the government claims, but the only one around with a gun who is on
their side.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Malisevo, 14-year-old Muhamet Mazreku cut a lonely
figure as he wandered around the town, looking for his three lost
cows. He hasn't seen them since he and his family fled the town
``with just the clothes on our backs'' in July. Muhamet, whose
family has been living with friends outside town, looked in on
their house, but found it was ransacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's been stolen,'' he said glumly.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a man appeared from an alleyway and yelled at Muhamet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come!'' the man shouted. ``We have to run away!''
</P>
<P>
   Without a word, the boy turned and ran, as fast as he could. He
never looked back.

CHANGING THE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Watching the shuttle go up last week, I tried to put my finger
on what it was that had changed since the 1960s, or even the 1980s,
when Challenger blew up. It wasn't just the woman's voice narrating
the flight, or the simple instrument panel graphic on the TV
screen, or that the president and his wife were present at the
launch _ the first president willing to risk the possiblity he
might preside over an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The really striking difference had to do with the presence on
board of John Glenn. I don't mean just Glenn the senior citizen,
but Senator Glenn the public figure, a veteran of the S&AMP;L crisis
and the Whitewater controversy as well as early spaceflight. What
was this guy doing strapped into Discovery?
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, I have been reading Thomas Hughes' new book,
``Rescuing Prometheus,'' published in August. Its subtitle
elaborates: ``The story of the mammoth projects _ SAGE, ICBM,
ARPANET/Internet and Boston's Central Artery/Tunnel _ that created
new styles of management, new forms of organization and a new
vision of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   I was astonished at the extent to which John Glenn's flight
illustrated Hughes' central thesis about how the technological
world has changed in the last 30 years: that a key characteristic
of the new approach to technological systems-building is public
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hughes, 75, trained as an engineer himself, is today the
nation's single most distinguished historian of technology. That
puts him on a par with Daniel Boorstin, Alfred Chandler, William
McNeill, David Landes, David Hackett Fischer, Nathan Rosenberg,
William Cronon, and a handful of other contemporary historians who
have contributed durable visions of America to our stock of
self-images. Professor emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania,
Hughes now shuttles back and forth between Philadelphia and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   He began his career as an author with a scholarly biography of
Elmer Sperry, &UR;  &LR; who is remembered best for his gyroscopic
controls, &UR;  &LR; as one of Thomas Edison's few rivals as an
inventor-entrepreneur. Hughes then moved on to write ``Networks of
Power,'' a comparative study of the electrification of Chicago,
Berlin, and London at the end of the 19th century. Analysis aside,
it is among the most beautiful books I have read in the past 25
years. And it makes abundantly clear the powerful role of culture
in shaping technology to local tastes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989 Hughes published ``American Genesis: A History of the
American Genius for Invention.'' Here for the first time emerged
full-blown Hughes' interest in inventor-entrepreneurs as
``system-builders:'' that is, architects of whole industries for
the production of goods and services and, of course, of the values
of order and control necessary to make them work. The race between
Edison and Nikola Teslawas recounted, as were the programs of
Samuel Insull, Henry Ford, the Bauhaus movement, and the adventures
and misadventures that most ambitious industrial visionary of all,
Nikolai Lenin.
</P>
<P>
   Included also were the stories less familiar entrepreneurial
heroes, of Bell Laboratories and the General Electric Research Lab
and the Edison-headed Naval Consulting Board _ the first,
unmistakable foreshadowing of what in due course Dwight Eisenhower
would dub ``the military-industrial complex.'' Hughes followed the
history of government's economic role through the Manhattan project
to develop the atom bomb and the Tennessee Valley Authority project
to bring electricity to the rural South.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with equal tenderness and affection, Hughes described the
backlash elicited by all this technological enthusiasm: the rise of
a counterculture deeply skeptical of all that had been wrought.
Citing the work of Lewis Mumford, Jacques Ellul, and Amory Lovins,
as well as the Challenger disaster and the nuclear accidents at
Three Mile Island and Chernobyl, the historian gave a full hearing
to the critics _ too full, for some readers' tastes. But he noted,
``In the modern world, systems do sometimes fade away, but even
larger and more complex one often displace them.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, in ``Rescuing Prometheus,'' Hughes has taken up where he
left off, describing the complicated new systems that have enfolded
the old. The result is a triumph, a history of how the Cold War
changed America that is different _ and deeper _ than any other. By
zeroing in on managerial institutions rather than science and
engineering itself, Hughes makes it clear how much has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the River Rouge automotive plant and the Hoover Dam were
the icons of the age that perhaps will forever be known as Modern,
so SAGE and ICBM, ARPANET, and the new system of underground
roadways for central Boston are the characteristic programs of our
own time.
</P>
<P>
   Who now remembers MIT's SAGE (Semiautomatic Ground Environment)
project? This radar-based plan to deploy Nike missiles against
long-range Soviet bombers was obsolete by the time it was deployed
in 1958. Yet Hughes compares it to the building of the Erie Canal
as a learning experience. Its planners put high-speed digital
computing at the center of military applications _ and lured an
old-line firm named International Business Machines into the
business to make them.
</P>
<P>
   ICBM? &UR;  &LR; It started out in 1946 as a $1.4 million Air Force
contract with Consolidated Vultee Aircraft Corp. (Convair) to
design a missile that would fall within a mile of its target 5,000
miles away. Before long it was the full-fledged intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM) project, its technical possibilities fast
expanding, whose descendent the astronauts rode into space last
week. The chapter on Gen. Bernard ``Benny'' Schreiver and Simon
Ramo and the ``Western Development Division'' of the Air Force is
great reading.
</P>
<P>
   And you simply won't find a more engaging account of how the
Internet came to be than the chapter that chronicles the career of
J.C.R. Licklider, head of the Information Processing Techniques
Office of the Defense Department's Advance Research Projects Agency
from 1962 to 1964 _ the years when the key contracts for its
ARPANET computer network were let.
</P>
<P>
   Many other brilliant citizens set their hands to creating this
astonishing system, but no contribution was more fundamental than
the vision of a dense network of interactive time-sharing computers
that was developed by Licklider during his years as head of the
psychoacoustics lab at Bolt Beranek and Newman of Cambridge, Mass.,
in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Only when you come to Hughes' chapter on Boston's ``Big Dig'' _
its project to burrow the city's central highway artery in a tunnel
well below the town _ is the full novelty of his analysis born in
upon you. He describes the sprawling complexity of the project,
involving federal, state, and local agencies, not to mention every
sort of interest group imaginable, and describes the tolerant
democratic style that former state Transportation Secretary
Frederick Salvucci evolved to cope with it _ in certain ways the
opposite of Benny Schreiver's approach to missile-building.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes says that Big Dig and the Internet are history's first
``post-modern'' engineering projects _ and that their
post-modernity can be ascribed ``in no small part'' to the
counterculture values that spread in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans blamed the tragedy of the Vietnam War on their
government's amoral use of large-scale military technology. The
distrust of government and technology focused not only on military
technology but on large-scale technology in general. Hierarchy,
bureaucracy and governance by experts fell into disfavor,'' he
writes. Public participation in the design of new technologies has
become the accepted rule.
</P>
<P>
   It is a considerable insight. The very same reactions that
motivated the 1970's tax revolt may be embedded in slightly
different form in the Internet, the most important technology of
our time, &UR;  &LR; one controlled by no government agency or corporation.
The same impulse that led to the Prague Spring of 1968 _ a
particularily forceful protest against Soviet hegemony _ may be
discerned in the reaction to various attempts to impose big
unsightly bridges on the Boston landscape in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what John Glenn is doing up there in orbit even
though his role in its ``medical mission'' has been scrubbed. He no
longer needs an excuse.

AWAITING WORD FROM MOUNT MO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The message has not come down from Mount Mo. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are waiting to see what it is going to take,'' said Red Sox
CEO John Harrington after meeting with his top executives in
Florida to chart the course for next season. ``Our No. 1 priority
is still signing Mo Vaughn. We will know, one way or another, if we
can get a new contract done by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people (Elaine Weddington Steward and Dan Duquette) have
been in touch with Mo's agents. They will be in Orlando over the
weekend talking, but I don't think anything will happen until next
Thursday or so. Up to that point, teams are not allowed to give a
specific offer to a free agent from another team. So I think Mo's
people will wait until that time to see what offers they have from
other teams and every detail of those offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, we think we will find out for the first time
exactly what it will take for us to re-sign Mo. We don't know now
how much money he'll be looking for. We don't know how many years
he wants to sign for. We'd like to sign him for three. But we
offered him four years last summer at the All-Star break, and if he
wants four, we'll go four.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington says the Red Sox will move quickly one way or another
when Vaughn's agents tell them what it will take to sign the free
agent slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't meet what they want,'' said Harrington, ``then we
will move on and get someone else signed with the money we have
slotted for Mo. If there is no one player, then we will use it to
get two very good players. Our top priority (after Vaughn) is still
a front-line pitcher. We asked Jimy (Williams), and his wish is for
more pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was asked if he thought the record-breaking
seven-year, $91 million contract the New York Mets gave catcher
Mike Piazza would affect the Vaughn negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Piazza is the standard for this year,'' he said. ``I
don't think anyone is going to get that kind of money. I look
around baseball and I don't see it coming from any other team. The
Mets are in a unique situation. They are fighting the battle for
the back pages in New York (tabloids) with the Yankees and they've
been losing. They have to try to keep themselves in the news to
generate positive publicity. That's why they went out right away
and got Piazza this deal and signed (pitcher Al) Leiter. And I'm
sure they will spend more money before they are finished. But they
are the only team that I can see that is in that kind of
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   How about the reports of Boston interest in White Sox free agent
Albert Belle?
</P>
<P>
   ``This I find interesting,'' said Harrington. ``I keep reading
all summer about how players don't want to play for the Red Sox,
about how they don't want to play in Boston. What a bunch of
blather. We have been contacted by the agents of just about every
player out there. And you know what they tell us? `Our player loves
the Red Sox. Playing in Boston is his No. 1 priority.' Belle? We
read he wanted to play in Boston. We checked it out. He does. When
the time comes, Mike Port will be talking to his agent to see what
it will take. Will we give him $14 million a year (which reportedly
is what Belle is looking for)? The answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington says that without signing a single new player for
1999, the Sox already have one of the top five payrolls in baseball
and will be subject to a luxury tax. ``One (salary) survey already
has us second,'' he said, ``so it isn't like we are not spending
money. We have spent money and we will spend more.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Flutie's big day &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow is the day Doug Flutie starts to cash in. In order to
get another shot in the NFL, Flutie signed with the Bills for the
minimum _ $250,000 _ which is chump change for a veteran of 13 pro
seasons. Luckily for him, his Boston-based contract agent, Jack
Mula, had 34 bonus provisions written into the contract. The first
bonus kicks in tomorrow when Flutie faces the Miami Dolphins in
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   His contract reads that if he's in for 25 percent of the
offensive plays during the season, he gets an additional $100,000.
That will happen vs. Miami. For every 10 percent after that, he
collects another $100,000. If he's in for 70 percent of the plays
and Buffalo wins 10 games, Flutie's bonuses would reach $1 million
_ and they'll climb beyond that if the Bills make the playoffs and
keep advancing. Even better, these bonuses will be added to
Flutie's base salary next year.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie apparently will be Buffalo's starting quarterback for the
next few weeks. Rob Johnson, sidelined by a rib injury, started to
throw this week, but it doesn't appear he'll be able to play soon.
And if Flutie keeps winning, he'll keep starting.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots visit Buffalo in 15 days, and incredibly, there are
still 25,000 tickets left for that game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our game with Miami was sold out before Doug started to
play,'' said Bills ticket manager Jerry Foran. ``If he keeps on
playing and winning, then I think he will sell a lot of tickets for
the Patriots game. If anyone down there wants to come up here, they
can call us (1-877-228-4257) and we will take care of them.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the Flutie phenomenon in Buffalo would have happened
without Mula. When Flutie was given a 30-day window of opportunity
in January to leave the Canadian Football League for the NFL, Mula
contacted every team. At first, none responded. Then he got a
glimmer of hope from Bills scout A.J. Smith, who had watched the
CFL and liked Flutie. However, GM John Butler said Mula would have
to convince new coach Wade Phillips first.
</P>
<P>
   So with money out of his own pocket, Mula got on a plane to San
Francisco, where Phillips was watching the East-West Shrine Game
practice sessions. He walked up to Phillips and introduced himself.
Phillips said he was willing to give Flutie a shot, and that opened
the door.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
More work on NBA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People close to the NBA labor negotiations think it will take
another three weeks to get resolved and three weeks after that
before the games begin. Despite what has been said publicly, the
league will do everything it can to reschedule as many missed games
as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked with other arena managers,'' said FleetCenter boss
Rich Kreswick, ``and all of us feel that these games will be made
up. They are not going to walk away from all of that money. None of
us have a policy on what we are going to do to repay the luxury
box- (and seat-) holders. We have to see how it all ends up.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are now trying to bad-mouth NBC-TV for paying the
owners while the lockout is ongoing. What they don't seem to know
is that the networks paid out money to the NFL when its players
were on strike. There was no way NBC would have gotten the NBA
contract unless it agreed to the pay schedule the league wanted.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
L.A. may get football nod &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's the scoop out of the latest NFL meetings. The majority of
owners are leaning toward Los Angeles to get the 32d team even
though Houston seems better prepared. The league will choose the
next city in February or March. When that happens, the NFL will
realign into eight divisions with four teams each.
</P>
<P>
   It was recommended that the teams within each division, as
presently constructed, talk with each other to see who would not
mind shifting. The Cleveland Browns will be in the AFC Central next
year. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue will make a ruling within three
weeks as to when the new Browns and other teams can start
approaching coaching candidates who are under contract to other NFL
teams. It is expected that coaches with teams who don't make the
playoffs can move right away and that Tagliabue will allow Super
Bowl coaches to talk with other teams in the off week before the
game.

(For release Sunday, Nov. 1)

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street is ever searching for corporate
executives upon whom it can pin hopes of miraculous jumps in stock
prices. Back in 1996, for example, before Al Dunlap was unmasked as
a mere pretender to the title of corporate turnaround king,
investors bid up shares of the Sunbeam Corp. on news that Dunlap
was riding to its rescue.
</P>
<P>
   A similar thing happened to the CBS Corp.'s stock last week. Mel
Karmazin, president of the company, was named chief executive on
Wednesday. This news, along with a better-than-expected earnings
announcement, popped its shares to $28, up 10 percent in a day.
</P>
<P>
   Karmazin will succeed Michael H. Jordan, the man who bought CBS
in 1995 on his way to transforming Westinghouse from a gritty
industrial maker of stoves, freezers and nuclear generators into a
sexy media enterprise. One of the properties he bought to help him
achieve the makeover was Infinity Broadcasting, the largest
operator of radio stations in the country _ run by Mel Karmazin.
</P>
<P>
   Investors certainly like what they see in Karmazin. A
hard-driving entrepreneur, he is known for setting tough sales
goals, then getting rid of those who don't meet them. He recently
announced layoffs of 300 people in CBS' news division. And as the
company's largest shareholder, Karmazin has priorities that are
aligned with those of his investors.
</P>
<P>
   He has another skill: spinning the Street. ``Mel is well known
on Wall Street as a broadcaster who keeps his eye on the value of
the company's stock, as well as lean operations and building
revenue,'' said Gil Schwartz, senior vice president of
communications at CBS. ``We're dedicated to 10 percent sales growth
a year, regardless of market conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's faith in Karmazin derives from his track record at
Infinity. Between 1992, when he took the company public, and 1996,
when he sold to CBS, Infinity shares rose 58 percent a year, on
average.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders under Jordan, first at Westinghouse and then at
CBS, didn't fare as well. Graef Crystal, the executive compensation
expert, says that between June 1993, when Jordan began running
Westinghouse, and September 1998, the stock was outperformed by 60
percent of the companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500.
</P>
<P>
   Even though investors are sold on Karmazin, it is not at all
clear that he can do at CBS what he did at Infinity. There, he was
good at taking high-performing operations and squeezing a bit more
juice out of them.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he was operating in prosperous economic times.
Turning around lagging operations is another matter, especially in
a slow-growth environment.
</P>
<P>
   One way Karmazin plans to increase CBS' revenues is by selling
advertising packages across its various media outlets. Of that
strategy, Jim Citrin, managing director of the communications and
media practice at Spencer Stuart &AMP; Associates, said, ``Unless it's
driven by great content exploited across multiple platforms, it's
unproven.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's ardor is a fickle thing, of course. And skeptics
note that some of the recent brokerage-firm bullishness on CBS may
be related to the company's planned initial public offering of a 20
percent stake in its radio operations. Winning the underwriting
would give a welcome lift to firms that have seen fees from
securities issuance disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason everybody's struggling in the business,'' a
senior broadcasting executive said. ``The idea that some messiah is
going to come in with a golden touch is Wall Street trying to
create something to hang onto.'' &QL;

GET READY FOR NBC'S `TEMPTATIONS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JAMES SULLIVAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Temptations were not too proud to beg. They also argued
viciously, broke up time and again and recorded a half-dozen songs
that every living American knows by heart.
</P>
<P>
   These are good qualities for a miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Temptations,'' an NBC made-for-TV biopic, begins Sunday
night and concludes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see how the network could attract such talent for
this sweeps production. Heck, the director, Allan Arkush, is the
guy responsible for the original dancing-baby episode on ``Ally
McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did the long-running vocal group endure all kinds of
internal strife, but most of the members' lives ended in tragedy _
suicide, overdose, cancer. Add to that the fact that the
Temptations have spanned several decades of pop music, inspiring
the costume department to re-create fashions from Tony Curtis
pompadours to Chevy Impala chic, and the result is some eminently
watchable TV.
</P>
<P>
   With a string of gold records, the Temptations became Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame inductees by bridging the doo-wop era (``My
Girl'') with disco (former lead singer Eddie Kendricks' ``Keep on
Truckin'''). In between, they defined the Motown sound with
activist anthems (``Get Ready'') and hard-soul laments (``Papa Was
a Rollin' Stone,'' for which there's a wonderful video-style
montage in the movie).
</P>
<P>
   The miniseries is based on the recollections of Otis Williams,
the group's sole surviving original member. Cast members are young,
limber and expressive. Their lip-synching in the musical sequences
is a marvel, and they do their level best with the one-dimensional
caricatures they're given to portray.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ever been a part of something that's bigger than
yourself?'' Temptation Melvin Franklin asks his doctor, who is
trying to persuade the performer to retire. ``It's a beautiful
thing, doc.''
</P>
<P>
   Played by D.B. Woodside, whose acting experience encompasses
both a drag queen and Malcolm X, the deep-baritone Franklin is the
loyal Temptation. He gets shot in a struggle with a car thief, ends
up in a wheelchair and dies at home in his mama's house.
</P>
<P>
   Williams (Charles Malik Whitfield) comes across as the stoic
Temptation. ``You ain't just a success in show business,'' his
dying mother tells him as they sit on a porch together, tears
flowing. ``You're a success as a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Other characters fit their slots just as neatly. Kendricks
(Terron Brooks) is the satiny, easygoing crooner. David Ruffin,
played by screen veteran Leon (``Waiting to Exhale''), is the
explosive prima donna with a drug problem; Paul Williams (Christian
Payton of ``Hoodlum'') is the alcoholic who gets kicked out of the
group.
</P>
<P>
   The movie doesn't offer a lot of insight into the Temptations'
rise and fall. The group's relationship with longtime manager
Shelly Berger is barely explored, and the fascinating inner
workings of Motown are reduced to a few fraternal scenes outside
the ``Hitsville'' studio. A cameo by Smokey Robinson, singing at a
funeral, feels glued on.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's all swell entertainment. In one early exchange on
the Hitsville lawn, the fledgling group is looking for a name
change. As they toss around a football, members holler suggestions.
``The Radicals!'' ``The Spectacles!''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Testicles!'' blurts Franklin, before he can catch himself.
</P>
<P>
   A hearse drives by. ``The Stiffs!'' someone tries.
</P>
<P>
   Happily enough for those looking to knock off a little time in
front of the tube, there's plenty of life in this made-for-TV
movie.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until they declared ``Netwar'' against the Mexican government,
Ricardo Dominguez and Stefan Wray earned their activist credentials
the old-fashioned way, attending rallies in support of the
Zapatista rebels, handing out pamphlets, shouting political
slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the two New Yorkers organize ``virtual sit-ins'' and
recruit computer programmers to attack the World Wide Web sites of
any person or company they deem responsible for oppression. Their
new rallying cry: ``The revolution will be digitized.''
</P>
<P>
   Wray, 37, and Dominguez, 39, are co-founders of the Electronic
Disturbance Theater. It is one of several groups around the world
that are beginning to experiment with computer hacking, so far
largely nuisance attacks and the equivalent of electronic graffiti,
as a means to a political end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this as a form of electronic civil disobedience,'' Wray
told a group of about 75 people who had gathered in New York's East
Village for an ``anti-Columbus Day'' event in October. ``We are
transferring the social-movement tactics of trespass and blockade
to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion is a departure for both radical activists and
hackers, whose distinct, subversive subcultures have rarely
intersected until recently. In some ways, the two psychologies are
polar opposites.
</P>
<P>
   Hackers, while reliably anti-authoritarian, tend to limit their
critique of the military-industrial complex to its imperfect
computer security apparatus. Enamored of their image as the cowboys
of the electronic frontier, most at least pay lip service to the
hacker mantra, ``information wants to be free.''
</P>
<P>
   But whatever capacity they might have to disrupt the social
order has so far been largely restricted to pointless vandalism and
pinching the occasional credit card number.
</P>
<P>
   Political activists, on the other hand, preoccupied as they are
with the power structure, have typically paid little heed to the
information infrastructure on which it rests. Motivated by the
desire for social change, they generally see building communities
of support and cooperation as essential.
</P>
<P>
   But the rapid growth of the Internet has transformed what was
once a hacker playground into, among other things, a far-reaching
political platform. What's more, the tricks invented by hackers
have become easier for activists to learn and adopt because they
are now widely published on how-to Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, radical groups are discovering what hackers have
always known: Traditional social institutions are more vulnerable
in cyberspace than they are in the physical world. Likewise, some
members of the famously sophomoric hacker underground are finding
motivation in causes other than ego gratification.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, groups as diverse as the Animal Liberation
Front, a militant animal-rights group; Radio4All, which supports
pirate broadcasting, and international teams of teen-agers with
cyber pseudonyms like Milworm and causes like anti-imperialism have
increasingly begun pumping political protest through the Internet's
security holes.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct., 27, a day after China's human rights agency announced
its new Web site, the official view of that nation's human rights
record was replaced with an electronic trespasser's manifesto:
``China's people have no rights at all, never mind human rights.
How can the United States trade millions and millions of dollars
with them and give them most-favored trade status when they know
what is happening?''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in October, computer intruders scrawled ``Save Kashmir''
over the opening screen of a Web site that the Indian government
set up last summer to provide information about the region, whose
ownership is disputed by Pakistan and several separatist groups.
The hacked site included photographs of Kashmiris allegedly killed
by Indian forces, overlaid with the words ``massacre'' and
``extra-judicial execution.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, after the Indian government conducted nuclear tests,
college students in Britain and the Netherlands claimed credit for
placing the image of a mushroom cloud on the Web site of India's
major nuclear weapons research center.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Portuguese hackers modified the sites of 40
Indonesian servers to display the slogan ``Free East Timor'' in
large black letters, and they added hypertext links to Web sites
describing Indonesian human rights abuses in the former Portuguese
colony.
</P>
<P>
   No slouches in packaging and self-promotion, the burgeoning
computer underground has adopted a catchy term for the trend: they
call it ``hacktivism.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hacktivism is a way to be heard by millions,'' a group of
three Mexican hackers known as X-Ploit wrote in an e-mail message
to a reporter. ``We want to speak out about what we and many, many
people disagree with in this treasonous and corrupt government. If
we protest both on line and off line, we'll have better chances to
see a change.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactic is not limited to one end of the political spectrum.
A group of Serbian computer hackers this month claimed
responsibility for crashing a Web site promoting the ethnic
Albanian cause in the Serbian province of Kosovo. The Serbian
newspaper Blic quoted one of the hackers as saying, ``We shall
continue to remove ethnic Albanian lies from the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the group, called Black Hand, after a clandestine
Serbian military organization at the turn of the century, attacked
the site of the Croatian state-owned newspaper Vjesnik. Croatian
hackers counterattacked the next day, inserting messages like
``Read Vjesnick and not Serbian books'' on the Web site of the
Serbian National Library, Vjesnik reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrilla attacks on Web sites may seem more of a
headline-grabbing ploy than true information warfare. But security
experts said the recent spate of digital vandalism underscores the
risk to companies and governments that increasingly rely on the
Internet for commerce and communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``What this demonstrates is the capacity of groups with
political causes to hack into systems,'' said Michael Vatis, chief
of the National Information Protection Center, a new federal agency
formed to protect the nation's crucial infrastructure. ``I wouldn't
characterize vandalizing Web sites as cyber-terrorism, but the only
responsible assumption we can make is there's more going on that we
don't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Established by Attorney General Janet Reno this year, the center
is in part a response to the perception that ``political forces
which could not take on the United States in conventional military
terms stand a better chance on an electronic battlefield,'' said
Vatis.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The potency of the sling-shot approach is not lost on would-be
hacktivists, either. ``If you have 10 people at a protest, they
don't do much of anything,'' said a Toronto-based computer jockey
who calls himself Oxblood Ruffian. ``If you have 10 people on line,
they could cripple a network.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxblood is a member of Cult of the Dead Cow, a hacker group that
recently reserved the Web address www.hacktivism.org as an Internet
distribution hub for tools to assist others in subversive digital
activism. He said the group was planning to attack the Internet
operations of U.S. companies doing business with China.
</P>
<P>
   But the effectiveness of such actions is unclear, prompting a
debate over how best to implement the hacktivist brand of political
protest.
</P>
<P>
   Under U.S. law, terrorism is defined as an act of violence for
the purpose of intimidating or coercing a government or a civilian
population. And breaking into a computer system and altering data
are felonies.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, the members of the Electronic Disturbance
Theater emphasize that the software they use to attack Web sites
disrupts Internet traffic but does not destroy data. In the
tradition of civil disobedience protests, they encourage mass
participation and use their real names.
</P>
<P>
   The group was forged in an online discussion among several
American supporters of the Zapatistas, the first armed
revolutionaries known to have solicited public sympathy for their
struggle by publishing their communiques over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 22, the group says, it plans to attack the Web site of
the School for the Americas, a U.S. Army training center for
foreign military personnel, some of whom have been accused of human
rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Recent targets have included the sites of Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo and of the U.S. Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   When online activists heed the call to ``commence flooding!''
they visit the group's Web site and click on an icon that launches
a program called FloodNet. The software points their Web browser to
the target of the attack, where it requests the same page over and
over again at a rate of about 10 times per minute.
</P>
<P>
   This tactic is a variation of what is known in Internet
security-speak as a ``denial of service attack.'' An unusually
large volume of requests will overwhelm the computer that is
serving up the target's Web pages. This can cause legitimate
visitors to see error messages instead of the pages they are
seeking, and it can even crash the server computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't cyber-terrorism,'' insisted Carmin Karasic, a
Quincy, Mass., software engineer who designed the FloodNet program.
``It's more like conceptual art.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Defense Department does not agree. Alerted to a planned
FloodNet attack on its public site on Mexican Independence Day, the
agency responded by diverting the requests to a nonexistent
Internet address, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't illegal it was certainly immoral _ there are
other constructive methods of electronic protest,'' the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of such attacks are not the only ones to criticize
the digital desperados. In their quest for support from a public
already suspicious of hackers and anxious about online safety, some
political activists deride such methods as counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   And hackers faithful to the ethic of electronic exploration for
its own sake deride Web site intrusions as the work of ``script
kiddies,'' an epithet for people who break into systems by using
schemes developed by others rather than by searching out new
security holes of their own. Script kiddies have been responsible
for a recent surge in attacks throughout the Internet _ of which
politically motivated hacks are a small fraction.
</P>
<P>
   But in e-mail and telephone interviews, several hackers
promoting a political agenda _ all of whom refused to give their
real names _ insisted that their motives were pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have hundreds of servers we could hack, and we don't,''
said Secretos, a Portuguese hacker in his early 20's whose group,
the Kaotik Team, has taken up the cause of East Timor independence.
``By contrary, we even help them to fix their bugs. The main
objective of our hacking pages is to transmit the message. It is
not, `We are groovy, we have power.'''
</P>
<P>
   John Vranesevitch, editor of Antionline, an Internet publication
that tracks hacker activities, said the apparent political
awakening among hackers reflects a generation's coming of age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see right now the first generation of people
who have grown up on the Internet,'' said Vranesevitch, who at 19
counts himself among that group. ``These hackers are entering the
ages where people are most politically active. This is their
outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   And some are trying to make that outlet more accessible. A
26-year-old University of Toronto dropout calling himself Perl
Bailey, after a computer language popular among Web developers,
said he had earned a living as a software developer and had dabbled
in not entirely legal computer exploration for several years. Now,
he is writing a tool to arm computer novices with basic hacktivist
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you reach a certain point, it feels like you are dressed
up with nowhere to go,'' he said. ``I want to make people doing
questionable business dealings with countries that have no respect
for human rights worry that someone who doesn't have a grade school
education can sit down and go click-click and create havoc. To me
that to me is very powerful.''

   GOTEBORG, Sweden _ They were teen-agers whose parents had
brought them here from homes torn by war or terror _ from Bosnia,
Eritrea, Somalia and others _ and in their new country they formed
new bonds, through school and music and parties.
</P>
<P>
   About 65 of the young people died and more than 190 were
seriously injured late Thursday night when fire and smoke engulfed
an overcrowded makeshift discotheque that had only one unlocked
door.
</P>
<P>
   The fire was the deadliest this country has seen in decades, and
it was all the more painful because it highlighted the profound
divide between native Swedes and the rainbow of immigrants who have
found refuge here over the decades.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all of the victims were teenagers between the ages of 13
and 17, who had packed into a Halloween hip-hop party at a hall
owned by a Macedonian civic organization. Most of the victims died
from smoke inhalation as they trampled each other in a panicked
attempt to escape, but others were scorched by the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters and police said they still had not determined the
fire's cause. Though its explosive speed initially led
investigators to suspect arson, later Friday they said evidence
pointed to electrical short-circuits in the lighting or sound
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dancing and then suddenly people were screaming and
running and pushing,'' said Sara Afeworki, 15, who came here from
Eritrea six years ago. ``There were two exits, but the one in the
back was covered up. The only way out was a small door at the
front, and there were 400 people.''
</P>
<P>
   At candlelight memorials outside the discotheque, and at local
hospitals, Kurds found themselves clinging in grief to classmates
from Romania, Uganda and many other places that refugees have fled
in the last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors described watching their friends jump from the windows
on the building's second floor. Others, who managed to get out the
door, recalled a horrifying chaos within the building as they found
themselves choking and clawing their way toward fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It the most frightening thing I have ever been through,'' said
Arya Shafai, a 15-year-old Iranian, as he recuperated in a bed at
the nearby Salgrenska Hospital. Arya said he would probably not
have escaped, except that three larger teen-agers managed to pull
him out from a mass of collapsed bodies around him. The boy who
came to the party with him, Gilsad, never got out. ``He was just so
small, you know,'' said Arya, his voice trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors and police officials said the hall had been rented out
by a group of Kurdish students, who organized a hip-hop party and
charged an entrance fee of about $5. The hall was not supposed to
hold more than 150 people; about 400 were inside when the fire
broke out shortly before midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dancers, including Arya, said they saw a lamp
exploding just before the panic began. Others said they had seen a
speaker fall over and appear to be malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   Disk jockeys quickly began urging people to leave the building,
but survivors said the hall was so crowded that the teenagers had
little idea at first about what was happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said something about tear gas,'' said Andrea
Guajardo, a 15-year-old Chilean girl who had come with her Iranian
classmate, Yusra Morabet. ``We got out of the building and thought
things were actually okay. Then we looked up and saw people banging
on the windows of the second floor and then trying to jump out.''
</P>
<P>
   When police and rescue workers showed up a few minutes after
midnight, they found many young people relentlessly holding onto
companions who had collapsed or even died in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people were holding onto dead and dying friends,'' said
Sten Schaaf, a police officer who coordinated part of the rescue
operation, which lasted until about 5 a.m. Friday. ``In such
situations, you just can't tear them apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Swedish Prime Minister Goren Persson toured the charred remains
of the discotheque this afternoon and came out visibly shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all burned out, with only a skeleton left,'' he told
Swedish reporters. ``On the floor were shoes and boots _ boots just
like our children have. It was only then that you could really
understand what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Birgitta Bahl, speaker of Sweden's Parliament, noted with
particular sadness that the tragedy had befallen people who had
come to Sweden in the hope of escaping violent death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is especially moving that many of the families who lost
their children had come here to seek refuge from violence and
suppression,'' Ms. Bahl said. Swedish officials quickly set up
psychological counseling centers around the city Friday, and
churches in almost every neighborhood held bereavement services
this evening.
</P>
<P>
   Yet chaos and confusion continued to dominate efforts at picking
up the pieces. Officials said Friday night they had only been able
to positively identify a handful of the dead teen-agers so far,
because many of partygoers either had no identification cards or
false ones with false ages.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many dazed students and parents wandered around the
hospitals here fearful that missing friends or children had died
but unable to know for sure. Police officials said it may be
several days before they know the names of every victim.

POLITICAL MODERATION PREVAILS IN STATE WITH POLARIZED TRADITION

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When this election year began in California, the
big political questions were whether the Republican nominee for
governor, state Attorney General Dan Lungren, a staunch foe of
abortion, was too conservative to appeal to swing voters in this
diverse and giant state, and whether Sen. Barbara Boxer was too
liberal to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the election season winds down here, Lungren trails his
Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by double-digits in the
polls. And Boxer finally appears to have opened a solid lead over
her Republican challenger, state Treasurer Matt Fong _ but only by
outspending him 2 to 1 in television advertisements that paint him
as extremist.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, moderation is the watchword in the Golden State this
year, and Davis, a 23-year veteran of state government widely
mocked as the dullest politician in his party, appears on the verge
of a major victory that will put him in charge not only of the
world's seventh largest economy but also of the political
redistricting of the nation's largest state _ and thus, a big chunk
of Congress _ two years from now.
</P>
<P>
   That blandness has become the dominant political virtue in a
state that not so very long ago produced the polar partisan
opposites of Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown _ and at a time when
partisan divisions are deeper than ever in many aspects of national
political debate _ says much about current feeling in a place long
viewed as an incubator of American trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like bookends,'' said Bill Carrick, a South Carolinian
who has been a Democratic political consultant in Washington and,
for nearly a decade, here in Los Angeles. ``On the one hand, you
have a national Republican Party increasingly dominated by Southern
politicians, with a unique, Southern-fried Republicanism
exemplified by Trent Lott, Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey and Tom
DeLay.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrick added, ``California has a big pile of Republican
moderates who are pro-choice, very sensitive to environmental
protection, worried about the coast and offshore oil drilling,
afraid of random violence and therefore more supportive of gun
controls _ basically 25 percent of the party with a political
philosophy that is more like the philosophy of independents than it
is like other Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, Davis, a decorated Army veteran of the Vietnam War
who supports the death penalty, has relentlessly exploited those
tensions in the Republican Party in a state where party
registration is about evenly divided but where Republicans have
controlled the governorship for 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has succeeded to such a degree that in the most recent Los
Angeles Times Poll on the election last week, he led Lungren 53
percent to 42 percent among people it considered likely to vote,
and drew nearly 5 in 10 of the voters who described themselves as
moderate Republicans. By contrast, more than 5 in 10 moderate
Republicans had an unfavorable impression of Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   In a particular bit of bad news for Lungren, a higher percentage
of voters viewed Lungren negatively than they did Brown, for whom
Davis worked as chief of staff in Sacramento and whom Lungren has
tried to turn into a hot-button liberal by association in this
race. Instead, Davis has made Lungren's old voting record as a
conservative congressman _ against creating the Department of
Education, against reparations for Japanese-Americans interned in
World War II _ stick against him.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Boxer, an outspoken liberal from Marin County
north of San Francisco, was locked for months in a tight race with
Fong, a soft-spoken, fresh-faced political newcomer, because voters
perceived her as out of step with California's prevailing political
order. In her six years in the Senate she has not managed to expand
her base of support, and only broke 50 percent in her job approval
ratings for the first time last week.
</P>
<P>
   Only in recent weeks, with a series of television commercials
attacking Fong's opposition to new gun control laws and accusing
him of opposing tougher environmental standards, did Boxer gain the
upper hand in the campaign give-and-take. A statewide Field Poll
made public Thursday showed her leading Fong 51 percent to 42
percent among people it regarded as likely to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's biggest break came when The San Francisco Examiner
disclosed this week that in June, Fong gave $50,000 in campaign
funds left over from a past race for state treasurer to the
Traditional Values Coalition, an Orange County-based group that
opposes abortion, birth control and gay rights and favors school
prayer and tougher obscenity laws.
</P>
<P>
   That disclosure so angered Fong's gay supporters that he
promptly signed a letter agreeing to support most of their
legislative priorities, including a series of bills outlawing
discrimination against homosexuals in employment and housing and
working to increase funds for AIDS research. And that, in turn,
angered Fong's conservative religious supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fong has damaged himself terribly,'' said Sherry Bebitch
Jeffe, a political analyst at the Claremont Graduate School.
``Barbara Boxer is a very polarizing politician, but the reality of
it is, she is closer to the views of those moderates on issues that
Democrats have skillfully made wedge issues, particularly gun
control and abortion rights. What she has managed to do is push
those buttons that concern moderate and independent voters.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Boxer basked in the glow of the most popular
politician in the state, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who in her six
years in office has managed to build broad appeal with her
sponsorship of controls on assault weapons and a tough anti-crime
stance. At a joint appearance in Santa Monica, which has recently
seen an unusual wave of gang-related shootings, Boxer and Feinstein
complained that Fong opposes new gun control measures, including a
ban on junk guns and a requirement for child safety locks.

 LOS ANGELES: safety locks.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has helped that Fong, a former Air Force officer and member
of the state Board of Equalization and Assessment, has been
tentative in debates and has not drawn the unalloyed support of the
national Republican Party, which can get a bigger bang for its
advertising dollars in battleground states where television time is
less costly.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief appearance in Los Angeles' Chinatown on Thursday,
intended to rally support among Asian-American voters, Fong left
without taking any questions. Instead, he turned the podium over to
his campaign manager, who played videotapes of new television
commercials, including one featuring the candidate's mother, March
Fong Eu, the longtime former Democratic secretary of state here,
saying Boxer ``should be ashamed'' of her attacks, and another
branding the senator ``too liberal and ineffective for
California.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lungren has been hard-pressed to move his campaign
much beyond the issue of crime. On a visit to the Robert E. Lee
Elementary School in a minority neighborhood in his hometown of
Long Beach on Wednesday, Lungren read a Halloween story but spoke
listlessly to parents and teachers about education, never
mentioning his main proposal: giving government vouchers to allow
parents of children in troubled public schools to send them to
private or parochial schools.
</P>
<P>
   Only the next morning, at a ceremony honoring crime victims in
which Mayors Rudolph Giuliani of New York and Richard Riordan of
Los Angeles participated, did Lungren seem to come alive.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem for the Republicans here, Ms. Jeffe said, is
that their own base of party activists is increasingly dominated by
conservatives who produce candidates like Lungren, while elections
are won in the center. President Clinton showed the national appeal
of that brand of centrism two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Carrick, the Democratic consultant, noted that Californians of
both parties tend to migrate here from other states in search of
one kind or another of freedom from their old worlds, ``and that by
definition makes them more open-minded and far less judgemental''
than voters in many other regions. But he predicted that
California's penchant for moderation could become its latest
export.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a big influence in and of itself, just because
of its size,'' Carrick said. ``But in terms of the ability of the
political trends here to translate to other places, I think there's
going to be a continuing counter-reaction to the increasingly
conservative brand of Republicans in other parts of the country,
and then we're going to look back in 10 years and say it started in
California.''

HEALTHY GROWTH FOR ECONOMY,   BUT SOME ANALYSTS SEE OMINOUS SIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Consumers spent money freely over the summer,
making the US economy an island of solid growth amid a troubled
world economy, the government reported yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Several economists, however, saw bad news in the numbers and
predicted that economic growth would cool in the next few months.
``Things look very strong on the surface, but it's not so strong
when you probe around underneath,'' said Cynthia Latta, principal
US economist at Standard &AMP; Poor's/DRI in Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department reported that gross domestic product,
the broadest measure of goods and services produced in the United
States, rose at an annual rate of 3.3 percent in the
July-to-September quarter, seasonally adjusted. Analysts had been
expecting growth only a little above 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 3.3 percent rate compares to growth of 5.5 percent in the
first quarter of this year and 1.8 percent in the second quarter, a
time when the Asian financial crisis began cutting into orders at
US companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our economy is continuing to grow in a strong manner. ... In
the face of worldwide economic turmoil, our economy remains the
strongest in a generation,'' President Clinton said. The stock
market also cheered the Commerce report, sending the Dow Jones
industrial average up 97.07 to close at 8592.10.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts said the government report contained some
ominous signs.
</P>
<P>
   Exports declined at a rate of 2.9 percent, the third quarter in
a row that they fell. Equally troubling, businesses invested money
in new buildings and equipment at a slower pace. ``You've got two
major weaknesses in the GDP: exports are still a disaster, and now
you have problems with business investment,'' said Nicholas Perna,
chief economist with Fleet Financial Group Inc. ``You have to ask
yourself how long the economy can go along with those areas being a
drag on the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The troubling news did not end there. Much of the economic
growth in the third quarter came as businesses added to their
inventories. Their shelves are now stocked, but it is unclear
whether they will sell off those goods and place new orders with
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, consumer confidence has been slipping, a fact given
more weight Friday as the University of Michigan index of consumer
sentiment slipped to 97.4 in October from 100.9 in September..
Consumer spending drives about two-thirds of economic activity.
</P>
<P>
   The government report Friday gave mixed news on consumer
spending, saying it grew at a robust 3.9 percent annual rate in the
third quarter. At the same time, consumers are spending just about
everything they earn. According to Latta, the government reported
that the savings rate is now at a troubling 0.1 percent, down from
0.4 percent in the second quarter and greatly lower than about 5.5
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Both Latta and Oscar Gonzalez, an economist with John Hancock
Mutual Life Insurance in Boston, said the newest GDP numbers would
likely prompt them to revise their estimates downward for growth in
the final quarter of 1998. Because some growth likely occurred in
the third quarter that they had expected to come in the fourth,
Gonzalez said he would probably forecast growth for the last
quarter of the year at 2 percent or 2.5 percent, while Latta pegged
it at something less than the 2.8 percent in her most recent
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   More problematic, growth could slow to under 1 percent in the
first part of next year, Latta said. ``And if you're used to 3.5
percent growth, that feels like a recession,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you need is a couple of things to go wrong to move you
from slow growth into negative growth,'' said Perna. He said the
chance of a recession in the near future is about 30 percent or 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
   One open question is whether the Federal Reserve will try to
stimulate the economy by again lowering interest rates. Several
analysts said the strong GDP numbers Friday made it unlikely that
Fed policy-makers would cut rates at their November meeting. But
Perna predicted a half-point cut, possibly in two stages, over the
next few months.

TOUGH ODDS AS CASINOS MULTIPLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)  (For release Sunday, Nov. 1) 
(af) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark Greenberg, portfolio manager of the Invesco Leisure fund,
stayed at the new Bellagio hotel in Las Vegas last week, while
attending the Salomon Smith Barney Leisure Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Widely considered the most luxurious and spectacular resort in
Las Vegas, the Bellagio boasts Picasso paintings on its walls,
Italian marble on its floors and a man-made lake with more than
1,200 fountain spouts on its grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The accommodations were indeed grand, but Greenberg was a bit
unhappy about the price. ``I wish my rate wasn't so good,'' he
said. ``It's $99 a night.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's fund has a small amount of its money invested in
Mirage Resorts Inc., which owns the Bellagio and hopes to charge
$200 a night on average, a new high for Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Greenberg got his room for $99 _ albeit on a
weekday during a slow time of the year _ could be a sign of deep
trouble for Las Vegas, the nation's largest gambling center.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Picassos aside, the Las Vegas picture is not pretty,
at least for casino companies and investors. A looming oversupply
of rooms and falling profits have battered their stocks; the
hardest hit, like Circus Circus Enterprises and Primadonna Resorts,
have fallen by about half this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that might not mean that such stocks are bargains. ``In that
environment, the better question is not who thrives but who
survives,'' said Harry Curtis, an analyst with BancBoston Robertson
Stephens.
</P>
<P>
   A glut of rooms is not the only concern. The Asian economic
crisis has reduced visits by Asian high rollers. Revenue from
baccarat, their game of choice, is down 24 percent through August
this year.
</P>
<P>
   And Californians will vote Tuesday on a proposition that would
expand Indian-run casinos in their state. The could siphon gamblers
from Las Vegas, which drew 28 percent of its visitors from
California last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000-room Bellagio, which opened on Oct. 15, is the first
of four splashy hotels that together will increase the number of
rooms in Las Vegas by more than 12,000, or 12 percent, in the
coming year. The three others are Circus Circus' Mandalay Bay,
Hilton Hotels' Paris and the Venetian, owned by Sheldon Adelson,
who made his fortune from the Comdex computer trade show.
</P>
<P>
   Still more hotels are set to open in 2000, bringing the room
count to 128,000, up nearly 22 percent from 1997, according to the
Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The new hotels represent a shift upward in price and luxury as
casino operators hope to attract wealthy people, even if they are
not gamblers, who might otherwise vacation in Palm Springs or
Aspen. Instead of luring visitors with cheap rooms and 99-cent
shrimp cocktails, the new hotels hope their fancy rooms,
restaurants and shops will be profit centers in their own right.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, new hotels have attracted enough visitors to more
than fill the new rooms they created. In 1993, the number of hotel
rooms jumped by 12 percent with the opening of Treasure Island,
Luxor and the MGM Grand. The next year, the number of visitors
soared 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say that while the latest hotels will bring in
more visitors, the increase will not be enough to fill the new
capacity, in part because airline service to Las Vegas is
insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis predicted that the visitor count would rise 4 percent to
4.5 percent a year, but that 6 percent would be needed for Las
Vegas casinos as a group to meet earnings expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a belief that each new round of hotels must be more
spectacular than the last means higher construction costs, thus
lowering potential returns. The Bellagio cost $1.6 billion, not
including the Picassos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the returns on investment during this
round of capital investment will be less than they were last
time,'' said Andrew S. Zarnett, an analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts recommend a flight to quality. ``Some of the
better operators will glean the lion's share of the profits and
others will be working very hard to make less money,'' said John J.
Rohs, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   By consensus, analysts saw Mirage Resorts as the safest bet,
though they differed on how safe it would be. It is the only casino
company on Schroder's list of recommended stocks, and Rohs
predicted that Mirage shares would be at $24 a year from now,
compared with $16.937.
</P>
<P>
   Zarnett is a bit more optimistic. He said the talk in Las Vegas
was that the Bellagio was already drawing increasing numbers of
visitors. In addition to Mirage Resorts, he recommended MGM Grand,
with a price target of $35, up from $26.125 on Friday. It has good
management, a pristine balance sheet and a new convention center to
help fill its rooms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jason N. Ader of Bear, Stearns said he would not invest in
any Las Vegas casino operators right now. While the Bellagio should
do well, Ader said, it might cannibalize business from other Mirage
Resorts hotels. (He recommends Sun International Hotels, which is
opening a casino on Paradise Island in the Bahamas, where it will
face virtually no competition.)
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, despite small positions in Hilton and Mirage Resorts,
is not buying any more Las Vegas casino stocks, quite a statement
for a fund manager whose mission is to invest in leisure
industries. ``I don't know what they are going to do to get out of
this problem,'' he said of the oversupply.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps the best reason for buying casino stocks now is that
no one else seems to want them. This is what is known in Las Vegas
as a long shot.

<P>
   After 155 years as a life insurance company that concentrated on
providing policies at low cost rather than on turning a profit, the
Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York is preparing to enter the
turbulent world of publicly traded companies.
</P>
<P>
   The big question for investors is whether management can turn a
tortoise into something more closely resembling a hare.
</P>
<P>
   There is money to be made if Michael I. Roth, the chief
executive, succeeds. For like other sluggish mutuals that have made
the transition to stock ownership, MONY, as it is known, should
come out of the gate in the next few weeks at a big discount.
</P>
<P>
   At an expected price of about $20 a share for its initial public
offering, it would trade nearly 44 percent below the company's book
value of $35.58 a share.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, publicly held life insurers are trading at about
twice their book value.
</P>
<P>
   But the discount is not there for nothing. ``Mutual life
insurance companies have deeply ingrained cultures,'' said Eric N.
Berg, an analyst for CIBC Oppenheimer, an investment bank. ``They
can change. And some have. But changes in such conservative
companies are hard fought.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent history is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   The Equitable Life Insurance Co., now the Equitable Companies,
shifted from a mutual to a stock structure in 1992 with an initial
public offering at $9 a share. After rising to about $20, the stock
plateaued for several years before climbing to a peak of $84.1875
last July.
</P>
<P>
   It closed on Friday at $49. The State Mutual Life Assurance
Company of America in Worcester, Mass., now the Allmerica Financial
Corp., went on the market in late 1995 at $21. It gradually rose to
a peak of $75.25 this summer, and closed on Friday at $50.
</P>
<P>
   These companies have picked up the pace. And MONY may do so,
too. But MONY and its brethren are unlikely to ever be mistaken for
sprinters. ``This is a company for the long haul, something you
might want to put in your kid's college fund,'' said Randall Roth,
an analyst at Renaissance Capital, an initial-offering research
firm in Greenwich, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   MONY's is the first of a new wave of recently announced
conversions, as big mutuals scramble to raise money for expansions
aimed at gaining greater market share and economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
   MONY's offering is being watched by other mutuals that are
converting, like Prudential and John Hancock, as well as others,
like Metropolitan Life, that are leaning that way.
</P>
<P>
   MONY plans to issue 34 million shares to its 900,000
policyholders, who are the formal owners of the company, and to
sell 11.3 million other shares, expecting to raise more than $200
million. (MONY had planned to sell 15.3 million shares before the
stock market began to lose its zip.)
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring that investors may be getting a bargain, some
policyholders have said the offering should be delayed until the
market improved. But Roth said at a New York State Insurance
Department hearing two weeks ago that no one could be sure when
that would be. And, down the road, he said, prices ``could be
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   MONY got into serious trouble in the late 1980s when it had lots
of real estate and junk bonds _ more than many competitors _ and
the value of both dropped sharply. While the company has been
recovering, its return on equity is about 4 percent, below even the
stolid 7 percent average for other mutuals and well below the 13
percent for publicly traded competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Some who have looked at the company's books do not like what
they see. Robert Mescal, an analyst at the Institute for
Econometric Research in Deerfield Beach, Fla., said he is skeptical
about the company's reports that profits have risen sharply in the
last 18 months though revenues have been flat, at about $2 billion,
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   MONY's prospectus shows the profit increase comes from capital
gains on real estate sales, which many analysts say they eliminate
in evaluating a company.
</P>
<P>
   It does not look like a case of management trying to gussy up
its performance, said Michael A. Frinquelli, a principal of
Renaissance Fund Advisers, an investment fund. MONY looks like ``a
value stock,'' he said, adding that he was still researching but
``we're predisposed to buying it.''

 &HT;    Debate over bounds of bounty hunters renewed in Georgia
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The popular image of a bounty hunter is Clint
Eastwood, a stogie clenched in his teeth, riding into town with a
trussed up ne'er-do-well thrown over a horse. It didn't matter how
he got the varmint. He just did.
</P>
<P>
   That notion has persisted and was reinforced this week when two
bounty hunters kicked in the door of the wrong house in South
DeKalb County where a terrified 14-year-old girl was home alone.
The men were charged criminally Friday, reopening debate over just
how far bounty hunters can go.
</P>
<P>
   Don Geary, a Gwinnett County prosecutor who convicted two bounty
hunters in Fulton County three years ago after a shootout, said the
profession has no oversight and there's a common myth that bounty
hunters are somewhat beyond the law.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters ``govern themselves by an 1830-something case
that says they have basically unfettered power,'' said Geary. ``But
they don't have near as much authority as they think they have.''
State law enforcement officials say the civil contract signed by
people bonded out of jail forfeits some of their rights, but does
not give bounty hunters carte blanche in their pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sign away some of their rights,'' said Geary. ``But they
have no right to go into the homes of people not involved. They
don't have more rights than police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan said a 1983 DeKalb
County ruling upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court ``says they
(bounty hunters) have the same rights as police officers, although
I disagree with that vehemently. ``
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate judge Alan Harvey told the two bounty hunters in the
DeKalb case Friday that their job gives them the right to enter a
house looking for a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you do not have the right to damage property,'' Harvey
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Jenkins, owner of a Marietta debt collection agency, said
he left the bounty-hunter business four years ago ``because there
are too many crazies out there who'll kick in doors thinking
they're Wyatt Earp.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's an effort afoot by some bail bonding agents to clean
up the industry and establish guidelines regulating who should be
able to chase down ``skips.'' Currently, Georgia has no
requirements for bounty hunters. They don't have to be licensed and
no criminal background checks are performed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the felons out of doing recovery,'' said Ray Krebs,
owner of A Accommodating Bonding in Marietta and regional director
of Professional Bondsmen of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs, who said bounty hunters perform a public service by
capturing 28,000 bail jumpers a year, worked with state Rep. Kem
Shipp (R-Kennesaw) this year in an unsuccessful attempt to pass a
law that would require training and licensing for bounty hunters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never legislate out stupidity,'' said Krebs. ``But
there are laws dealing with stupidity. They broke down the door and
got charged.''
</P>
<P>
   Shipp unsuccessfully tried to put his plan under the umbrella of
the state Peace Officers Standards and Training Council and then
the Secretary of State's office. Both agencies said they did not
have the staff for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp, who said he started the effort after bounty hunters
terrorized a friend's daughter one night, amended the bill to have
bounty hunters pay for their own training. Convicted felons would
be excluded. They would also be required to register with the
county sheriff. He plans to push the bill again next year.
</P>
<P>
   Krebs said he requires his ``recovery agents'' to have a gun
license and good references before he interviews them. ``You say,
`Isn't it fun to kick in doors?' If they say yes, whoa, they're
gone,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want management, training and screening,'' said Krebs.
``Right now some (bondsmen) don't care who they hire.''

 &HT;    Tough image marks attorney general race
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ State Attorney General Thurbert Baker took the
offensive this week in his bid to win re-election, picking up key
endorsements and hitting the airwaves to say his GOP opponent's
``negative ads are a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The closely contested race pits Baker, the former state
legislator appointed to the post last year by Gov. Zell Miller,
against state Sen. David Ralston (R-Blue Ridge) and Zebulon lawyer
Walker Chandler, the Libertarian candidate. During the final weeks
of the campaign, both Baker and Ralston have aired TV ads that make
it sound as if each candidate is going to be the toughest lawman
possible. At the same time, each criticizes the other for being
soft on crime.
</P>
<P>
   At a Friday news conference outside the Capitol, Baker announced
he had received endorsements from 19 of the state's 47 district
attorneys. Three metro area DAs _ Paul Howard of Fulton County, J.
Tom Morgan of DeKalb and Bob Keller of Clayton _ stood at Baker's
side. On Thursday, Baker picked up an endorsement from the National
Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said it is the first time he knows of that district
attorneys have endorsed a candidate for statewide office.
``Thurbert supported the DAs when he was floor leader for Governor
Miller,'' Morgan said. ``We don't forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Ralston made note that less than half of the
state's district attorneys formally endorsed Baker. He added: ``We
have not asked for DAs to endorse us because most all the DA's we
talk with view their office to be outside politics. It troubles me
he's bringing them into a political fight.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ralston has received support from at least one district
attorney, Roger Queen of the Appalachian Judicial Circuit. During a
recent debate, Ralston criticized Baker for not responding to a
Dec. 10, 1997, letter from Queen, who asked for help in the appeal
of a pretrial ruling involving the death penalty prosecution of
Tommy Lamar Pickren. Pickren, who shot and killed Gilmer County
Deputy Brett Dickey, was sentenced to life without parole. Baker
says his office assisted Queen's prosecutors in the case, even
though he did not personally answer Queen's letter. And District
Attorneys Morgan and Howard both said Friday that the attorney
general's office during Baker's tenure has helped prosecute death
penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   In his advertising campaign, Ralston also criticizes Baker for
voting to kill legislation requiring violent criminals to serve 85
percent of their sentences and for his vote against legislation
that proposed to allow nonunanimous verdicts in capital sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who now says violent criminals should serve their entire
sentence, said his ad calls Ralston's claim ``a lie'' because it
misrepresents his record. Baker said he voted against the
85-percent proposal because it may have weakened a state law
requiring life sentences for anyone convicted a second time of one
of the ``seven deadly sins.''
</P>
<P>
   In a show of support for the death penalty, one Baker ad notes
that he ``ordered'' the June 9 execution of a convicted murderer.
Although Baker's office successfully argued for James Cargill's
execution, it was actually a judge who ordered the execution.

 &HT;    Barnes raises record $9 million for Georgia governor's race
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Republican Guy Millner, a multimillionaire businessman
with no experience in government, has campaigned for governor on
the promise he'll apply business principles to state government,
but Georgia's business establishment appears to be at least as
comfortable with Democrat Roy Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   That' picture emerges from a study of the two candidates'
campaign finance disclosure reports through October 19.
</P>
<P>
   Millner has invested at least $11.5 million of his own money in
the race and raised another $3.5 million from 4,400 contributors.
But Barnes, a state representative from suburban Atlanta, has
beaten the bushes for a record $9 million from 9,000 contributors
who represent a broad spectrum of economic interests, including
banking, real estate, healthcare, timber and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some true believers who think any Democrat won't be
friendly to business,'' said Keith Mason, an Atlanta attorney who
has worked on the staffs of Gov. Zell Miller and President Clinton.
``But some of the more informed people in business understand that
government has a role to play in areas like producing an educated
workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes received contributions from the CEOs of Georgia-Pacific
Corp., Georgia Power Co., Chatham Steel and from CNN's Ted Turner.
Millner accepted contributions from the CEO of Equifax and from
Bear Stears and Flowers Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers Wade, who has given to both parties and recently
contributed $5,000 to Millner, said many of the state's
conservative Democrats and established businesses have sided with
Barnes because they are leery of radical change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're staying with what they know,'' said Wade, president of
the non-partisan Georgia Public Policy Foundation. ``They don't
know Guy Millner. This may be his third go-round, but they still
don't know him.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Tarbutton family, which runs a hugely
profitable railroad that serves the kaolin industry in middle
Georgia, contributed $23,500 to Barnes after initially supporting
Republican Mike Bowers, whom Millner defeated in the primary in
July.
</P>
<P>
   If Millner hasn't made much headway with certain established
Georgia businesses and political action committees, he's done quite
well with newer, entreprenurial firms, Wade said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of new money out there,'' Wade said. ``The names
of the companies don't register with any of us, but they're making
jillions of dollars and are run by very bright young people. I
think the Republican went after that new money.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stuckey, a former head of the state Republican Party, said
many entreprenurial types lean toward Millner because they don't
want government to create obstacles to their success and
Republicans are generally associated with less intrusive
government.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, on the other hand, has solid labor support. He also
inherits an advantage in fundraising from PACs and big companies
because those interests ``have been used to Democrats running the
show.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is beginning to change as Republican prospects
brighten, Stuckey added.
</P>
<P>
   Perennial contributors AFLAC, the Columbus insurance giant, and
Synovus, the Columbus bank holding company, gave substantial sums
to both Barnes and Millner.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, A.W. Dahlberg, the CEO of the Southern Co., gave
$1,000 to each, while the energy holding company's law firm,
Troutman Sanders, gave $5,000 to each.
</P>
<P>
   But as a group, attorneys overwhelmingly supported Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   More than one-fourth of the $4 million Barnes raised in the
11-week reporting period ended October 19, came from lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Stuckey said Barnes' $1 million came almost entirely from
plaintiff attorneys, not from regulatory and corporate defense
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very distinct break in the bar,'' said Stuckey, a
regulatory attorney who contributed $1,250 to Millner. ``Trial
lawyers are a very well-organized part of the bar and they
traditionally vote Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   But Barnes has done extensive work as both a plaintiff attorney
and a defense attorney for doctors, and he reported contributions
from prominent corporate lawyers at King &AMP; Spalding: Griffin Bell,
a former U.S. Attorney General, and Sam Nunn, a former U.S.
senator.

 &HT;    Millner hangs on to narrow lead in race for Georgia governor
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four days before the vote, Republican Guy Millner
clings to a tenuous lead over Democratic rival Roy Barnes in an
ever-tightening race for governor, a new poll for the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution/WSB-TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   Millner's 5-point edge over the veteran state legislator is a
milestone for Republicans who have not led at this stage of the
game during their 130 year struggle to win the state's top office _
or at least since political polling began. Millner, the party's
nominee for the past three statewide contests, used it Friday as
further evidence that he will prevail. ``I think we're going to
win,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But by no means does Millner's 45-40 lead over Barnes in the
poll guarantee a victory at the ballot box. The poll showed 11
percent of voters undecided, and how they break on election day
could change the outcome. The narrow margin separating the two
major candidates almost falls within the poll's margin of error, a
fact that had spin machines cranking overtime in both camps to
claim a bump from the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trends are on our side, the people are on our side, the
momentum is on our side,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Close scrutiny of the numbers may give Barnes good cause for
optimism in a race that promises to be one of the tightest in
Georgia history.
</P>
<P>
   Among the encouraging factors for Democrats is that Mark Taylor,
their nominee for lieutenant governor, surged to a comfortable
13-percent lead in the new poll. The possibility of a solid turnout
among south Georgia Democrats to support their hometown boy _
Taylor is from Albany _ could pump up vote totals for Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   The Mableton attorney, who closed the race by one percent since
the newspaper's last poll, now is picking up almost two-thirds of
the white swing vote, a group that could help decide the
gubernatorial contest, according to the poll. Those voters
generally broke Republican in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Millner still falls short of the 60 percent support he needs
among white voters to win, the poll shows, while Barnes is much
closer to the 40 percent threshold he must cross with white voters
to build a winning coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not for Millner a comfortable lead by any chance,''
said Merle Black, an Emory University political scientist. ``This
looks like everything is virtually dead even.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 709 registered likely voters, conducted Oct. 24-28,
has a 4 percentage point margin of error. It tracks with other
polls released in the last few days indicating the contest is a
dead-heat.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, Millner shored up his support among voters
below the age of 30, and he continues to do well among Georgians
aged 45-64. Millner's message of tax cuts and government
streamlining may have contributed to his strong appeal among white
males.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not a professional politician, that's the first plus,''
said poll respondent Doug Duncan, a firefighter and emergency
medical technician from Cobb County. ``He's successfully managed a
business, and the governor is an administrator.''
</P>
<P>
   Among women, Millner's support has declined somewhat since the
last poll, despite months of wooing by the Republican. Millner's
favorability rating also dropped during the last month as Barnes
stepped up ads criticizing Millner's business record. During that
same time period, Millner drew a hard-line with commercials
opposing affirmative action, an issue that stirs many women and
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millner doesn't come across well to me,'' said June DeLauder,
a homemaker from Woodstock. ``I don't care for some of the things
he's promoting.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows Barnes continuing a lopsided lead among blacks,
traditionally one of the Democrats' strongest voting groups. But
his support level _ six out of 10, according to the newspaper poll
_ is short of the level Democratic candidates have come to expect,
political scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes and other political watchers raised questions about the
poll's distribution of the black vote. Internal Democratic polls
show Barnes carrying almost 80 percent of the black vote, more
consistent with previous campaigns. That amount gives Barnes a
tentative lead.
</P>
<P>
   Black voters contacted for follow-up interviews said their
support for Barnes is strengthened by Millner's push against
affirmative action. ``I just don't think the Republicans care that
much about blacks,'' said Lillian Reese, a 46-year-old federal
employee from Decatur. ``The only time you see Republicans putting
a black in front of them is if they're running for something.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes also polled well among the over-65 set. Retirees like
Dora Burnett, a former teacher from Marietta, found Barnes'
two-decades experience in the Legislature reassuring. ``Roy is as
solid as dirt,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Republican projections that metro Atlanta may be a
key to victory, voters in the five metro counties are almost evenly
divided. A final wildcard in the contest may be the presence of
Libertarian Jack Cashin, who polled what may turn out to be a
crucial 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a hard, hard one to pick,'' said James Jolly, a
retired trucker from Henry County. ``Frankly, it's kind of reach in
the hat and pull out one and hope they'll do what they say they'll
do.''

 &HT;    Democrats target Gingrich's role in GOP ads
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _Newt Gingrich became the focus of Democratic
campaigning Friday after published reports that the House speaker
personally approved Republican ads that refer to the Monica
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, meanwhile, continued their onslaught of
advertisements in the final days of the campaign, a product of the
GOP's massive financial edge over Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) sent Gingrich a
letter Friday saying that his alleged role in approving the ads is
at odds with the speaker's pledge for a bipartisan impeachment
inquiry. ``It is clear that you have forfeited your legitimacy as
speaker,'' Gephardt said.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic National Committee radio ad released Friday says:
``Newt Gingrich orchestrated these pro-impeachment negative ads. Do
you want another year of investigations or a Congress that works
for you?''
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore also joined the fray by raising the
specter of endless investigations if Republicans do well in
Tuesday's election.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich campaign spokesman Mike Shields denied a report in the
Washington Post that the speaker signed off on or managed the
content of three ads that either explicitly or implicitly invoke
the Clinton sex scandal. ``It's just not true,'' Shields said. ``I
was there when he was told these ads were running. He said, 'That's
nice. They sound effective.' But even though reporters in
Washington don't believe it, he is not involved in the nitty-gritty
of the campaign. To this day, he hasn't seen any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich campaigned Friday in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic response to Gingrich's alleged involvement in the
ad campaign illustrated the party's last-ditch efforts to make sure
their most loyal supporters go the polls next week. It recalled the
1996 campaign, when Gingrich was the constant target of Democratic
candidates who tried to hang the unpopular speaker around the necks
of their Republican opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, spending $10 million in the last week on behalf of
House candidates nationwide, see in the new ads the ability to
motivate their base.
</P>
<P>
   Other ads that are part of the GOP blitz target specific
candidates on education, taxes and ethics. Republican ads are
running in at least 29 congressional districts, suggesting that GOP
strategists believe the party can pick up six to 12 seats, which
many analysts have said is a reasonable forecast.

 &HT;    Glenn mission may have prompted record media turnout
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENNEDY SPACE CENTER, Fla. _ John Glenn's nostalgia-rich return
to space on Thursday prompted possibly the biggest news media
turnout in the history of manned space flight.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 news people pre-registered for press credentials
here, and NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham estimated 3,000 news
people were on the scene by the time Discovery lifted off. TV
trucks and trailers turned the press site's parking lot and part of
a once-grassy field into a high-tech mobile home park.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Apollo 11's launch in 1969 generated 3,497 press
requests, with 2,700 actually covering the launch. The biggest
turnout on record was the first space shuttle launch in 1981, which
drew 2,707 reporters, photographers and support crews, according to
the space agency.
</P>
<P>
   But the 77-year-old space pioneer was not the only reason for
the intense interest by the news media. With Tuesday's election
looming, the press site was awash in politicians, and even
President Clinton flew in to watch Glenn rocket back into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 Spanish news people covered the launch _ not Glenn's,
but that of Mission Specialist Pedro Duque, who became the first
Spanish citizen to fly in space. Duque is an astronaut for the
European Space Agency, of which Spain is a member.
</P>
<P>
   With Thursday's launch, Duque became to Spain what Glenn was to
the United States when he made his first flight in 1962, said
Consuelo Ortega, a reporter for the national TV service Tele 5 in
Madrid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very important. He's a hero,'' she said. Besides Spanish
reporters in U.S. bureaus, about 20 came from Spain to cover the
launch, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shoko Yamamoto, a spokeswoman for the National Space Development
Agency of Japan, said her nation has a heightened interest in the
flight because payload specialist Chiaki Mukai, a medical doctor,
is Japan's first female astronaut. This is her second space flight.
</P>
<P>
   The international nature of this mission spurred the French news
service Agence France-Presse to send its Washington, D.C.-based
science correspondent Guy Clavel to the launch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come here regularly,'' he said. ``This is exceptional.
The main story is of course Glenn, because he's a unique man. It's
a unique situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is the overwhelming reason for the intense American news
coverage, from CNN to Lester Gingold, 76-year-old publisher of The
Best Times, a magazine for ``active mature Memphians'' in
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Gingold said his interest stemmed from ``the fact that a
77-year-old man can go into space and I can vicariously go with
him, and what I believe is the important scientific research in the
field of aging'' that Glenn is to do.
</P>
<P>
   Space launches aren't new to science journalist Andrew Chaikin,
author of A Man on the Moon, a history of the Apollo program.
Chaikin said he watched the last moon mission, Apollo 17, blast off
in December 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he thought this mission was worth witnessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be here for the history of it,'' he said.

 &HT;    GOP ad message centered on Clinton scandal offers slim choice
 &HT;    By Bill Osinski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VALDOSTA, Ga. _ A late-rounds gut punch of Republican Party
television attack ads seems to have most parties reeling in the
political ring of Georgia's Second Congressional District.
</P>
<P>
   The tactic was as subtle as a Mike Tyson ear nuzzle. The ads,
which capitalize on President Clinton's Monica Lewinsky
relationship, seek to frame Tuesday's election as a referendum with
two choices: ``Reward Bill Clinton for lying, or vote Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign is intended to help the Republican first-time
candidate for Congress, Albany businessman Joe McCormick, unseat
three-term incumbent Democrat Sanford Bishop. This district is the
only one in Georgia that is part of a $10 million GOP campaign in
30 congressional races around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to tell who's getting hurt the most in this south
Georgia district.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick sought to distance himself from the ads.
</P>
<P>
   His heavyweight campaign visitor, former Republican presidential
candidate Bob Dole, backed off from negative campaining and
recalled when he'd been hurt 10 years ago by a similar late blow _
one delivered by his Republican opponent, George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop's corner has so far kept their man above the fray.
</P>
<P>
   And some regular folks in the district appear ready to throw in
the towel on what they see as below-the-belt politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this is going to get the Republicans anywhere,''
said Charles McCleod, as he breakfasted on ham-and-grits at a
Valdosta diner. McCleod, who described himself as a political
independent who voted for Dole in 1996, said he was unimpressed by
the ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are sick of Clinton, but most people are sick of
this kind of politics,'' he said. ``Especially in this year's race,
people are going to vote for individuals, not national parties.''
</P>
<P>
   At another restaurant, Gigi Taylor, an active Republican, said
that while she subscribed to the message of the ads, she's not sure
how effective they'll be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I don't think it will change people's votes,''
she said. ``They don't care (about Clinton's sexual scandals). I
care, but a lot of other people don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Highsmith, who said she tends to vote Democratic, said
she was offended by the implication of the ad campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pathetic and thoughtless,'' she said. The ads may
backfire, she said, generating more interest in the elction among
black voters, who overwhelmingly support Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bit of hostility out there,'' Highsmith said. ``I
think the American public is intelligent enough to reject all this
negative campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Rita Bumgarner, a Democrat who said she is ``trying to forget
Bill Clinton every chance I get,'' added that she nonetheless
separates the president's problems from her vote. And as for the
Republican campaign that has spent millions to try to connect those
elements, she said, ``I think it's outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The ads may be effective in some targeted markets, but in south
Georgia, even the intended beneficiary didn't seem too happy about
them.
</P>
<P>
   After a campaign event in Valdosta on Thursday, McCormick said
of the ads, ``Those are things that are being done independently of
this campaign.'' He added that he has sought to keep his campaign
focused on issues that are most important to the people of the
district.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick did not mention Clinton or the ad campaign at the
Thursday event.
</P>
<P>
   Dole spoke out against negative campaigning in general: ``I
don't go around knocking the opponent. And I'm not running around
the country saying the president ought to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole knows too well how it feels to be on the receiving end of a
late-in-the-game blitz of negative ads. During the 1988
presidential primaries, Dole came out a big winner in the Iowa
primary, while then vice president Bush finished a humbling third.
</P>
<P>
   That put everything on the line in the New Hampshire primary. On
the last weekend of that campaign, Bush unleased a barrage of
television ads that claimed Dole would raise their taxes, a threat
that plays at least as dramatically as a sex scandal in New
Hampshire. Bush won, and on election night on national television,
Dole pleaded with voters to ``tell George Bush to stop lying about
my record.'' Dole's anger may have been righteous, but his campaign
was finished.
</P>
<P>
   Selby McCash, Bishop's press aide, said he doesn't think the
late avalanch of Republican ads will have a significant impact on
the Bishop-McCormick race.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, voters in general haven't transferred blame for
Clinton's behavior to local Democrats,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCash noted that his office received only a small number of
angry calls earlier this month, after Bishop voted against the
Republican impeachment inquiry plan. Most people in the Second
District have accepted Bishop's overall credentials as a
conservative, and Republican attempts to slap the liberal label on
him are ``somewhat amusing,'' he said.

 &HT;    New Orleans shoots down gun industry with lawsuit
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The most famous city in the state that calls
itself the ``Sportsman's Paradise'' declared war on the gun
industry Friday, filing an unprecedented lawsuit against 15 gun
manufacturers, three trade associations and several local
pawnshops.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed by New Orleans Mayor Marc Morial, seeks to
recover damage to the city from the gun industry's sale of guns
that are not ``personalized'' with safety devices that would
prevent their use by children and anyone else other than the owner.
It is the first such suit to be brought against the gun industry by
a government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe the technology exists to make guns smart,'' Morial
said. ``We will not rest until we make New Orleans the safest city
in America.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several safety devices in development. One requires
the shooter to wear a ring embedded with a computer chip that
transmits a message to the gun. Another recognizes the owner's
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the National Shooting Sports Foundation, a
defendant, called the lawsuit ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This technology is not yet proven,'' said Bob Delfay. ``They
are suing an industry for not including unproven technology in its
products. I thought it was supposed to be the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that guns violate the state's product liability
laws because they are ``unreasonably dangerous,'' lacking safety
features and adequate warning labels. The manufacturers and
distributors of these guns fail to prevent their use by
unauthorized people, the suits says, including children and
criminals who steal the guns and use them in robberies and murders.
</P>
<P>
   Safety devices have been available, the suit alleges, but the
defendants have failed to incorporate them into their products. The
suit specifically attacks semi-automatic weapons, because people
have been killed when they were unaware of a round of ammunition
left in the chamber even after the ammunition magazine has been
removed. Almost one-fourth of the annual 1,500 accidental shooting
deaths in the United State occur because the user didn't know a
round of ammunition was in the gun, according to the General
Accounting Office. Delfay said manufacturers agree guns need to
stay out of the hands of children and unauthorized users, but he
said safety devices aren't the solution. The National Rifle
Association called the lawsuit ``absurd.'' The NRA is promoting
Project Exile, a program in Richmond, Va., that soon will be
duplicated in Philadelphia. The program steps up enforcement of an
existing federal law that imposes a five-year prison sentence on
any felon caught with a gun. Since Richmond began Project Exile 18
months ago, the homicide rate there has decreased 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take criminals off the streets and your streets are safer,''
said Bill Powers, an NRA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans Police Chief Richard Pennington, who is credited
with reducing his city's crime rate by 40 percent in four years,
had a quick response to the NRA's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We already do that,'' he said. ``We do that every day, we just
don't have a fancy name for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Orleans police took 2,500 guns off the streets in 1997,
and 1,700 this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   M. David Gelfand, a professor with the Tulane University School
of Law, said the suit bears a strong ressemblance to the recent
successful suits against the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suit builds upon a pretty well-established body of law
regarding product liability,'' he said. ``And this situation is in
a way even stronger than the tobacco argument. The fact is, there
is a defect: The failure to include easily included devices that
would personalize the gun and make it useable only by the owner.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he said, the city may have a tough time proving the
so-called ``chain of causation.

 &HT;    Democrats hope to reverse stronghold of GOP in South
 &HT;    By Mark Sherman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUMMIT, Miss. _ Between shouts of praise for Jesus, Delbert
Hosemann delivered a campaign homily that was heavy on Mississippi
values.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our moral compass in Mississippi is straight,'' Hosemann, the
Republican candidate for Congress, told worshipers at the Wednesday
night service at Calvary Apostolic Church in nearby McComb.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mention of President Clinton, but the message is
clear, particularly when coupled with the airing of a new
Republican Party ad that plays on Clinton's initial denial of his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But in Mississippi, so-called family values issues are not the
exclusive province of Republican candidates. Told about Hosemann's
event, Democrat Ronnie Shows said he too spent Wednesday evening in
a Pentecostal church, this one in Natchez, where the animated
pastor invited Shows to follow him around the sanctuary. ``I
believe we'll do real well in the Pentecostal churches,'' Shows
said.
</P>
<P>
   The nip-and-tuck race in Mississippi's 4th Congressional
District and the campaign in the neighboring 6th district of
Lousiana offer Democrats rare opportunities to pick up
congressional seats in the South with candidates who defy easy
labels.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Republicans aren't trying, armed with a flood of
money from national GOP organizations and well-worn tactics. Shows
is soft on crime, supportive of gun control and prone to raise
taxes, according to the GOP ads.
</P>
<P>
   In Louisiana, ads on Baton Rouge television stations call
Democrat Marjorie McKeithen a ``liberal'' and Republican Rep.
Richard Baker, a 12-year incumbent, a ``conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters in both districts scoffed at the negative ads (although
Shows has not aired any attack ads). But political analysts and
campaign officials credit those ads with making the races closer
than they otherwise would have been.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans make up 40 percent of the Mississippi district
and 30 percent of the one in Louisiana. Highlighting the importance
of black turnout to the Democratic Party, pleas from Rep. John
Lewis (D-Ga.) and other black politicians are airing on Baton
Rouge's black radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana campaign is typical of the state's colorful
politics.
</P>
<P>
   McKeithen, a 32-year-old attorney in her first campaign, is the
daughter of Republican Secretary of State Fox McKeithen and
granddaughter of former Gov. John McKeithen.
</P>
<P>
   Family features prominently in her campaign, which got an
initial boost from the familiarity of voters with the McKeithen
name.
</P>
<P>
   A anti-abortion Democrat who spoke of the importance of
``Christian morals'' at a recent forum, McKeithen has kept the
incumbent on the defensive through much of the campaign by raising
questions about Baker's ethics, including an allegation that he
used political influence to obtain a scholarship for his daughter
to attend Tulane University. Baker has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The effectiveness of McKeithen's attacks prompted Rep. John
Linder (R-Ga.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee, to label Baker, 50, his top concern among incumbent
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Now, negative ads from both sides fill the airwaves. Recent
salvos from Baker hit McKeithen for not voting in some elections
and hiding the source of her income. She has apoloigized for
missing some votes and released a list of clients.
</P>
<P>
   John Maginnis, editor of a political newsletter in Baton Rouge,
said Baker may still have an edge. ``I'm not sure she is
penetrating beyond the chronic voter,'' Maginnis said. ``Do black
voters have a real reason to go vote? I'm not sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are spending heavily to mobilize their voters, but
must contend with several wild cards that include the possible
indictment of former Democratic Gov. Edwin Edwards and the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Bad weather typically depresses vote totals, and Republicans
generally do better when only the most determined partisans make it
to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Weather and poor turnout also are concerns of Mississippi
Democrats, who hope to take back the seat they held until Rep. Mike
Parker left the Democratic Party for the GOP in 1995. Parker is
retiring.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike McKeithen, Shows is on the receiving end of an onslaught
of negative ads. His campaign grew so worried about Hosemann's
charge that Shows favors gun control that Shows's father, a World
War II veteran, recorded a radio ad refuting the Republican's
assertion.
</P>
<P>
   Shows, 51, an elected state transportation official, asked for
support Thursday from students at Summit's Southwest Mississippi
Community College by noting that his opposition to abortion rights
and gun control ``kind of go against the grain of the national
Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   His populist campaign is aimed at depicting Hosemann as a
wealthy Jackson tax attorney who is out of touch with Shows' native
rural Mississippi. ``I do live in the country; my opponent does
not,'' he told a Western civilization class.
</P>
<P>
   Hosemann, wearing khakis and an open-collared shirt in the
Pentecostal church, also is seeking to cultivate a down-home image,
even though he has spent more than $100,000 of his own money on the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The church's pastor, the Rev. Steve Hancock, introduced him as a
lawyer who has not worked ``to spring criminals out of deserved
lengthy sentences, but who has instead promoted a fair and
equitable system for small businesses and citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The national Republican ad that asks viewers to vote Republican
as a counterweight to Clinton might be expected to resonate among
this region's conservative church-goers. But, in dozens of
interviews in Louisiana and southern Mississippi, the predominant
view of the Clinton sex scandal from Republicans and Democrats was
that voters would not make Democratic candidates atone for
Clinton's sins.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Stockton, a cashier in the community college cafeteria,
condemned Clinton's behavior and the Republican-led impeachment
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did was wrong,'' Stockton said. ``But this is a witch
hunt.''

 By LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Are you going to write that I'm an arrogant guy?'' the real
estate financier Ethan Penner asked a reporter, calling from his
car phone one afternoon in mid-October. ``I mean if you ask a lot
of my close friends, they'll tell you I'm not arrogant at all. It's
just when someone meets me for the first time that they think
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an interesting comment from a man who complained in 1988
that Morgan Stanley had shortchanged him by paying a $550,000 bonus
he had agreed to, instead of the $750,000 to $1 million he thought
he deserved. ``I was grossly underpaid,'' Penner still contends. Or
from a man who was taunted by colleagues at his first job, at a
savings and loan in Orange County, Calif., after boasting that he
could parlay his $12,000-a-year desk post into a $100,000 executive
suite within a year. (He didn't make it.)
</P>
<P>
   But Penner's outsized ambition _ pressed, he acknowledges he is
``borderline arrogant'' _ has colored his career.
</P>
<P>
   He popularized commercial real estate lending on Wall Street,
joining the American brokerage unit of Nomura Securities in 1993
and transforming it into an industry giant. But as quickly as the
markets shifted, so did his fortunes. He resigned in September amid
huge losses at the Capital Company of America, the subsidiary he
ran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a corporate politician,'' Penner said in defense of
his tenure there. ``Every business has its ups and downs.
Politicians manage both, so when the down cycle comes they can live
for another day. That's never been my style.''
</P>
<P>
   Penner, though, will live for another day, too: his almost six
years at Nomura made him rich. He easily earned $125 million over
all at Nomura, doling out $32 billion in commercial loans. To add
to that Nomura gave him an additional $30 million upon walking out
the door _ an exchange for half of the 10 percent in Capital
America shares he has rights to.
</P>
<P>
   Penner can, at times, be charming, surrounding himself with
influential friends. Asked to name a few, he produced a list of 27
names, including A. Alfred Taubman, chairman of Sotheby's Holdings,
and the Knicks star Walt Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   One of those, Steve Scheer, a producer with CBS Sports, grew up
with Penner in Yonkers and has known him 30 years. When Scheer
broke his arm playing basketball as a teen-ager, Penner drove him
to the doctor. ``I know that if anything ever happened to me, my
wife and child would be taken care of,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Penner's troubles with Nomura date back to April 1997. That, he
said, is when he confronted top executives at Nomura Holding
America, the company's United States brokerage unit, and threatened
to quit if the business he ran was not turned into a subsidiary, of
which he would be a part owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an investor who would back me,'' he said, adding that it
would be foolish ``not to let Nomura match that.'' His bosses did
not see the matter so benignly. ``They thought they had a gun to
their head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nomura acquiesced _ the lending business was a cash cow _ but it
drafted more than 25 pages of terms, including a limit of $500
million in equity capitalization for the new subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   It took 14 months to negotiate the spinoff. At that point,
Penner told his bosses that he needed $700 million in equity
capital. Nomura balked, by Penner's own account. (A spokesman for
Nomura said the company would not discuss Penner's employment.)
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Here are the documents,' '' Penner recalled,
describing a meeting in New York on June 29. `` `If you don't
shrink the equity capitalization to $500 million by January of
1999, you lose your job. If you don't sign, then you don't get the
spinoff.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He signed, becoming chief executive of Capital America. But he
still continued to seek outside financing and in mid-July arranged
for executives of Cerberus Partners, a New York-based private
investment fund, to fly to his office in San Francisco to examine
the subsidiary's books, Penner said. Cerberus would not comment.
Still, Nomura executives back in New York did not want a partner.
</P>
<P>
   As it became increasingly clear to Penner that he would be
ousted if he failed to meet Nomura's terms, he began to negotiate
his exit. He gave up management responsibility for the Capital
Company of America, becoming vice chairman in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   His timing was uncanny; within days, the commercial
mortgage-backed securities market collapsed. On Sept. 17, he was
out for good. A month later, Nomura announced a $1.16 billion loss
for the six months ended Sept. 30, attributing most of the deficit
to losses in its mortgage-backed securities business.
</P>
<P>
   In August, the final words playing over the loudspeaker at the
last big party Penner threw for investors was ``It's the End of the
World as We Know It'' by rock band R.E.M. Maybe the band knew
something Penner didn't.

 &HT;    Ex-ambassador to Eritrea denies he was fired
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John F. Hicks, former U.S. ambassador to Eritrea,
denied Friday that President Clinton fired him last year after
complaints from two embassy employees that Hicks made improper
sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Times reported that Clinton fired Hicks, who was
named ambassador in May of 1996, while the president was involved
in what he has called an inappropriate relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, there is no truth to the statement that Mr.
Hicks was fired by President Clinton or anybody else,'' according
to a statement Friday from Kalijarvi, Chuzi &AMP; Newman, the
Washington law firm representing Hicks. ``He resigned from the
State Department for personal reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Contacted at home in Silver Spring, Md., Jacqueline Hicks
declined comment. She said her husband, a career member of the
Foreign Service who grew up in Goldsboro, N.C., was not available.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper quoted the State Department's inspector general as
concluding that ``Ambassador Hicks' behavior was both severe and
pervasive in creating a hostile work environment for these women.
It was unwelcomed, repeated, unsolicited and clearly of a sexual
nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Presidential press secretary Joe Lockhart said the inspector
general transmitted a report on the case to Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright in August 1997. Hicks resigned three weeks
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hicks denied the allegations and was prepared to
vigorously defend himself at an administrative hearing,'' according
to the statement from his lawyers. ``However, Ambassador Hicks
decided to pursue employment opportunities in the private sector
rather than having his family go through the personal indignities
and legal expenses that would result from him defending himself
against these baseless accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, Ambassador Hicks resigned,'' the statement
said. ``His desire then and now is to close this matter and move on
with his life.

<P>
   Ever wish you could get a piece of a major lawsuit? You may have
a chance, in the form of a handful of wildly esoteric securities
that track the outcome of such suits.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, an award is expected next spring from the United
States Court of Claims in Washington in a suit against the federal
government by the Golden State Bancorp, a savings and loan. And
some analysts are rating the suit's related security _ generically
known as a litigation participation certificate _ as a buy.
</P>
<P>
   Such certificates, listed by NASDAQ, grew from the
savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s, when the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board was encouraging healthy savings and loans to buy ailing
ones. The board created an accounting device that allowed the buyer
to list the liabilities of the acquired institution as
``supervisory goodwill.''
 &UR;  &LR;  This could be written off over 35 to 40 years, and during that
time, the write-off would be accounted for as capital, against
which loans could be made.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, however, Congress dissolved the bank board and phased
out the supervisory goodwill. The savings institutions contended
that such a move violated their agreements with the government.
</P>
<P>
   More than 120 breach of contract suits have been filed against
the government by savings institutions seeking restitution and
damages. The lawsuits could ultimately cost taxpayers $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Because pending suits were likely to complicate mergers in the
rapidly consolidating savings-and-loan industry, three of the
institutions _ Golden State, California Federal Bank and Coast
Federal, created special securities to spin off the potential value
of their suits to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Federal has been acquired by Washington Mutual; California
Federal is acquiring Golden State but is keeping the latter's name.
The three institutions have all received summary judgments in their
favor at trial court level. They are are only thrifts to have spun
off such securities, which trade separately.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Chamberlain, an analyst at Jeffries &AMP; Co &UR; . &LR; , said the
Golden State certificates are the blue chips of the group because
an award is so close, though the government is likely to appeal any
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State, which calls its certificates litigation tracking
warrants, is the only company that will pay off in stock, making
the payout nontaxable until the shares are sold. The warrants
closed at &UR;  &LR; $4.875  &UR;  &LR;  on Friday. Ms. Chamberlain says they could pay
off at $11 each if Golden State gets the full $1.9 billion it is
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Coast Federal issued what it calls contingent payment rights,
which pay in cash. They closed on Friday at $9.50. The claims
court, however, has urged Coast and the government to try to reach
a settlement.
 &UR;  &LR;  Barring that, hearings on damages are not likely to begin until
2000, diminishing the present value of the security, said David
Dusenbury, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Coast is
seeking $1.1 billion. Dusenbury puts the pretax cash value at
$24.40 a certificate if a full award was made today.
</P>
<P>
   California Federal's case has not advanced as far as the others.
It has two certificate classes: contingent litigation recovery
participation interests and secondary contingent litigation
recovery participation interests, which will pay off differently
depending on the amount of any award.
</P>
<P>
   They trade at $16.125 and $17.75, respectively, and Ms.
Chamberlain said they would pay off at $48.60 and $70.89,
respectively, if the institution gets the full $1.64 billion it
seeks.
</P>
<P>
   The wait has tired many investors, and the securities are
trading well below their highs. Even so, a favorable award for
Golden State is likely to run up the prices of all of them.

JUDGES SAY SPAIN HAS RIGHT TO PROSECUTE PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Great Britain, France, Italy)  (mk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ In a landmark ruling, an 11-member panel of
senior Spanish judges decided unanimously Friday that Spain has the
legal right to bring criminal charges against Chile's former
dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet, and to seek his extradition from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The judges' decision, which is based on a large body of
international humanitarian law, runs directly counter to a ruling
by the High Court in London.
</P>
<P>
   That court said on Wednesday that Britain had no authority to
arrest the 82-year-old general since, it said, he had immunity for
actions committed while he was head of state. Nonetheless it
ordered that he remain in detention pending an appeal to the House
of Lords. Pinochet was arrested two weeks ago at the request of a
Spanish magistrate while he was on a visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Friday, a sweeping finding that Spain had
jurisdiction over crimes committed by the Chilean and Argentine
dictatorships two decades ago, is without precedent, according to
experts in international law. They said that under international
conventions Spain or any signatory had the right and obligation to
prosecute crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The experts pointed out that several countries have previously
prosecuted crimes, for example Nazi war crimes, which had been
committed outside their territory, but that the countries
invariably tried individuals who were on their soil.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spanish ruling affirms Spain's jurisdiction over a
multitude of crimes against humanity committed over a long period
by people not in Spanish custody. Until now, such ambitious goals
have been pursued only by international tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish decision thus opens the way for Madrid's request for
Pinochet's extradition to face trial here on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture. Friday's ruling may bolster the appeal
pending in Britain against granting the general immunity and
releasing him, by reinforcing Spain's legal case.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Spain's National Court, which is the country's
second- highest tribunal, ends a long struggle between Spain's
conservative government and two independent Spanish magistrates.
For the past two years, the magistrates, responding to the
relatives of victims, have been investigating the torturing and
killing by the Chilean and Argentine dictatorships. But the
government argued that they had no authority to do so and said the
investigations were complicating Spain's diplomatic and commercial
relations with Chile and Argentina. The National Court in Madrid
met to settle the issue of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Following seven hours of public hearings Thursday and four hours
of closed-door deliberations Friday, the 11-judge panel announced
its decision in a tense and crowded courthouse Friday afternoon. As
one of the judges read out that by unanimous decision ``the
jurisdiction of Spain has been confirmed,'' there was an outburst
of applause and sobs of relief from lawyers and relatives of
victims of the South American dictatorships. Some shouted loudly,
``Viva, Viva la Justicia!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a breath of fresh air, a breath of justice, for all
us,'' said Patricia Isaza, a 38-year-old architect from Chile. Ms.
Isaza said she was kidnapped at the age of 16 by Chilean security
and held and tortured for 26 months in a camp known as JIR. ``Even
if Pinochet goes back to Chile, things will not be the same for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Sergio Requena, a 52-year-old Chilean
engineer who was tortured and imprisoned for one year in 1975, said
``the door of justice has opened just a crack.'' He added: ``I hope
that this is the beginning of the end of impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling was announced, some lawyers and human rights
workers rushed to an upper floor of the court building to thank
Baltasar Garzon, the investigating magistrate who set in motion the
investigations into the crimes of the Chilean and Argentine
right-wing regimes. It was Garzon, long seen here as a quixotic
figure, who filed the request that led to Pinochet's arrest in
London Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   European legal experts said the ruling is a strong signal of
encouragement to prosecutors in France, Italy, Sweden and
Switzerland where in recent days relatives of victims of the
Chilean dictatorship have filed suits against Pinochet and several
courts have sought his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said that, even if Britain eventually allows the
former dictator to return home, the Spanish legal system will now
be able to pursue him as well as other senior Chilean and Argentine
military officers through arrest warrants if they travel and by
blocking bank accounts allegedly held in their name in European
cities. Spain could not try any of the suspects in absentia, but
France, for instance, could. France did try Capt. Alfredo Astiz of
the Argentine navy, in absentia, and sentenced him to life in
prison for killing two French nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon had already signed a number of arrest warrants and asked
Switzerland for bank accounts to be blocked. But if the National
Court had said Friday that Spain had no jurisdiction, Garzon would
probably have been forced to annul these steps.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials here said that as long as Pinochet remains in
Britain, Garzon will continue to seek his extradition, for which
the formal request will be filed in the coming days. Two British
government lawyers have been working with Garzon's team over the
past week as it prepares the extradition request for London. The
reason for their assistance, court officials said, is to insure
that the request matches British technical requirements and is not
delayed by bureaucratic complications.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government, though it has been opposed to the
investigations, has said in recent days that it would comply with
whatever the judiciary decided. Spanish lawyers said Friday that,
contrary to earlier reports, the government need not and cannot
approve or disapprove the extradition request, although it could
slow down the necessary paperwork if it so desired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government must now send on the request because it cannot
block it,'' said Diego Lopez Garrido, professor of constitutional
law at the University of Castilla-La Mancha at Albacete.
</P>
<P>
   The National Court in Madrid Friday did not outline the
arguments behind its ruling claiming jurisdiction for Spain. Carlos
Cazon, the judge who made Friday's announcement, said the court
would provide written arguments next week. But court officials said
the ruling was based on Spanish law and on the large body of
international humanitarian law adopted in recent decades, including
the Geneva Conventions and the U.N. conventions against torture and
against genocide. Countries that are parties to these conventions _
such as Britain and Spain _ have the right and the obligation to
pursue crimes against humanity. There is no limit on place or time
in pursuing such crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon has argued that such grave crimes were committed against
civilians in Chile and Argentina. The Argentine military killed or
``disappeared'' more than 10,000 of its political opponents between
1976 and 1983. In Chile, according to a Chilean government report,
more than 4,400 people were killed during Pinochet's rule between
1973 and 1990 and many thousands were imprisoned and tortured. Less
than a dozen cases were brought to trial in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in international law welcomed the Spanish decision. ``We
are seeing a groundswell of support for international humanitarian
law,'' said Graham Blewitt, a senior prosecutor at the tribunal in
the Hague that deals with war crimes in the former Yugoslavia.
``Frankly, this support is very encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Slepoy, an Argentine lawyer who was in Madrid
representing the Argentine Association for Human Rights, also
celebrated the Spanish ruling. ``At last we have heard that the
great violators of human rights can be caught and tried anywhere,''
he told reporters, fighting back tears. ``For years, we read this
in international laws, but the principle was rarely applied. We
waited 22 years to try to achieve justice. We had to come to Spain
to find the beginning of it. Argentina and Chile have been in
hiding. The assassins are still walking in the streets.''

COMMENTARY: DON'T LOOK BACK  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Let the old folks get misty-eyed about John
Glenn's return to space. Here in the self-proclaimed capital of
Silicon Valley _ the true epicenter of science and industry in
America, 1998 _ nostalgia doesn't play. Most of those who run the
high-tech industry that now fires the world and much of its economy
are too young to remember the first Glenn mission. Their scientific
explorations venture into virtual space, not outer space, and their
means of propulsion, the microchip, must be examined through a
microscope, not a telescope. The only prospect of danger comes from
hair-raising gyrations of the Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   There has been a countdown here all week long _ second by second
on the San Jose Mercury News Web site _ but it wasn't for Glenn.
Saturday is the official opening _ the ``plugging in'' _ of The
Tech, a nearly $100 million mango-and-azure downtown showplace for
Silicon Valley's revolutionary accomplishments. The full title of
the place is The Tech Museum of Innovation, but as Peter Giles, its
CEO, explains: ``The word `museum' carries a stigma here. People
really aren't interested in what's come before but in what's
coming.'' To get more than 300 of the valley's high-tech companies
_ from Hewlett-Packard and Intel to Adobe and Infoseek _ to pitch
in, The Tech had to be conceived as an un-museum too busy rushing
toward the future to reflect upon the past.
</P>
<P>
   Only a little history peeks through: A small panel describes the
advent of the first microprocessor in that ancient year of 1974.
Otherwise The Tech aspires to be something new in the run of
science centers and museums. Reflecting the values of a restless,
hypercompetitive industry whose products become outdated almost the
second they are released, it does not expect any of its
``permanent'' exhibits to last more than five years. Reflecting the
gestalt of the people who built and run that industry, it contains
no grandiose monuments to the valley's founding geeks or even any
biographical descriptions of them. In one exhibition area, there's
the facade of a garage _ the prototypical birthplace of Apple and
so many legendary valley start-ups _ but the interactive displays
all celebrate the cult of the chip, not the personality of a
Wozniak or Jobs.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose has passed its neighbor San Francisco in size and is
now the 11th-largest American city; its metropolitan area exports
more goods than those of New York or Detroit. But as a cultural
force, it ranks nowhere near so high. Part of the idea of The Tech
_ which secured $41 million in city redevelopment funds _ is to
anchor a cluster of downtown arts institutions and to make the city
``a destination,'' as the outgoing mayor, Susan Hammer, puts it.
But The Tech is also designed to solve two more practical problems.
It has a huge educational outreach program, aimed at local teachers
and students whose science training has been gutted by Proposition
13. And it hopes to be the area's unofficial visitors' center;
tourists who come to Silicon Valley looking for spectacular sights
in tune with its giant achievements have been baffled to find
mainly office buildings and modest computer history exhibits. Cape
Canaveral it's not.
</P>
<P>
   In my hours exploring The Tech's efforts to fill this vacuum, I
enjoyed touring a mock ``cleanroom'' (where microchips are
fabricated) and using computer software to design my own personal
roller coaster (which I could then take for a virtual ride). The
ethics exhibits _ on phenomena like E-mail privacy and the digital
retouching of news photos on magazine covers _ are unusually tough.
</P>
<P>
   But what most impressed me was how The Tech captures the meeting
of science, commerce and culture of its moment much as the Air and
Space Museum did in the 1970s. ``Start-ups and venture capital
typify the valley more than technology,'' said Giles, as we talked
in The Tech's New Venture Hall. And so what you find here is not
just an explication of the science that is our current new frontier
but the cultural coordinates of all our frontiers: the buzz of
impatient youth, of gold-rush booms and busts, of new immigrant
talent and burgeoning community. In other words, The Tech is a
snapshot of the national idea as it stands at the turn of our
century. See it before these restless American pioneers, like all
those before them, come up with a better idea and tear it down.

IN MICROSOFT CASE, A LOT OF NOT VERY MUCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 1) 
(af) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moore's Law _ which holds that the speed of computing doubles
every 18 months _ is a concept that is hopelessly alien to the
practice of law.
</P>
<P>
   The government's antitrust lawsuit against the Microsoft Corp.
wound up its second week in federal district court in Washington on
Friday, and the case, which was originally expected to be argued in
a month's time, now looks as though it might drag on until close to
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the stock market's response, it does not seem as though
investors think the government has much of a case. Since the trial
began, Microsoft's shares have actually risen slightly, closing at
$105.875 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the case remains a wild card for Microsoft's prospects.
George L. Priest, the John M. Olin Professor of Law and Economics
at Yale Law School, talked about the trial and what it means for
business.
</P>
<P>
   Q. You have no interest in the case beyond that of a
well-informed bystander. What is your take on what has transpired
thus far?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the Justice Department has shown much of
anything yet in the Microsoft case. They have emphasized meetings
and memos that are ambiguous at best. But nothing I have read rules
out the possibility that the Internet Explorer and its integration
into Microsoft Windows is a superior product for consumers than an
unbundled browser, such as Netscape's Navigator. And that has to be
the ultimate standard: What is the impact on consumers? How are
consumers worse off?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It seems the Justice Department is bringing an antitrust case
in an industry whose lifeblood is speed. Even if the government
wins its case, isn't there a risk that competitive conditions in
the business will be far different once a remedy is proposed than
they were when the case was brought?
</P>
<P>
   A. The case will be obsolete by the time it is settled unless
the judge rules for the government and slaps some kind of
injunction on Microsoft. That would be unfortunate for consumers,
the economy and the world.
</P>
<P>
   One of the problems is that most of our antitrust law has been
developed in the context of manufacturing, where if a firm has a
very large market share we know it will take a long time to erode,
because of the costs of getting into the market.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not U.S. Steel, whose monopoly took 30 years to
erode. This is an industry where market share can be overturned in
a very short period.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What sort of remedy do you think might be imposed if the
government wins?
</P>
<P>
   A. If the judge puts a limitation on the Microsoft browser, and
tells them to unbundle it, that is not so important. It is not a
clear gain for consumers, but it will not dramatically affect the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, anyone with the mildest level of computer
sophistication can download Netscape's Navigator within a matter of
minutes. It can't be an important restraint of trade to exclude
Navigator when you can get it off the Internet that quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What if the court ordered a breakup of Microsoft?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think Microsoft can be broken up. This is not a
company with different plants. What are you going to do, put
partitions in the halls of Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond,
Wash.? The notion of breaking up Microsoft is lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Still, might a victory over Microsoft embolden the government
to take on other high-technology companies?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think the industry will be thrown into a tizzy if
Microsoft loses, if only because Justice does not have the
prosecutorial resources to bring massive numbers of suits.
</P>
<P>
   This is not like the 1960s and 1970s, when the Warren Court
began issuing decisions that effectively agreed with everything
Justice brought before them. That type of authority did have a
substantial impact on all industrial development in the United
States, and it was only in the 1980s and 1990s that that sort of
thrust has been reversed. I don't think that is going to happen
here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The Microsoft case is capturing the headlines, but the
government recently brought an antitrust suit against Mastercard
and Visa. Is this the start of a new period of activism by Justice
in antitrust?
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know why Justice has gotten more active. It is
unfortunate that it seems more activist on the behalf of individual
firms that at the moment are not doing as well as their competitors
in the marketplace, be they American Express in the Mastercard/Visa
case or Netscape Communications in the Microsoft action.
</P>
<P>
   I am a strong supporter of antitrust law, as a general matter.
But given the increased level of competition in the world, we are
going to need fewer antitrust cases.
</P>
<P>
   Monopolization will become less relevant because of the
possibilities of entry into a given market. We have fewer trade
restrictions now, and that allows foreign companies to enter and
compete if there is even a threat of dominance.

 &HT;    Glenn gives video report on experiments
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Sen. John Glenn reported from space
Friday that he has adjusted easily to weightlessness. Then, as if
to prove he was feeling himself, he used a video uplink to once
again talk up the scientific purpose on his flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is right on the timeline so far,'' Glenn said while
holding himself in place with his arm against a middeck bulkhead,
``and we just want to keep it that way and make sure we get back
all the good results we thought we'd get on all the research
experiments that are on board because that's the main reason we're
up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being named to the shuttle crew last January, Glenn has
pushed relentlessly to focus the limelight on Discovery's
scientific payload and away from his historic return to space after
36 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday's free-floating effort once again faced stiff
competition from the awesome vision of a 77-year-old man reliving
an expanded version of the achievement that secured his place among
America's pioneering heroes. As happened throughout the eight
months of training for the flight, joyful reminiscences from an
icon of an inspiring era crept into the practicalities.
</P>
<P>
   Like the nighttime pass over a luminescent Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long time ago that I looked at the same thing and it
looks beautiful,'' Glenn said as the space shuttle flew 340 miles
above the earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the year of Glenn's first orbital flight, the people of
Perth burned every light in their coastal city so he would see it
as he passed over. Some even staked white sheets to their lawns to
reflect the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights show up very well and thank everybody for turning
them on, will you?'' Glenn said during that original flight.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the first full day in orbit, after Thursday's launch,
which Glenn called a ``great ride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was keyed in with every little noise and quiver we made on
the way up,'' he said. ``It was quite different from the ride I got
before, of course, a long time ago...''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn said he did not go through the period of nausea that is
common for astronauts adjusting to weightlessness, although he
worried that he would. Although he's never been prone to getting
air sick, Glenn has been vulnerable to seasickness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Glenn could only loosen the straps of his seat in the
capsule, so he didn't experience weightlessness then the way he has
now.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the personal side of it, to be able float around like this
in zero g,'' he said, ``I just wish everyone could experience
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last time, Glenn flew for just under five hours, the primary
purpose being to prove it could be done.
</P>
<P>
   His current mission will have him in space for nine days. He
returns next Saturday, and this trip he has a lot more to do.
</P>
<P>
   But with all of the shuttle's tasks well on schedule _ in fact,
some things were activated early _ the only on-board problem
reported so far (aside from the loss of the door to the dragchute
compartment) was a mishap with his oatmeal as he dealt with
floating foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One little speck wound up on my glasses,'' Glenn said,
smiling. ``I guess with old folks you normally think it goes down
on an old man's necktie, but on this one it went up on my
glasses.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The World of Coca-Cola, which on the cultural scale
falls somewhere between legitimate museum and Disney-style
extravaganza, is one of M. Douglas Ivester's hangouts. Once a month
or so, he likes to pop in, gaze at the exhibits of Coke ephemera
and eavesdrop on the tourists crowded around.
</P>
<P>
   The other day he spied a jukebox, punched up a bouncy 1930s
tune, the ``Coca-Cola March,'' and lingered for a moment to listen.
``Doesn't it just make you want to get a flag and march,'' he
asked, ``and then go attack the world?''
</P>
<P>
   For Coca-Cola Co., attacking the world _ with or without musical
accompaniment _ has become a lot harder lately. Just one year into
his tenure as chairman and chief executive, Ivester finds himself
leading Coke through extraordinarily bleak times.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have shriveled in miserable synchrony with the collapse of
the Russian ruble, the continued economic morass in Japan, worries
about an impending monetary crisis in Brazil and an assortment of
other ills _ even bad weather in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Gloom would have every reason to prevail in the corporate world
of Coca-Cola, a company that gathers 75 percent of its profits
outside the United States and is the archetype of the U.S.
multinational corporations that rode the '90s promise of an
ever-expanding global economy directly into investors' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   But if others confronting today's economic woes seem befuddled _
think of the International Monetary Fund, this or that central
banker, the hobbled gurus of the hedge fund business _ Ivester and
his fellow Coke executives exhibit an almost surreal confidence. It
is perhaps a byproduct of so many years spent selling a
high-fructose, caramel-colored beverage that, by most measures,
people can live without.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Ivester about the inhospitable global atmosphere, and you
might soon wonder why you even brought it up. Crisis? What crisis?
By his definition, it's business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a changed environment for people of a certain age,''
he said, referring to the generation of business people who have
only known the 1990s expansion. ``But for the Coca-Cola Company,
it's nothing new. We've worked in these environments for years. We
go to a country to stay. We don't go to a country for the good
times.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, said Ivester, who is 51 and joined Coke 19 years ago,
Coke is adept at wringing profits out of its most remote operations
_ patches of jungle or desert, remote islands and other spots he
calls ``upcountry.'' With a touch of scorn, he added: ``Eighty-five
percent of the places we do business in are tough, and they've
always been tough. A lot of companies rushed in and got some of the
cream that was rising to the top.''
</P>
<P>
   It's brave talk. But can Coca-Cola weather so many simultaneous
flare-ups when it is so dependent on overseas earnings? Is its bet
on global growth so big as to be too risky? Does the situation
spell extended weakness for company earnings?
</P>
<P>
   Coke itself is making no predictions beyond the fourth quarter
of this year, when it has said earnings will be down compared with
the comparable period in 1997. And this comes on the heels of a
third quarter in which earnings were down 12.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Investors are offering a tentative vote of confidence. With the
encouragement of analysts who were impressed by Ivester's calm
demeanor in delivering his earnings warning at a meeting in late
September, they have bid the stock up from a low of $53.6875. It
closed Friday at $67.5625, still 24 percent off its mid-July high
of $88.9375.
</P>
<P>
   But the market is not always a shrewd judge when it is
infatuated with a stock; sometimes, a rally can lead into a bear
trap. Given Ivester's talking down of expectations for the rest of
the year, investors are paying a price-to-earnings multiple of 46
for the company.
</P>
<P>
   The risks for companies like Coke are ``becoming clearer,'' said
Leah Modigliani, an equity strategist for Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, ``but they were really there before as well.'' Coca-Cola
and other global consumer marketers like Procter &AMP; Gamble and
Gillette may be great companies, she said, but sometimes, ``great
companies shouldn't really be confused with great stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In Coke's favor are its management, deep with people who have
broad international business experience, and its deep pockets,
which allow it to invest heavily at any time. Working against it
are the global uncertainty that continues to preoccupy investors
and the question of whether the company will need to spend abnormal
amounts to generate the growth that impresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since they've had to manage through this
much turmoil on such a broad-based scale,'' said Doug Lane, a
beverage analyst for Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Ivester has the added burden of replacing a legend: the genteel,
Cuban-born Roberto Goizueta, who died of complications from lung
cancer in October 1997. Goizueta was revered by almost everyone who
holds even a splinter of Coke stock for his relentless focus on
shareholder value. During his 16-year tenure as chief executive,
the company's book value mushroomed from $4.3 billion to $147
billion, attracting such august investors as Warren E. Buffett and
anointing new millionaires all over Atlanta and the red-clay
country beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the leadership transition was all but seamless, largely
because Ivester, as company president and Goizueta confidant, had
been integrally involved in top-level decisions for a long time.
Among other things, he was the architect of the spinoff and
consolidation of Coca-Cola's bottlers that did wonders for the
parent company's balance sheet, moving off debt and stoking
profits.
</P>
<P>
   A man whose posture and stride bring to mind those polar bears
featured in so many Coke commercials, Ivester seems to have
blossomed in his new role, exuding a certain charm where he was
once the numbers man hovering in the background.
</P>
<P>
   But he now stands alone at the top _ he has purposely avoided
naming a No. 2 _ and Coke's numbers are certainly off. Sales volume
worldwide rose by only 3 percent in the three months ending Sept.
30, compared with 11 percent in the period a year earlier. And he
acknowledged being surprised at the speed with which the global
situation unraveled. ``I don't think you anticipate these sorts of
things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, analysts say, Coke has used its considerable
capital to ride out financial traumas _ the devaluing of the
Mexican peso in 1994, for example _ while smaller competitors
retreated or even failed.
</P>
<P>
   But now, with so many problems on so many fronts, the company
has kicked into higher gear. There are meetings each week about
Germany, Coke's third-biggest market, where concerns include
currency value and bottling efficiency as well as the weather, and
every six weeks about Japan, second only to the United States in
generating profits.
</P>
<P>
   In Indonesia, where sales have fallen by double digits as the
economy has tumbled into depression, Coke is trying a returnable
glass 6-ounce bottle _ a low-cost size _ in hopes of spurring a
rebound. A car sweepstakes in Germany and coupons on 2-liter
bottles in Russia are other strategies in a global effort to
improve volume.
</P>
<P>
   With so many consumers chastened, though, Coke faces an uphill
fight. In Brazil, cheaper second-tier brands known as ``Tubainas''
are cutting into Coke's market share. ``Coke is much better, but
too expensive,'' said Terezinha Barros Neves, a housekeeper from
Rio de Janeiro.

IMF DELAYS RUSSIAN BAILOUT PACKAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ When Russia's leaders unveil their long-awaited plan to
tackle their country's economic crisis Saturday, they will do so
knowing international lenders have refused to back the blueprint
with much-needed cash.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who Kremlin aides acknowledge
has replaced ailing President Boris Yeltsin as Russia's de facto
day-to-day leader, may have been hoping for a multibillion-dollar
boost from the International Monetary Fund for Russia's empty
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF, which has said it will not release new funds until
it sees a feasable plan, wrapped up talks in Moscow Friday with no
new agreement and without setting a date for new talks. The IMF
postponed a $4.3 billion payment of a $22.6 billion rescue package
after Russia allowed the ruble to devalue and defaulted on $40
billion of its domestic debt in August, sending the economy into a
nosedive.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there was a common view on the desirable objectives for
economic policy through the end of next year, the necessary policy
measures are still under consideration,'' it said in a statement.
The statement said the IMF was ready to return to Moscow later for
further talks, and suggested one thing Russia should do is draw up
a ``realistic budget'' for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Primakov government was counting on the cash to help pay off
wages that were in arrears and late pensions, and also meet some
$2.5 billion in foreign debt payments by the end of the year.
Cabinet officials have said the government may need to resort to
inflationary printing of money to pay its debts.
</P>
<P>
   Drafts of Primakov's plans have been leaked to the press,
although an official at the Economics Ministry said none of the
plans that have been published are the final draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``In reality, there is no plan, just a bunch of declarations,''
said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``It will
soon be clear that none of these measures are possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the documents leaked to the Russian press stipulate
greater state intervention in the economy, with tax breaks for
industry, increased benefits and social spending. Russian news
agencies last night reported that the program calls for stabilizing
the ruble, restructuring Russia's domestic debts and keeping
inflation to within 20-30 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
   The Interfax news agency said the IMF delegation had criticized
the Primakov plan for increasing spending without increasing
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also criticized a plan to bail out 15 of the country's
largest banks, which found themselves short of funds when the ruble
crashed in August. The plan, which would classify banks in order to
decide which were strongest and deserved to be saved, would be
susceptible to the kind of favoritism that allowed Russia's poorly
managed banks to grow in the first place. Interfax said a similar
criticism was made of heavy government involvement in restructuring
of industry.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of increased state involvement say the IMF has no
right to criticize Russia. On Friday, Moscow's populist Mayor Yury
Luzhkov, a potential candidate to one day replace Yeltsin, lashed
out at the IMF for supporting the previous governments, whose
dependence on high-yield, short-term treasury bills for financing
led to the Augsut default.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in the West did anything to stop the criminal actions
of the Russian government in forming financial pyramids,'' Luzhkov
commented.
</P>
<P>
   Few members of Primakov's government will sympathize with the
IMF's call for Russia to balance its budget by cutting federal
spending.
</P>
<P>
   After years of hardship in the name of market reforms, Russians
are not likely to approve of more belt-tightening or the IMF's
appeal for cuts in the number of federal employees and military
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has also argued against the popular idea of reducing
taxes _ at least until Russia does something about streamlining its
system and improving compliance. Tax collection fell off again in
September, something not helped by the willingness of the
government's new tax inspector, Georgy Boos, to accept barter
payments instead of cash from big tax debtors like the gas monopoly
Gasprom, another practice frowned on by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, Boos on Friday said the government had hauled in
one-third more taxes in October than in September, or $812 million
compared with $581 million last month. Boos said that was well over
his October target of $593 million, but he did not explain the
surprising improvement.
</P>
<P>
   More good news came from another top government official, Deputy
Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, who said Russia has come to
``mutually acceptable'' terms with holders of the country's
defaulted treasury debt, The Associated Press reported. Kasyanov
said he expected a final agreement next week. Russia needs to reach
a deal before Nov. 17, when its self-imposed three-month debt
moratorium is lifted, or else foreign banks may move to freeze the
accounts of Russian banks abroad.

 NEW YORK: de Janeiro.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One analyst, Laura Meizler of Salomon Smith Barney, points to
``actual declines in core Coca-Cola products'' in Brazil, adding:
``You will see an even bigger decline in the fourth quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   In Venezuela, Coke's anchor bottler, Panamco, has lost market
share over the last year to Pepsico, which recently started an
aggressive discounting program, Ms. Meizler added.
</P>
<P>
   Coke is reeling in costs wherever it can, from postponing
training programs to reducing work by outside contractors. Its
bottlers in Japan are being pushed into collaboration: instead of
producing every Coca-Cola product, each will specialize in a few
products and sell them across a wider region. Analysts say the plan
has met with considerable resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When times are good, you don't think about these things,''
said Douglas N. Daft, Coke's group president for Asia and the
Middle East. ``Boy, have I practiced everything I've ever
learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Day to day, Ivester counsels Coke executives around the globe,
whom he and others describe as depressed. Don't cancel the
Christmas party, he told one manager; it would send the wrong
message. Don't take problems like the Russian economic situation
personally; instead, he advises his deputies, look for opportunity
in the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost immediately, I started saying, `Let's capitalize on
this,' '' Ivester said.
</P>
<P>
   His fundamental tactic is to encourage his troops to share a
mindset that posits the company working its way through the current
mess and, ultimately, coming out ahead. It is a philosophy that
seems rooted in his childhood on the fringes of Gainesville, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   He was an only child, and his parents, both factory workers,
gave him ``as much opportunity as they could,'' he said. They also
gave him their undivided attention, he added, pressuring him to
succeed in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father's point of view was, if they gave A-pluses and you
didn't have all A-pluses, you weren't all the way there,'' said
Ivester, who remains close to his parents _ and motivated to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mindset to me is setting a destination,'' Ivester said. ``It's
not a matter of if we're going to get there. It's a matter of when.
I've been that way my entire life.''
</P>
<P>
   He works seven days a week, often long into the night. His
travel schedule is exhausting, too. He has visited 19 countries
since the beginning of the year, making seven stops during one
11-day trip in September.
</P>
<P>
   Even outings to the supermarket are research missions: Ivester
will often stand at the end of the checkout lane to see what
beverages people are buying. Overseas, he has been known to peer
into trash baskets to see how people are spending their snack
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not in the ivory tower,'' says Andrew Conway, a beverage
analyst for Morgan Stanley. ``He is out in the field.'' (Sometimes,
in fact, he can be seen driving himself to the field in his bright
red Porsche.)
</P>
<P>
   All of Ivester's deputies have learned, sometimes the hard way,
that voice mail is the boss' favorite form of communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any relevant data on something, I leave him a
message on it,'' said Daft, ``four times a day, minimum, when I'm
in Atlanta and five or six times a day when I'm traveling.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft once thought he could travel without so much contact with
Ivester. The first time he didn't check in for several days,
Ivester called to say, ``I was really worried about you.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Ivester's current worry is about how to expand
the business. At a billion servings of Coke-owned drinks a day, it
simply is not big enough for him. He likes to point out that people
around the world are consuming 47 billion other drinks that aren't
Coke _ every day. It's that mindset business again.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Frenette, who became Coke's director of marketing in
May, said: ``There is a fundamental belief in this company that we
have unlimited potential as far as anyone can see or imagine. It's
simply our job to figure out how to remove the barriers to that
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Stahl, the Coke group president who oversees business in
the United States and Canada, added, ``I've never heard Doug say
`I'm satisfied.''' Recently, Stahl got a bottler to increase his
sales growth projections to 12 percent a year, from 3 percent. He
said that when he proudly reported that to Ivester, the response
was, ``Twelve percent? That's really just a mindset, isn't it?'' It
was clear that 24 percent would have been better.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors have a special place in the Coke mindset. Inside
Coke headquarters, no one refers by name to Pepsi-Cola; instead,
it's ``P-cola'' or ``P-company.'' And when asked about the
competition, Coke executives routinely refer to the power of their
own brands, not the threat from someone else's.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much evidence that they do care. Last June, at the
Atlanta hotel where Coke was conducting a meeting for money
managers and analysts, one attendee was amused by the spectacle of
the room-service staff scrambling to remove bags of Frito-Lay
snacks _ made by Pepsico, Pepsi's parent _ from the mini-bars.
</P>
<P>
   Coke, like any other major soft-drink company, would rather have
its own products in every nook and cranny _ to the exclusion of
others, when possible. The practice of obtaining exclusive
distribution rights, is at the center of a federal lawsuit Pepsico
filed earlier this year against Coca-Cola, contending that Coke
used its considerable leverage to force food-service distributors
to drop Pepsi fountain products. Coke officials say the lawsuit is
groundless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug's mission is to place that stuff in every conceivable
market and to convince people that they should drink it,'' said Tom
Pirko, a New York-based consultant who works with Coke and other
soft-drink companies. ``There's a belief system there that they are
doing the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Global Depression could certainly challenge the mindset. And the
economics of Coca-Cola's business could be roiled by a proposed
rule change by the Financial Accounting Standards Board that, if
enacted, might force the company to reabsorb billions of dollars in
debt that is now on the books of major bottlers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Coca-Cola's board offers a vote of confidence in the people
it has put in charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coke and other businesses are being affected by the rolling
movement of the Asian flu,'' said Donald McHenry, a former U.S.
ambassador to the United Nations and a Coke director since 1981.
``All companies are going to have to react and adapt their plans,
and Coke is no different.'' Coke, he added, is ``in very good
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a close encounter with Coke's inner circle leaves the
impression that the chief executive thinks the outside world simply
needs to follow his example.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drink water occasionally,'' Ivester said when asked what
else was on his personal beverage list. Then he said softly, almost
under his breath, ``Why would you drink anything other than a Coke
product?''

WARREN BUFFETT: INVESTOR WITH ZEAL FOR COKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Nov. 1) 
(sidebar with COKE-IVESTER) 
(bl) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The global picture may be unsettling, but Warren Buffett, whose
Berkshire Hathaway Inc. controls about 200 million shares of
Coca-Cola, says Coke's business will keep rolling along.
</P>
<P>
   ``In given countries at given times there will be hiccups,''
Buffett, a Coca-Cola director since 1989, said in a telephone
interview Thursday from his office in Omaha, Neb. ``But that
doesn't take your eye off where you want to be 10 or 15 years from
now, which is to have everybody drinking nothing but Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of Buffett's investing strategy is to find corporate
executives in whom he has deep faith and then stick by them for the
long haul. ``The top guy does set the tone for the way the people
down the chain behave,'' Buffett said. ``If the top guy is thinking
about his golf game, the other guys start thinking about their golf
game.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't a problem at Coke. Buffett was a big believer in
Roberto Goizueta, the company's late chief executive, and he says
he believes in Goizueta's successor, M. Douglas Ivester.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen him in action a long time, and he's got a burning
passion about the company,'' Buffett said. ``It's a mission with
him. He can't control exchange rates, and he can't control the
domestic economy of a country. But if you keep pouring it on,
people are always going to get thirsty, and there are always going
to be more people who want to buy your product.''
</P>
<P>
   Coke's pricing, near ubiquitous availability and generally
positive image all work in the company's favor, too, Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Buffett and Ivester have teamed up to do their part on
the ubiquity front.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Buffett went out with his grandson for pizza at an
Omaha restaurant and discovered that the place served Pepsi, not
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mentioned it to Atlanta, and World War III broke out,''
Buffett said. ``They're now serving Coke.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I don't think Doug sleeps at night if that one pizza
parlor in Omaha isn't selling Coke.'' &QL;

AD PROMPTS SALEM'S NEO-WITCHES TO MULL PARTICIPATION IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication notice: also sent with `a' code) 
(bl) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Mass. _ Every once in a while, a political campaign comes
along that offers evidence that a particular group, whether
professional, religious or geographic, has become influential and
must be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   But could the campaign of Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci, a
Republican seeking a full term as governor, herald the arrival of
witches as a political force?
</P>
<P>
   The question follows an unusual outcry this month against a
television advertisement run by Cellucci's campaign. The
advertisement, which attacked the professional ``priorities'' of
Cellucci's Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Paul
Harshbarger, included a segment featuring a black-hatted,
green-faced crone, while an announcer said that Harshbarger once
threatened to prosecute a Christian group that had allegedly
harassed Salem's modern-day witches, members of a broad,
``neo-Pagan'' tradition called Wicca.
</P>
<P>
   After the commercial aired, a number of witches _ who say they
practice a peaceful, nature-centered religion unrelated to devil
worship _ telephoned the Cellucci campaign to complain that the ad
played to stereotype and indirectly made light of an incident they
recall as threatening.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, some staged a rally in Boston, during a debate
between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement ``was insulting,'' said Amy (Gypsy) Ravish,
proprietor of the Nu Aeon bookstore, a high priestess and a member
of the Council of Elders of the Temple of Nine Wells, a Wiccan
group. Laurie Cabot, proprietor of The Cat, the Crow &AMP; the Crown,
denounced the advertisement, but said it had brought witches
together.
</P>
<P>

   The league's chairwoman, Cheryl Sulyma-Masson, a veterinary
technician in Rehoboth, said that after she complained to the

<P>
   Some local witches have formed a ``Witches' Education Bureau,''
to answer questions from the curious. It publishes a flyer saying
witchcraft's essential law is, ``Do as you will and harm no living

reincarnation, but not in a devil, and declaring that flying
broomsticks are imaginary but would be nice ``at rush hour.''

<P>
   Oct. 31, Halloween to most Americans, is the day that witches
call Samhain, a New Year's festival that honors the dead.
</P>
<P>
   John K. Simmons, a professor of American religion at the
University of Western Illinois, said the number of people in the
many, diverse Wiccan groups is not known, but it is growing, aided
by a focus on nature and openness to women's leadership, which
strike receptive chords in a culture where environmentalism and
feminism are important to many.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, witchcraft can still attract hostility, even in Salem.
In June 1992, some Wiccans complained to police that they had been
harassed by a visiting conservative Christian group. Harshbarger
wrote a letter warning the group it could face prosecution for
civil rights violations if it returned.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cellucci advertisement, which debuted Oct. 15, the
announcer said Harshbarger had ``made his priorities crystal
clear,'' in part because ``he threatened prosecution on behalf of
the witches of Salem.'' (Among other things, the ad showed a Santa
Claus figure and said the attorney general barred Christmas
decorations from his office. A spokesman for Harshbarger said he
asked employees not to hang decorations in the office's common
areas.)
</P>
<P>
   Andy Antrobus, a Cellucci campaign spokesman, said the
advertisement was no longer airing, because it had run its course.
``We're talking about our opponent's professional record, not
anything else,'' he said. As for the witches' response, he said,
``It really didn't amount to a whole lot more than a day of phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not every witch in Salem was upset. Jennifer Williams,
who described herself as a solitary practitioner and ``not a member
of any coven,'' said, ``The Wiccan community reacts too strongly to
this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice? ``It's like, relax, lighten up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But others like Teri Kalgren, proprietor of an organic herb
shop, took the matter more seriously. ``There are 2,000 of us on
the North Shore,'' she said. If they all voted, she said,
politicians might take note.
</P>
<P>
   But she said many witches had not registered. ``A lot of people
who come into witchcraft are tired of the mainstream,'' she said.

AD PROMPTS SALEM'S NEO-WITCHES TO MULL PARTICIPATION IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (duplication notice: also sent with `p' code)

<P>
   SALEM, Mass. _ Every once in a while, a political campaign comes
along that offers evidence that a particular group, whether
professional, religious or geographic, has become influential and
must be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   But could the campaign of Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci, a
Republican seeking a full term as governor, herald the arrival of
witches as a political force?
</P>
<P>
   The question follows an unusual outcry this month against a
television advertisement run by Cellucci's campaign. The
advertisement, which attacked the professional ``priorities'' of
Cellucci's Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Paul
Harshbarger, included a segment featuring a black-hatted,
green-faced crone, while an announcer said that Harshbarger once
threatened to prosecute a Christian group that had allegedly
harassed Salem's modern-day witches, members of a broad,
``neo-Pagan'' tradition called Wicca.
</P>
<P>
   After the commercial aired, a number of witches _ who say they
practice a peaceful, nature-centered religion unrelated to devil
worship _ telephoned the Cellucci campaign to complain that the ad
played to stereotype and indirectly made light of an incident they
recall as threatening.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, some staged a rally in Boston, during a debate
between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement ``was insulting,'' said Amy (Gypsy) Ravish,
proprietor of the Nu Aeon bookstore, a high priestess and a member
of the Council of Elders of the Temple of Nine Wells, a Wiccan
group. Laurie Cabot, proprietor of The Cat, the Crow &AMP; the Crown,
denounced the advertisement, but said it had brought witches
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Cellucci, we have a common issue,'' said Ms. Cabot,
author of four books on witchcraft and founder of the non-profit
Witches League for Public Awareness, whose mission is ``correcting

INVESTING WITH WILLIAM OATES OF NORTHEAST INVESTORS GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (ART ADV: Graphic of facts on Northeast Investors Growth is being
sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make individual
purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.) 
(For release Sunday, Nov. 1) 
(af) 
 By WILLIAM R. LONG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the past 26 years, William A. Oates Jr. has picked his
stocks from the same 10th floor office at 50 Congress Street, in
the heart of Boston's historic financial district.
</P>
<P>
   The holdings in his Northeast Investors Growth fund are almost
always proven, successful companies, often with blue-chip
pedigrees. Many people might call his approach to investing
old-fashioned or stodgy, even unsophisticated. But he calls it
plain old common sense.
</P>
<P>
   Oates, 56, doesn't use computerized screens or so-called
black-box models to crunch the numbers. He employs no analysts to
crank out fundamental research and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would come up with lots of ideas that I wouldn't listen
to anyway,'' said Oates, displaying his independent side. ``I'm not
going to do what a 30-year-old Harvard business school graduate
suggests, because I know more.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing he knows is to invest in stocks he is familiar with.
``I'm looking for something I understand, that has a good track
record, that has the potential to grow on a steady, understandable
basis, and through that growth produce value over time.''
</P>
<P>
   That has led Oates to banks as well as to big technology, drug
and media companies. His top 10 holdings are Mellon Bank,
BankBoston, Pfizer, Microsoft, Time Warner, Warner-Lambert, Walt
Disney, Zions Bancorporation, General Electric and Merck.
</P>
<P>
   Investors should be forewarned that Oates is not afraid to be
out of fashion. He recalls how the fund, which was started in 1980,
languished from 1993 to 1994, during a particularly rough period
for blue chips.
</P>
<P>
   And Northeast suffered during the recent market selloff, which
punished financial stocks. From the market's peak on July 17
through Oct. 23, the fund lost 13.8 percent, versus a loss of 11.6
percent for its peer group of large-capitalization blend funds,
according to Morningstar Inc., the financial publisher. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index lost 9.4 percent over that
period.
</P>
<P>
   Oates does not make big changes in his fund if he believes in
the stocks. ``My horizon is long-term,'' he said. ``I want to make
money over time.'' Turnover is 16 percent, versus a 64 percent
average for its peer group, Morningstar said.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' buy-and-hold disposition often leads to superior results.
For the three-year period ended Oct. 23, the fund returned 25.6
percent, annualized, compared with 19.3 percent for its peer group
and 25.1 percent for the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of his independent style, one of his few sales this
year was General Re, the giant re-insurance company being acquired
by Berkshire Hathaway for stock valued at $22 billion at the time
of its announcement on June 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sold it because I'm one of these guys that doesn't believe
in Warren Buffett,'' Oates said, referring to Berkshire's chief
executive. ``I think he's a cult, and I think that Berkshire
Hathaway is overvalued.'' General Re closed at $220 on Friday,
above the $213, or so, at which he sold most of his shares.
</P>
<P>
   That does not keep Oates from owning two of Buffett's favorite
holdings. The first is Gillette, which Oates likes despite the
panning it has received from some analysts since the launch of its
new triple-blade razor, the Mach 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great company,'' he said, ``but, you know, the
little rabbits on Wall Street going around, they say, `Gee, this
blade isn't selling.' I say, `Here's a company that's down about 25
percent, it's a market leader, it has an exciting new product,
great pricing flexibility, and currently is out of favor.' And I
say `Let's buy more.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Despite gloomy Wall Street assessments of the blade, ``Gillette
says it's doing just fine,'' Oates said. ``I think it is a superior
shave.'' Gillette stock closed on Friday at $45.0625, off 28
percent from its 52-week high of $62.65625.
</P>
<P>
   Oates does not calculate target prices for his stocks, but he
predicted that Gillette's earnings growth would be 15 percent to 16
percent a year over the next year or two and that the stock price
would eventually follow.
</P>
<P>
   Another Buffett holding that Oates likes, despite a slump in its
price, is Disney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's down on Disney,'' he said, citing predictions that
the company's theme parks might have lower traffic, among other
reasons. ``I think it is a premier entertainment company; I think
Mickey Mouse is known throughout the world. Their theme parks are
part of Americana; they have a fabulous ability to produce things _
apparel, hats _ and a fabulous ability to produce movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock closed at $26.9375 on Friday, down 37 percent from its
52-week high of $42.796875. He estimated 1999 earnings growth ``in
the neighborhood of 15 to 19 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oates does not buy only blue chips. One favorite sector is
regional banks, accounting for 20 percent of the fund's holdings.
While the market has punished bank stocks in recent months, he said
``common sense'' determined that he add to his positions. ``When
you get a really good company and it's down 25 or 30 percent, and
the fundamentals are basically the same and you've got some extra
cash, then why wouldn't you buy a little more?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He said recent decreases in interest rates should not hurt bank
earnings, ``because their cost of money is lower.'' The regionals
are largely untouched by the Asian crisis, and some are likely
targets for takeovers by national banks. And a healthy regional
bank can reflect a robust regional economy, like that of the
Mountain States.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Utah-based Zions, the fund's No. 8 holding, account
for 2.6 percent of assets. Oates said Utah's population is growing,
the bank is expanding, and ``these people have a very good
long-term record.'' He predicted future earnings growth of 13
percent to 14 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has owned Zions stock for at least a decade and has an
average cost of about $30 a share, he said. It closed on Friday at
$53.0625.

BUDROYALE FAVORED IN CAL CUP CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>

By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ Budroyale is the new, 8-5 favorite for the $250,000
California Cup Classic, highlight of the 10-race card today that
showcases the state's breeding industry.
</P>
<P>
   Cavonnier was the 9-5 favorite on the morning line before being
scratched Thursday because of a hind-leg injury, delaying the 1996
Santa Anita Derby winner's comeback from a nearly 2{-year layoff. A
field of six remains.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale, a 5-year-old gelding ridden by Garrett Gomez, has won
7 of 12 starts at Santa Anita. Trainer Ted West hopes the son of
Cee's Tizzy will get the lead early in the 1[-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears he has a chance to go 46 (seconds) and change on
the lead, and that will definitely help him,'' West said.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale, whose biggest victory came in the San Bernardino
Handicap in April, finished second in the Pomona Handicap at
Fairplex Park last time out as winner Score Quick got loose on the
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificbounty (Eddie Delahoussaye riding) is second on the
Classic morning line at 5-2, followed by 3-1 Bagshot (Alex Solis),
9-2 Kingdom Found (Kent Desormeaux), 8-1 Mateo (David Flores) and
20-1 Funny Tale (Gary Stevens).
</P>
<P>
   The Cal Cup is a nine-year-old event that features a Breeders'
Cup-style array of races for both genders and all specialties but
is restricted to Cal-bred horses. The purses total $1.2 million.
First post is at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Large, competitive fields are the rule, though there are two
deservedly heavy favorites today, 4-5 Magical Allure (unbeaten in
six starts) in the Matron and 7-5 Controlled (unbeaten in three
starts) in the Juvenile Fillies.
</P>
<P>
   Pick-six players will chase a pool guaranteed by the Oak Tree
Racing Association to total at least $2 million.

ACTOR TOMMY LEE JONES SCRAPED, BRUISED AFTER FALL FROM POLO PONY 
 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Academy Award-winning actor Tommy Lee Jones, scraped
and bruised in a fall from a polo pony, was airlifted to Hermann
Hospital Friday afternoon from a ranch in San Felipe, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing quite well,'' said Dr. Drue N. Ware, in a taciturn
description of the 52-year-old actor's injuries. ``He has multiple
contusions but no neurologic impairment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Jones had suffered some bruises, a few scrapes and may
have even lost consciousness briefly after falling from his horse
about 2 p.m. Ware said Jones would stay in the hospital overnight
and might be released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The actor underwent a physical examination and several X-rays to
determine the extent of his injuries, Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, an avid polo player, was competing in a match at Estancia
Del Pueblo Viejo, a private polo club about 45 miles west of
Houston. His horse was galloping downfield when it stumbled,
throwing Jones in front of it and stepping on him, his publicist,
Jennifer Allen, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing great,'' Allen said. ``He took a fall, but he's
fine. His quote was, `I'm not hurt, just a little sore.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a San Saba native, had finished work in Louisiana on
Monday on the film ``Double Jeopardy,'' scheduled for release next
fall. Allen said polo is the actor's main off-camera pursuit and he
raises polo ponies on his San Saba ranch, which overlooks the San
Saba Polo Club. He also is featured on the cover of the
September-October issue of Polo Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's his passion,'' she said. ``It's his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who won the Oscar for best supporting actor in ``The
Fugitive,'' was treated by a private ambulance at the polo grounds
until Life Flight helicopter arrived. The helicopter carrying Jones
landed at Hermann at 2:53 p.m., and Ware began assessing the
injuries soon after.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, during a riding competition, actor Christopher Reeve
was thrown from his horse and suffered a spinal cord injury that
paralyzed him from the neck down. &QL;

IMPEACHMENT BECOMES A GALVANIZING ISSUE ON ELECTION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)   (EDs: SUBS 11thgraf, Ninety-four incumbents, to add dropped word;
pickup: In June, Democrats)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was being called the ``Seinfeld election,''
something about nothing, a midterm yawner void of any galvanizing
national issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the launching of a last-minute Republican advertising blitz
highlighting the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal changed all that. No
longer a sleeper, this election will set the stage for the
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, who is accused of lying
and using his power to cover up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Any way it goes, the congressional election will have a major
impact on the impeachment process. With hearings likely to begin a
few weeks after Tuesday's balloting, leaders of both political
parties say they'll be happy to either gain a few seats or not lose
too many.
</P>
<P>
   Republican gains would embolden GOP lawmakers in their conduct
of impeachment hearings. If the Democrats do well in races for the
House and Senate or lose only a few seats, ``the hearings will be
brief,'' said political scholar Thomas Mann of the Brookings
Institution, an independent Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrated by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the $10-million
television effort is aimed at 30 districts, many in the South and
rural areas where animosity to Clinton runs high. The goal:
Energize conservatives disappointed by GOP budget compromises two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, say the backfire potential is so high that
the ads and ensuing news coverage might help bring out their
voters. Late last week, the Democratic National Committee announced
a $1 million ad blitz of its own. The aim is to convince voters
that Republicans are scandal-obsessed while Democrats want to move
forward on issues such as education and reining in managed care
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very obvious Republicans have said we can't win on the
issues, therefore let's try to gin up our hard-right, narrow base
with attack ads,'' said DNC national chairman Roy Romer, the
governor of Colorado. ``They're obsessed with investigations. I'm
glad our party is obsessed with education.''
</P>
<P>
   The dueling ad campaigns ``open up a Pandora's box of
uncertainty,'' said Curtis Gans, president of the nonpartisan
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Before they
aired, he added, ``we were heading into a low-turnout election.''
Still, Gans estimated turnout in the range of 36-to-38 percent of
eligible voters, down from the 38.8 percent turnout in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   While candidates on the home turf may be talking about abortion,
health care and other issues, the ads put impeachment on the
electoral map as perhaps the closest thing there is to a
galvanizing national issue.
</P>
<P>
   The party controlling the White House always faces an uphill
battle in midterm elections. The last time the president's party
did not loose seats was 1934, just as President Franklin D.
Roosevelt, a Democrat, was launching the New Deal.
</P>
<P>
   All 435 House seats are up, but only 50 to 60 are considered
competitive. Many of those are taking place in 34 districts where
the incumbent is retiring, leaving an open seat. The open seats are
evenly split _ 17 belonged to Republicans and 17 to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-four incumbents are in uncontested races. Another 240 are
expected to be re-elected. Republicans now control the House
228-206, with one independent who generally votes with the
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Democrats appeared gleeful that the 11 seats needed to
retake the House seemed within reach. Now they concede that
scenario is virtually impossible. Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee executive director Matt Angle predicted ``plus five or
minus five'' for the party's candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, predicted the Republicans would gain
between 10 and 15 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Both parties will watch whether House votes last month for or
against the impeachment inquiry resolutions affect incumbents'
re-election bids.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-four Senate seats are up for grabs. With Republicans in
control 55-45, Democrats are given virtually no chance of retaking
control of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are unlikely to pick up the five needed to reach 60,
a number that would enable them to defeat Democratic filibusters
that can kill legislation. More probable is that the Republicans
will gain two to three seats in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Gender is less of an issue this year than in 1992, dubbed ``the
year of the woman'' because of strong electoral gains by women.
Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, D-Ill., elected in 1992, has been
entangled in scandals ever since. She looks to be a goner.
</P>
<P>
   In California, after a tumultuous struggle against Republican
challenger Matt Fong, incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer is ahead in the
polls. And in Washington state, self-proclaimed ``mom-in-tennis
shoes'' Sen. Patty Murray, another Democrat elected in 1992,
appears to be headed for a slim victory over Republican Rep. Linda
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other hot races:
</P>
<P>
   _ In Kentucky, the Senate seat vacated by retiring Sen. Wendell
H. Ford, a Democrat, is a tossup between Rep. Scotty Baesler, a
Democrat, and Republican Rep. Jim Bunning.
</P>
<P>
   _ In New York, the mudbath between Republican Sen. Alfonse M.
D'Amato and his Democratic challenger, Rep. Charles E. Schumer,
remains close. Most polls put Schumer slightly ahead.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Wisconsin, it's too close to call between Democratic
incumbent Sen. Russ Feingold, and Republican Rep. Mark Neumann. One
late poll shows Neumann moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   _ In North Carolina, Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth is in a
tight race against trial attorney John Edwards. Faircloth's poll
numbers are slipping, making him one of the few vulnerable
incumbent Republicans this November.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Republicans outdistanced Democrats in campaign
fund-raising. Democratic Party national committees raised $106.9
million, a 40 percent increase over the last midterm election in
1994. But they have a debt of $11.1 million, much of it left over
from the 1996 campaign. Their Republican counterparts raised $184.6
million and have a debt of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also beat Democrats in the war for ``soft'' money,
contributions for party building and voter turnout that are not
subject to Federal Election Commission limitations. Soft money
mostly winds up financing not-to-subtle party television
commercials that endorse candidates without specifically soliciting
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans took in $93.7 million in soft money, a 144 percent
increase over 1994. Democrats received $78.8 million, an 84 percent
increase.

GLENN GETS HIGH MARKS FROM SHUTTLE COLLEAGUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Glenn, the world's oldest astronaut, received high marks
Friday from his colleagues for his first 24 hours aboard the
orbiting shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing very, very well,'' said Dave Williams, NASA's
director of life sciences research at the Johnson Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   The bespectacled 77-year-old, who more than 36 years ago became
the first American to orbit the Earth, proved a harsher critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a lot of problems like eating food,'' confessed
Glenn, who on Feb. 20, 1962, remained strapped in the seat of his
tiny Mercury capsule and unable to float around during his near
five-hour flight. ``If it gets away from you, it gets on
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Most astronauts would have been much too proud to reveal what
Glenn disclosed next: ``Like this morning. I had some oatmeal and
raisins. One little speck wound up on my glasses,'' said Glenn. ``I
guess with old folks you normally think it falls down on an old
man's necktie, but this time it wound up on my glasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn is one of seven astronauts who blasted off Thursday aboard
Discovery for nine days of research, including a series of
experiments that will compare how young and elderly astronauts
adapt to the rigors of spaceflight.
</P>
<P>
   During several minutes of televised discussion with mission
control, Glenn's neck and face appeared puffy, a response to the
absence of gravity in which the bodily fluids migrate from the
lower torso to the chest and head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, everyone was puffy faced around here and looked
like the Poppin' Fresh Doughboy,'' Glenn noted. ``I guess I'm still
a little round faced today. That is something I understand goes
away in a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half of astronauts, according to past medical studies,
also experience a queasiness because their nervous systems are
disoriented by the absence of gravity. The adjustment takes about
three days, and the shuttle is equipped with anti-nausea
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, the crew up here has felt fine this time,'' said
Glenn, not entirely ruling out he may have experienced some of the
discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Glenn has focused most of his attention on medical
experiments, downing a vitamin pill-sized, miniature thermometer
with a tiny radio transmitter. During the two to three days the
pill remains in his digestive tract, the pill signals a recording
device clipped to his waist of changes in his core body
temperature, one of the protocols for a sleep experiment he is
participating in.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went right to work,'' said Discovery commander Curt Brown,
ticking off a list of first day accomplishments that included a
minor repair to a leaky water line and the deployment of a small
experimental communications satellite built by students at the
Naval Postgraduate School in Monterrey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've stayed pretty much on the time line with a few hiccups
here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   There was time for a moment of nostalgia for Glenn as he spotted
the city lights of Perth, Australia from Discovery, just as he did
during his Mercury flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks even brighter now then it did back then,'' said
Glenn. ``They really got it lit up tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks beautiful,'' he added. ``Please pass that along to
the people of Perth. We send our best regards.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the lights of Perth symbolized the far-flung support
for Glenn's endeavor at a time when the United States was locked in
a Cold War-era race to the moon with the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NASA confirmed that an 18-by-22-inch panel covering
the drag chute compartment on Discovery's tail section broke loose
moments before Thursday's liftoff from the Kennedy Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   Though an assessment of potential safety hazards is under way by
ground-based shuttle engineers, it appears the biggest threat
occurred during the lift off when the falling panel struck one of
Discovery's rocket nozzles, said NASA's Jeff Bantle, the mission
operations director.
</P>
<P>
   Bantle said the drag chute that helps to brake the shuttle when
it lands will not be used when Discovery returns to Earth on Nov.
7.
</P>
<P>
   The missing panel is situated on an area of the spacecraft that
does not experience high temperatures during the shuttle's re-entry
through the atmosphere, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers believe it is possible the aluminum cover plate was
improperly installed before the flight and rattled free because of
the vibration of the igniting rocket engines. &QL;

IMPEACHMENT BECOMES A GALVANIZING ISSUE ON ELECTION DAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Nov. 1)   (EDs: SUBS 12thgraf, Ninety-four incumbents, to add dropped word;
pickup: In June, Democrats)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was being called the ``Seinfeld election,''
something about nothing, a midterm yawner void of any galvanizing
national issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the launching of a last-minute Republican advertising blitz
highlighting the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal changed all that. No
longer a sleeper, this election will set the stage for the
impeachment inquiry of President Clinton, who is accused of lying
and using his power to cover up his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Any way it goes, the congressional election will have a major
impact on the impeachment process. With hearings likely to begin a
few weeks after Tuesday's balloting, leaders of both political
parties say they'll be happy to either gain a few seats or not lose
too many.
</P>
<P>
   Republican gains would embolden GOP lawmakers in their conduct
of impeachment hearings. If the Democrats do well in races for the
House and Senate or lose only a few seats, ``the hearings will be
brief,'' said political scholar Thomas Mann of the Brookings
Institution, an independent Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestrated by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the $10-million
television effort is aimed at 30 districts, many in the South and
rural areas where animosity to Clinton runs high. The goal:
Energize conservatives disappointed by GOP budget compromises two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, say the backfire potential is so high that
the ads and ensuing news coverage might help bring out their
voters. Late last week, the Democratic National Committee announced
a $1 million ad blitz of its own. The aim is to convince voters
that Republicans are scandal-obsessed while Democrats want to move
forward on issues such as education and reining in managed care
health plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very obvious Republicans have said we can't win on the
issues, therefore let's try to gin up our hard-right, narrow base
with attack ads,'' said DNC national chairman Roy Romer, the
governor of Colorado. ``They're obsessed with investigations. I'm
glad our party is obsessed with education.''
</P>
<P>
   The dueling ad campaigns ``open up a Pandora's box of
uncertainty,'' said Curtis Gans, president of the nonpartisan
Committee for the Study of the American Electorate. Before they
aired, he added, ``we were heading into a low-turnout election.''
Still, Gans estimated turnout in the range of 36-to-38 percent of

FIRST LADY: A CAMPAIGN ROAD WARRIOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton, a one-woman
campaign machine, is on the road and on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   As the election-day clock ticks down and she crisscrosses the
country one more time, the first lady has a single-minded mission:
To help Democrats pick up seats in the US House, hold down losses
in the Senate, win a few more governorships, and, not incidentally,
remind the nation it needs President Clinton as much as he needs
her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's crusade, with stops in New York, Florida,
California, New Jersey, Iowa, Illinois, Minnesota, Pennsylvania,
and Ohio over this last week of campaigning, feels more like a
victory tour than a get-out-the-vote drive.
</P>
<P>
   All 5,000 tickets to the Democratic rally she headlined here
Thursday were snapped up in a day. Admirers, some who came from as
far as Miami, packed the convention center and waved ``Hillary for
President'' signs. The mostly female crowd interrupted the first
lady's impassioned stump speech a dozen times with cheers,
applause, and standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Show her some love tonight, show her some love!'' bellowed
Representative Corrine Brown of Jacksonville, who introduced Mrs.
Clinton with a mix of sympathy and affection many have felt for her
in the humiliations of the last few months. ``Show her how we
appreciate her and the things she does for this country, especially
for women and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, a three-term lawmaker and the first African-American
since Reconstruction to hold a House seat from Florida, is in a
competitive race with a better-financed Republican. She begged Mrs.
Clinton to come into her district and whip up Democratic voters.
``It's a victory for us just getting her here,'' said Gretchen
Hitchner, Brown's spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Brown was one of the lucky ones. According to Melanne
Verveer, Mrs. Clinton's chief of staff, the first lady has had many
more requests for appearances than she can fulfill, even though she
has campaigned this season in nearly 20 states for scores of local
and statewide candidates, raised millions of dollars, and done
almost 100 radio ads for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exhausting, but the first lady is very committed to the
issues and believes there is nothing so rewarding as doing what she
is doing,'' Verveer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Energized'' is the word used most to describe her, and indeed,
there's been something stirring in Mrs. Clinton in October that was
clearly missing, maybe even lost, back in the low days of August.
Politicking on issues she loves, like education and child care, and
against the GOP she despises, Mrs. Clinton is radiant, zestful,
funny, and combative. Nobody even ventures to ask anymore how much
it hurts that her husband had a 16-month affair with a White House
intern and lied about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got to be really hard for her,'' said Sherron Kenski, an
elementary school principal in Jacksonville whose only reason for
attending the Democratic rally was to see Mrs. Clinton. ``She's got
a lot of class, and by standing by her husband instead of leaving
him, she shows that two wrongs don't make a right. I admire that.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanee Hunt, the former US ambassador to Austria and a longtime
acquaintance of the first lady, attended a recent fund-raiser with
her at the Brookline home of Democratic activist Elaine Schuster
and said she had never seen Mrs. Clinton more relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I could think was, she has nothing to fear, no more
skeletons can come dancing out of the closet,'' said Hunt, director
of the Women and Public Policy program at Harvard's John F. Kennedy
School. ``There is no question that she feels absolutely stabbed,
but she has this inner strength that allows her to keep her eye on
the ball and carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are delighted that the first lady, who was badly
discredited for pushing too hard on health care reform in Clinton's
first term, is now the party's deadliest weapon against Republicans
and her husband's most precious political asset. Polls show that
she is more popular than the president _ her approval rating is 63
percent while his is 54, according to a recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup
poll _ and 72 percent of Americans believe she has shown courage.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been incredibly helpful in talking about issues and
rallying the Democratic faithful to get out and vote,'' said Olivia
Morgan of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Poll
watchers noted that in Rhode Island, Democratic candidate Myrth
York pulled even with incumbent GOP Governor Lincoln Almond after a
visit earlier this month from Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Crawford, Morgan's Republican counterpart, says there is
``no question'' Mrs. Clinton is an effective campaigner, partly
because people feel sorry for her, partly because she has no choice
but to stand in for her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the president's scandal, the first lady becomes all the
more important to Democrats, because his utility on the stump is
quite limited,'' Crawford said. ``For some reason, she doesn't seem
to carry the same baggage he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Normally the president would play a large role in the midterm
elections, but Clinton avoids campaigning for candidates who are
not sure if a visit would hurt or help. Mostly he has been assigned
to large, private Democratic Party events safe from hecklers and
the press, surrounded by his most stalwart defenders, and on stage
with Senate candidates who really need the big money he can raise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hillary Clinton is the public face of the White House in this
campaign, and it's a smart strategy for the Democrats,'' said
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst in Los Angeles. ``There
is a great deal of sympathy for her, and she can energize women.
It's also important that she is visible because it reinforces the
notion that she has forgiven her husband, and the country should
get over it and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has also made the practical calculation that the
more Democrats elected to the House and saved in the Senate, the
fewer Republican votes there would be for impeaching the president.
She has made a herculean effort to help Representative Charles
Schumer of New York defeat GOP Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who chaired
the Whitewater hearings, and she did a rousing rally in Rhode
Island for Democratic Representative Patrick Kennedy, who has been
one of her husband's most vocal allies.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, she has appeared with Democrats Scott
Harshbarger, &UR;  &LR; John Tierney, James McGovern, and Michael Capuano,
among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk to every person you know _ call them on the phone, e-mail
them on your computer, stop them on the street _ and tell them this
in no ordinary time, no ordinary election,'' Mrs. Clinton said at
the Jacksonville rally. ``The next Congress will decide the future
of Social Security, the future of Medicare, the future of the
minimum wage, the future of public education, the future of health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that doesn't matter to you, then I don't know what does
matter, because these are the issues that will affect how you live
and how your families live,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing in her speech about impeachment, Monica S.
Lewinsky, a right-wing conspiracy, or her relationship with her
husband. She talked about her husband's policy initiatives and good
works but not about his personal healing process. She criticized
Republicans repeatedly for misguided policies and being captives to
special interests, but only once did she refer to them as ``people
who want to spend time tearing others down.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond her remarks, no one gets a chance to question Mrs.
Clinton, who turned 51 on Monday. Her appearances are tightly
controlled, the press is kept penned up a good distance away, and
no reporters are allowed to travel on her plane or meet her at the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful she even saw the handful of protesters outside
the convention center who carried signs saying, ``Impeach the
Clintons,'' ``Monicagate,'' and ``Hillary is a hypocrite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She goes around saying she is for children, but what kind of
message is she sending to our daughters when she stays with a
philandering husband?'' said Jeanne MacDonald, a Jacksonville
homemaker. ``What she cares about is her own political career, but
I think she's a coward. She's not getting my vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Swanee Hunt doubts this is the first lady's audition
for a campaign of her own. With her political savvy, experience,
and connections, Hunt speculated, Mrs. Clinton someday will be ``a
headhunter's dream.''

CAN CULTURES SURVIVE IN OUR WIRED WORLD?
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One hundred years ago, the dealers who sold Edison
phonographs gathered to talk about how to sell more record players.
Their customers were businesses, they thought, who would send the
wax recording cylinders back and forth in the first-ever voice
mail.
</P>
<P>
   Little did those dealers realize how radically differently their
machines would ultimately come to be used. Rather than compete with
the typewriter, their machine transformed popular music into an
international business.
</P>
<P>
   And with that transformation came other unexpected
transformations.
</P>
<P>
   The local tenor, for instance, suddenly had to compete against
recordings of the great Enrico Caruso. For the local boy, it became
an overwhelming challenge. For Caruso, it made him more famous,
rich and marketable than ever.
</P>
<P>
   In just such unexpected ways, the Internet and related
communications technologies may turn culture on its head once
again, warned William J. Ivey, National Endowment for the Arts
chairman, and others speaking at the Getty Center's recent
``Communicating Culture'' conference.
</P>
<P>
   Business people, artists, bureaucrats and the media chewed on
the future of culture in a networked age as part of the Getty's
latest all-star attempt to think about technology's impacts on
museums, culture and society.
</P>
<P>
   The big question: How do you preserve what makes us different _
distinctive regional cultures, for instance _ when the world is
increasingly woven together by technology that could make us all
the same?
</P>
<P>
   Will technology boil down the flavors of regional culture to an
artistic Big Mac, a globalized monoculture that makes for an
unsatisfying steady diet?
</P>
<P>
   Or will the Internet's endless depths and globe-girdling reach
provide a way to preserve and even amplify endangered cultures that
might otherwise disappear?
</P>
<P>
   ``It does make the world smaller in one sense, but in the
process it's also making the world larger, more complex and
difficult,'' said Paul Saffo, director of the Institute for the
Future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a single, global village, it's a world of multiple
global villages bumping against each other in multifingered ways,''
said Saffo. ``I think digital technology will be an accelerant for
diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The coming big technology change, Saffo predicted, will be
cheap, ubiquitous sensors on machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hanging eyes, ears and sensory organs off our
computers,'' Saffo said. ``Now that we've begun making computers
aware of the environment, it will change everything.''
</P>
<P>
   George MacDonald, head of the Canadian Museum of Civilization,
said 3-D technologies will allow indigenous cultures to preserve
their crafts in ways never before possible and to show them to the
rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be enormously enriching for peoples' lives,''
said MacDonald. ``We can get to the flotsam and jetsam of cultures
that are warehoused in museums now.''
</P>
<P>
   But that also means cultural misappropriation will be easier
than ever, creating ever sharper debates about who ``owns'' a
culture's distinctive products, MacDonald said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cultural assets will be digitized and will be part of the
economy of the future,'' said Kimber Craine of the National
Assembly of State Arts Agencies. ``The question is how the First
World will share those assets with the Third World.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Blau, the Markle Foundation's program director, said the
``Caruso effect'' will wallop weaker and less vibrant cultures,
just as it did those small-time tenors a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early recording days, there was a sense of
possibility,'' Blau said. ``People thought anyone could do their
own recording, but they didn't realize they were now competing for
attention with Enrico Caruso. Benefits don't necessarily accrue to
the producers of small, independent cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   Author and publisher Stewart Brand, now with the Global Business
Network, said the Burning Man celebration is an example of what
technology may do to culture in the long term.
</P>
<P>
   Burning Man's ``no spectators'' motto feeds a crazily
kaleidoscopic explosion of self-created art for a week in the
scalding Nevada desert every year, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the existence of the Internet freed up a whole
generation of artists in their 20s to create their own
institutions, given the evanescence of all this,'' Brand said.
</P>
<P>
   It pulls control away from the kinds of cultural institutions
that were represented at the conference, and even from artists
themselves, speakers said. ``Using Moore's Law (Intel co-founder
Gordon Moore's prognostication that the computing speed of
microprocessors doubles every 18 months), I can predict with
reasonable certainty how many transistors we'll have on a chip in
the next 20 years,'' said William Wulf, head of the National
Academy of Engineers. ``But we've been horrible about predicting
the social and economic consequences of that technology.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, a University of Virginia historian digitized the
experiences of 10,000 people who lived in the Shenandoah Valley
during the Civil War into a work called ``The Shadow of the
Valley,'' Wulf said. Users of the work could randomly call up
information about any of the people alive then and learn about
their experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, he lost control,'' Wulf said. ``It was a
profound change for him. As a historian, he had always written
books before, creating a linear experience for his readers. But the
reader all of a sudden had control. It was a mind-wrenching thing
to lose control.''

   A QUEEN OF MYSTERIES &QL; 
Like to live dangerously? Well, if that head of yours isn't good
enough to solve the interactive mystery game at the Web site for
the upcoming movie ``Elizabeth'' (at www.elizabeth-themovie.com,
it'll be a toasted marshmallow.
</P>
<P>
   The mystery game explores the bloody, religion-fueled intrigues
surrounding Queen Elizabeth I not long after her ascension to the
throne almost exactly 440 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   An assassin stalks the queen, and you have to investigate,
question suspects, gather clues then tab the likely suspect (in
real life, there were at least three major plots against the queen,
and she barely avoided being executed by her Catholic half-sister
while still a princess).
</P>
<P>
   Guess wrong in your investigation and burn at the stake (well,
virtually, unless they've figured out a way to make the ``execute''
command a literal one on your computer). Guess right and the bad
guys become crispy critters.
</P>
<P>
   MUCH NOISE ABOUT MUSIC &QL; 
If the Daily News' occasional series about music on the Internet
has whet your appetite for more, the online newsletter WebNoize is
sponsoring a conference Monday through Wednesday at the Sheraton
Hotel in Universal City.
</P>
<P>
   It's not cheap, at $995 for the full WebNoize '98 conference,
but it features 100 speakers covering about every aspect of music
and the Net, with most of the big players slated to speak in a
location a few miles from just about all the major labels. The
conference also will feature more than 35 exhibitors of various
Net-related technologies. Surf over to www.98.webnoize.com for more

<P>
   Despite months of financial turmoil and heightened anxiety about
contagion from the rest of the world, the U.S. economy is holding
up far better than most experts expected.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. economic output grew at a surprisingly solid 3.3 percent
pace this summer, the Commerce Department reported Friday, as
automakers scrambled to rebuild inventories after the General
Motors strike and consumers spent money as fast as they earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Although significantly slower than the dizzying pace at the
beginning of the year, the increase in the nation's gross domestic
product for the July-September quarter was nearly twice the 1.8
percent annual rate of the spring, when the Asian crisis first hit
U.S. industry. And it was a lot faster than the 2 percent gain Wall
Street forecasters had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of a midterm election, evidence that the economy is
performing better than anticipated was welcome news for Democrats.
And President Clinton was quick to take credit for the low interest
rates and a balanced budget that have contributed to the healthy
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the face of worldwide economic turmoil,'' Clinton said at
the White House on Friday morning, ``our economy remains the
strongest in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with the robust growth in the economy, now expected to
deliver more than $8.5 trillion in goods and services this year,
the inflation rate hit its lowest point since 1963. The most
comprehensive measure of inflation, the so-called GDP deflator,
rose at a mere 0.8 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expressed surprise at the economy's continued
vitality. ``Reports of the expansion's demise are greatly
exaggerated,'' said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist of PNC Bank in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in the stock market, who have been worrying about the
prospects for corporate profits, celebrated the brighter economic
picture by sending the Dow Jones industrial average up 97 points to
close above 8,592.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question has been: Is the U.S. economy strong enough to
drive through the problems of the world?'' Jeffrey Davis, chief
investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors, told
Bloomberg News. ``The evidence suggests it is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bond investors, however, were disappointed, selling off some of
their bond holdings and pushing interest rates higher. Together
with the rebound in the stock market and fresh signs that wage
inflation is heating up, the latest evidence that the
seven-and-a-half-year-old expansion remains on track makes it
somewhat less likely that the Federal Reserve will cut interest
rates again right away. ``The GDP report has lowered the odds of an
immediate easing,'' said Richard Rippe, chief economist at
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Although Friday's report eased fears that a recession lay around
the corner, most economists still expect growth to slow in the
coming year. The 50 forecasters in the Blue Chip Economic
Indicators survey expect the economy to advance by just 2.1 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   One source of the current strength may well turn into a source
of restraint in coming months. The buildup of business inventories
at a $57 billion annual rate, which mostly occurred in the auto
industry, added nearly a percentage point to economic growth in the
summer. That pace of accumulation is not expected to be sustained
in coming quarters.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, all categories of domestic spending, including
consumer outlays, were somewhat weaker in the summer than in the
first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Trade was the biggest drag on growth, though not as much as
earlier in the year. In the summer, the widening trade deficit
shaved three fourths of a percent from GDP, compared with a sharp
two percentage points in the spring. Exports fell at a 2.9 percent
annual rate while imports rose at a 3.4 percent annual rate. The
trade gap is likely to widen further as growth in Latin America
slows.
</P>
<P>
   But the global picture is not completely bleak, William Dudley,
chief economist at Goldman, Sachs, points out. Most Asian countries
are now running large trade surpluses, which means that they are no
longer under extreme pressure to slash imports from the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Business investment in new plants and equipment, which powered
growth during most of this expansion, is suddenly idling. Over all,
investment fell 1 percent in the summer after soaring at a 26
percent annual rate in the first half. Equipment spending edged up
at a mere 1 percent rate while factory and office construction
contracted at a 6.5 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for further growth in business investment are
mixed. On the one hand, industry is not utilizing its existing
capacity as much as before, suggesting the need for new facilities
is waning. On the other, cash flow is holding up well, despite
weaker profits, giving business the wherewithal to spend more. And
orders for everything from computers to heavy machinery were
surprisingly strong in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies still want to be more efficient, get ready for year
2000 and substitute technology for workers,'' said Rippe, who
thinks spending will stay sluggish but will not dry up.
</P>
<P>
   In the main, America's consumer households are still the
economy's stalwarts.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of home building slowed in the summer, only partly
because of a spate of tropical storms. The National Association of
Realtors reported Friday that new home sales continued to slip
after Labor Day. In some areas, real estate agents report that
stock market jitters are affecting the high end of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet housing has rarely been more affordable for the average
family. Incomes are rising smartly, house prices have not moved up
much and mortgage rates are near a 30-year low. That suggests that
housing will continue to be a plus for the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Consumption also slowed from the spring, but remained at a very
robust 3.9 percent annual rate. The rate is all the more remarkable
in light of the fact that the GM strike prevented consumers from
buying all the cars they evidently wanted. Vehicle production and
sales, which fell sharply in the spring, continued to shrink in the
summer, but both appear to be on the rebound this fall.
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons for thinking that consumers will
become a bit more cautious. For one thing, Americans spent
virtually all of their income this summer, and the official savings
rate dropped to virtually zero. That's not likely to continue. For
another, consumer confidence readings have come down since the
summer. The University of Michigan's index, which was hovering at
around 105 as recently as August, fell to 97.1 in October despite
the fact that the Federal Reserve twice lowered interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence is still very positive, but the direction of change
is unambiguous,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the Center of
Consumer Surveys at Michigan. ``It indicates that spending growth
will weaken.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several important factors, however, that should keep
the slowdown from turning into outright retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is rebounding, and the Dow delivered its best
performance for the month of October since 1982. Wages are rising
at a very solid clip. And the job market, though a bit looser than
several months ago, is still quite tight. Help-wanted advertising
is strong and first-time claims for unemployment insurance, which
were drifting up a few weeks ago, are back down close to 10-year
lows.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, said Dudley at Goldman, Sachs, ``the most likely
scenario is that we'll slow down more but avoid recession.''

G7 NATIONS ENDORSE CLINTON PROPOSAL ON IMF  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The world's leading industrial nations on Friday
endorsed President Clinton's proposal to help protect vulnerable
but essentially healthy nations from the kind of currency and stock
market upheavals that have battered nations from Asia to Latin
America in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal establishes a new line of credit that would make
billions of dollars available to some countries to ward off attacks
on their currencies or markets that are set off by economic
troubles elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, announced by the Group of 7 industrial nations Friday
morning, offers a new strategy for the International Monetary Fund,
which has usually offered money only after a country is in deep
economic trouble. Under the new plan, the fund could act more
quickly to help countries before their economies grow far sicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``With substantial new resources at the IMF,'' Clinton said
Friday morning at the White House before leaving for campaign
appearances in New York, ``this line of credit gives us a powerful
new tool that can be used when it will do the most good at the
lowest cost before the trouble starts.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan does not require any new money from countries
contributing to the Fund, although the announcement specifically
noted that individual countries could contribute additional money.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was developed by Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and
his aides, who want to send a message to speculators that they may
be taking big risks if they sell a nation's currency or other
assets, believing that they will decline in value. Frequently,
those sales force a devaluation of the currency. In theory,
speculators could lose money if the IMF credit line helps a country
stabilize by buying back its own currency or boosting its reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of 7 also announced several other longer-term steps to
reform the IMF, ones that were demanded by Congress in return for
$18 billion in additional funding approved this month. They
included new requirements that the IMF charge relatively high
interest rates for many of its loans, so that countries are
encouraged to pay back the fund as soon as private lenders are
willing to offer them money in the country _ a strategy that worked
in Mexico in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Markets rose at the news on Friday, perhaps less for the
specifics than for the evidence that the leading industrial
nations, who appeared to be drifting without a firm policy a month
ago, were finally taking action.
</P>
<P>
   But while the statement by the finance ministers and central
bankers of the Group of 7 nations committed the group to ``limit
the swings of boom and bust that destroy hope and diminish
wealth,'' many of the specific, longer-term actions were left
extraordinarily vague.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the statement supported ``an orderly and
progressive approach'' to continued opening of financial markets
around the world _ a subject of fierce debate in smaller economies
in Asia and Latin America, where many believe that pressure from
Washington to allow investors to move billions of dollars freely
across borders has contributed to the enormous volatility in
markets, and the panic that dried up credit around the world after
Russia's economic implosion in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of wording could mean almost anything, including the
ordaining of some kind of controls,'' said John Lipsky, chief
economist at Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Rubin refused to reveal what portion of the IMF's
funds would be devoted to this new ``precautionary fund.'' His
aides said that the former currency trader knew the importance of
keeping secret the size of the world's economic arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to bet against the house, we would rather keep
them guessing,'' one White House official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress recently approved an additional $18 billion in new
money to the fund, part of a $90 billion infusion from its member
nations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The first test of the new approach may come as early as next
week, in Brazil, where the final touches are being put on a package
of $30 billion to $40 billion in aid provided partly by the IMF.
Brazilian officials, fresh from the announcement of an austerity
plan intended to convince global investors that Brazil is finally
mustering the will to end wild overspending, are flying to
Washington this weekend to close the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is expected to contribute $3 billion to $5
billion to that program.
</P>
<P>
   American officials continued on Friday to be coy about their
contribution to the Brazil package, in part because it is likely to
raise hackles in Congress, which objected strenuously to a $20
billion commitment to Mexico in 1995. One administration official
left little doubt that Brazil will be the test case of the new
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the ideas involved with contingency financing could
possibly find application in Brazil, although that will of course
depend on how the situation in Brazil progresses,'' Deputy Treasury
Secretary Lawrence Summers said at a a news briefing in the White
House.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A senior official of the IMF, who asked not to be identified,
welcomed Friday's announcement, saying it would make it possible
for the fund to be more flexible as it seeks ways to help
countries. Until now, the fund has usually committed aid only after
a nation fell into deep trouble, with its currency under attack and
its cash reserves depleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new way of doing business, and that alone may be
useful,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there are three major risks associated with the new
precautionary fund strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The first is that the fund, desperate to stop the economic
contagion that spread from Asia to Russia to Latin America, could
end up supporting a country that fails to carry through on its
promised reforms. In fact, the presence of the protective shield
created by the line of credit could reduce pressure on a government
to clean up its financial act.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern would be are we throwing good money after bad?''
asked Sung Won Sohn, the chief economist of Norwest Corp. ``Will
they waste resources put in by the G-7 and the IMF?'' The first
test, Sung noted, may come in Brazil, whose unpredictable Congress
already shows some signs of resisting many of the budget cuts and
increased taxes that the government is proposing to stabilize the
economy and quality for IMF aid.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Summers addressed that criticism, saying: ``That's
obviously a crucial issue.'' He added that any effort by the
country to draw on the line of credit would ``require the approval
of the IMF board, on the basis of review by the IMF staff of the
appropriateness of policy that was being pursued.''
</P>
<P>
   The second concern is that once the IMF extends the line of
credit to a country, it would be virtually impossible to withdraw
it _ even if the country's fiscal discipline fell apart, as it did
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   By terminating the line of credit, the IMF would essentially be
announcing to the markets that it was now open season on a
country's currency _ and trigger a panic. In short, the fund would
be handcuffing itself to the country it is helping.
</P>
<P>
   The third concern is that the IMF, in trying to speed along
approved of its ``precautionary'' loan, may impose conditions a
country that are considerably less strict than the conditions on an
ordinary loan from the Fund. ``Fewer conditions and more money is
not the direction the IMF should be going,'' Jeffrey Sachs, the
Harvard economist and a longtime critic of the fund, said earlier
this week.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The changes announced Friday took weeks to negotiate, and
American officials said the talks were led by Gordon Brown,
Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer. The United Kingdom is the
temporary president of the G-7 nations, and Prime Minister Tony
Blair has repeatedly said in recent weeks that bringing some order
to the world economy would be one of his top priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Brown noted that several of the long-term
initiatives include a commitment to develop international standards
on fiscal policies, corporate governance and accounting, so that
countries and companies can be judged by investors around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   In many nations, accounting standards have been written to allow
nations to hide their problems and protect influential businesses,
many with close ties to politicians. Off-shore islands that make
their money by providing a haven for big investors and their funds
use secrecy as a national asset _ one they are not easily going to
give up.
</P>
<P>
   ``These problems will take considerable time to work out,''
Rubin said Friday. ``I've said that many, many times.''

<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ His great-grandfather was president of the
United States, his grandfather and father senators. And now,
Republican Robert Taft, heir to the nation's most enduring
political dynasty, has made some history of his own, becoming the
first candidate in Ohio ordered to remove an advertisement from the
airwaves because it contains intentional lies.

   With that, the race for governor here has descended into
name-calling and smears, notable for its breathtaking avoidance of

<P>
   ``You lie, you lose,'' the latest televised spot for Democratic
gubernatorial candidate Lee Fisher, blares across the television
airwaves. In an immediate counter attack, a Taft ad declares:
``Lie. Lose. Lee.''
</P>
<P>
   Such recess-time rhetoric has become commonplace across the
nation, as the autumn campaign limps toward its finish Tuesday. As
much of the public attention is focused on the races for the House
and Senate, 36 governorships are on the line, with Republicans
appearing to hold an advantage in virtually every large state but
California.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, in Ohio, in states from the East Coast to the
West Coast, gubernatorial candidates are raising record amounts of
money, then pouring the cash into expensive negative TV
commercials, all contributing to voter apathy and even antipathy.
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, for example, polls show that nearly 33 percent of the
electorate has yet to decide how to vote in the governor's race
with less than a week to go _ a figure that has only spurred the
two candidates to intensify their attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Void of Washington-based issues such as Monica S. Lewinsky,
gubernatorial candidates are simply focusing on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaigns have kind of degenerated, as they often do, to
negative advertising,'' said Governor Howard Dean of Vermont, a
Democrat without serious opposition this year. ``The more money the
candidates have, the less they pay attention to issues. They just
throw the junk on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rhetoric is small-bore, the stakes are anything but.
As crucial as the Congress is to the national psyche, it is in the
50 state capitals that much of day-to-day government is done, on
issues ranging from implementing welfare reform to funding new
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   As an added incentive, the party that captures the governorships
in the largest states will inherit a significant tactical advantage
in the 2000 presidential campaign, providing a massive, ready-made
political organization to launch a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governors are extremely influential,'' said Clinton Key,
executive director of the Republican Governors Association in
Washington. ``The difference between them and Congress is the
governors run things. They run states. And they are in the home
state on a daily basis, having direct contact with local leaders.
When you're running for president and you have a governor's
support, he can do a lot for you, from raising money to introducing
you to the people you need to know.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Republicans are in danger of relinquishing
their 16-year reign in California, as state attorney general Dan
Lungren, the GOP candidate, trails Democratic Lieutenant Governor
Gray Davis by a handful of percentage points in several recent
polls.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans are in position to maintain their hold on the
next seven largest states _ Texas, New York, Florida, Pennsylvania,
Illinois, Ohio, and Michigan. In New Jersey, the nation's ninth
largest state, Republican Governor Christine Todd Whitman does not
face reelection. In the 10th most populous state, Georgia, the open
race between Republican businessman Guy Millner and Democratic
state Representative Roy Barnes is too close to call, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Across the nation, political namesakes have emerged or enhanced
their image. In Texas, Republican Governor George W. Bush, son of
the former president, has picked up endorsements from state
Democratic officials and could defeat his opponent, Land
Commissioner Garry Mauro, by 40 percentage points or more.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, Jeb Bush, George W.'s brother, is making his second
bid for the governorship and holds a wavering lead over Democratic
Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota, Democratic Attorney General Skip Humphrey, son of
the late senator, holds a statistically insignificant one-point
lead over St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman in a poll released this week.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans currently hold 24 of the 36 governorships now
contested, and party officials predict a gain of two or three.
Democrats believe they will pick up three or four states and are
especially buoyed by their prospects in California. Victory there
would significantly undercut the GOP boast that 75 percent of
Americans are governed by a Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Lungren has run a universally derided campaign,
wrapping himself in the Reagan legacy, continuing to be outspoken
in his opposition to abortion rights, and thumping the fading issue
of crime. Davis, as politically colorless as his first name
implies, has forged his lead with straightforward constituent
politics learned from years of political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be a tide running for Davis,'' said Merv Field,
the head of the Field Poll in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, where polls show a tight race, incumbent Democratic
Governor Parris Glendening has launched a new negative advertising
campaign with the help of President Clinton. In the radio ads,
Clinton attacks Republican Ellen R. Sauerbrey's civil rights
record, specifically taking her to task for a 1992 vote in the
Maryland General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Ohio, residents appear to have long ago abandoned the
possibility of a good campaign, or even a fair one. Two weeks ago,
in an unprecedented move, the Ohio Elections Commission ordered
Taft to pull a negative ad off the airwaves because it contained
lies about Fisher's crimefighting record and personnel cutbacks
when he served as attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Taft has lashed out at Fisher for lies about the
Republican's stand on property-tax cuts. Fisher has appeared
reenergized and accused Taft of being a liar at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Polls vary widely, with one showing a 16-point Taft lead and
another showing just a four-point edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We teach our children to tell the truth,'' Fisher said at a
debate Wednesday night. ``The bottom line here is that Mr. Taft has
engaged in a very negative and deceitful campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the debate, Fisher added, ``Mr. Taft is a
candidate who blames other people and doesn't take
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, and even after a long one, Taft, the secretary
of state and great-grandson of President William Howard Taft,
appears an unlikely target for such criticism. At 56, he seems as
bland as an Ohio winter. He talks in slow, short spurts, as if
reading from a children's book and constantly needing to turn the
page.
</P>
<P>
   In the debate, he agreed with Fisher on the need for better
school safety, better protection for patients against insurance
companies and HMOs, better education funding, and tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   About the ads, he said: ``I value my family's reputation for
integrity and my reputation for integrity. I think Lee Fisher and I
both share some of the responsibility for those negative ads. ...
The test of leadership is not whether you make mistakes; it's
whether you own up to them.''

DEMOCRATS SEEK TO GALVANIZE BLACK VOTERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ The Democratic Party, in a last-ditch effort
to increase black voter turnout, is making Tuesday's election a
referendum on the impeachment of President Clinton in some close
congressional races that could be decided by black voters.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are undertaking an unprecedented effort to galvanize
black voters, whose support for Clinton has been unwavering, even
through the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal, but who are less likely to
vote in a non-presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   With projections of a low turnout, Democrats have seized the
opportunity Republicans recently handed them to nationalize the
election on the sex-scandal issue, using it to energize their base,
especially among blacks.
</P>
<P>
   This midterm election ``is about as presidential as you can get
without having the actual Clinton name on the ballot,'' said
Representative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said Republicans, who in some districts have started
airing three ads connecting Democratic candidates to Clinton's lies
in the Lewinsky matter, gave Democrats a gift. ``Why in God's name
they want to bring it up again, I don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And with new reports of House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
involvement in preparing the ads, Rangel and other congressional
Democrats have pounced on the speaker's unpopularity among blacks
to try to trigger a backlash against Republicans at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich spokeswoman Christina Martin Friday told Reuters Friday
that the ads are accurate, but that reports of the speaker's
involvement are not. ``Newt Gingrich was aware but not involved in
either the scripting or the execution of these ads,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a kickoff here Thursday for a three-day, five-city bus trip
called ``Take Back the House _ Get Out the Vote,'' several
Congressional Black Caucus members railed against Gingrich, saying
he is trying to suppress the black vote by focusing on the sex
scandal and trying to bring down Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about Gingrich, you ain't talking about
fairness,'' Rangel, clutching a baseball bat, told a small crowd at
the entrance of the Louisville Slugger Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Representative John Conyers of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on
the House Judiciary Committee that will hold impeachment hearings
against Clinton next month, said there is a ``very sinister thing
going on in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Newt Gingrich reaches the level of lowness in which he
would invoke'' the impeachment statue ``to get his goal of taking
over the White House and driving out both President Clinton and
Vice President Al Gore, make no mistake, this is politicaly
motivated,'' Conyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a crisis on hand,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 1994 midterm election, the Democratic Party is going
all out this year to take advantage of Clinton's popularity among
blacks to boost turnout. The party has poured thousands of dollars
into get-out-the-vote ads on black radio stations, some featuring
Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. On Sunday, the
president will appear at a black church in Baltimore at the
invitation of Representative Elijah Cummings, a member of the black
caucus.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is distributing
fliers in black communities that feature a sour-faced Gingrich with
the words: ``Newt Gingrich and his Republican friends don't want
you to vote on Tuesday, November 3rd. Stand up and prove them
wrong!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's crucial for Democratic success in a number of critical
districts is turning out the African-American voter, and one way to
do that is to remind those communities of what's at stake,'' said
Olivia Morgan, spokeswoman for the campaign committee.
</P>
<P>
   In places like Kentucky's 3rd Congressional District, where
Democratic candidate Chris Gorman, a former state attorney general,
is in a statistical dead heat in his bid to unseat incumbent
Republican Representative Anne M. Northup, African-American votes
are considered crucial.
</P>
<P>
   The district is one of 30 that Democrats have targeted to
increase black voter turnout. In 1994, black turnout was 37.1
percent compared with 47.3 percent for whites. It rose in 1996, a
presidential election year, to 50.6 percent, while white turnout
climbed to 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The African-American vote is 18 percent in this district, and
it's incredibly important we make sure we have a strong get-out-the
vote effort,'' Gorman said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He has appealed to black voters by critizing Northup for voting
in favor of the Republicans' open-ended impeachment inquiry. ``We
do not need to spend the next two years in this Congress
investigating our president's sex life,'' he said the other day,
garnering applause from his largely black audience.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats also need to motivate their base of women and
senior citizens, the black vote is an easier target because it
tends to be concentrated in the cities, said David Bositis, a
senior policy analyst at the Joint Center for Political and
Economic Studies, a black think tank in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Russell, a black 30-year-old stagehand in Louisville,
said during a lunch break that he was distressed by Republicans and
Democrats ``bad-mouthing each other so much you don't know who to
vote for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he has concluded that Republicans are ``making a
mountain out of a molehill'' with the Clinton scandal, and he plans
to vote to ``make my voice heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennie J. Smith, a black musician who is a renegade candidate
for mayor here, said: ``Everybody is tired of the negative
campaigning,'' which he predicted would motivate some people to go
to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Gans, director of the nonpartisan Committee for the Study
of the American Electorate, said Republicans at the last minute
injected an issue of national consequence into what had been an
election based on local issues. The GOP move is a ``wild card''
with an unpredictable outcome, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats may succeed in getting out the black vote, their
ballots could be offset by an energized religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is each party is going to try to maximize the vote
from the various constituency groups,'' Gans said. ``And victory
will have a lot of authors and defeat will be an orphan.''

<P>
   ESPANOLA, N.M. _ It could have been a scene from ``The Milagro
Beanfield War,'' the Robert Redford movie about Hispanic farmers
fighting for water rights here in northern New Mexico. Under the
balcony of an adobe meeting hall, Roberto Mondragon, the lion-maned
actor who played a farmer in the 1988 film, addressed Hispanic
ranchers and farmers at a political rally here.
</P>
<P>
   But in a detour from the script, the ``Vivas!'' were for Rep.
Bill Redmond, a Republican. After winning a special election in May
1997 to represent New Mexico's 3rd District in Congress, Redmond is
seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have become more practical _ they are much less married
to a party,'' Mondragon, a former Democratic lieutenant governor,
said as he gave Redmond a hearty hug to welcome him to a rally
sponsored by a group called Democrats for Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, politics followed the conventional script as
Redford led a tumultuous pep rally today for the Democratic
congressional candidate, Tom Udall, New Mexico's attorney general
and heir to a sterling political name in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to keep from drowning in a Republican sea, Democrats
in the Rocky Mountains are finding Republicans poaching on their
traditional electorates. As the Rockies now rival the South as the
nation's most Republican region, Republicans now control 19 of the
22 congressional seats in the seven-state time zone. It comprises
Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, New Mexico, Montana, Utah and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   In Colorado's 2nd District, normally safe for Democrats, Mark
Udall, first cousin of Tom, is facing a stiff challenge from Bob
Greenlee, a moderate former mayor of Boulder. Polls indicate that
both congressional races are too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   Republican poaching is most striking here in Rio Arriba County,
where Republicans account for only 10 percent of registered voters.
Democrats account for all the county commissioners, and, in
Espanola, all the city council members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been doing a lot to cut into his base among Hispanic
Democrats,'' Kevin McDermott, spokesman for Redmond, said in noting
a poll in Thursday's edition of The New Mexican in Santa Fe that
showed that 20 percent of registered Democrats in the district
supported Redmond. ``The land-grant issue has given us a lot of
credibility among traditionally Democratic Hispanics.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the House of Representatives approved a bill
sponsored by Redmond to study local families' claims that the land
of their ancestors was lost to the U.S. Forest Service. Making
political hay from history, Redmond arranged for two pages of the
Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo to go on display in Santa Fe last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest defrauding of land in the United States took place
when they did not respect the treaty,'' the congressman said here,
referring the peace settlement in which Mexico ceded much of what
is now the American Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   In a district comprising a mix of sovereign Indian tribes,
Hispanic voters, and non-Hispanic whites, the Democrats are trying
to make peace with a new political tribe, the Greens. In the 1997
election, Carol Miller, the Green candidate, won a surprising 17
percent of the votes. President Clinton, seeing the Greens as
spoilers for New Mexico Democrats, recently urged environmentalist
Democrats to ``look at the consequences'' of voting Green. To cut
down the Green vote, Udall, the state attorney general, enlisted
dissident Greens to form Greens for Udall.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller said Thursday : ``That group is totally funded by
Udall. Their real problem is Democrats for Redmond.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because Udall is seen as strong on the environment, and
partly because liberals do not want to see the re-election of
Redmond, a conservative, support for Ms. Miller has fallen in polls
here to single digits.
</P>
<P>
   In a complex political chess game, Republicans are promoting the
Green candidate as a liberal alternative to Udall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are building her up, and trashing me,'' Udall complained.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's New Mexican newspaper quotes John Dendahl, chairman
of the New Mexico Republican Party, as saying, ``Carol Miller is
our best friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after last year's special election, Mike Burita, a
Redmond strategist, wrote in an article in Campaigns and Election
magazine, ``By legitimizing Miller as a liberal alternative, we
helped her peel away crucial Democratic voters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Miller retorts that the 1997 race was won by turnout.
Redmond won the seat with 43,472 votes. That tally amounted to 23
percent fewer votes than he received six months earlier against
Rep. Bill Richardson, who resigned in February 1997 to become chief
U.S. delegate to the United Nations and is now Energy Secretary.
</P>
<P>
   In the special election, half of registered Republicans voted
while one-quarter of registered Democrats voted. Looking to
Tuesday's voting, Udall concluded, ``It's a close race that will
come down to turnout.''

   SALEM, Mass. _ Every once in a while, a political campaign comes
along that offers evidence that a particular group, whether
professional, religious or geographic, has become influential and
must be reckoned with.
</P>
<P>
   But could the campaign of Acting Gov. Paul Cellucci, a
Republican seeking a full term as governor, herald the arrival of
witches as a political force?
</P>
<P>
   The question follows an unusual outcry this month against a
television advertisement run by Cellucci's campaign. The
advertisement, which attacked the professional ``priorities'' of
Cellucci's Democratic opponent, state Attorney General Paul
Harshbarger, included a segment featuring a black-hatted,
green-faced crone, while an announcer said that Harshbarger once
threatened to prosecute a Christian group that had allegedly
harassed Salem's modern-day witches, members of a broad,
``neo-Pagan'' tradition called Wicca.
</P>
<P>
   After the commercial aired, a number of witches _ who say they
practice a peaceful, nature-centered religion unrelated to devil
worship _ telephoned the Cellucci campaign to complain that the ad
played to stereotype and indirectly made light of an incident they
recall as threatening.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, some staged a rally in Boston, during a debate
between the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The advertisement ``was insulting,'' said Amy (Gypsy) Ravish,
proprietor of the Nu Aeon bookstore, a high priestess and a member
of the Council of Elders of the Temple of Nine Wells, a Wiccan
group. Laurie Cabot, proprietor of The Cat, the Crow &AMP; the Crown,
denounced the advertisement, but said it had brought witches
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to Cellucci, we have a common issue,'' said Ms. Cabot,
author of four books on witchcraft and founder of the non-profit
Witches League for Public Awareness, whose mission is ``correcting
misinformation'' about witches.
</P>
<P>
   The league's chairwoman, Cheryl Sulyma-Masson, a veterinary
technician in Rehoboth, said that after she complained to the
Celucci campaign and got no satisfaction, she sent information
about the advertisement to bookstores with a Wiccan clientele.
``Witches now understand that we have to have a voice in
politics,'' she said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Salem, site of witchcraft trials in 1692, now celebrates its
link with an infamous past. Familiar images of a caped figure on a
broomstick seem ubiquitous, a lure to tourists who visit places
like the Witch Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The city has also gained a reputation as tolerant of alternative
spirituality, becoming home to Wiccans and adherents of New Age
beliefs, along with stores like Ms. Ravish's and Ms. Cabot's that
sell books, jewelry and other goods associated with contemporary
witchcraft.
</P>
<P>
   Some local witches have formed a ``Witches' Education Bureau,''
to answer questions from the curious. It publishes a flyer saying
witchcraft's essential law is, ``Do as you will and harm no living
thing,'' asserting that witches believe in a god and a goddess, in
reincarnation, but not in a devil, and declaring that flying
broomsticks are imaginary but would be nice ``at rush hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Oct. 31, Halloween to most Americans, is the day that witches
call Samhain, a New Year's festival that honors the dead.
</P>
<P>
   John K. Simmons, a professor of American religion at the
University of Western Illinois, said the number of people in the
many, diverse Wiccan groups is not known, but it is growing, aided
by a focus on nature and openness to women's leadership, which
strike receptive chords in a culture where environmentalism and
feminism are important to many.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, witchcraft can still attract hostility, even in Salem.
In June 1992, some Wiccans complained to police that they had been
harassed by a visiting conservative Christian group. Harshbarger
wrote a letter warning the group it could face prosecution for
civil rights violations if it returned.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cellucci advertisement, which debuted Oct. 15, the
announcer said Harshbarger had ``made his priorities crystal
clear,'' in part because ``he threatened prosecution on behalf of
the witches of Salem.'' (Among other things, the ad showed a Santa
Claus figure and said the attorney general barred Christmas
decorations from his office. A spokesman for Harshbarger said he
asked employees not to hang decorations in the office's common
areas.)
</P>
<P>
   Andy Antrobus, a Cellucci campaign spokesman, said the
advertisement was no longer airing, because it had run its course.
``We're talking about our opponent's professional record, not
anything else,'' he said. As for the witches' response, he said,
``It really didn't amount to a whole lot more than a day of phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, not every witch in Salem was upset. Jennifer Williams,
who described herself as a solitary practitioner and ``not a member
of any coven,'' said, ``The Wiccan community reacts too strongly to
this sort of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her advice? ``It's like, relax, lighten up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But others like Teri Kalgren, proprietor of an organic herb
shop, took the matter more seriously. ``There are 2,000 of us on
the North Shore,'' she said. If they all voted, she said,
politicians might take note.
</P>
<P>
   But she said many witches had not registered. ``A lot of people
who come into witchcraft are tired of the mainstream,'' she said.

   Charles K. Gifford, chief executive of BankBoston, loves to
escape to Nantucket, with its cobblestone streets and calm harbors.
Or at least he used to.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he has been getting an earful from the locals about the
service they have been getting at the venerable Pacific National
Bank since it was acquired by BankBoston late last year. A
chastened Gifford apologized in an interview in Nantucket's
Inquirer and Mirror newspaper in September, saying the acquisition
``didn't live up to my expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The mea culpa, however, didn't placate Steve Bender, owner of
Fishers Fiddle Catering, who switched to a rival bank. ``The
changeover was sloppy,'' he said. ``They sent out a user-unfriendly
brochure with all the new fees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford says the complaints are getting to him. ``Do I like to
go to the market and have somebody come up and tell me, `My ATM
card doesn't work'?'' he asks. ``No, I don't! And I'm there in my
swimsuit and T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   He vows that service will improve. BankBoston says reports of a
customer exodus are overblown. And on Thursday, the Nantucket
bank's president of six months resigned.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sasha Cavender &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Corporate directors are at times a hunted lot. The teamsters'
union has a list of ``least valuable directors.'' The AFL-CIO has
published a report asserting that compliant boards too often
overpay chief executives.
</P>
<P>
   But Director's Alert, a newsletter for Fortune 1000 chief
executives and directors, has assembled a list of America's top 10
directors, based on the opinions of more than 100 other directors.
</P>
<P>
   The mahogany-colored envelope, please: Silas S. Cathcart,
retired chief executive, Illinois Tool Works; Hanna Holborn Gray,
retired president, University of Chicago; Gerald Grinstein,
chairman, Delta Air Lines; Roderick M. Hills, former chairman,
Securities and Exchange Commission; Ellen Marram, former chief
executive, Tropicana; David T. McLaughlin, president emeritus,
Dartmouth College; Paul H. O'Neill, chief executive, Alcoa; John M.
Richman, retired chief executive, Kraft Foods; Benjamin M. Rosen,
chairman, Compaq Computer, and Patrick G. Ryan, chief executive,
Aon.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 win high marks for the advice they give. But some details
stand out. Cathcart is fond of organizing field trips with fellow
GE board members to the company's plants.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gray is known for opposing stock buybacks, preferring to use
the money for research and marketing. And McLaughlin was
instrumental in the 1996 merger of Chase Manhattan and Chemical
Bank that eliminated 15 directors _ including him.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adam Bryant  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to change a reputation, and few people know this
better than George Steinbrenner. He is still the go-to guy for
comedy writers when they need an easy punch line, even though
recent profiles of him suggest that he may be softening slightly
around the razor-sharp edges.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his choice of management books signals that he may indeed
be trying to refine his leadership style. According to USA Today,
his current reading includes ``Cigars, Whiskey &AMP; Winning:
Leadership Lessons from General Ulysses S. Grant'' (Prentice Hall;
1998).
</P>
<P>
   Section headings include: ``Avoid Humiliating Your
Subordinates,'' ``The Organization Doesn't Revolve Around You,''
``Recognize the Limits Of Your Authority'' and ``Know When to Keep
Your Mouth Shut.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Adam Bryant  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As long as he is traveling on official business, Robert W.
Pittman, president of America Online, flies his own plane at
company expense.
</P>
<P>
   William H. Gates, who owns $55 billion worth of Microsoft stock,
has a second fortune totaling several billion dollars and invests
some of it through a company called Castle Gate.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Wynn, the Las Vegas casino mogul, owns almost 5
percent of Activision, a California maker of computer-game
software.
</P>
<P>
   Those telling details are disclosed in Securities and Exchange
Commission records circulated on the Internet. Digging out such
nuggets, though, has been a chore because the agency's files are
organized by company, not by people.
</P>
<P>
   But starting Monday it will be easy to tie names to companies
with a new Internet search engine called Edgar-Online People, found
at www.edgar-online.com/people. Searches will be free for two
weeks; after that, access to documents other than proxy statements
will cost $9.95 a month.

GLENN IS WORKING HARD, HAVING FUN AND DOING WELL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Australia)  (mk) 
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ On his second day in orbit, 77-year-old
John Glenn was feeling fine, eating well and working hard Friday,
and so were all the astronauts aboard the space shuttle Discovery.
</P>
<P>
   They got busy early, deploying a small communications satellite,
processing metal alloys and semiconductor materials, and studying
the effects of space weightlessness on the human body and how it
relates to aging. For old times' sake, the people of Perth, on the
western coast of Australia, had their lights on in full glow and
Glenn saw them as the shuttle passed to the north, just as he had
done so memorably on his first space flight, on Feb. 20, 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In a televised report from Discovery, Glenn smiled and declared,
``It's been a great ride so far.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the launching on Thursday ``was quite different from the
ride I got long, long ago.'' And he said he was enjoying the
freedom to float weightlessly in the shuttle, which is far more
spacious than the tiny cockpit he occupied on his first flight.
Glenn said he had suffered no motion sickness and was eating
heartily, and he joked that in weightlessness a speck of food stuck
on his glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to float freely up here, I just wish everyone could
experience this,'' Glenn said.
</P>
<P>
   Mission officials said the shuttle was also performing well.
They said the missing cover of a parachute compartment, which fell
off during the launching here, was not expected to curtail the
flight or pose a hazard during the vehicle's descent and landing.
Engineers are still investigating the cause and possible
implications of the malfunction.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at the Johnson Space Center in Houston,
Jeff Bantle, the mission operations manager, said the absence of
the insulation-covered aluminum panel should not expose any vital
shuttle systems to dangerously low temperatures in orbit or to high
ones during re-entry into the atmosphere for landing. The plan now,
he said, was not to attempt to deploy the stowed parachute on
landing to assist in braking the shuttle's speed on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Bantle said this plan would not add any ``significant risk'' or
require that Discovery change its landing site from the Kennedy
Space Center to Edwards Air Force Base in California, where the
breadth of the flat desert gives pilots a wide margin for error.
For the first half of the shuttle program, the vehicles landed
safely without using such so-called drag chutes at touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Technicians here recovered pieces of the panel scattered around
the launching pad from which Discovery took off on Thursday for its
planned nine-day mission. The astronauts were instructed to use a
camera on the end of the shuttle's robotic arm to investigate the
tail section where the parachute door had been.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether the parachute is still tucked inside
the opening, though engineers think it remained in place and is not
likely to deploy prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the missing door, Bantle said, ``The orbiter is in
very good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   David Williams, a physician and the director of life sciences at
the Johnson Space Center, reported that Glenn ``is really enjoying
being back in space, and he's doing really well.'' Glenn is
retiring from the U.S. Senate in January and is making his return
to space 36 years after he became the first American to orbit
Earth. He is the oldest person to travel in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear the excitement in his voice,'' Williams said.
``I think he's doing a fantastic job.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole crew, the doctor said, appeared to be well and
extremely busy and productive during their first 24 hours in orbit.
Using a terrestrial expression, he said, ``From a medical
perspective, this crew hit the ground running.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew is commanded by Lt. Col. Curtis Brown of the Air Force.
The other astronauts are Lt. Col. Steven Lindsey of the Air Force,
Dr. Stephen Robinson, Dr. Scott Parazynski, Pedro Duque and Chiaki
Mukai. Duque is from Spain, and Mukai is from Japan.
</P>
<P>
   When Discovery flew north of Australia Friday morning, the
glowing lights of Perth were clearly visible, as Glenn had been
told to expect. Looking out a shuttle window, he radioed to Mission
Control: ``I've got a real good view of Perth, two big centers of
light. I think Perth's grown a little since I saw it from this
angle last time.''
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, Brown, Lindsey and Robinson were at the
controls when one of the shuttle's payloads was released out of the
cargo bay. This was the Petite Amateur Naval Satellite, or Pansat,
a small communications satellite designed by students at the Naval
Postgraduate School in Monterey, Calif. Although its main purpose
is to train military officers in designing, building and operating
satellites, Pansat will function for at least a year in the amateur
radio frequency range as a kind of space bulletin board for ham
radio operators.

STARR'S OFFICE APPARENTLY LEAKED CLINTON DATA, JUDGE FINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal judge has ruled that 24 news accounts
about the investigation of President Clinton appear on their face
to show that prosecutors in Kenneth Starr's office repeatedly and
knowingly violated federal rules by leaking grand jury testimony or
other secret information, according to documents released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In the ruling, made in September by U.S. District Court Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson but unsealed only Friday, the judge also
said that an investigator selected by her to look into the matter
had the power to seize and examine the prosecutors' telephone
records and logs along with their appointment calendars,
memorandums and other documents to determine whether they disclosed
information to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson kept secret the name of the investigator, known as
a special master, although she did not explain why. She said that
if the special master found instances of improper leaks she could
hold members of the independent counsel's office in contempt or
order other sanctions. Such an action would undermine the standing
of the independent counsel, but it is unlikely that even if
sanctions were imposed they would affect the results of the Starr
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Judge Johnson also adopted a sweeping definition
of the kind of information that prosecutors may not disclose in a
grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   She said prosecutors are prohibited not only from talking
publicly about actual grand jury testimony but also about more
generalized matters, like the ``strategy and direction of the
investigation,'' the fact that a witness has been subpoenaed to
testify or even ``what is likely to occur'' before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Such a broad definition appears at odds with Starr's view as
expressed in an interview in the magazine Brill's Content in June.
In that interview, Starr acknowledged that he and his deputy had
spoken with reporters about the investigation ``on background.''
But he insisted that these disclosures were not illegal because
they did not involve direct testimony before a grand jury. He said
his comments were permissible because they were made to protect his
office from attacks that undermined public confidence in his work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The news reports that Judge Johnson has ruled contain evidence
of violations of grand jury secrecy are from the television
networks ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN and Fox, as well as from Newsweek,
Brill's Content, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The New
York Daily News and The Boston Globe. Judge Johnson said that
because the news accounts constituted ``prima facie'' evidence of
wrongdoing, the burden was now on Starr and his fellow prosecutors
to show they were not the source of the articles and broadcast
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In her 23-page opinion, Judge Johnson summarized the two dozen
broadcast and newspaper reports about the investigation of
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky and noted that many
included attributions like ``prosecutors,'' ``sources with
knowledge of the investigation,'' ``the prosecution acknowledged,''
``law enforcement sources'' and ``Starr's deputies.''
</P>
<P>
   She described the articles and broadcasts as ``serious and
repetitive'' evidence that Starr and his prosecutors may have
committed violations.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reports contained less direct references to
prosecutors as the sources of information.
</P>
<P>
   The forceful ruling was quickly welcomed by the White House,
which has been pressing the notion that Starr and his deputies are
committed to ousting Clinton from office to the point of abusing
their power.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, special counsel to Clinton, described Judge
Johnson's ruling Friday as confirming ``what we have said all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who is managing the White House response to both the
Starr investigation and the efforts in Congress to impeach the
president, said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that the Office of Independent Counsel has been
waging a campaign of leaks against the president in an improper
effort to influence public opinion and congressional opinion and it
has done so in direct violation of federal laws safeguarding the
confidentiality of grand jury proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Ray, a spokeswoman for Starr, declined to comment
except to say that the prosecutors' office was cooperating fully
with the special master named by Judge Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson had initially ruled that Clinton's lawyers were
allowed to conduct an investigation of possible leaks from the
office of Starr, but an appeals court overturned that order, saying
it would be improper for White House lawyers to be questioning the
prosecutors who were investigating the President.
</P>
<P>
   In the order released Friday, Judge Johnson is saying in essence
that if the White House is not permitted to conduct an
investigation into leaks, she will have her own investigator do it.
</P>
<P>
   The investigator or special master has apparently been at work
for more than a month, according to the Judge Johnson's ruling.
Several bureau chiefs of the news organizations whose accounts were
included in the ruling said they would have no comment because the
issue involved confidential sources.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the news executives who were interviewed said
that neither they nor their reporters had not been contacted by the
special master. If that were to occur, they said, they would refuse
to identify their sources, relying on the protections of the First
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes it more likely that the special master is
focusing on the people who work in the office of the independent
counsel, perhaps including Starr himself. Unlike the journalists,
the prosecutors would have no grounds to refuse to answer questions
from the judge's personal representative.

   That 9-to-5 workday is in little danger of going the way of the
long-vanished six-day workweek. But employers are increasingly
trying to provide their workers with alternatives to traditional
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   William M. Mercer Inc., a New York consulting firm, polled more
than 1,800 employers and found that 61 percent, up from 40 percent
in 1993, offered flex time, in which employees decide their workday
hours within guidelines set by the company.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 12 percent were considering it. Growing even
faster is the opportunity to telecommute _ to work at home on a
computer linked to the office. A third of the companies offer the
option, up from 6 percent in 1993.

   New Internal Revenue Service rules, effective Monday, phase out
a maneuver that some investors have been using to reduce 1998 taxes
in converting their traditional individual retirement accounts into
new Roth IRAs.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have converted IRAs to coincide with sharp drops
in the stock market. Because assets shifted to a Roth IRA are taxed
at regular income-tax rates, converting after a plunge means a
lower tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   But some people went back and forth from traditional to Roth
IRAs several times when the market was falling, knowing that the
IRS counts only the last conversion for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the IRS changed the rules: only one more
conversion-reconversion is allowed the rest of this year, and
another in 1999. After that, permanent rules should be in place.
Conversions are limited to taxpayers, single or married filing
jointly, with adjusted gross incomes of $100,000 or less.

   After a month of wide movements, mortgage rates settled down
last week. While rates at individual banks in specific markets
still showed volatility, a survey of 200 lenders by Bank Rate
Monitor, the tracking service in North Palm Beach, Fla., found that
the average 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage rose just 0.01 percentage
point, to 6.79 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Brian O'Connor, managing editor of the company's Web site,
www.bankrate.com, said the consensus of lenders was that there
should be no sharp moves at least until the Federal Reserve's
policy-making committee meets on Nov. 17 to decide whether to cut
short-term rates further.

 &HT;    Bounty hunters catch felony charge for busting into wrong house
 &HT;    By R. Robin McDonald

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two bounty hunters found themselves in handcuffs
Friday and charged with felonies for kicking in the door of the
wrong Ellenwood house Monday night where a 14-year-old girl was
home alone.
</P>
<P>
   Vindex Levado Wallace, 29, a former police officer from Raleigh,
N.C., and Olatunji Andrew Spencer, 24, of Decatur were charged with
second degree criminal damage to property.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace was also charged with simple battery in connection with
an alleged attack on the 14-year-old, the daughter of Stephenson
High School teacher Vivian Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   The men turned themselves to authorities on Friday and were
released on bond following a magistrate court hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question they (the bounty hunters)
did not have the right to do this,'' said Morrow's lawyer, Terry
Lloyd, a former assistant district attorney and federal prosecutor.
``I don't believe under any stretch of any law, a bounty hunter, on
a rumor that a fugitive may be in a house, can willy-nilly kick in
a door. Their intent was to go in and terrorize whoever was in that
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The bounty hunters, working for Delta Bonding Co., were seeking
a man wanted on a half-dozen misdemeanor traffic warrants and for
failing to appear in court.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that the suspect did not live at the address on
the bond, they said they were directed by residents there to the
Morrow home
</P>
<P>
   They later told police and a county sheriff's deputy that they
had spotted the fugitive leaving the Morrow home. But they never
said why they decided not to either follow him or detain him at
that time. Instead they returned to the Morrow house in search of
him six hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying badges identifying themselves as bail enforcement
officers in violation of a memo to Delta Bonding Co. from DeKalb
County Sheriff Sidney Dorsey warning against such practices, they
demanded entry from the 14-year-old shortly after 9 p.m. Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When the teenager refused to let them in, locked herself in her
mother's bedroom and called a friend and then 911 for help, the
bounty hunters broke down the door, police said. They ransacked the
house looking for her, broke down the door of the bedroom where she
was hiding, dragged her from a closet, and snatched the telephone
from her, said police and the girl's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``They grabbed my baby, shined lights in her eyes, and threw her
on the bed,'' Morrow said. Then, they shoved a picture of the
wanted man in her face and demanded to know if her daughter knew
him, Morrow said.
</P>
<P>
   After the bounty hunters realized they had the wrong house, they
waited for police.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the two men told them they were working with the
DeKalb County Sheriff's Department, where they had obtained their
badges, an assertion Sheriff Sidney Dorsey denies.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Dorsey said he has asked the court to consider signing
additional warrants charging the bounty hunters with making false
statements to police. In telling police they were working with the
Sheriff's Department, Dorsey said, ``They deceived investigating
officers who arrived at the scene.''
</P>
<P>
   Those statements, Dorsey said, ``could have gone a long way to
keep them from being arrested... The statement they were working
under the color of the sheriff's department probably caused police
to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey also said he has summoned Delta Bonding to a hearing next
week to determine whether their authority to post bond at the jail
should be suspended or revoked ``based on the criminal actions of
the bonding agents.''

 &HT;    Handgun links two triple killings in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The same .45-caliber handgun was used _ probably by
the same person _ in the slayings of a teen-ager at a motel outside
Atlanta and three out-of-town businessmen at the Atlanta Hilton &AMP;
Towers, police confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting of Laderis Hawkins in the College Park Days Inn on
Oct. 15 is similar, but not identical to the Atlanta killings; for
example, while police believe the killer knew his victim in College
Park, they are not convinced the same is true in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Georgia crime lab has determined that the same gun was
used to kill all four victims,'' Atlanta police Maj. Mickey Lloyd
said at a press conference at Atlanta Police headquarters. ``The
weapon used was a .45-caliber handgun. We have real reason to
believe that the same man that killed the person in College Park,
killed the people in Atlanta.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said ballistics tests completed by the state's crime lab,
as well as shell casings found at both crime scenes helped police
reach their conclusions earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   College Park Police Chief Lewis Harper said because Hawkins, 19,
opened the door for his killer, it adds to their suspicion that he
knew the man. Hawkins had been living at the Days Inn on Old
National Highway since August.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to do this guy in specifically,'' Lt. Richard
Chromi said, referring to Hawkins. ``We have strong indications
that he was somehow involved with drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said though drugs were ruled out earlier last week as a
possible motive in the Atlanta killings, no motives are being ruled
out now. He also would not speculate on whether the Hilton incident
was random or planned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still haven't closed the door on a motive,'' Lloyd said.
``We do know that the types of killings were similar _ both were
done in a hotel and both were done with the same gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrold Shropshire, 50, of Altamonte Springs, Fla.; Ronald
Gutkowski, 51, of Leesburg, Fla; and Phillip Dover, 31, of
Gainesville, Ga., were found shot in the head on the 24th floor of
the Hilton on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Three days earlier, Hawkins was found shot in the face. All four
victims were shot more than once. Each was found in their
underwear. There was no forced entry into either of the rooms,
police have said. Except for Dover, all of the victims' keys and
wallets were taken as well.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cobb police spokesman Robert Quigley has said that
agency is working with Atlanta to determine whether a robbery at
the North Atlanta Hilton is related to the Atlanta homicides. He
would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd and Harper also said Friday they believe no one had been
in the room with either of the four victims before their killer
arrived. Blood found at both crime scenes belonged only to the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the man they are looking for could be a serial
killer, Lloyd and Harper frowned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hate to say serial killer, but at this point it's entirely
possible,'' Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police have already released two video shots of a man
they're calling a ``possible witness'' in the Hilton incident. The
first tape released last Friday shows Dover walking to the hotel
elevators at 2:10 a.m. with an unidentified man dressed in a neat
khaki shirt and matching pants. The man, hefty in size, is also
sporting a dark cap. The man and Dover are seen chatting.
</P>
<P>
   Dover, hotel officials have said, had purchased a sandwich at
the hotel's 24-hour Cafe Express. He is seen holding a white paper
bag in one hand as he walks toward the elevators. The stranger was
holding a can of beer in his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   All three Atlanta victims had walked to the Steak and Ale on
International Boulevard and ate steaks and drank a couple of beers
before returning to the hotel earlier that evening, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week Atlanta police released a second video shot of
the same stranger entering the Hilton lobby sometime after
midnight. He brushes by several lobby plants and then is seen
veering toward the left where the all-night hotel eatery is
located.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said the three Hilton victims died shortly
after 2:10 a.m. Their bodies were found at 8 a.m. by a hotel
housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd said police have questioned several people, but still need
to talk to several more.
</P>
<P>
   He also said two Atlanta homicide investigators arrived in
Central Florida on Thursday to speak to police in Altamonte
Springs. Earlier this week someone broke into Shropshire's
apartment, rifling through papers in a living room drawer.
Altamonte Springs Deputy Chief Mike Deal said Thursday that
investigators have not ruled out a connection between the break-in
and the triple homicide at the Hilton, but that such a connection
seems unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd and Chromi said they hope Friday's announcement will get
results.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've now realized that this is much bigger and we hope that
people will come forward,'' Chromi said.

<P>
   The epic courtroom battle between the Justice Department and
Microsoft has now ground through eight days in court, and the
defense's strategy seems to take new twists daily.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's lawyers, cross-examining the government's star
witness, James L. Barksdale, president of Netscape Communications,
spent several days trying to make Netscape out as a crybaby unable
to stand the rough-and-tumble of a business battle fought hard but
clean by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   When that approach found little traction, the defense tried to
paint a crucial 1995 meeting between Microsoft and Netscape
executives as a ``setup'' meant to entrap Microsoft into
incriminating itself.
</P>
<P>
   The government riposted with a new batch of documents, including
a handwritten note from Fred D. Anderson Jr., chief financial
officer of Apple Computer, to Barksdale describing how Microsoft
strong-armed Apple into choosing its Internet browser over
Netscape's.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys then tried to get a senior vice president of
America Online, David M. Colburn, to say his company chose to ally
with Microsoft because Microsoft's browser was superior, but
Colburn said that a promise of a prime spot on the Windows
operating system's desktop display was the real reason.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft lawyers succeeded in dragging out Colburn's testimony
long enough to deny prosecutors the chance to play a tape of
Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, sparring with lawyers during his
deposition; the tape will have to wait until sometime next week,
giving Microsoft more time to devise new legal strategies.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was once uncommon to find telephone-company executives
anywhere but phone companies. Nowadays they are increasingly
crossing over into senior jobs in other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond W. Smith, who is due to retire as chairman of Bell
Atlantic at the end of the year, said last week that he would take
his experience acquiring Nynex and GTE to the investment banking
world, where he will head up the Rothschild Group's North American
holding company.
</P>
<P>
   But some don't stray so far: Alex J. Mandl, who quit as
president of AT&AMP;T in 1996 when it became clear he wasn't in line to
become chairman, said his wireless telecommunications start-up,
Teligent, was now open for business in 10 cities. ... Sprint
decided to hold off taking its wireless operations public until
markets calm down.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Market turmoil may be causing some companies to tighten their
belts, but environmental spending appears to be escaping the
cost-cutter's ax. A survey of corporate environmental managers
found that U.S. industrial companies planned to increase
environmental spending next year by an average of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The BTI Consulting Group, which does the survey annually, said
it was the first time in seven years that industry planned to
increase its environmental budget. BTI suggested that companies
might feel they finally have other costs under control and are more
comfortable budgeting for cleanup, and that many may be sprucing up
properties and divisions that they hope to sell.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew at a faster-than-expected 3.3 percent annual
rate in the third quarter, damping fears that a recession is
looming. Durable-goods orders rose 0.9 percent in September;
analysts had expected a decline.
</P>
<P>
   But home resales fell last month, and consumer confidence sank
to its lowest level in nearly two years. ... Brazil laid out
details of an $80 billion package of spending cuts and tax
increases in a bid to stabilize its finances. ... Southwest
Airlines said it would put a toe in the nonstop transcontinental
flight arena with an experimental pair of $99 flights between
Oakland and Baltimore on Thanksgiving Day.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having long since saturated every mass medium and most public
places with ``brand awareness messages,'' marketers constantly
search for fresh opportunities to stuff an ad into the few
remaining unsold seconds of a consumer's waking hours.
</P>
<P>
   Usually that means finding a new way to invade the home _ and a
rationale to make the incursion go down easier with a suspicious
public.
</P>
<P>
   A recent classic of the genre proclaims that ``two of America's
leading names in laundry are teaming up in a new consumer-education
effort'' to help simplify the lives of consumers by providing
``useful cleaning information when and where they need it most.''
</P>
<P>
   How is this great beneficence to be wrought? By permanently
imprinting an ad for Procter &AMP; Gamble detergent and fabric softener
inside the lids of new General Electric washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   The ``helpful tips'' range from ``Tide helps keep whites white''
and ``Downy rinses in to help gently protect fabrics'' to
lifesavers like ``Step 2: Add clothes'' and ``For best results,
read the `use and care' book that came with your washer.''
</P>
<P>
   The proud concocters of this idea boast in their news release
(which came with an actual steel washer lid) that the average
household will have to look at the ad on the lid 4,368 times over
the planned 12-year life of the machine.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could buy a front-loader.

AMBASSADOR QUIT AMID SEX INQUIRY, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. ambassador to Eritrea resigned last year
after State Department investigators determined that he had engaged
in sexual misconduct, the White House said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials said an investigation by the
department's inspector general supported accusations of sexual
harassment made against the ambassador, John Hicks, by two
secretaries in the American Embassy in Asmara, the capital of the
East African nation.
</P>
<P>
   While refusing to discuss details of the inquiry, the White
House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Hicks resigned in September
1997 after a report by the inspector general concluded that the
ambassador had ``engaged in sexual misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart was responding to a report Friday in The Washington
Times that President Clinton had dismissed the ambassador at a time
when Clinton was involved in what he has since acknowledged was an
inappropriate sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday whether Clinton had known of the ambassador's
resignation when it occurred last year, Lockhart replied, ``Not
that I'm aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the resignation might suggest a double standard in
light of Clinton's acknowledgment of his relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky, the spokesman said, ``I don't know the details of the
case, so it suggests nothing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone at his home in Silver Spring, Md., Hicks, a
career diplomat and 22-year veteran of the Agency for International
Development, said, ``I'm not commenting and don't intend to
comment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks' lawyer, Thomas Trgovac, said the embassy secretaries had
``improper motives'' in bringing the accusations against the
ambassador, but he would not say what those motives were. Trgovac
denounced the accusations in the inspector general's final report
as ``false and supported only by flawed and deficient
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hicks denied the accusations and was prepared to vigorously
defend himself at an administrative hearing,'' the lawyer said.
``However, Ambassador Hicks decided to pursue employment
opportunities in the private sector rather than have his family go
through the personal indignities and legal expenses that would
result in him defending himself against these baseless
accusations.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general, Jacquelyn Williams-Bridgers, had no
comment on the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   While administration officials refused to make available a copy
of the inspector general's report, they confirmed that the inquiry
began after the two secretaries accused Hicks of repeatedly groping
them and of other crude sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the investigation had largely validated the
accusations and found that Hicks had created a hostile work
environment for the two women. They said the Justice Department
reviewed the case for possible criminal prosecution but declined to
bring charges.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton named Hicks to the embassy in Eritrea in May 1996.

A YOUNG BOY'S HERO LANDS IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of these days, depending on how long I can put it off, I'm
going to have to embarrass us both and tell the new Dodgers manager
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   When Davey Johnson was 31 and I was 13, he was my favorite
baseball player.
</P>
<P>
   I think I know what he'll say, because it's what they all say.
</P>
<P>
   He'll say, ``You're making me feel old.''
</P>
<P>
   To which there's nothing to say except, ``No, no! Don't feel
that way!''
</P>
<P>
   Every young sports fan has idols. The disadvantage of growing up
to be a sportswriter is that you might get to meet them and even
cover them.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the question is what to say _ ``I pasted your autograph
right next to Joe DiMaggio's!'' _ without risking everybody's
dignity.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a kid in the San Fernando Valley, before the sports
autograph business went big-time and the fan-athlete relationship
lost its sincerity, I would write away for autographs and attend
players' promotional appearances at local stores. It wasn't unusual
to find a superstar pitcher signing photos for free at a plumbing
store.
</P>
<P>
   In my autograph album, dug out of a closet along with ``Winning
Tennis by Arthur Ashe'' and a Partridge Family record, an odd
cross-section of '70s sports stars is represented on photos and
scraps of notebook paper: football's Rosey Grier, Deacon Jones, Joe
Kapp and Lance Rentzel _ the first a preacher and the last a
convicted sex offender _ are in there. So are basketball's Pat
Riley _ then a mustachioed Lakers guard _ Gail Goodrich, Rick
Barry, Louie Dampier and Bill Keller; if you've never heard of the
last two, you weren't a fan of little ABA 3-point specialists. And
here are baseball's Hank Aaron, Vida Blue, Brooks Robinson and
Nolan Ryan (a tiny but stylish ballpoint signature over an
unwrinkled young face in Angels cap and sideburns).
</P>
<P>
   Three baseball players qualified, at one time or another, to be
called my favorite.
</P>
<P>
   The first was Bill Grabarkewitz, a Dodgers infielder whose
mouth-of-marbles name was part of his charm. Charlie Brown had Joe
Shlabotnik; I had Bill Grabarkewitz.
</P>
<P>
   He played shortstop in the first Dodgers game I remember
attending, on May 22, 1970. The ticket for a seat on aisle 2 of the
reserved level cost $2.50 then, and it's in my wallet today.
</P>
<P>
   Early in that game, which the Dodgers lost 1-0 to Pat Jarvis and
the Atlanta Braves, Grabarkewitz tried to cut off a throw from the
outfield. The throw sailed over his head, and as Grabarkewitz
back-pedaled desperately, he tripped over second base and fell in
the dirt, arms and legs flailing.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-thousand people laughed at the poor little guy wearing a
dirty number 1.
</P>
<P>
   That season, Grabarkewitz hit 17 home runs, enough to lead the
Dodgers, and played in the All-Star Game, where his 12th-inning
base hit moved Pete Rose into position to crash home with the
winning run on a Jim Hickman single. Grabarkewitz was a good
player, popular with writers and teammates, quotable and funny.
</P>
<P>
   But as I remember it, what made me a fan was the sight of him
belly-up on the Dodger Stadium infield.
</P>
<P>
   Grabarkewitz was traded around and injured a lot over the next
five years. Back then, before ESPN and USA Today tied the sporting
nation together, a player traded out of town might as well have
been sent to Mars. The fastest way I could devise to find out which
number Grabarkewitz was wearing with the Chicago Cubs was to write
and ask him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for the nice letter. I appreciated it,'' he wrote back,
the only athlete in my short autograph-hunting career who replied
with more than a signature and some sort of best wishes. ``Team _
Cubs. Number _ 10. Billy G.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, before a Dodgers old-timers game, I used my press
credential to go on the field, brush past Koufax and Drysdale and
meet Grabarkewitz. I asked if he remembered tripping over second
base.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I forget?'' he said. ``The Herald-Examiner (which
had a tabloid sports section in those days) had a full-page picture
of it the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was embarrassing,'' he said. ``But I'll bet you didn't
know I once threw up on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   That's my hero, ahead of his time, throwing up on the field 25
years before Cade McNown made it cool.
</P>
<P>
   A similar haplessness defined the career of my last
``favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Duane Kuiper was a second baseman best known for hitting
precisely one home run in 3,379 at-bats _ off future Cy Young Award
winner Steve Stone in 1977 _ in a 10-year major-league career with
the Cleveland Indians and San Francisco Giants. Though he was a
valuable pinch-hitter at the end of his career, he didn't try to
live down his legendary powerlessness, even posing for one
trading-card photo with a broken bat over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   I introduced myself to Kuiper at the batting cage one day after
I joined the Dodgers beat in 1985. He was on the disabled list and
told me the Giants were keeping him just long enough to give him 10
years of major-league service and the pension that goes with it.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't sure if he'd want to talk about the home run, but I
asked about his weird claim to fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad I never hit a second homer,'' Kuiper said, under
no illusion about his place in baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   By now you might have guessed I was a light-hitting infielder as
a kid (with the Cubs and Orioles of the Sepulveda Park league). But
my hero between Grabarkewitz and Kuiper was a heavy-hitting
infielder.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson had 43 homers for Atlanta in 1973, leading a team
that had Aaron (40) and Darrell Evans (41) and one behind Willie
Stargell's league-leading total.
</P>
<P>
   The following season at Sepulveda Park, I wore Johnson's number,
6. To no avail: My swing always was more Duane than Davey.
</P>
<P>
   Now it'll be my job to critique Johnson's managing and I promise
to do it objectively. Still, I'll be waiting for just the right
time to tell him that somewhere in my closet is a blue, white and
red Braves souvenir batting helmet with number 6 stenciled on the
back.

TUTU ASSAILS ANC, OTHER CRITICS OF APARTHEID REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu leveled a stinging attack
Friday on critics of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission's
final report, saying the African National Congress in particular
had squandered its moral high ground by attempting at the last
minute to block the document's public release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't struggle in order to remove one set of those who
thought they were tin gods to replace them with others who are
tempted to think they are,'' Tutu told reporters. ``Reconciliation
is not saying a wrong has not happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The five-volume report _ the culmination of more than two years
of inquiry into the most repressive decades of the apartheid era _
accused senior leaders and parties on both sides of the conflict of
committing gross violations of human rights. Released Thursday, the
document was supposed to foster a collective understanding about
South Africa's strife-torn past. Instead it has sown division and
drawn fire across the political landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Thabo Mbeki, president of the ANC and deputy president of the
country, accused the truth panel of ignoring the party's objections
to the report and said the commission was gravely mistaken to have
found the ANC guilty of serious abuses.
</P>
<P>
   The National Party, which devised apartheid and ruled with
increasing repression for 46 years, accused the commission of
``failure to achieve reconciliation.'' The party's senior former
politicians were deemed guilty of the worst crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party called the panel a ``circus
... a body crippled by political bias (that) could never hope to
achieve proper reconciliation.'' The commission held the party and
its president, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, ``responsible ... for 3,800
killings in the Natal and KwaZulu area.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his deep disappointment, particularly at the ANC
response, Tutu long expected that the commission's final report
would spark anger. ``You can see that truth is explosive,'' he said
in an interview a few months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he continued, ``if we didn't seek to delve deeply and
people thought they were healed, then the poison would still
perhaps be in their systems. The devil that should be exorcised
would still possess them and we would have an explosion down the
line that we had not in fact expected because we thought a healing
had happened.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is already complicating the immediate political
future of South Africa. Several parties, including the Afrikaner
Volksfront _ whose leader, former general Constand Viljoen, was
implicated in some of apartheid's worst cross-border atrocities _
are now calling for a blanket amnesty. The truth commission process
was so biased and flawed, they argue, that the only way to promote
reconciliation is to end the ``witchhunt'' for perpetrators from
all sides.
</P>
<P>
   That might be an appealing idea even for the ANC, whose
opposition to that approach five years ago led to the political
compromise ultimately establishing the truth commission. The truth
panel found the ANC guilty of abuses ranging from torture in its
military training camps to the systematic assassination of Inkatha
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Among those named as specific offenders were people now in
senior government positions _ Defense Minister Joe Modise, Deputy
Defense Minister Ronnie Casrils, and ANC Deputy President Jacob
Zuma.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, according to Deputy Chairman Alex Boraine, ``has
a great deal of information referring to people who have not
applied for amnesty, which will be turned over to the attorney
general's office.'' Under the law establishing the commission,
anyone who did not apply for amnesty or was denied the provision
can be prosecuted with the aid of material gathered by the truth
commission.
</P>
<P>
   The ANC originally sought general amnesty for all its members,
but that attempt was overturned by a court ruling and now each case
will be considered on its own merits. A blanket amnesty might be a
convenient way to protect senior ANC members now named in the
report, but the party risks a popular political backlash when
national elections are only six months away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catharsis can be very uncomfortable,'' says Ronald Suresh
Roberts, coauthor of a book on the truth commission. ``The
commission is not about trying to make everyone feel good. It is
about broad notions of political and collective responsibility. One
of the most important outcomes is to get people to acknowledge what
happened.''

<P>
   By reducing costs and shedding troubled businesses, Oxford
Health Plans appears to be reducing the losses that have plagued it
over the last year. The managed care company said Friday that it
had lost $47 million, or 58 cents a share, for the quarter ended
Sept. 30, on revenue of $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Having disappointed analysts last quarter when it reported a
loss of $507.6 million, Oxford surprised them Friday with
significantly better-than-expected results. Wall Street had been
expecting a per-share loss ranging from 65 cents to more than $1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest parts of the turnaround have already been
accomplished,'' said Norman Payson, brought in as chief executive
earlier this year as part of sweeping changes at the company, which
has its headquarters in Norwalk, Conn., and which was once a
darling of Wall Street because of phenomenal growth. Oxford
stumbled badly last year after it lost control over medical costs
and fell months behind in paying doctors and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Besides reducing the company's administrative costs, Payson
said, Oxford is selling or dropping some of its most unprofitable
plans, including those in Pennsylvania and Illinois, and sharply
cutting back participation in government-sponsored programs like
Medicare and Medicaid, where it was losing money.
</P>
<P>
   As other managed care companies reported good results, investors
pushed Oxford's stock up almost 16 percent this week. It closed
Friday at $11.8125, up 56.25 cents for the day.
</P>
<P>
   But while Oxford appears to have gained some breathing room,
health care consultants and analysts say it is premature to predict
that Oxford will return to profitability anytime soon. To do so,
Oxford must both raise premiums and reduce what it pays doctors and
hospitals. But those changes could make it hard to offer the broad
network of providers it is known for and could make its services
less popular with consumers. ``This is the critical quarter,'' said
Barry Barnett, a principal at Kwasha HR Solutions, a unit of
PricewaterhouseCoopers.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford said it had already increased premiums by about 9 percent
for many of its plans. ``The competitive environment has gotten
better,'' Payson said. He added that many employers had agreed to
higher rates because other plans were also charging more.
</P>
<P>
   While benefits consultants say that most of Oxford's corporate
clients appear to be sticking with the company, they say some may
decide to pass any higher costs onto their employees. These people
will have to pay more to keep Oxford _ in premiums, deductibles or
co-payments _ and if given a choice of other plans, they could
decide to leave Oxford.
</P>
<P>
   Enrollment has already dropped slightly, to 1.9 million members,
according to the company. Payson said Oxford could lose about 10
percent of its enrollment in its commercial plans, but many
companies and employees are still in the midst of making their
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just not going to have a good handle on this until
year-end,'' said Bob Braddick, a consultant with William M. Mercer
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford's medical costs also remain high. Its medical-loss ratio,
the percentage of a premium that goes to medical expenses, is 88.9
percent. ``Clearly and absolutely, improving the medical-loss ratio
is our primary challenge,'' Payson said.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford's relationship with its doctors is improving, he said,
and there have been ``almost no resignations.'' But the company's
conflict with some New York-area medical societies over unpaid
bills is unresolved. Earlier in the week, two medical groups sued
Oxford. The company called the $1 billion in damages they sought
absurd.
</P>
<P>
   All of this uncertainty makes it unclear when exactly Oxford
might return to profitability. The company's cash flow losses have
been reduced but it is still far from making money after it pays
hefty interest charges and other costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return to positive earnings territory appears to be
farther out than in 1999,'' said Roberta Walter, an analyst with
Merrill Lynch. Oxford, which earlier in the year said it expected
operating losses to continue until the third quarter of next year,
did not offer any additional forecasts Friday.

SECURITY COUNCIL OUTLINES NEW STRATEGY ON IRAQ ARMS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The Security Council outlined on Friday how it
might proceed with a comprehensive review of Iraq's relations with
the United Nations, if and when the government of President Saddam
Hussein allows arms inspections to resume.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis have been silent on the question of when or how they
will resume cooperation with arms inspectors, and have been
attempting to link compliance with a review that Baghdad appears to
believe could be manipulated to lead automatically to the lifting
of the eight-year embargo.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Iraq's ban on spot inspections, imposed on Aug. 5,
and the prospects for a review, are likely to be discussed next
week by the Security Council, with the U.S. representative, Peter
Burleigh, in the president's chair for November.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq appears to some diplomats _ and to the arms inspection
commission _ to be risking more problems by seeking another review.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller-scale reviews of Iraqi compliance this year have
produced a number of embarrassments for Iraq, including
confirmation of the discovery of components of VX nerve gas on
missile warheads by international experts last week. Iraq is again
demanding outside experts for the new comprehensive review,
although scientists from Russia, China and France _ Iraq's friends
on the council _ have been no less rigorous in finding fault with
Iraq than American or British experts.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two weeks ago, Iraq presented the secretary-general with
a list of nine ``clarifications'' amounting to demands on how the
review should be conducted. The Iraqis also anticipated in their
summary that the council may conclude on the basis of the
comprehensive review that Baghdad was in the clear on major arms
questions.
</P>
<P>
   After the Iraqi list was passed on to the council, the British
and American delegations took the lead in trying to stop the Iraqi
bid for a prearranged review that put the burden of proof on the
inspectors of the U.N. Special Commission and the Security Council
to show that Iraq still had prohibited weapons, and to share the
evidence with Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on Friday to Secretary-General Kofi Annan that was
in part intended to demonstrate that the council would remain in
charge of the process despite Iraqi efforts to deal only with
Annan, the council members said unanimously that they ``could not
prejudge the outcome'' until they had collected evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The council did agree to divide the review into two phases,
something friends of Iraq had sought. The first would focus
strictly on Iraqi compliance with disarmament requirements and
future monitoring. The second part would deal with other
obligations unmet by Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. The
United States has insisted that Iraq must account for missing
Kuwaiti prisoners and property, among other demands.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is invited in the letter to ``contribute its own accounts
of its compliance with its obligations, in the form of written
reports and oral presentations, with a clear explanation of its
reasoning.'' According to the letter, Iraq could also expect a time
frame for steps on the way to meeting council demands and the
eventual lifting or easing of sanctions, ``assuming full Iraqi
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Iraq restores the right of arms inspectors to conduct spot
searches, however, the notion of a comprehensive review remains
moot. And until the inspections resume, there can be no formal
periodic review of sanctions alone. These normally took place at
60-day intervals, with two major surveys each year.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is thought to be close to meeting requirements on nuclear
weapons, although questions remain about the country's capacity to
rebuild its clandestine program. Until the discovery of traces of
deadly VX nerve gas on warheads that Iraq had tried to hide and
then apparently clean up after inspectors found them this year,
Baghdad also seemed close to closing the missile file.
</P>
<P>
   But chemical weapons programs are still plagued by unknowns,
inspectors say. And the substantial Iraqi biological weapons
programs are a long way from a full accounting.

INDONESIA DENIES IT FAILED TO PULL OUT TROOPS FROM EAST TIMOR  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ The military denied on Friday that it had
not reduced the number of troops in disputed East Timor after the
government had announced a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information such as that is misleading and is only engineered
by irresponsible parties to disturb the comprehensive and peaceful
settlement of the East Timor problem,'' the armed forces commander,
Gen. Wiranto, said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times had reported on Friday that opponents of
Indonesia's control over the territory said that documents leaked
from the Defense Ministry showed that the army was not withdrawing.
</P>
<P>
   The military, accused of widespread human rights abuses since it
invaded East Timor, a former Portuguese colony, in 1975, says it
has removed all combat troops and reduced the number of personnel,
to 6,000 territorial troops and 6,000 local troops, with no combat
units.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that 17,941 soldiers were in East Timor at
the end of August. Adding paramilitary groups and pro-government
youth groups used by the military, the personnel under armed forces
control totaled more than 21,000.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat who insisted on anonymity said there was
little doubt about the accuracy of the information in the documents
after comparing it with other information on military activity.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual removal of combat troops was widely seen as a
critical first step in earning the trust of the 800,000 residents
after decades of military repression under President Suharto and an
important element in President B.J. Habibie's promise to grant
greater autonomy to the region and win international recognition of
Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of the number of pro-independence rebels in the
territory vary. But the majority of the residents, mostly Roman
Catholic in predominantly Muslim Indonesia, are believed to be
sympathetic to the long fight for self-determination.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators from the two sides are reportedly in Austria to
prepare for settlement talks next month.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has not recognized Indonesian rule.

CIA SAID TO HAVE REJECTED BOMBING SUSPECT'S BID TO BE A SPY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A former sergeant in the U.S. Army who is now being
held in connection with the terrorist campaign of Osama bin Laden
was rejected in the 1980s when he offered himself to the CIA as a
spy, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ali A. Mohamed, who was born in Egypt, was an officer in the
Egyptian military when he walked into the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and
volunteered his services as a spy for the Central Intelligence
Agency, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officers at the embassy remained in contact with him for
nearly a month before deciding that he was too unreliable to be a
useful agent inside Egypt, officials said. They refused to say on
Friday whether the CIA had subjected Mohamed to a lie detector
test. That is the agency's standard practice when dealing with
potential foreign agents.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA cut off contact with Mohamed, and did not have a
relationship with him later when he came to the United States and
joined the army, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed has been charged secretly by federal prosecutors in New
York as part of the government's efforts to destroy bin Laden's
terrorist network after the bombings of two U.S. embassies in East
Africa in August, said law enforcement officials who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed, 46, was charged in September in a closed hearing and
remains in custody at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New
York City. The details of the charges against him could not be
determined, but it is believed that he became enmeshed in bin
Laden's terrorist group at some point in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The possibility that Mohamed had some ties to the CIA was first
raised in 1995, when his name surfaced in the trial of a group of
defendants charged with plotting to blow up the New York landmarks.
The Boston Globe reported that year that Mohamed had originally
been admitted to the United States under a special visa program
controlled by the CIA. The Globe also reported that Mohamed had
claimed to have worked for the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Egyptian military in 1984, Mohamed entered the
United States in 1985 and soon became a permanent resident. He
enlisted in the Army in 1986. He spent his three years in the Army
attached to a Special Forces unit. He was involved in training and
lecturing soldiers being deployed to the Middle East, and also
appeared in training videotapes about the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Mohamed's entry into the United States came soon after
he was evaluated as a spy by the CIA's Cairo station, American
officials said Friday that there was no evidence that the agency
arranged for Mohamed's visa. Officials could not, however, rule out
the possibility that some other federal ag5Y0$1031%, .!Y31SPY :/ .!
- ms slGC203611 naY31SPY e, quOUT-TNS ency helped Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, the same year he was honorably discharged from the
Army, Mohamed began to provide military training to members of the
terrorist group later charged in the New York landmarks case,
according to testimony in the group's 1995 trial. And, by 1992, an
eyewitness in the landmarks case saw Mohamed at a training camp
near Khost, Afghanistan.

   BOISE, Idaho _ Former Gov. Cecil Andrus says that if Rep. Helen
Chenoweth were to come across a brush fire, her instinct would be
to douse it with a pail of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Mrs. Chenoweth, a stalwart on the right flank of
the Republican revolution, has taken stands and made statements
that created an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building in Oklahoma City in 1995, she asserted at a committee
hearing, ``The most peaceful and responsible thing this body could
do is listen to the complaints of people who have resorted to
violent action.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth advocates an elk-hunting season in Yellowstone
National Park, and she sponsored legislation that would require
federal agents to get permission from local sheriffs before
carrying firearms into the sheriffs' jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Now Mrs. Chenoweth, 60, is one of the few Republican incumbents
who are in serious danger of being defeated in Tuesday's election.
Her Democratic opponent, Dan Williams, a 36-year-old lawyer from
Boise who lost to her by only 6,500 votes in 1996, is presenting
himself as someone who represents the same conservative values as
Mrs. Chenoweth but is willing to compromise to accomplish goals.
</P>
<P>
   In their third and final debate, taped on Thursday in a
television studio in Spokane, Wash., for broadcast in northern
Idaho on Sunday night, Williams told his opponent: ``We don't
always get 100 percent of what we want in this life. The trouble
with your approach is that we never get one inch closer to a
resolution of our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth, a skilled debater, had a ready response.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goodness, Mr. Williams, but that's trial-lawyer stuff,''
she declared.
</P>
<P>
   Then she added: ``We don't need having someone sit down and
compromise with the federal government. That's gone on too long.
Real people with real property need an advocate. Individuals and
small businesses need an advocate to stand up and make the federal
government accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates do have some policy disagreements. Mrs.
Chenoweth believes that most abortions should be illegal and that
the government should not pay for abortions for poor women, even in
cases of rape or incest. Williams favors abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth would turn over some federal land to the states.
Williams believes that such action would result in a give-away to
developers.
</P>
<P>
   But basically, the election boils down to a referendum on Mrs.
Chenoweth and her style. Marc Johnson, who was chief of staff to
Andrus, a Democrat, says Idahoans have such strong views about Mrs.
Chenoweth, favorable and unfavorable, that she would win 48 percent
to 52 percent of the vote whether she were running against Abraham
Lincoln or Godzilla.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth said in an interview that she agreed with that
appraisal. Incidentally, even though she has been divorced from
Nick Chenoweth since 1973, she wants to be called ``Mrs.'' and not
``Ms.,'' she said, ``because I am a mother and a grandmother,'' and
she calls herself a ``congressman'' because she thinks
``congresswoman'' is a silly word.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If she is re-elected, she said, she will retire at the end of
the term because she pledged when she first ran in 1994 that she
would limit herself to three terms. She has come to believe that
the idea of term limits is a mistake, she said, but added: ``I gave
my word. It was part of the bargain between the voters and me.''
</P>
<P>
   The race for the other congressional seat in Idaho is also
close. The incumbent Republican, Michael D. Crapo, has resigned to
run for the Senate. Democrats recruited Richard Stallings, who held
the seat for eight years until 1993, to return to politics and try
to regain it. His Republican opponent, Mike Simpson, is speaker of
the state House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   This raises the prospect that in Idaho, one of the most
conservative and Republican states in the country, Democrats could
pick up two congressional seats now held by Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Political insiders here agree that both races are too close to
predict the outcome with confidence, but say that if they had to
bet they would put their money on the Republicans. The reason, said
John Freemuth, a political science professor at Boise State
University, is that Republicans in Idaho are much better organized
to get their supporters to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The Chenoweth-Williams race took an unusual twist last month
when Mrs. Chenoweth ran a television advertisement in which she
asserted: ``Bill Clinton's behavior has severely rocked this nation
and damaged the office of the president. I believe that personal
conduct and integrity does matter.''
</P>
<P>
   After the commercial was broadcast, The Idaho Statesman reported
that in the 1980s, Mrs. Chenoweth had a six-year affair with a
married man who was her business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Chenoweth acknowledged the affair, calling it a mistake but
emphasizing that at the time, she was single and not in public
office.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has taken the high road. ``My sense,'' he says when
asked, ``is that the people out here care a lot more about real
issues than they do about anyone's personal life, whether it's
Helen Chenoweth's or Bill Clinton's.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the disclosure of her affair, Mrs. Chenoweth has not run
the Clinton advertisement. When the matter came up at the debate on
Thursday, Mrs. Chenoweth's response sounded as if it could have
come out of the mouth of the president:
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to my mistake, I'm not proud of it, but I am proud
of my record in Congress. The Idaho people are far more interested
in what I have done in Congress and what I will be doing in the
future.''

<P>
   October was yet another month when small-capitalization stocks
lagged behind large-cap ones. But here is a reason that small caps
might soon come around: the Federal Reserve's cuts in the discount
rate last month.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by Prudential Securities said small caps respond
particularly well to such rate cuts. Looking at the 12 months that
followed the start of the Fed's last 10 rate reductions, small
stocks did better than large stocks by an average of eight
percentage points, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 10 periods tracked, starting in 1954, the small caps
outperformed large caps in eight of them.
</P>
<P>
   The effect seems to work, to a lesser degree, on mid-cap stocks
as well. The report found that for the 12 months after the start of
the rate cuts, mid caps outperformed large caps by 6.2 percentage
points, on average. They outperformed in the same eight instances.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Claudia E. Mott, director of small-cap research
at Prudential, said investors might be heartened by what happened
in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1973-74 recession, small stocks suffered, losing about
one-half their value at the low point. But after the Fed cut the
discount rate in December 1974, small stocks eventually rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   For a year, they merely tracked large caps. Then, at the end of
1975, they soared. ``The kind of undervaluation one sees in the
small caps today was evident back then, and perhaps some of the
large-cap overvaluation exists as well,'' Ms. Mott wrote. &QL;
</P>

   For years, municipal bond investors had no way to tell if the
price of a bond quoted by a broker was good, bad or indifferent,
unless they canvassed other brokers. That will end this month when
the Bond Market Association, a trade group, begins daily postings
on its World Wide Web site of 1,000 muni transactions tracked by
the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
</P>
<P>
   The data will be available free at www.investinginbonds.com. The
site will include credit ratings, insurance data and yields,

Standard &AMP; Poor's.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Not all hedge funds are hush-hush. Consider the tiny Loring
Fund, with $1 million in assets, managed by Patrick O'Neill of
Loring Investments in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's strategy and holdings are disclosed on his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched Peter Lynch and Jim Rogers telling what they are
buying and what they are selling,'' O'Neill said. ``I thought, `Why
shouldn't hedge funds do the same thing?' So I decided to put mine
on the World Wide Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund is relatively straightforward by hedge fund standards,
with 7 percent of its assets in cash and a moderately hedged
position. Top holdings include Netscape Communications, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and a clutch of small-cap stocks.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill said he began the fund in 1996 with $200,000 and lost 17
percent that year, ``trying to figure out what to do.'' The fund
returned 72 percent in 1997, and 34 percent so far this year
through Oct. 1. The Web site is www.stockbook.com.

   A play on Cuba? Sure. Thomas J. Herzfeld, an investment adviser
in Miami, plans to offer a closed-end Cuba fund that would invest
primarily in companies permitted to do business there.
</P>
<P>
   If the trade embargo against Cuba is lifted, the fund will also
invest directly in Cuban businesses, according to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing.
</P>
<P>
   Herzfeld already runs the $9 million closed-end Caribbean Basin
fund, which invests in companies that operate in the Caribbean and
that should also benefit from a lifting of the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Its only Cuban investment is $160,000 of Republic of Cuba
sovereign debt, which the fund values at zero because of a lack of
reliable trading data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always believed that the lifting of the Cuban embargo
would be the single most important economic factor in the region,''
he said.

   NATION'S ECONOMIC OUTPUT SURPASSES EXPECTATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The nation's gross domestic product grew at a surprisingly
strong 3.3 percent pace this summer, as auto makers rebuilt
inventories after the General Motors strike and consumers spent
money as fast as they earned it. In addition, the inflation rate
fell to its lowest level since 1963. The most comprehensive measure
of inflation rose at a mere eight-tenths of 1 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   The figures indicate that America's economy is holding up far
better than most experts had expected despite months of financial
turmoil and heightened anxiety about contagion from the rest of the
world. The news sent stock markets soaring.
</P>
<P>
   PLAN TO CONTAIN TURMOIL ENDORSED
</P>
<P>
   The leading industrial nations endorsed President Clinton's
proposal to help protect vulnerable but healthy nations from the
kind of currency and stock market upheavals that have battered
nations from Asia to Latin America in the last year. The proposal
would establish a line of credit making billions of dollars
available to some countries to thwart speculative selling of their
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil stocks surged 7.78 percent on the agreement, which could
lead to a $45 billion credit line for Latin America's biggest
economy. Other Latin markets also rose sharply.
</P>
<P>
   BONDS TUMBLE, PUSHING UP YIELDS
</P>
<P>
   The price of 30-year bonds plummeted as a wealth of good news
sapped demand for Treasury securities. The declines rounded out the
worst month for 30-year bonds in more than a year, as signs of
stability in world markets and two interest rate cuts by the
Federal Reserve prompted investors to begin buying riskier
securities again. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 5.15
percent from 5.08.
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH AIRWAYS DELAYING ALLIANCE
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said that it would phase in its alliance with
American Airlines over the next five years because of delays by
European and United States regulators.
</P>
<P>
   CASINOS SPENDING HEAVILY FOR VOTES
</P>
<P>
   Facing vital ballot initiatives and continuing to fight for
increased acceptability across the country, the gambling industry
and its supporters this year have contributed about $85 million in
campaign funds leading into next week's election.
</P>
<P>
   HANG SENG INDEX JUMPS 2.25 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong stocks closed higher as cash-rich foreign investment
funds streamed into the market, putting sidelined money back to
work. The Hang Seng index gained 223.48 points, or 2.25 percent, to
close at 10,154.94, its highest point since May 4.
</P>
<P>
   KELLOGG EARNINGS DECREASE
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg said third-quarter earnings dropped 31 percent because
of softness in the cereal market and the cost of investments
intended to strengthen its international position.
</P>
<P>
   PROTESTS IN CYBERSPACE
</P>
<P>
   Until they declared ``Netwar'' against the Mexican Government,
Ricardo Dominguez and Stefan Wray earned their activist credentials
the old-fashioned way, attending rallies in support of the
Zapatista rebels, handing out pamphlets, shouting political
slogans. Now, the two New Yorkers, founders of the Electronic
Disturbance Theater, organize ``virtual sit-ins'' and recruit
computer programmers to attack the World Wide Web sites of any
person or company they deem responsible for oppression. Their new
rallying cry: ``The revolution will be digitized.''

DOW SURGES 97.07; MONTH'S GAIN IS HIGHEST SINCE JANUARY '87 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices barreled ahead Friday after
industrialized countries unveiled a new mechanism for stabilizing
distressed economies and the United States said its growth was
faster over the summer than analysts had predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Large stocks again set the pace, with the Dow Jones industrial
average climbing 97.07 points, or 1.14 percent, to finish at
8,592.10, its highest level since Aug. 25. At one stage Friday, the
average was up by 165 points. The average's rise of 749.48 for the
month made October 1998 the average's best month since January
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Other gauges also rose solidly, including the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies, which has rebounded 21.9 percent from its low
of three weeks ago to qualify this group as entering a bull market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mood perception has shifted,'' said Gordon Fines, senior
portfolio manager at American Express Financial Advisers in
Minneapolis. ``There's a continuing flow of money back into the
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The bond market, which interpreted the rapid 3.3 percent
third-quarter growth pace of the economy as diminishing the chance
for another interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, tumbled
enough to push rates on Treasury securities up by as much as
one-eighth of a percentage point. Bonds also suffered from the
continuing withdrawal of money that had earlier swung to them from
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Agreement by the Group of Seven industrialized countries on a
new stabilization fund seemed to clear the way for a rescue package
fashioned for Brazil by the International Monetary Fund. Brazil's
Bovespa stock market index soared 7.78 percent. Mexico's Bolsa
jumped 4.28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   American financial issues were outstanding performers Friday,
especially brokerage stocks. Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette jumped
5}, to 35}, after having traded as low as 20] three weeks ago,
while Charles Schwab rose 3 13/16, to 48, and Lehman 3 7/16, to 38.
</P>
<P>
   But the Commerce Department's report of a hefty economic
expansion over the summer gave a clear lift to stocks tied to the
business cycle. Dow Chemical was up 3 7/16, to 93 9/16,
International Paper 2[, to 46 7/16, and Union Pacific 1{, to 47|.
Most airline stocks boomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave more confidence to the market,'' said Cummins
Catherwood, a managing director at Rutherford, Brown &AMP; Catherwood
in Philadelphia, referring to the third-quarter growth. ``The
economy's okay, not out of control.'' Some analysts have forecast a
recession next year as the impact of foreign distress intensifies.
</P>
<P>
   While not predicting a contraction in business activity, William
Meehan, chief market analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, was leery about
stocks, noting that the prices of issues comprising the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index were nearing a lofty and almost
unprecedented 30 times earnings.

<P>
   ``If we have any earnings growth next year, it'll be
negligible,'' Meehan predicted.

   American Express, up 2 13/32, to 88 13/32, was the biggest
factor in the blue-chip index, which has rebounded about 1,050
points, or 14 percent, from its low at the end of August. The gain
for October alone, historically one of the weaker months, was
almost 750 points.

   Elsewhere, Kellogg was one of the few major companies to report
third-quarter earnings Friday, and despite a 34 percent decline,
its stock managed a gain of 13/16, to 33.

   Among the airlines, Delta climbed 5 7/16, to 105|, AMR rose 3[,

   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index gained 12.74 points, or 1.17

Reno Air, up 4{, to 22}, and Telebras, the Brazilian phone company,
up 4 3/16, to 76. On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing issues
outnumbered declines by 2,215 to 880. Volume was 785 million

EXCERPTS FROM RULING ON NEWS LEAKS IN STARR PROBE 
</HEADLINE>
  (with STARR-NEWSLEAKS) 
(bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from an order by U.S.
District Court Judge Norma Hollaway Johnson of dated Sept. 25, in
which established her reasons for ordering that member of the
independent counsel's office must show cause why they should not be
held in contempt of court for disclosures in 24 news reports. The
order was made public by the court Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On June 19, 1998, the court ordered the Office of the
Independent Counsel (O.I.C.) and individual members therein to show
cause why they should not be held in contempt for violations of
Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 6(e)(2). The Court also set
forth procedures to be followed at a show cause hearing that would
include the participation of counsel for President Clinton, the
White House, Monica Lewinsky, Bruce Lindsey and Sidney Blumenthal
(collectively ``mavants''). In a second order, entered on June 26,
1998, the court clarified its June 19 order and outlined further
procedures related to the show cause hearing including permitting
the movants to undertake limited discovery of press contacts with
the O.I.C. The O.I.C. appealed the court's procedural rulings
permitting movants to take discovery and to participate in the show
cause hearing. In its emergency appeal, the O.I.C. did not contest
the court's finding that prima facie violations of Rule 6(e) had
been established by at least six news reports. Rather, the O.I.C.
strenuously objected to the procedures that the court had adopted
in order to conduct the show cause hearing; the O.I.C. argued that
any show cause hearing and related discovery must be conducted ex
parte and in camera. The Court of Appeals vacated the procedural
aspects of the court's June 19 and June 26 orders and remanded for
further proceedings consistent with its opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Presently before the court is the O.I.C.'s ex parte memorandum
requesting that the court outline further procedures for the O.I.C.
and its members to show cause why they should not be held in
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 6(e) provides, in relevant part, that ``an attorney for the
Government, or any (such Government personnel . . . as are deemed
necessary by an attorney for the Government to assist an attorney
for the Government in the performance of such attorney's duty to
enforce Federal criminal law) shall not disclose matters occurring
before the grand jury, except as otherwise provided in these rules.
. . . A knowing violation of Rule 6 may be punished as a contempt
of court.'' It is clear that the secrecy requirements of Rule 6 (e)
apply to the O.I.C..
</P>
<P>
   Our courts have consistently recognized the importance of
secrecy to the proper functioning of our grand jury system,
specifically noting ``several distinct interests served by
safeguarding the confidentiality of grand jury proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court outlined the ``several distinct interests
protected by Rule 6(e) as follows: First, if preindictment
proceedings were made public, many prospective witnesses would be
hesitant to come forward voluntarily, knowing that those against
whom they testify would be aware of that testimony. Moreover,
witnesses who appeared before the grand jury would be less likely
to testify fully and frankly, as they would be open to retribution
as well as to inducements. There also would be the risk that those
about to be indicted would flee, or would try to influence
individual grand jurors to vote against indictment. Finally, by
preserving the secrecy of the proceedings, we assure that persons
who are accused but exonerated by the grand jury will not be held
up to public ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, enforcing Rule 6(e) is of the utmost importance to
the integrity of our grand jury process.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, the Court of Appeals has held that a district
court ``must conduct a `show cause' hearing'' if a motion for order
to show cause establishes a prima facie violation of Rule 6(e). To
establish a prima facie case, movants must show that media reports
disclosed information about matters occurring before the grand
jury'' and indicated that the sources of the information included
attorneys and agents of (O.I.C.).'' Once a prima facie case is
established, ``the burden of rebutting the prima facie case will
lie with the independent counsel, who must now come forward with
evidence, in whatever form the district court requires (including
affidavits, depositions, production of documents, or live
testimony) to rebut the inferences drawn from the news articles
that established the prima facie case of a Rule 6(e) leak to the
press by personnel in or `close to' the (independent counsel's)
office.'' If the court finds that a member of the O.I.C. violated
Rule 6(e)(2), it may order appropriate relief such as contempt
sanctions and equitable relief.
</P>
<P>
   In order to establish a prima facie case, movants must first
demonstrate that the media reports disclosed ``matters occurring
before the grand jury.'' The D.C. Circuit has held that the scope
of grand jury secrecy is necessarily broad in order to properly
effectuate the several distinct objectives of Rule 6(e). ``It
compasses not only the direct revelation of grand jury transcripts
but also the disclosure of information which would reveal `the
identities of witnesses or jurors; the substance of testimony, the
strategy or direction of the investigation, the deliberations or
questions of the jurors and the like. In light of the ``broad reach
of grand jury secrecy,'' the Court of Appeals has held that Rule
6(e) covers ``naming or identifying grand jury witnesses; quoting
or summarizing grand jury testimony; evaluating testimony;
discussing the scope, focus and direction of the grand jury
investigations and identifying documents considered by the grand
jury and conclusions reached as a result of the grand jury
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``the fact that (a witness) was subpoenaed to
testify, the fact that he invoked (a) privilege in response to
questions, (and) the nature of the questions asked'' of him are
``according to our precedent `matters occurring before the grand
jury.' '' Furthermore, statements by prosecutors which disclose
when an indictment will be presented to the grand jury, who will be
charged in the indictment and what crimes will be charged also
violate the secrecy requirement of Rule 6(e). ``The touchstone is
whether disclosure would tend to reveal some secret aspect of the
grand jury's investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ....
</P>
<P>
   In addition to establishing that media reports disclosed
``matters occurring before the grand jury'' movants must also show
that such reports ``indicated that the source of the information
included attorneys and agents of the (O.I.C.). When deciding
whether movants have met their burden, the court must treat all
statements in the news reports as true with respect to what was
disclosed and by whom. Thus, if a news report explicitly identifies
the source of information protected by Rule 6(e)(2), the court must
accept this attribution as correct for purposes of the prima facie
case.
</P>
<P>
   While an article expressly identifying the O.I.C. as the source
of the Rule 6(e) information clearly supports a prima facie case,
``(t)he article submitted need only be susceptible of an
interpretation that the information reported was furnished by an
attorney or agent of the (O.I.C.); in fact, ``(i)t is not necessary
for (an) article to expressly implicate the (O.I.C.) as the source
of the disclosures if the nature of the information disclosed
furnishes the connection.''

 &HT;    APD seeks more diversity, improved community policing
 &HT;    By Bob Banta
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Austin area police agencies can improve
community policing by creating programs to help minority officers
become managers, the retired chief of the Los Angeles Police
Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Williams, who took over the Los Angeles force in 1992 and
piloted it through the turbulent aftermath of the Rodney King
beating, spoke to more than 100 law officers at a seminar at
Huston-Tillotson College in Austin. The gathering occurred as the
Austin Police Department's has been working to attract more African
Americans, Hispanics and women to its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Giving minorities a chance to rise to command positions is an
important part of a police department's ability to diversify, said
Williams, who is African American.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must identify those individuals in your department who
display leadership and give them career support,'' he said. ``There
is great strength in having a minority officer who can talk with
people in a neighborhood and say: 'I know what you're going
through. I've been there.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Austin police recruiters says they have fallen short of
their goal of hiring officers with minority backgrounds for their
January cadet class. Of the 43 eligible candidates, 9 percent are
Hispanic males, 16 percent are black men, 7 percent are white
females, and 2 percent are Hispanic females.
</P>
<P>
   Austin Police Chief Stanley Knee said Friday that despite those
shortfalls, he expects the demographic breakdown of sworn officers
to meet city diversity standards by the fall of 1999, when three
more cadet classes will have graduated. Those standards call for a
police force that is 11 percent African American, at least 20
percent Hispanic, 3 percent Asian and at least 15 percent women.
</P>
<P>
   Knee said that the lack of ideal ethnic diversity in the ranks
is being offset by extra ethnic-sensitivity training for officers.
Every officer on the force has been given 10 hours of diversity
training. Additional sensitivity training is also woven into
academy curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as career management, over the next 18 months, we hope
to implement improved management and supervisory courses for our
officers,'' said Knee. ``I think by having a diverse department, it
makes it easier to do (community policing).''
</P>
<P>
   Under the principles of community policing, officers discuss
neighborhood problems with residents on their beats to solve crime
problems before they become crises.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who retired as chief of the L.A. force in 1997, said
Friday that when he first became an officer on the Philadelphia,
Pa., police force in 1964, the only career support he received was
from a black police captain who held study groups at his home for
officers preparing to take tests for promotion.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of his own experiences, Williams urged minority
officers to seek out mentors in their own departments and to form
their own study networks to get ready for tests.

 &HT;    How the Bulldogs and Florida match up
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RUSHING OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have struggled running the ball this season, but it
appears the Gators may be taking some drastic steps to correct it.
Florida has shuffled its offensive line, inserting run blockers
Corey Yarbrough at center, Cheston Blackshear at right guard and
Cooper Carlisle at right tackle. The Gators need a strong
performance from first-time starter Eugene McCaslin, who's probably
better than Georgia's runners, who will have a tough time against
an outstanding defense.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   PASSING OFFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Florida quarterback Doug Johnson has been inconsistent
throughout his three-year career, plagued by mental mistakes and
very poor decisions. Georgia needs to put plenty of pressure on the
junior and contain wideout Travis McGriff. Georgia freshman Quincy
Carter has been outstanding, carrying the Dogs to a 6-1 record. The
Bulldogs need big games from senior Tony Small, tight ends Jermaine
Wiggins and Larry Brown and two-way star Champ Bailey against a
questionable Gators secondary. Can Georgia give Carter enough time?
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   RUSHING DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Both teams have been outstanding, but Florida may have the
nation's best front seven. The Gators are allowing only 74 yards on
the ground per game; Georgia is averaging 161.4 yards rushing. The
Bulldogs need to shut down Florida's running game, which would
force Johnson to throw early and often. ADVANTAGE: FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   PASSING DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   Again, both defenses have done extremely well against the pass.
Georgia's secondary is more experienced with All-America candidate
Bailey at cornerback and strong safety Kirby Smart. The Gators are
using redshirt freshman Bennie Alexander at right cornerback and
first-year starter Rod Graddy at strong safety. Both teams need to
establish a strong pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   SPECIAL TEAMS
</P>
<P>
   Both teams' kicking games have been inconsistent. Florida has a
walk-on place-kicker in Jeff Chandler; Georgia has a walk-on punter
in Wynn Kopp. But the Gators lead the nation in kickoff returns and
have two sprinters in John Capel and Robert Gillespie. That could
be a key in field position.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   COACHING
</P>
<P>
   A matchup of two of college football's best offensive minds.
Spurrier admits that Georgia's Jim Donnan out-coached him last
year, using a plethora of offensive looks to confuse the Gators
defense. But Spurrier has had this game circled for months, and
he's had two weeks to prepare.

 &HT;    Governor candidates speak on capturing House majority
 &HT;    By Ken Herman and Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHERMAN, Texas _ Republican Gov. George W. Bush, cheerleading
for his ticket on Friday, declined to say that Republican control
of the state House should guarantee election of a GOP speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, confronted with the question at campaign stops in Sherman
and Wichita Falls, clung to a hands-off position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will let the decision of the House members be the decision
of the House members,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The House will pick a speaker when it convenes in January. Pete
Laney, D-Hale Center, is expected to win re-election if the
Democrats retain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that as many Republicans win as possible,'' said Bush,
expressing hope that the GOP has a chance at picking up the eight
seats the party needs to have a majority in the 150-member House.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Laney have forged a solid working relationship. Laney
has steered clear of endorsing Democratic challenger Garry Mauro in
the gubernatorial race.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro on Friday dismissed the speaker speculation as moot. The
Republicans, he said, will not gain a House majority next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they really think they are, then they are going to be in
for just as big a surprise as George W. Bush, who thinks he's going
to win, too,'' Mauro said on a campaign day that took him to
Austin, Houston, Grand Prairie and Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who also campaigned Friday in Texarkana, was joined in
Sherman by Rep. Ron Clark, a Republican seeking re-election, and in
Wichita Falls by Ron Buffum, a Republican seeking an open House
seat. Like Bush, Clark and Buffum declined to say the House should
be led by a Republican if that party has a majority in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush has appeared in campaign brochures for House
candidates around the state _ including some Democrats _ he said
Friday there is not much he can do to influence legislative races.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing a governor can do is help a candidate become
well-funded,'' Bush said in Wichita Falls. ``But state House
politics are very local elections. What matters most in a state
House race is coffee house chatter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro said the GOP capture-the-House strategy is a part of an
overall big-bucks effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans think they can win just by throwing money
around,'' he said. ``That's how they think they can solve problems
_ with money, not by addressing issues or problems. But Texans
aren't going to buy that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro noted that the GOP spent $2 million on a registration
drive for suburban voters, with what he insisted are minimal
results. ``Early voting is way down. Their suburban voters aren't
materializing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if Republicans should take control of the state House and
retain control of the Senate, Mauro said he sees no problem working
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be so shocked that I beat George Bush that
they will know Texans have sent a message. We'll work closely
together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In other campaign news Friday, abortion rights proponents
endorsed Democratic attorney general candidate Jim Mattox. The
Texas Abortion Rights Action League said Republican John Cornyn
supports reversing the court decision that established abortion as
a woman's right.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn opposes abortion personally ``but he will uphold the law,
period,'' said his spokeswoman Michele Kay.

 &HT;    Battle continues in race for Texas House seats
 &HT;    By Mike Ward and Dave Harmon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Republican Party's push to capture control
of the Texas House has become an all-out battle of big money.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the $125,000 or so that political consultants say it
typically takes to mount a House campaign, candidates in targeted
districts have raised at least that much in the last 30 days alone,
according to Texas Ethics Commission records.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans need to capture eight additional seats to take
control of the Texas House for the first time this century and in
the past 30 days GOP loyalists and political action committees have
dumped more than $2 million into campaigns in 16 districts that
they believe they can win _ with GOP candidates in 15 of those
districts receiving in excess of $100,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates in those same districts have raised
$850,000 in the same one-month period that ended Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 18 years in this business, I've never seen this much
money being spent on state House races,'' said Brian Eppstein, a
Fort Worth political consultant whose resume includes electing more
Republicans to the House than any other adviser _ among 160 House
races that include successful campaigns for 43 current lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total war for power in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the GOP candidates receiving large contributions include
Larry Taylor of Friendswood, who raised $220,515 in 30 days as he
tries to unseat incumbent Democrat Craig Eiland of Galveston in the
24th District. Eiland raised about $88,000 over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Close behind is Eddie Schauberger, a Republican from Liberty
taking aim at Democrat Zeb Zbranek in District 20. Schauberger had
raised about $47,000 in three months before three PACs began
funneling money into his campaign. Of the $188,566 Schauberger
raised between Sept. 25 and Oct. 24, more than $100,000 came from
Texans for Lawsuit Reform, Associated Republicans of Texas, and
Eight in '98 _ political committees whose goal is GOP control.
</P>
<P>
   Zbranek, a three-term incumbent who raised about $10,000 less
than his challenger from July to September, is suddenly $164,000
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those (PACs) have been recruiting my opponents the last
several times,'' said Zbranek, who spent less than $30,000 when he
won the seat in 1992. ``They want me to vote the way they want on
their special issues. They've tried to pressure me, and I've said
no, and this is the recourse they take.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, both sides are cautiously claiming victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to get to the majority, and we're going to make
that,'' said a confident Milton Rister, director of the Eight in
'98 campaign which is driving for a GOP majority _ and a
speakership for Rep. Tom Craddick of Midland _ and expects to spend
$700,000 on this year's House elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 64-dollar question right now is just how many seats we
will take.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Black, spokesman for the Republican Party of Texas,
predicts they will win at least 10 additional seats. But GOP
consultant Karl Rove says he expects to win half as many, slightly
less than a majority.
</P>
<P>
   And while Harold Cook, the Texas Democratic Party's political
director, sees little chance Republicans will win a majority,
``they think they can take the House and they're sure blowing a lot
of money because of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they're running some second-rate candidates against
qualified, experienced Democrats and they've got to buy a lot of
makeup to make them look good to voters,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are spending whatever they think it will
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Black and Rister say Democrats are just as reliant on big-money
donations from their own special interests. In the past month,
Black said trial lawyers alone have contributed $1.7 million into
Democrat coffers. Forty Democratic contributors have contributed a
total of $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have raised less than that, and we have 1,690
contributors,'' Black said. ``You tell me who's the Big Tent
party.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook insists Democrats are just trying to keep up. ``The
Republicans raised the bar in the House races . . . and we will
match the Republicans this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans steadily gaining clout in elections this decade
_ 1996 marked the first year the party was on the primary ballot in
all 254 Texas counties _ Black, Rister and others said they think
the outlook for controlling the Texas House is rosy.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the strength of our governor and the strength of our
ticket, we think the dynamics are such that we will win,'' Black
said. ``If there is a Clinton factor, it will be in our favor. We
have more Republicans running in grassroots races than ever before
_ more than 1,000 _ and their families and friends and neighbors
are voting Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with just days to go before Election Day, most
consultants on both sides concede privately that races in as many
as 15 of the most hotly contested House races are too close to
call.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there is hand-to-hand combat going on in 12 to 15
legislative races that could go either way,'' Eppstein said. ``And
these races are tight, not because of any local issues, but because
of the amount of money that is being spent by both parties. For the
first time, state rep races are a boon to the state's economy this
year because of the amounts of money that are being spent on
them.''

 &HT;    Glenn gives video report on experiments
 &HT;    (Eds: Tightens lede, fourth graf, combines GLENN-DOOR info.)
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. _ Sen. John Glenn reported from space
Friday that he has adjusted easily to weightlessness. Then, as if
to prove he was feeling fine, he used a video uplink to once again
talk up the scientific purpose on his flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is right on the timeline so far,'' Glenn said while
holding himself in place with his arm against a middeck bulkhead,
``and we just want to keep it that way and make sure we get back
all the good results we thought we'd get on all the research
experiments that are on board because that's the main reason we're
up here.''
</P>
<P>
   Since being named to the shuttle crew last January, Glenn, 77,
has pushed relentlessly to focus the limelight on Discovery's
scientific payload and away from his historic return to space after
36 years.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's attempt to divert attention from the space-pioneer
legend was a tough sell. As happened throughout the eight months of
training for the flight, Glenn's joyful reminiscences continually
crept into practical matters.
</P>
<P>
   Like the nighttime pass over a luminescent Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long time ago that I looked at the same thing and it
looks beautiful,'' Glenn said as the space shuttle flew 340 miles
above the earth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, the year of Glenn's first orbital flight, the people of
Perth burned every light in their coastal city so he would see it
as he passed over. Some even staked white sheets to their lawns to
reflect the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lights show up very well and thank everybody for turning
them on, will you?'' Glenn said during that original flight.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the first full day in orbit, after Thursday's launch,
which Glenn called a ``great ride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was keyed in with every little noise and quiver we made on
the way up,'' he said. ``It was quite different from the ride I got
before, of course, a long time ago...''
</P>
<P>
   One hitch in the otherwise perfect launch was the loss of an
11-pound, 18-by-22-inch door to the dragchute compartment in
Discovery's tail. A TV camera on the launch pad showed it bouncing
off a shuttle engine.
</P>
<P>
   A technical ``tiger team'' is analyzing potential impacts the
loss of the panel could have on the flight and landing, NASA's
chief flight director said Friday at Johnson Space Center in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a meeting every day for probably the next four
or five days'' to examine safety issues, said Jeff Bantle,
operations director for the mission.
</P>
<P>
   Bantle said Mission Control plans to have the winged orbiter
land as usual at Kennedy Space Center. The pilots will not deploy
the dragchute, and they will be ready to jettison it quickly if it
deploys during landing.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern to Glenn was fully experiencing weightlessness
for the first time. He said he did not go through the period of
nausea that is common for astronauts adjusting to weightlessness,
although he worried that he would. Although he's never been prone
to getting air sick, Glenn has been vulnerable to seasickness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1962, Glenn could only loosen the straps of his seat in the
capsule, so he didn't experience weightlessness then the way he has
now.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out, he likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the personal side of it, to be able float around like this
in zero g,'' he said, ``I just wish everyone could experience
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last time, Glenn flew for just under five hours, the primary
purpose being to prove it could be done.
</P>
<P>
   His current mission will have him in space for nine days. He
returns next Saturday, and this trip he has a lot more to do.
</P>
<P>
   But with all of the shuttle's tasks well on schedule _ in fact,
some things were activated early _ the only on-board problem
reported so far was a mishap with his oatmeal as he dealt with
floating foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One little speck wound up on my glasses,'' Glenn said,
smiling. ``I guess with old folks you normally think it goes down
on an old man's necktie, but on this one it went up on my
glasses.''

IN EIGHTH DAY, MICROSOFT TRIAL SLOWS ITS PACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Shortly after Dr. Avadis Tevanian joined Apple
Computer Inc. as a senior executive last year, he recalls, a
software developer warned him that if Apple did not stop selling
its highly successful QuickTime multimedia software product,
``Microsoft would take any necessary action to drive Apple out of
businesss.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months later, ``I appreciate the prophetic import of
his words,'' Tevanian stated in written testimony as a government
witness in the antitrust trial against Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian, a close lieutenant of Apple's co-founder and acting
chief executive, Steve Jobs, was vice president of engineering at
Jobs' Next software until Apple acquired Next in 1997. Now an Apple
senior vice president, he is scheduled to take the stand in U.S.
District Court on Monday morning to face cross-examination by
Microsoft lawyers, who will try to impeach his direct written
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In the direct testimony, made public Friday evening, Tevanian
accuses Microsoft of threatening and bullying Apple to drop support
for Netscape Communications Corp.'s browser for navigating the
World Wide Web and instead to favor Microsoft's Internet Explorer
browser. If Apple refused, he said, Microsoft executives, in
several discussions with Apple, threatened to stop developing and
supporting crucial Microsoft business software for Apple's
Macintosh operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian testified that Microsoft had also repeatedly pressured
Apple to drop out of the multimedia software market, in which
Apple's QuickTime program for playing audio, video and animated
graphics files is a de facto industry standard.
</P>
<P>
   When Apple refused, he said, Microsoft rigged the Windows
operating system so that, in many circumstances, QuickTime would
not work on Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   Apple's Macintosh line of personal computers and its operating
system, Mac OS, stand as the only real competition to Microsoft,
though Apple now has less than 5 percent of the market. Almost
every other personal computer in the world runs Microsoft's Windows
operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Tevanian's testimony, Microsoft released a
statement Friday asserting: ``Microsoft and Apple continue to be
great partners after more than 17 years of both competing and
cooperating in the software industry. Microsoft today reiterates
its strong support for the Macintosh and our Macintosh customers.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, Tevanian's testimony echoes that of the man who
preceded him on the witness stand, David Colburn, a senior vice
president at America Online. In his testimony, Colburn described
how Microsoft had used its Windows monopoly to thwart a planned
deal in which America Online was to distribute Netscape's Navigator
as its default browser, that is, the browser distributed with
America Online's software.
</P>
<P>
   By offering America Online an icon on the Windows desktop, the
most valuable real estate in cyberspace, Microsoft was able to
persuade the online service to abandon Netscape and to make
Internet Explorer its default browser.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Tevanian said that while Apple offered both the
Microsoft and Netscape browsers, it had originally chosen Netscape
as its default browser.
</P>
<P>
   But Tevanian testified that when Microsoft chairman Bill Gates
learned of that choice, ``he became very upset,'' and that over the
following months Microsoft used a variety of threats and entreaties
to persuade Apple to make Internet Explorer the default browser.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in mid-May 1997, Tevanian testified, Microsoft told
Apple that it would pull the plug on application programs for the
Macintosh operating system if Apple refused to adopt Microsoft's
browser and declined to settle several other disputes ``on terms
acceptable to Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the programs Microsoft threatened to quit supporting were
its Macintosh versions of Word and Excel, industry-dominating word
processing and spread sheet programs. Both are also part of
Microsoft Office, which has more than 90 percent of the market for
business applications suites.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that domination, Tevanian said, Apple
``desperately needed to maintain support for Microsoft Office for
Macintosh.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the threat, which Tevanian called ``extremely
disturbing,'' Microsoft, he said, ``had made a substantial
investment getting Office 98 for Macintosh ready for market,'' yet
was ``willing to risk an outright loss of that entire investment to
force Apple to terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple gave in and made Internet Explorer the default browser and
agreed not to promote Netscape's browser. As Tevanian describes it,
Microsoft sweetened the deal by making a $150 million investment in
Apple and agreeing to settle some patent disputes. By the time the
deal was announced in August 1997, Apple had lost $1.7 billion over
the previous seven quarters.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Friday, Microsoft said: ``The allegation that
Microsoft threatened to withhold Macintosh Office 98 in order to
force Apple to make Internet Explorer its default browser is
another example of how the government deliberately twists facts to
support its distorted allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian testified that Microsoft also used threats to persuade
Apple not to market QuickTime for Windows computers. At one point,
he testified, Microsoft offered to let Apple continue writing
software tools for creating multimedia files _ a tiny market
consisting mostly of professional developers _ if Apple would cede
the far larger market for software that plays such files on all
computers.
</P>
<P>
   The business tactics he describes echo the central testimony
last week of James Barksdale, the chairman of Netscape, who said
that Microsoft offered to let Netscape sell browsers to the far
smaller pool of non-Windows computers if the company would cede the
Windows browser market to Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian quotes one senior Microsoft executive at a meeting as
saying: ``We're going to compete fiercely on multimedia playback,
and we won't let anybody play back in Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, he said, Apple's multimedia program stopped
working well on Windows computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's statement says: ``While Dr. Tevanian alleges that
Microsoft has somehow intentionally disabled his company's product,
the facts show that Apple's engineers did not properly author the
QuickTime set-up program for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite Dr. Tevanian's accusations, the only known
interoperability issues affecting QuickTime were caused by Apple,
not Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement echoes Microsoft's response when the chief
executive of RealNetworks, Rob Glaser, told the Senate Judiciary
Committee last summer that Microsoft had engineered the Windows
Media Player to ``break'' his company's industry-leading multimedia
software for the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Starting Monday morning, John Warden, Microsoft's lead lawyer in
the antitrust suit, will begin a cross-examination of Tevanian that
is likely to last for several days.

BRAZILIANS ARE UPBEAT OVER IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ While wary of coming negotiations in
Congress over an austerity package to reduce Brazil's crippling
deficits, investors here celebrated Friday over an agreement by the
industrialized nations that opens the way for replenishing
International Monetary Fund coffers with $90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the Brazilian government presented an $80
billion, three-year package of spending reductions, tax increases
and pension cutbacks, a team of Brazilian officials left Friday
night for Washington, where they will go over the austerity package
with IMF officials. They are also expected to work out the details
of a letter of intent between Brazil and the IMF, one of the final
steps before a formal agreement is announced that will create a
special line of credit for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Markets here also surged after a syndicated column in the local
press said the IMF could come up with as much as $45 billion to
back up Brazil. The report was not attributed to any government
official, and Finance Minister Pedro Malan said that no firm figure
had been fixed for the aid, but it was sufficient to lift the
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The Bovespa index in Sao Paulo jumped 7.78 percent Friday,
leading markets across Latin America in a general upswing. In
Argentina, the Merval rose 2.36 percent, while Bolsa of Mexico
jumped 4.28 percent and Venezuela's main index was up 3.57 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been waiting for this IMF package and wondering if
it's being put off for some reason,'' said Rick Johnston, a
managing director at Offitbank in New York. The agreement by
industrialized nations, he said, was ``certainly part of the pop
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Group of Seven industrialized nations on Friday accepted a
series of demands laid out by the U.S. Congress when it approved an
$18 billion contribution to the IMF. The measures are intended to
make the lending agency less secretive and more likely to help
countries well before their economies are in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement should bring in $90 billion that wealthy nations
said would provide the framework for a system to protect emerging
markets from the turbulence that has ravaged their economies for
more than a year. Brazil, Latin America's largest nation, is
considered the most likely candidate for such aid.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference here Friday, Malan said the amount that
Brazil would borrow from the IMF had not been determined. He noted
that Brazil, unlike South Korea, Indonesia, Russia, and other
victims of the financial firestorms over the last year, has not
devalued its currency, the real, or defaulted on debt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's not simple to define the amount, because there is no
immediate need for the money,'' Malan said. ``What there is is a
bet that it's possible to re-establish confidence, and the greatest
demonstration of success of an operation like this will be
precisely a low use of the resources that are made available to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not talking about a rescue operation,'' Malan said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of protecting the currency from devaluation, however,
has been soaring interest rates, which make investments denominated
in the real more attractive but make loans prohibitively costly to
many Brazilian businesses, choking economic growth and increasing
joblessness.
</P>
<P>
   In a sobering reminder of the impact of high interest rates, the
auto parts industry in the Sao Paulo industrial area announced
Thursday that it would be laying off 30,000 workers from a work
force that now totals 80,000.

 By LAURA M. HOLSON and CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stylized map of Manhattan's skyscrapers on the
wall behind Andrew D. Stone's desk at Credit Suisse First Boston is
peppered with tiny yellow dots, each representing a real estate
deal in which he had a hand.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 140 in all, from 17 Battery Place and 40
Wall Street in lower Manhattan to the St. Moritz Hotel on Central
Park South and the Vinegar Factory on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   In just under three years, Stone, a confessed deal junkie and
the head of CS First Boston's principal transaction group, poured
more than $5 billion into commercial real estate loans and equity
investments in New York, a total of $24 billion nationally.
</P>
<P>
   So aggressive was his approach that last February, CS First
Boston backed five of the seven bidders for 48 Wall Street, a
landmark building in the heart of the financial district.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relationships aren't our strength,'' Stone acknowledged last
spring. ``We love the market. If three guys are bidding, we'll back
all three. We don't like to pick the partner we like best.''
</P>
<P>
   But the market Stone loved a few months ago is not the market of
today. The real estate boom that he _ and the investment banks of
Nomura Securities and Lehman Brothers, among others _ had fueled
came to a screeching halt when global turmoil roiled markets in
late summer.
</P>
<P>
   The effects were sudden and drastic. Real estate deals
collapsed. Initial public offerings were called off. The ``flight
to safety'' that drove down stocks as investors sought comfort in
Treasury bonds also decimated the market in the mortgage-backed
securities that Wall Street sold to finance its real estate
lending.
</P>
<P>
   And the sound of knees knocking could be heard at industry
conferences from Houston to Boston, as investors flashed back to
the early 1990s, when inflated property values collapsed and
overbuilt downtowns teemed with dark and half-empty buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't hit our heads on the windshield, but it makes
people think about how the world was five or six years ago,'' said
Mark Teitelbaum, senior managing director of investment sales at
Julien J. Studley Inc., a New York real estate company.
</P>
<P>
   How did real estate _ the most local of businesses _ become
exposed to the hazards of globalization? By coming to rely on Wall
Street, the nerve center of the global economy, for financial
backing.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial banks and savings-and-loan institutions had stumbled
_ and in some cases collapsed _ under the weight of billions in
sour real estate loans in the recession of 1990-91, and they had
all but stopped lending to developers and landlords.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers like Stone and Ethan Penner of Nomura Securities became
the new kingmakers in real estate, stepping in as the traditional
banks bowed out. Their innovation was to turn commercial mortgages
into securities.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of just letting the loans clutter up their own balance
sheets, investment banks pooled the loans; cut the pools up into
classes rated triple-A on down, just like municipal bonds or
commercial paper, and sold the loans _ under the name ``commercial
mortgage-backed securities'' _ to institutions, including pension
funds, hedge funds and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, they shared the wealth _ and risk. And the dollar
value of commercial loans made by investment banks blossomed, from
$17 billion in 1993 to $50 billion in the first eight months of
1998, before the effects of a stumbling market were felt, according
to Commercial Mortgage Alert, a newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   That river of cash invigorated downtown hubs, suburban office
and industrial parks and apartment complexes, as owners renovated
old buildings and added value to their assets. But it also allowed
speculative buyers and developers to outbid each other for
properties, driving prices ever skyward.
</P>
<P>
   Now though, with financial investors demanding steeper returns
on mortgage-backed securities or refusing altogether to buy the
loans warehoused on the investment bankers' balance sheets, Wall
Street has abruptly tightened the capital spigot to a mere trickle.
</P>
<P>
   And as a result, the real estate deals that aren't coming
unwound are shriveling; properties are commanding as much as 25
percent less than sellers expected in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry, the market'll come back,'' Steven Roth, the
chairman of Vornado Realty Trust _ whose stock has fallen to
$33.6875 from a high of $49.1719 in January _ told a crowd of real
estate professionals at a recent conference. ``You'll just be as
old as I am when it does.''
</P>
<P>
   Warnings like that were almost unthinkable three months ago,
and, to students of real estate fundamentals, hard to understand
even now. Demand for office space is rising in most cities,
particularly New York, where there has been limited building the
last seven years. Asking rents in Manhattan jumped more than 28
percent the last two years, according to Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, a
real estate brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For all the immediate pain _ not least the $1.16 billion pretax
loss recorded by Nomura last month, mostly because of losses in its
mortgage-backed business _ that schism is the sign of hope in this
wacky real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   The current troubles are rooted in the way Wall Street financed
growth, not in supply and demand for space. That suggests that the
next downturn in real estate may be less devastating than the last
because the excesses of the market are being weeded out. Already,
bankers are limiting loans to 70 percent of a property's value,
compared with 95 percent three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   In short, with investment banks beholden to fixed-income
investors who won't tolerate losses in their own portfolios, market
discipline is having its salutary effect. ``Gone are the days when
the investment banks are going to buy wildly speculative deals
where the cash flow is not in place,'' said Peter Hauspurg,
chairman of Eastern Consolidated Properties. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Steven C. Witkoff was one of the first real estate meteors to
streak across the New York skyline after the commercial real estate
recession ended in the mid-1990s. Starting with a small 40-year-old
office tower in 1995, he quickly acquired a stable of 30 buildings
in five cities; up to 95 percent of the financing was provided by
Credit Suisse First Boston or Lehman Brothers. For three years,
Witkoff, a former real estate lawyer, was one profitable jump ahead
of the rapidly escalating market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Witkoff had the vision to get in there when nobody else did,''
said Stephen B. Siegel, president of the New York-based real estate
company Insignia/ESG and an adviser to Witkoff. ``He bought his
first building before anyone saw any appeal in the downtown
market.''
</P>
<P>
   But Witkoff's current maneuvering is indicative of just how the
financial markets have shaken the real estate operators who
benefited so handsomely from Wall Street's free flow of financing.
In recent weeks, Witkoff, 41, has struggled to hold his biggest
trophy: the Woolworth Building, the handsome Gothic tower near City
Hall in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   He beat out rival bidders in July with what many experts thought
was a rich offer: $157 million, or $160 a square foot. Three years
earlier, Witkoff and other buyers could have acquired downtown
office buildings for a cheap $17 a square foot. But in the summer
of 1998, buyers had already snapped up the bargains, and many deals
were being based on a projected spike in rents, not existing cash
flow.
</P>
<P>
   Then world markets tumbled, and Lehman backed away in September
from financing the Witkoff deal.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing he would lose the building, but reluctant to pay what
now seemed like an exorbitant price, Witkoff pressed the Venator
Corp., as the Woolworth Corp. had been renamed, to renegotiate.
Venator, anxious to close the deal by the end of the year and
fearing that any other buyer would pay even less, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   They signed a new deal that is scheduled to close in early
December for $137 million, a 14 percent discount from the original
price. Witkoff, who put down a $15 million deposit, is confident
that he will secure the financing.
</P>
<P>
   Witkoff, like other leveraged speculators and developers, has
pulled out of other deals and canceled development plans this fall
as his financing disappeared. One junked deal was his planned
acquisition of 11 buildings from the TIAA-CREF pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying economics of real estate didn't change,'' said
Philip DiGennaro, a managing director of TIAA-CREF who negotiated
with him. ``It's the capital markets that changed, and Witkoff was
concerned about going forward without having his financing locked
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other operators have fared far worse. Crescent Real Estate
Equities, a Fort Worth company controlled by the financier Richard
E. Rainwater and one of the largest commercial landlords in the
country, called off its $465 million purchase of office buildings
in Illinois and California and canceled a $1.5 billion agreement to
buy a casino company.
</P>
<P>
   The developer Harry Macklowe lost a deal _ and possibly his $6
million deposit _ to buy the 22-story building at 460 Park Avenue
in New York after he failed to round up new financing when Lehman
Brothers pulled the plug, according to brokers and bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financing is being pulled left and right,'' said Michael T.
Cohen, president of GVA Williams Real Estate, a prominent landlord
and real estate broker in New York. ``It's cut the legs out from
under the highfliers.''
</P>
<P>
   With the securities markets wilting, Witkoff and Macklowe are
among a group of real estate investors who have had to abandon
plans to take their companies public. Many had gone on shopping
sprees in New York and elsewhere, seeming to pay almost any price
to expand their portfolios on the expectation that they could pay
down their loans and pay off their partners with the proceeds of a
stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   If the economy slows and rents fail to rise as much as these
highly leveraged investors expected, some of them will come under
pressure, either when their loans from the investment banks come
due in three or four years or even sooner.
</P>
<P>
   Jules Demchick, president of the J.D. Carisle Development Corp.
in New York, said he had been contacted by a number of investment
bankers asking whether he would be interested in taking over
development deals on which the banks might have to foreclose.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Witkoff, who pulls in enormous management fees on his
properties, said he could easily weather the storm. Although the
leverage on his properties _ the amount he owes in loans against
them _ ranges from 75 percent to 92 percent of their value, he says
he has cut operating costs and leased vacant space at increasingly
higher rents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've bought solid, cheap bricks in good locations,'' Witkoff
said.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate brokers and developers say that the retreat by Wall
Street lenders has taken the froth out of the market. Besides
falling prices, the number of prospective buyers will probably
drop, too, as lenders insist on higher levels of equity.
</P>
<P>
   But, they add, real estate markets in most of the United States
remains healthy, if only because vacancy rates are low and _ in
most places _ there are few new office towers on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street has gotten religion,'' said Mitchell S. Steir,
executive vice president of Julien J. Studley. ``Instead of chasing
every deal in their path, they've decided to shut off the spigot
for the time being. Now deals will have to stand on merit, rather
than on some dream-like fantasy about rents.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If anyone was the poster boy for Wall Street's aggressive
fueling of the real estate boom in the 1990s, it was Ethan Penner,
the self-proclaimed rock-and-roll banker who started Nomura
Securities' commercial lending unit in 1993 and resigned in
September in a shake-up of Nomura's American operations.
</P>
<P>
   If a developer wanted a quick loan, Penner delivered. At its
zenith, his unit was making $1 billion in commercial loans a month,
for a total of $32 billion before it was spun off in June as a
subsidiary _ the Capital Company of America.
</P>
<P>
   But his popularity with borrowers sometimes came at the expense
of investors.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Penner upset some investors in Nomura's
mortgage-backed securities by not disclosing that one of the bank's
offerings included loans with a novel structure that could result
in lower financing costs for borrowers.
</P>
<P>
   The device, however, could also carry tax implications for
investors. Competitors of Nomura contacted the rating agencies once
they figured out what Nomura was up to. Lehman Brothers was
particularly vocal, and an incensed Penner says he called Richard
S. Fuld Jr., the bank's chief executive, to bawl him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disgrace to your firm,'' Penner says he told Fuld.
</P>
<P>
   A Lehman spokesman would not comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors not told about the loans were angry when
they found out. As a result, the ratings agencies demanded that
Nomura and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which was distributing the
securities, amend the prospectus to fully disclose the terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had just disclosed it, there wouldn't have been a
ruckus,'' said Gale Scott, a managing director in the real estate
finance group at Standard &AMP; Poor's, one of the ratings agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's real estate financiers were caught off guard by
August's front-page news, as Russia stopped payment on its bonds
and both Asian and Latin American markets shuddered. Focused on
real estate fundamentals, they had not counted on the bond market
troubles' widening the spread between their products and Treasury
securities as investors gravitated to less risky investments.
</P>
<P>
   By Aug. 28, bankers were already anxious as the spread on
triple-A commercial mortgage-backed securities grew to 110 basis
points (or 1.1 percentage points) over 10-year Treasury securities,
up from 80 basis points at the beginning of June. By Sept. 25, they
were panicking as the spread reached 145 basis points.
</P>
<P>
   Banks faced trouble on several fronts. Their loan portfolios,
which respond to market activity in ways similar to any sort of
fixed-income investment, fell sharply in value as investors sought
safer havens.
</P>
<P>
   And there were fewer buyers for their mortgage-backed
securities. Criimi Mae Inc., a real estate investment trust that
sought bankruptcy protection on Oct. 5, was said to have backed out
of a preliminary agreement to buy $137 million of subordinated
notes in a $1.3 billion deal offered by the Capital Company of
America in September.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Boyer, a portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, the mutual
fund family in Baltimore, said her company, a buyer of
mortgage-backed securities last spring for some private accounts,
is not investing in the market now, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, real estate is going to go into a downturn,'' she
said. ``We fear what is going to happen _ fear of a collapse.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other complications. If banks did go forward with
securities offerings, the rates they would be compelled to pay
investors would likely be higher than the interest they were
collecting on the loans in their portfolios _ a money-losing
equation. And investors would want to buy only the highest-rated
portions of the deals coming to market, forcing banks to keep the
riskiest loans in their portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Any bank today that is holding loans originated earlier this
year is probably finding those loans under water,'' said John Levy,
chairman of John B. Levy, a real estate investment bank in
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Wall Street simply stopped making new loans. In August,
Credit Suisse First Boston told clients that it was backing away
from more than $750 million in real estate deals and shutting its
financing operations until the market improved. Lehman Brothers
said it would become more ``selective.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the weakest links to emerge. In
mid-September, Capital America disclosed that it had received $113
million in margin calls on its credit lines with Morgan Stanley.
</P>
<P>
   In Tokyo, officials of Nomura Securities began pouring money
into the floundering American real estate operations. By Oct. 22,
when Nomura announced that it was taking a pretax loss of $1.16
billion for the six months ended Sept. 30, the company had sunk
$1.73 billion into bailing out its units in the United States _
fully half the size of the rescue mounted for Wall Street's most
notorious recent basket case, the Long-Term Capital Management
hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Nomura's losses in the United States came from marking
down the value of its huge inventory of real estate-related loans.
Currently, the company has about $10 billion in commercial loans on
its books.
</P>
<P>
   In the heyday of the mortgage-backed securities market, Penner
estimates that his unit made $1 billion for Nomura. But in the wake
of recent losses, many of the bank's top American executives have
resigned _ including Penner, who left with a $30 million severance
package.
</P>
<P>
   Are there more time bombs like Nomura's waiting to go off among
Wall Street's real estate lending operations?
</P>
<P>
   Most banks like to clear loans off their books by year's end.
But December is approaching, and the bond market has shown only
modest improvement in recent weeks. Any bank selling
mortgage-backed securities into this market, traders say, will be
hard-pressed to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Lehman Brothers completed the biggest sale ever of
mortgage-backed securities _ a $3.8 billion offering with interests
in 172 properties, including Manhattan's famed General Motors
building on Fifth Avenue. But because the deal was structured to be
paid off quicker than typical offerings of this sort and had a
floating interest rate, analysts said it did not reflect the health
of the market over &UR;  &LR; all.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the market's genius is at work. With Wall Street's lending
spigot turned low, new sources of capital for the real estate
industry are emerging.
</P>
<P>
   The developer Richard Kalikow recently closed on his $245
million acquisition of the Helmsley Building, at Park Avenue and
45th Street in Manhattan, with backing from the Bass family of
Texas. Now that cash is king and prices are falling, real estate
investment funds like those operated by Apollo Real Estate
Advisors, Blackacre Capital Group and Westbrook Partners _ even
Credit Suisse First Boston's Praedium Fund _ are panting to buy
what they think will be ``excellent opportunities'' when the dust
finally settles, according to real estate executives.
</P>
<P>
   Some investment bankers may change their pinstripes, too. Rumors
abound that Stone, guru of CS First Boston's mortgage-backed
lending operation, will be tossed out, that the investment bank is
losing millions and that he is stuck with $2 billion in high-risk
mortgages no one will dare buy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is talk, too, that Stone is about to start a fund _
with financial support from CS First Boston _ that would invest in
just the sort of low-grade commercial mortgage-backed securities
the bank is having so much trouble selling.
</P>
<P>
   Stone denies most of it, though he acknowledges that his day of
reckoning is near. He said his unit at CS First Boston made ``a
huge amount of money'' in the first half of the year, albeit less
since then. None of his loans are in default, he added. And if he
can reduce the $9.3 billion in American mortgages on the bank's
balance sheet _ by, among other things, selling $4 billion in
securities in two large offerings later this month _ he will be in
good shape, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be sitting pretty, or licking my wounds,'' Stone said.
``I'm feeling very upbeat now.

HONG KONG GIVES FORMER GOVERNOR A BIG WELCOME  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Christopher Patten, the outspoken last governor of
this former British colony, returned this week to a rapturous
welcome from the Chinese city that sent him packing 16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Patten is on a private visit to promote his new book about Hong
Kong and China. But as thousands of people lined up at bookstores
to buy copies signed by Patten _ with many bursting into cheers
when he appeared _ the visit took on the feel of a campaign swing,
heavily tinged with nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all he has done for Hong Kong he deserves our homage and
respect,'' said Yan Chun-yue, 44, a government worker who waited on
line for more than an hour on Friday outside a store in a fancy
shopping mall.
</P>
<P>
   Patten said the response to his visit was on the ``overwhelming
end of the scale.'' Chatting in a rented limousine as he sped from
one book signing to the next, he said: ``I think I represented and
fought for the things that make Hong Kong special such as the rule
of law.''
</P>
<P>
   That is quite a reversal of fortune for Patten, who left a
deeply ambivalent population and an openly hostile Chinese
government when he sailed out of Hong Kong Harbor on July 1, 1997.
Chinese officials called him a ``serpent,'' a ``whore of the East''
and even a ``tango dancer'' for his efforts to strengthen democracy
in the colony before the handover.
</P>
<P>
   But Hong Kong's fortunes have turned, too. For many here,
Patten, a rumpled 54-year-old British politician, symbolizes a time
when the economy boomed and the politics crackled. These days, Hong
Kong is staggering through its worst economic downturn in decades,
while Patten's successor, Tung Chee-hwa, has been criticized for
lackluster leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Patten's book, ``East and West: China, Power, and the Future of
Asia,'' has sold more than 30,000 copies here, according to
executives at Macmillan Publishers Ltd., the British publisher.
They said the average sales for an English-language nonfiction book
in Hong Kong were 500 to 1,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Patten received a public-relations windfall in February when his
first publisher, HarperCollins, part of the News Corp., abruptly
canceled the book under orders from its owner, Rupert Murdoch,
because the book was critical of China. In the United States,
``East and West'' is published by the Times Books unit of Random
House, part of Bertelsmann, AG.
</P>
<P>
   Although Patten was studiously diplomatic about Hong Kong _ he
met Tung on Friday _ the former governor was far less restrained
about China. He said the Chinese government was still violating
human rights. And he accused Western leaders of coddling Beijing in
their zeal to forge business ties. In particular, Patten criticized
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain for not making more of an
issue of human-rights abuses on a recent visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``If whispering behind their hands at meetings with Chinese
officials works it would be good news for all those who are locked
up in Chinese jails,'' Patten said. ``But the truth is if you
proclaim you have an ethical foreign policy, you do rather raise
people's expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten also condemned Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of
Malaysia for imprisoning former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim. When he was in Singapore this week, Patten said, he
telephoned Anwar's wife, Wan Azizah Ismail, who has become the
unofficial leader of a growing opposition movement.

 &HT;    Fright night now just a `candyfest', professor says
 &HT;    By Marcus Franklin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ University of Dayton Professor Jim Farrelly
remembers a time in the 1940s in north Newark, N.J., when he and
his childhood friends made their own, unpretentious costumes for
Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers when they were satisfied with treats such as
homemade popcorn balls, candied or caramel apples or two or three
pennies, and they indulged in yearly hi-jinks.
</P>
<P>
   These days, he said, Halloween has become merely a ``candyfest''
for children and an opportunity for adults to make political
statements with their costumes at parties, said Farrelly, an
English professor who teaches courses on literature and the occult
at U.D.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween has turned into such a mild event,'' Farrelly said.
``It's been turned into a collection of treats. It has lost all
sense of evil.''
</P>
<P>
   Halloween is the top holiday for candy sales and is expected to
generate a record $1.76 billion in candy sales this year, according
to Larry Graham, president of the National Confectioners
Association and the Chocolate Manufacturers Association in McLean,
Va. The holiday has become a celebration of candy and
``pseudo-scary festivities,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   The holiday has come a long way from its origins partly because
of ``marketeers'' who have commercialized Halloween, which hardly
resembles its predecessor, a celebration called Sam Hain.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Hain was celebrated thousands of years ago in areas now
known as Ireland, Scotland and Wales, Farrelly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a time when people actually believed the dead walked
the earth and witches practiced sabbaths,'' Farrelly pointed out.
``People tried to develop ways to avoid them so if they were going
to leave their house, they would put on a costume they thought
would put them in company with the dead so that they wouldn't be
recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrelly said residents also placed candles in windows to mark
their homes as safe havens.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween no longer resembles the All Hallow's Eve harvest
celebration that was established after Irish immigrants moved to
the United States in the mid-1850s and brought remnants of Sam Hain
with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mischief came in the context of city life in the 20th
century with industrialization and when people began tenement
living,'' Farrelly said.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the days when soap, mischief and tomato nights used to
prelude Halloween, he said. Instead, expect to see throngs of kids
on candy hunts disguised as Power Rangers, princesses, ninjas and
ballerinas, among other characters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like an extortion activity,'' Farrelly said with a
chuckle. ``Often times they don't even say 'trick or treat.' They
just hold their bag out and expect to get a treat. If you don't
give them something good such as chocolate, they'll say, `Why'd we
stop here.' ''

 &HT;    Something batty going on in limestone cave
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Dale Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Near the opening of a former limestone quarry
near Lewisburg, a small bat swoops into the tunnel toward a group
of explorers. Like a terrain-hugging fighter jet, the bat climbs
and banks to avoid the people. It is followed by another bat and
another.
</P>
<P>
   On the stone ceiling, tiny bats wrap their wings around and hang
upside-down. The cave is where they will hibernate until spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon the ceiling will be covered with bats,'' said Mark
Schaefer, owner of the 100-acre cave.
</P>
<P>
   The Halloween season is filled with ersatz bats, fanged cutouts
on windows and costumed trick-or-treaters, but real bats are just
as fascinating and a lot less frightening. And there's no better
place to see them than here.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer's bat cave is home to 25,000 bats, the largest colony
in Ohio and Pennsylvania, according to biologist Jackie Belwood,
who runs the bat program from the Cincinnati Nature Center. It is
also home to about 9,300 Indiana bats, which have been on the
endangered species list since 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is certainly the largest population in Ohio of the Indiana
bat,'' said Belwood.
</P>
<P>
   This time of year the bats share the cave with various ghosts
and ghouls, when the Lewisburg Boy Scouts put on a Haunted Cave.
</P>
<P>
   Belwood, however, would like to change the bat's Halloween
image.
</P>
<P>
   She has written a field book, In Ohio's Backyard: Bats , the
first in a series planned on the state's wildlife by the Ohio
Biological Survey.
</P>
<P>
   One place she could start is by changing some of the common
names of bats, such as the big-eared bat, the small-footed bat, the
long-nosed bat or the hoary bat. It seems a bit impolite to point
out that something that already looks like a flying rodent has big
ears, too.
</P>
<P>
   But bats are not rodents, which is one of the myths dispelled in
the book. They're mammals, closer in kind to monkeys and humans,
perhaps the only mammals besides the Wright Brothers to have
mastered winged flight. The bones in the micro-thin wings are
really elongated arms and fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Belwood said bats are in trouble in Ohio and elsewhere, through
loss of habitat, increased use of pesticides, and human lack of
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1960 and 1995, the number of Indiana bats has declined
from around 800,000 to 350,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that rate, it is estimated they will be extinct by 2010,''
Belwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Bats play an important ecological role. They eat thousands of
insects. Each one consumes about its own body weight each night.
Fewer bats could mean greater use of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without them, insect pests would multiply at an alarming
rate,'' Belwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Belwood's book corrects some common misinformation about bats.
</P>
<P>
   They're not blind. All bats have eyes and can see. Hunting for
food at night, however, bats use echolocation, a sensory system
based on sound that allows them to avoid objects and locate food.
</P>
<P>
   Bats don't fly into people's hair. All bats avoid people, using
echolocation and eyesight to stay clear.
</P>
<P>
   Bats live a long time for their size. A Little Brown Bat has
lived to be 34.
</P>
<P>
   Bats can contract rabies, but it is rarer than commonly assumed.
The disease is present in less than one-half of one percent of bat
populations. Wildlife professionals do recommend that people don't
touch a downed, wounded bat. They bite if trapped.
</P>
<P>
   In the tropics, where most of the world's 1,000 bat species
live, bats pollinate plants and disperse the seeds of bananas,
mangoes, avocados, dates, figs, cashews and almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Medical studies of bats' echolocation is being used for learning
ways to treat human deafness.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their fast, erratic flight, bats can be difficult to
study. Their migratory paths are largely unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically bats get ignored because they are difficult to
work with,'' said Belwood.
</P>
<P>
   And although bats usually return to the same nesting areas each
year, they show some adaptability. Most of the species in the U.S.
use abandoned mines as roosts.
</P>
<P>
   In Preble County, wildlife officials have installed grates on
many of the entrances to the cave, which keep people out but let
the bats come and go. There are nine entrances and the bats occupy
spots deep inside, away from the people lined up for the haunted
cave.
</P>
<P>
   At least most of them do.
</P>
<P>
   Schaefer recalled that last year two bats took up residence in a
barrel by the ticket booth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here were thousands of people walking by, throwing their
ticket stubs in the barrel and they were right next to a couple of
bats,'' he said.

 &HT;    Taft, Fisher vie on funding field, spending $10 million combined
 &HT;    By David Gulliver
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Kenneth Rhoads fears the power of money in
politics today. That's why he gave $300 to Lee Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that when you are in a fight, you fight with the
armaments that are there. And what's there is money,'' said Rhoads,
a retired Dayton school administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Zengel builds houses for a living, builds them carefully
and solid, and he sees much of that in Bob Taft. That's why he gave
the Republican $105.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go for anything that's untried, untested,'' Zengel
said. ``I believe in working slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Zengel lives off Mad River Road, in the the heart of Taft
Country, Montgomery County. People in the two ZIP codes covering
parts of Kettering, Miami Township and Centerville gave Taft more
than $60,000 this year, over one-fifth of the money he raised in
the entire Miami Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Rhoads lives in the Dayton View neighborhood, a hotbed of Fisher
support. The area between and around Main Street and Salem Avenue
gave the Democrat $19,698, second only to downtown, where law firms
and unions gave heavily.
</P>
<P>
   While Fisher has raised slightly more money overall, Taft is
drawing much more money locally than his opponent, roughly $3 for
every $2 by Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Taft's heaviest support is the big-money southern end of
Montgomery County, where he reaps thousands from business titans
like the Berry, Mathile and Danis families.
</P>
<P>
   The findings come from a computer analysis of the two
candidates' contributions through mid-October, filed earlier this
week with the Secretary of State. They also can be searched on the
Internet at the Ohio Citizen Action or Secretary of State's
websites.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates have spent nearly $10 million on advertising
since June, when their media blitzes began in earnest. Fisher has
spent $4.8 million, slightly more than Taft's $4.6 million_ on
average, $7 out of every $10 raised.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their mudslinging over the health insurance issue,
neither has closed its wallet to the industry. Taft has accepted at
least $41,000 from HMOs and their executives, but Fisher has
received at least $7,600.
</P>
<P>
   Both amounts are dwarfed by the overall contributions: Fisher
has raised more than $7 million in individual contributions, while
Taft has raised $6.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher leads Taft in money coming from political action
committees (PACs), groups representing a business or issue, with $1
million compared to his opponent's $852,000.
</P>
<P>
   Taft swamps Fisher almost 4-to-1 in Miami County donations,
raising $19,820 to his opponent's $5,050 in the Piqua, Tipp City
and Troy areas. But in northern Warren County ZIP codes, closer to
Taft's Hamilton County roots, he holds only a slim contribution
edge, $23,330 to $19,032.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Taft raised almost $281,000 in the Miami Valley, from
Sidney in Shelby County to Lebanon in Warren County, compared to
about $191,000 for Fisher.
</P>
<P>
   Money is the lifeblood of political campaigns, especially
high-profile statewide races that compete in multiple media
markets. But Fisher supporters say Taft's edge in local money
doesn't mean more local votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans usually out-raise us 2-to-1, 3-to-1, 4-to-1,''
said Dennis Lieberman, chairman of the Montgomery County Democratic
Party. ``Our support is not usually big-money-based.''
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are on more equal fund-raising ground this
time because it's a statewide race, said Jeff Jacobson, chairman of
the Montgomery County Republican Party. Ohio law limits individual
contributions in state office campaigns, unlike local races,
blunting a usual GOP edge. Fisher's experience as attorney general
also gave him ties to Dayton law firms, Jacobson said.
</P>
<P>
   Given Dayton's traditional Democratic roots, Taft backers are
pleased. ``We're doing better than we'd hoped to,'' said Brett
Buerck, Taft's campaign spokesman. He said a low average
contribution_ more than half are $100 or less_ means people are
giving money because they support Taft, not to gain access.
</P>
<P>
   Zengel, for example, said he believes Taft shares his same
beliefs: Government should be more business-friendly and less
intrusive, especially when things seem to be going well. ``I say,
what was wrong with the last six years? Seems like we were living
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhoads believes in his candidate, too. ``I think he has a feel
for people who have children in school. He wants to solve the
problem, because of the children involved, because of the parents
involved, not because of the politics involved. I distrust his
opponent... I believe the opportunity for the people to be heard is
greater with Lee Fisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Money often tips the balance in politics, but it's not clear yet
if that will be the case in Montgomery County. Lieberman said a
party poll last week showed Fisher and Taft in a dead heat_ with
one-third of voters still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``So is money indicative of votes?'' Lieberman said.
``Absolutely not.''

 &HT;    Fisher repeatedly fires against GOP hopeful Taft in last debate
 &HT;    By Debra Jasper
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ This time, it was Democratic gubernatorial candidate
Lee Fisher who came out swinging.
</P>
<P>
   In the third and last debate, before a rowdy crowd of 650 at the
Cleveland City Club, Fisher repeatedly bashed his Republican
opponent Bob Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said Taft backed a failed workers' compensation
initiative that he said would have harmed injured workers, and he
said Taft didn't respond when Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield
threatened to cut health care coverage for 20,000 Ohioans. When a
Piqua woman called both campaigns and asked for help fighting
Anthem's decision, Fisher said Taft did nothing: ``Only one of us
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft disputed Fisher's claims, saying he supports a strong, fair
workers compensation law and HMO reform.
</P>
<P>
   As the candidates attacked each other, the partisan crowd
reacted almost as if they were at a football game. Some jeered and
a couple of times even booed at the other side's remarks, and then
cheered when their candidate spoke.
</P>
<P>
   And what a difference they made. Despite the harsh questions
asked by members of the audience, all the candidates seemed more
relaxed and confident in this debate, the first held outside a TV
studio environment.
</P>
<P>
   Taft in his opening speech joked about the nonflattering
descriptions of him, noting that Bobby Kennedy and Ronald Reagan
had spoken before the City Club and assuring the audience he
``would not let my charisma overshadow these famous gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft, 56, a Cincinnati native, also tried to take some of the
home-team edge away from Fisher, saying he's campaigned in Cuyahoga
County 122 days and feels very much at home here.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, 47, an attorney who emphasized his roots as a native of
the Cleveland suburb of Shaker Heights, exhorted the audience to
look at the candidates' records, not what they say. He then chided
Taft, saying, ``Be consistent. Don't run away from your record.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft was quick to use Fisher's plea that voters look at their
records. When asked why he once voted against the death penalty as
a legislator but now supports it, Fisher said as Ohio's attorney
general he worked with the father of a murdered boy and other crime
victims and came to believe some criminals commit such vicious acts
they deserve the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, Fisher said, as attorney general he fought former
governor Dick Celeste's decision to commute some death sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Taft shot back that Fisher's record is clear. ``The one time he
had the chance to vote on the issue, he voted against the death
penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   John Mitchel, 51, The Reform Party candidate, a retired air
force officer from Beavercreek, said he also changed his mind on
the death penalty. However, while he once supported it he now
opposes it, and said he will remain opposed to it until death row
inmates can afford ``$400-an-hour attorneys.''
</P>
<P>
   Natural Law Party candidate Zanna Feitler, 47, a transcendental
meditation teacher from Shaker Heights, asked the crowd early on to
wave their hands in the air to support their candidate instead of
clapping, in order to minimize interruptions. The request was met
with laughter; the applause continued.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about campaign finance reform, Taft said when he ran
for secretary of state, he supported limiting individual and PAC
contributions, he said, and supports closing any other loopholes.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher retorted that Taft's ``so-called campaign finance
reform'' allowed him to raise nearly $12 million from special
interests. ``True campaign finance reform is not tinkering as Mr.
Taft has done,'' Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he favors spending limits, and giving free air time
to legitimate candidates to ``get money out of the system once and
for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher also tried to score points by drawing attention to a Taft
quote in a recent Cleveland Plain Dealer article. Fisher told the
crowd Taft favors throwing seniors out of nursing homes if they
don't measure up to certain standards. ``Read the quote, Bob,''
Fisher said. ``That's exactly what you said.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was referring to an article which quoted Taft as saying
he would look for ways to save money in the Medicaid program, an
expensive federal-state health care program for the poor, ``One of
the issues that may bear looking at is whether all the patients who
are now in nursing homes really, in fact, need nursing home care of
whether they could be provided for in some lesser-skill facility,''
the article quoted Taft.
</P>
<P>
   Taft said during the debate that all state programs, including
Medicaid, must be examined to ensure taxpayers get what they pay
for. After the debate, however, he stressed that he would not
support removing anyone currently getting care from a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said after the debate that he was happy he could compare
records because Taft is ``inventing himself'' as he goes along.
Fisher, who has been trailing Taft in the polls, said the momentum
is on his side, and he will travel the state all weekend telling
voters about how he differs from Taft.
</P>
<P>
   While Fisher declined to say whether he beat Taft in the debate,
Fisher's wife, Peggy had no such qualms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee gave (Taft) a black eye,'' she said, jubilantly. ``He
whipped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walking out the door, she turned to Taft's spokesman, Brett
Buerck, and said he should come and visit them after the campaign
``if you need employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Buerck retorted, ``You are making campaign promises your husband
can't keep.''
</P>
<P>
   Taft repeated the phrases he used in prior debates, telling the
crowd they've heard friendly and not-so friendly discussion and now
must decide. He warned them not to return to the ``tax and spend
days of the 80s.'' He said a vote for him is a vote to ``keep Ohio
on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher ended by telling the audience, ``Education, health care,
fighting crime. These are not words from my lips during a debate,''
Fisher said. ``This is the work of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Feitler closed by saying if voters chose her, she would put all
three of the other candidates to work. She said Taft is the perfect
candidate to tutor in a children's reading program; Fisher would be
a great ombudsman to help patients get treated fairly by their
insurance companies; and Mitchel could use his military experience
to root fraud, waste and abuse from the system.
</P>
<P>
   Elect her and ``make Ohio heaven on earth,'' Feitler said.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchel said they must choose from three candidates: himself,
Feitler or Taft or Fisher. That's only three candidates, he said,
because Taft and Fisher ``are both the same.''

SHERIFF DIES BUT REMAINS ON THE BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DON TERRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After several days in a hospital following a fall
in his home, Sheriff Sherman Block of Los Angeles County died on
Thursday from a massive brain hemorrhage. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   But Block's family and supporters hope voters will still
re-elect him to a fifth term on Tuesday as a tribute, and as a way
to keep his opponent out of the sheriff's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Block was first elected sheriff in 1982, and since then he
became the nation's highest-paid public official, surpassing even
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Already two of the five members of the county board of
supervisors, which oversees the sheriff's department, Michael
Antonovitch and Don Knabe, have said they will vote for Block.
</P>
<P>
   ``The campaign moves forward,'' Block's campaign spokesman,
Joseph Scott, said Friday. ``That's what Sheriff Block said he
wanted, and that's what his family wants. It's important for the
voters to have a choice.''
</P>
<P>
   H. Eric Schockman, a political science professor at the
University of Southern California, said: ``This is very weird
politics. The political establishment has clearly lined up behind
this ghost vote.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, Schockman said, appears to be an issue of control.
If Block wins, the board of supervisors will appoint an interim
sheriff, taking the decision out of the hands of the voters. The
interim sheriff would serve until 2000 and would then have the
option of running for the remaining two years of the four-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   If victory goes to Block's opponent, Lee Baca, a high-ranking
sheriff's official until he retired last June, the board still must
appoint an interim sheriff until Dec. 3, when the new sheriff will
be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Block's campaign, Jay Grodin, said at a news
conference Friday that ``the sheriff has made it very clear along
that way,'' that Baca, 56, was not qualified for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Grodin complained that Baca's major issue during the campaign
was the state of Block's health.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had no other vision,'' Grodin said. ``His issue is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Block was as tough as a winter in his native Chicago,
his health had been in decline. He had two bouts with cancer and
required kidney dialysis several times a week.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Flores, Baca's campaign manager, said that Baca liked and
admired Block and that out of respect for his former boss he would
not make any public statements for a couple of days. Baca has not
made any public campaign appearances since Block entered the
hospital last weekend, Flores said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee is a man who has risen through the ranks from deputy to
chief,'' Flores said. ``He's certainly qualified to be sheriff.''

BAD SPIRITS INVADE GREENWICH VILLAGE'S HALLOWEEN PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (budgeted earlier as NY-VILLAGE-PARADE)   (bl)  
 By RANDY KENNEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even in Greenwich Village, no one knew quite what to
make of it. It was a chilly Halloween night in 1974 and through the
narrow streets came a procession that looked something like a cross
between a Happening and a medieval mystery play.
</P>
<P>
   There was a man in a seven-foot-tall lobster suit, borrowed from
a Sam Shepard play. There was a two-headed pig monster and a giant
lizard. The 200 marchers paused to wage a mock battle between good
and evil on the steps of the Washington Square Methodist Church,
and then wandered across to the park, where they waved sparklers
and, basically, wondered what else to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were not many people around besides us _ maybe bums,''
said Ralph Lee, the mask and puppet designer who started the
Village Halloween Parade. ``And here we were, all holding
sparklers, kind of looking at each other.''
</P>
<P>
   When the parade rolls through the Village on Saturday night, a
quarter of a century later, its opening announcement, ``Let the
Celebration Begin!'' will be heard live on the radio in Japan, and
the parade will be televised live in the city. The signature
puppets, once made by Lee in his Village apartment with help from a
theater company, will come from an upstate workshop, where they
have been made with help from such corporate sponsors as Dunkin'
Donuts, Snapple and Miller Brewing Co. The parade is estimated to
bring neighborhood merchants more than $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   And consuming Avenue of the Americas from Spring to 22nd Streets
will be more than 20,000 marchers, who are expected to be
surrounded by 2 million spectators _ a crowd roughly the population
of greater Miami and about four times the size of the New Year's
Eve celebration in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   As things in New York tend to do, what started out small and
homegrown has become an annual superlative: the biggest, the best,
the most famous. But as with other big things in the city, the
parade has also begun to acquire powerful enemies. Many gay and
lesbian participants who once figured prominently in the
celebration now complain that it has not only lost its neighborhood
spirit, but also its uniquely gay New York character.
</P>
<P>
   This is, perhaps more than anything else, a belated reflection
of changes in the gay population in the Village and the city as a
whole _ as Chelsea and other neighborhoods become new centers of
gay life, and notions of a seamless ``gay community'' give way to a
wider diversity of pursuits and opinions.
</P>
<P>
   But many gay leaders say the parade has begun to reflect
something more troubling: a rise in anti-gay sentiment in the city
and across the country. They say that for at least the last five
years, it has attracted a sizable group of people who come simply
to drink and, often, to taunt, threaten and hurt gay participants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is just this sense that the parade once felt
like a place where we could have fun with everybody,'' said Deven
J.C. DeMarco, a gay 24-year-old sous-chef helping to organize a
demonstration at the parade to condemn anti-gay violence. ``Now,
the parade kind of feels like it's part of the problem,'' DeMarco
said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the parade occurs against a backdrop that focuses
those feelings more than at any other time: an 81 percent rise in
reported anti-gay bias crimes citywide and the killing of Matthew
Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming, which has prompted angry
protests around the country.
</P>
<P>
   But the parade's organizers complain that the event has been
unfairly targeted by a small but vocal group of gay men and
lesbians. Jeanne Fleming, an artist and event planner who has
organized the parade since 1985, says she thinks this may be
because the group is seeking issues to reignite gay advocacy in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe, she says, it is simply for political gain: Christine
Quinn, the executive director of the Gay and Lesbian Anti-Violence
Project and a parade opponent, is seeking the City Council seat of
Thomas Duane, who is gay and who is going to run for the state
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The parade's organizers say that Duane, who supports Ms. Quinn,
called for the parade to be canceled this year in part to make it
an issue to distinguish Ms. Quinn. Duane denies any political
motives and says that from his perspective, the parade has become
``a sea of homophobia.''
</P>
<P>
   His concerns, the organizers say, are not only unfair but
unfounded. They point out that there have been no anti-gay bias
incidents reported during the last four years. They say they had no
trouble gathering 17,000 signatures from Village residents, many of
them gay, on a petition to support the parade.
</P>
<P>
   There is an additional layer of animosity from Village
residents, both gay and not, who say the parade's main supporters
these days are the bars and clubs that profit from it. They say it
has simply outgrown the neighborhood and abandoned its modest
roots.
</P>
<P>
   But this is often a matter of perception. At a press conference
this week in which the parade organizers announced the issuance of
a police permit, an elderly woman on the sidewalk spoke wistfully
of the event's beginnings: ``This was something that was started
for children in the Village,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, says Lee, the founder, it really was not, and Village
residents tend to over-romanticize the parade's beginnings. While
many children were involved in the first parades, it was composed
mostly of friends and friends of friends, and he got the idea after
he staged a similar event for students at Bennington College in
Vermont, where he was teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of it as a milelong theatrical event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While he produced it on a shoestring, he added that it was also
not exactly a spontaneous, ``Fame''-like outpouring of people onto
the streets. From the very first year, Lee obtained parade permits
from police. And during the first parade, there was a single police
scooter at the head of the parade and one at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But the parade caught on quickly. The next year it doubled in
size, Lee said, and spectators began to line the streets. After
first resisting, he soon accepted help from corporate sponsors as
expenses escalated. (The parade organization is a nonprofit group,
and sponsorship remains relatively small: the budget this year is
$43,000, less than half of which comes from big companies, Ms.
Fleming said. The rest is from grants, from the city and from
Village merchants and individuals.)
</P>
<P>
   By 1985, when the parade had grown so large that the route was
shifted off the side streets of the Village onto Avenue of the
Americas, Lee said he no longer had the time or energy to organize
it. ``What I really always wanted,'' he said, ``was for people to
come and watch it and then go home to their own communities and
have their own celebrations; but I knew that was never going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee added that though there were gay participants during the
first years, drag queens and overtly gay elements were not
noticeable until several years later. Ms. Fleming said she
estimated that by the mid-1980s, gay participation had grown to
about 30 percent and was very visible. Men in drag and men and
women wearing next to nothing shared the streets with Christian
fundamentalists, Hare Krishna adherents, AIDS activists and people
dressed as witches, goblins, shoes, nuns, urinals and tubes of
lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1991 she remembered surveying the crowd and thinking,
``My God, I'm running a straight event.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as large as the parade has grown, police say it remains one
of the tamer celebrations in the city for its size. Mike Singer, a
community affairs officer for the 6th Precinct, said that criminal
activity had not risen consistently over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crime is really very low the night of the parade,'' he said.
``Quality-of-life complaints are high.''
</P>
<P>
   But some residents said that the low number of summonses
reflects the fact that there are not enough police officers to
catch wrongdoers and that the process of reporting crimes,
especially anti-gay bias crimes, is difficult. (Police will not say
how many officers patrol the parade, but they say the number will
be larger this year.)
</P>
<P>
   Matt Foreman, a past director of the Anti-Violence Project, said
he remembered bottles being thrown at him and others when they
marched in the parade in 1990 and 1991 with Queer Nation, a street
protest group. ``But you're going to the precinct on Halloween
night to spend several hours there reporting an incident where
you're not seriously injured?'' he asked. ``Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming _ who loves Halloween so much that she once got
married on Halloween night _ said she has become accustomed to
opposition over the last few years. And it has not ruffled her
because the tradition of the parade itself has been one of dissent
and radically opposed viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an event where literally every group is marching to a
different drummer, and part of the fascination is to figure out how
to keep it all together,'' she said early this week.
</P>
<P>
   But by Thursday night, after long days of trying to calm nerves
and rally support and figure out whether protesters would disrupt
the parade, she added wearily: ``Right now, if I had a choice, I
would say it's become too political and it's not for me anymore.
I'm an artist.''

LOUISIANA'S SODOMY STATUTE IS CHALLENGED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Texas, Fla., Ga., N.C., Va., Mo., Ark., Md., Ky.,
Mont., Tenn.)  (mk) 
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Jim Wiltberger, an accountant and political
activist, remembered what it was like to be a gay man traveling
outside the French Quarter into the more conservative and
unwelcoming parishes of Louisiana. Gay men identified themselves
with code words, he said. They signaled one another by twisting
their pinkie rings. They had colored handkerchiefs sticking out of
their pockets to advertise their sexual orientation, with different
colors connoting particular proclivities.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then there got to be something like 54 different colors
and nobody could remember what the code was and, besides, at a bar
you couldn't see the color in the dark,'' Wiltberger said from the
witness stand Wednesday in Civil District Court in New Orleans, a
wobbly air-conditioner fan clanging in the background.
</P>
<P>
   Even as religious conservatives and some Republican politicians
have intensified their criticism of homosexuality and are urging
states to strengthen or more strictly enforce their anti-sodomy
laws, gay and lesbian activists have continued a decade-old
strategy of attacking the 19 remaining state anti-sodomy statutes,
one state at a time. The current battle is in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In a case that opened on Monday and was expected to run at least
a week, John Rawls, a gay New Orleans lawyer, is arguing that the
state's anti-sodomy law is incompatible with the Louisiana
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The trial began with a veterinarian describing how some 460
species of mammals have been known to exhibit some form of
homosexual behavior. It continued with a discussion of how ``crime
against nature'' statues date to 12th-century ecclesiastical laws.
And it included the testimony of several homosexuals about how the
law had been used to discriminate against them in Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The Louisiana law against ``unnatural carnal copulation'' makes
it a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and applies to
both homosexual and heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Rawls said he would prove that the law was invalid because it
was religious in nature, that it discriminated against people whose
rights were protected by the state constitution and that there was
no rational scientific basis for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course that's what he's going to do, that's what he ought
to do, that's the smart thing to do,'' said Charles Braud, a lawyer
in the state attorney general's office assigned to defend the
statute. ``But this statute has been on the books in Louisiana for
150 years and it's the attorney general's job to defend the
constitution and the state's laws. I believe all we have to do is
show that the legislators had a rational reason for enacting the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Braud said the state would wait until Rawls finished his
arguments before deciding whether to call any of its witnesses,
including mental health experts and the leaders of groups that
believe homosexuality is a chosen lifestyle that, with counseling,
can be unchosen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my hope that we will determine he has not proved his case
and not have to present any witnesses at all,'' Braud said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund has led some of the
efforts to overturn anti-sodomy laws and is assisting in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the early 1960s, every state in the union had some
form of anti-sodomy statute,'' said Suzanne Goldberg, a lawyer with
the organization. ``Now there are 19 states that still have them,
14 that outlaw sodomy and oral sex between all couples and five
that outlaw it only for same-sex couples.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, gay activists say, is not so much the arrest of
people for engaging in such sex acts but the other ways in which
the laws are used to discriminate against or clamp down on
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sodomy laws are used to brand gays and lesbians as criminals,
and they are also used as the basis for all sorts of other
discrimination,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``There have been instances,
in Texas, Florida and Georgia, where they were used to deny jobs to
gay applicants, and in North Carolina and Virginia such laws were
used as a basis for denying custody in divorce cases. It's also
often used as a means of keeping gays out of the political
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important, she said, was the social climate that such
laws create in a community, perhaps encouraging those disposed to
violence against homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Many states repealed their anti-sodomy laws in the late '60s and
early '70s. In 1986, though, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 vote,
ruled in a case involving a gay Georgia man arrested while engaging
in oral sex in his own home that there was no privacy protection
under federal law that invalidated the Georgia statute. As a
result, gay groups have moved into the state courts and
legislatures in the last decade, because state constitutions
sometimes guarantee more specific and widespread rights than does
the Bill of Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Since that Supreme Court decision, Nevada and the District of
Columbia have voted to repeal their anti-sodomy laws, and state
courts have overturned them in Kentucky, Montana and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   But not all efforts to have the laws repealed have succeeded. In
Texas, an appeals court declined to rule on the constitutionality
of that state's law. In Missouri, a state court upheld the state's
anti-sodomy law, arguing in part that Missouri had a public health
interest in outlawing anal and oral sex, since such acts could
spread the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Gay activists say they are already looking beyond the Louisiana
case, to battles in Arkansas and Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue in every state is always the same, whether that
state's courts are willing to tear up their state constitution or
throw out their sodomy laws,'' Rawls said. ``This is a continuing,
galling insult to all lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender
persons.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 1, will move Saturday in the `a' category. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ELECTIONS-REVIEW _ Rep. John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, perhaps said it best,
and certainly most succinctly, when he was asked last week which
issue was dominating the elections on Tuesday. ``Nothing,'' he
said. Yet the prevailing sense of a fat and happy _ and
uninterested _ electorate clashes weirdly with the dire, often
despairing, warnings from candidates that have marked this campaign
season. With undiminished fervor, politicians have been loudly
proclaiming one calamity after another, offering themselves as
salvation from, take your pick: the health care crisis; the
education crisis; the Social Security crisis; the moral crisis; the
crisis in the environment; the crisis in international markets. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   NASA-REVIEW _ Last week National Aeronautics and Space
Administration officials turned out in force at Cape Canaveral,
Fla., for another lesson in space-agency showmanship as NASA
skillfully orchestrated both a high-stakes drama and a world-class

   MIDEAST-REVIEW _ Since Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from
Washington with a signed peace agreement, he has been the subject
of rabid protest and threats from the far right, particularly the
radicals of the Jewish settler movement. In demonstrations, on the
radio and at a funeral for a terrorism victim, the language used to
attack the prime minister has had a creepy echo for most Israelis.
The words are the same that were used against Yitzhak Rabin after
he brought home the Oslo interim peace accord in 1993. By Deborah
Sontag. &QL;

   IRAQ-REVIEW _ ``Divide and conquer'' is an ancient tactic that
Saddam Hussein refined into an art form as a dictator in Iraq. Now,
it seems, it has done him good service in aggravating the United
States and its one-time allies as they struggle to keep him in the
corner where they put him after the Persian Gulf war. These days,
it seems, there are only divisions in the complicated apparatus
designed to prevent him from acquiring new weapons of mass
destruction or the economic power with which to develop them.
Members of the transatlantic and Arab coalition that once fought
him often seem at odds with each other _ so much so that they have
failed to come up with a sucessful response to his latest efforts
to wriggle out of arms-control inspections. By Youssef M. Ibrahim. &QL;

   AMERICA-ENERGY-REVIEW _ Americans are consuming about as much
energy as they did 25 years ago. They are living in bigger homes
crammed with more appliances and driving larger, more powerful cars
and more light trucks. They using energy as if it were limitless _
consuming far more per person than Asians or Europeans. Only
Canadians, with more heavy industry and more chilblains, consume
more. By Allen R. Myerson. &QL;

<P>
   OK-GUNFIGHT-REVIEW _ Why did history and Hollywood choose to
make the gunfight at the O.K. Corral immortal? A partial answer is
that Americans have always looked to the West _ to the Alamo, to
Custer's Last Stand, to the O.K. Corral _ for defining moments in
the national character. Another is that, in time, post-Marx
historians saw the Earps and the Cowboys as representatives of
opposing cultural and political forces. By Allen Barra. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-AGE-REVIEW _ There's no place quite like Hollywood for
its obsession with youth _ but anguish about getting older is
hardly limited to well-known actors and actresses surgically
carving up their faces to look younger. Writers over 50, especially
on television, are virtually shut out of many top shows because
they are considered too old and too out of touch by network
executives and producers who are in their 20s and 30s. By Bernard
Weinraub. &QL;

   MARATHONS-REVIEW _ The 32,000 runners in Sunday's New York City
Marathon will be cheered by 2 million spectators, serenaded by 40
bands, hydrated at 24 water stations and tinctured at two dozen
medical stations. But, alas, there will be no oyster tent at Mile
25. While New York's is one of the world's great marathons, it is
not one of the most exotic. For those who crave the slithery slide
of mollusks instead of the chewy energy of Power Bars for that
final surge across the finish, the Marathon des Chateaux du Medoc
in France's Bordeaux wine country is the place to go. By Jere
Longman. &QL;

<P>
   JAPAN-WOMEN-REVIEW _ Women often complain that working women
have a tougher time in Japan than in any other industrialized
country. While there has been some improvement in recent years, the
Japanese government is now trying to confront the issue by
releasing new guidelines in an effort to bar sexual harassment. By
Sheryl Wudunn. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMAR-REVIEW _ For grammarians, lexicographers and linguists,
it's the Thing That Will Not Die. Just when they think it's buried
once and for all, the corpse rises again to haunt a new generation.
The creature walking among us, if you haven't already guessed, is
the old ``rule'' of grammar that says we shouldn't split an
infinitive. It's been pronounced dead every few years for more than
a century, but it just won't be laid to rest. In the hearts of true
believers, it's still a sin to ever put an adverb (like ``ever'')
between the word ``to'' and the infinitive form of a verb. The
latest post-mortem comes from Oxford University Press, which
publishes the granddaddy of dictionaries, the Oxford English
Dictionary, as well as baby dictionaries of every size and
description. By Patricia T. O'connor.

 &HT;    Sharp, Perry differ on key issues
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo and Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It doesn't take a lot of effort for Texas voters
to note the similarities between lieutenant governor candidates
Rick Perry and John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Both men want to end social promotion in schools. Both agree
that teachers need pay raises and that public education needs
improvement. Each says laws governing cities' annexation powers
need strengthening.
</P>
<P>
   But there are key differences between the two major-party
candidates. Perry, the Republican, wants to start a pilot program
in which students in low-performing schools get state dollars to
attend other schools, including private and religious ones. Sharp
says that would only hurt the public and private education systems.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, and fellow Democrat Garry Mauro, who's running for
governor, say there's a way to end a mandatory early release
program for prisoners jailed for crimes committed before Sept. 1,
1996 _ an idea struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court when Florida
attempted it.
</P>
<P>
   Perry says he would love to do the same thing. But he agrees
with Gov. George W. Bush that it would be extremely difficult, if
not impossible, because of constitutional restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Perry or Sharp becomes Texas' next lieutenant governor _
the state's No. 2 officeholder, the leader of the Senate and the
chairman of the powerful Legislative Budget Board _ those and other
issues are sure to crop up in the legislative session that begins
in January. And even on topics on which Perry and Sharp agree,
there are differences in the details.
</P>
<P>
   It's been the theme of nearly every campaign this year and a hot
topic every time lawmakers gather.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the last time the Legislature convened, Bush put out a
plan to cut local school property taxes by increasing the state's
share of public education spending. His plan _ to kick in $1
billion in state money and increase the number of businesses paying
the state's main business tax for even more money _ got inflated,
deflated and finally passed as a $1 billion property tax cut via an
increase in the homestead exemption. For many Texans, though, the
savings were eaten up by local school tax increases.
</P>
<P>
   Bush now says he wants to put $2 billion toward the effort and
another $1.6 billion for school districts to spend as they see fit.
He's hoping that the additional money will prevent schools from
raising tax rates, giving more Texans a chance at pocketing some
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp and Perry mostly line up with Bush on the issue. Sharp
wants to increase the amount of money the state gives to schools
for each student. He also wants to raise the level at which
districts with a greater amount of local property tax revenue are
forced to share with others.
</P>
<P>
   As for Bush's plan, Sharp said parts sound like his, but he
would have to see the details before agreeing to it.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to similar plans, Perry wants to pay ``reading
masters'' an extra $5,000 a year _ $7,000 if they teach in
low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Education
</P>
<P>
   Education concerns don't end at the public school doors.
</P>
<P>
   In the last several years, proposals to give students publicly
funded vouchers to pay for private and religious schools have
gained popularity, mostly among conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, however, a handful of liberal Democrats, mostly those
who represent urban, minority districts, signed on to vouchers for
students in low-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   That idea also has the backing of Bush and Perry. But Sharp and
Mauro oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp once said he was ``intrigued'' by the idea as a way to
spur competition in education. Schools that lost students and the
money that goes with them would be encouraged to do better, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp now has all but shut the door on the idea. He says
competition can be accomplished by allowing students in
low-performing schools to move to better public schools. That would
encourage improvement without taking money out of the public school
system, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Perry doesn't believe that's enough. He wants to provide
vouchers as a pilot program. If it improves education, he says
lawmakers could consider expanding it. If not, Perry says he'll be
the first to pull the plug.
</P>
<P>
   Decades after the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision,
lawmakers continue to haggle over possible restrictions on a
woman's right to have an abortion. One of the latest, which has
come close to passing in recent sessions, is parental consent and
notification before a minor receives an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Perry supports both measures, but adds that he also would use
the lieutenant governor's office to promote abstinence and
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, a Catholic, opposes abortion. But he said a parental
notification or consent bill would have to protect the rights of
minors who need an abortion and parents' rights to be involved in
such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get one that protects both sides, I would not have
a problem with that,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   Added Perry, ``I don't know if I know of any elected officials
who are against abstinence.''

 Kaiser's Ailments Continue _ $111 Million Loss in 3rd Quarter  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Warning it could close this year with a loss rivaling last year's
unprecedented shortfall, Kaiser Permanente Group said yesterday
that it lost $111 million on third-quarter revenues of $3.9
billion.
<P>
   Kaiser, the nation's largest health maintenance organization,
said its operating loss was slightly offset by $9 million it earned
primarily from stock investments.
</P>
<P>
   But so far this year, its operating losses, the most important
indicator of its long-term health, have totalled $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   Given that winter is typically the sick season, Kaiser said it
expects its losses will continue despite cost-cutting efforts. It
predicted it would end 1998 with a loss comparable to the $266
million shortfall it posted in 1997 _ the first loss in its
history.
</P>
<P>
   Wanda Jones, an analyst with the New Century Health Care
Institute in San Francisco, said Kaiser's ills are easy to diagnose
but will take time to cure.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of years, aggressive recruiting drives
swelled Kaiser's ranks. But while Kaiser was adding members, large
corporate insurance buyers were forcing all HMOs to hold their
rates flat, and that particularly affected Kaiser, which was 10
percent lower to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rates will have to go up,'' Jones said. ``In real dollars,
Kaiser and the other HMOs have seen as much as a 25 percent
reduction in real premiums since the early '90s.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser has already negotiated a 10.75 percent increase for 1999
with the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS),
its biggest customer.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser Chief Financial Officer Dale Crandall said he is
``cautiously optimistic'' that rate increases will enable the
company to report a profit in 1999. He said the HMO will try to
raise rates in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Crawford, an HMO analyst with Fox-Pitt Kelton, said
Kaiser's rate increases will enable competitors like WellPoint
Health Networks Inc., Foundation Health Systems Inc. and PacifiCare
Health Systems Inc. to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need to raise rates aggressively for the next couple of
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for Kaiser's current troubles, according to
Jones, is that during the past few years of stagnant rates, it
halted a $6 billion construction program it had planned in the late
1980s. In high-growth areas like Southern California, it has been
unable to treat all its new members in its own facilities, and has
been forced to pay higher costs by farming the excess out to other
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser noted yesterday it has opened two new hospitals, one in
Baldwin Park in Southern California, and the other in Roseville,
north of Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   In California, where Kaiser has some 5.6 million HMO members,
the company reported operating losses of $55 million for the
quarter and $190 million for the year to date.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1945, Kaiser has some 8.5 million members in 17
states and Washington, D.C. It employs some 10,000 physicians and
90,000 technical, administrative and clerical employees.

ANTHONY CELEBREZZE, 88, MAYOR, JUDGE, HEW CHIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Mich., Ky., Tenn.)   (bl)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anthony J. Celebrezze, a storied Cleveland mayor who transformed
the city's skyline in the 1950s and went on to spend three
productive years as secretary of health, education and welfare in
the 1960s and three low-key decades as a federal appellate judge,
died Oct. 30 at a hospice in Cleveland. He was 88 and a founder of
a far-flung Ohio political dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   His family said the cause was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   For all the pride he took in the accomplishments of his nine
activist years as mayor of Cleveland, Celebrezze later admitted
that his most sweeping achievements came during his brief service
in the Kennedy and Johnson Cabinets.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed by President John F. Kennedy in July 1962 as
the first Italian-American to serve in a presidential Cabinet. He
remained in the Cabinet until August 1965, when he submitted his
resignation to President Lyndon B. Johnson. In that time,
Celebrezze helped shepherd more than a dozen major New Frontier and
Great Society bills through Congress, including the Medicare Act,
the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Water Pollution Control Act, the
Clean Air Act and the law creating the Head Start program.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, Celebrezze's heart remained in Cleveland. During
his 30 years as a member of the 6th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals,
based in Cincinnati, Celebrezze, who had senior status at his
retirement in 1995, maintained an office in the federal courthouse
in Cleveland, a city where he was regarded with something akin to
awe.
</P>
<P>
   That was hardly surprising, since throughout his career
Celebrezze maintained a reputation as both an urban visionary and a
hard-nosed, hard-working and honest politician whose very life
seemed to epitomize a cherished American myth of triumph over
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The man who began his political career in Cleveland as the
self-proclaimed ``boy from the slums'' was not even born in the
United States. The son of an Italian immigrant who never made more
than 26 cents an hour as a railroad track walker, Celebrezze, the
middle child of 13, was born on Sept. 4. 1910, in Anzi, Italy. His
hometown was a rocky mountain village in the province of Lucania,
on the instep of the Italian boot, where his family had repaired to
sit out the depression of 1908.
</P>
<P>
   As Celebrezze later recalled, growing up in a Cleveland slum
across the street from a house of prostitution and an opium den
instilled in him the idea that things could be made better, as they
were years later when the neighborhood was cleared to make way for
a college as part of a vast urban development program developed
during his years as mayor.
</P>
<P>
   From the age of 6 he joined his older brothers and sisters as a
shoeshine boy and newspaper hawker on a busy downtown street corner
considered such a choice location that they had to fight off others
seeking to displace their family monopoly. Long after the children
had grown, Clevelanders knew the intersection as Celebrezze Corner.
</P>
<P>
   After working his way through local colleges in Cleveland as a
boxer, railroad laborer and freight truck driver, Celebrezze
obtained a law degree from Ohio Northern University in Ada in 1936.
He worked a while for the Ohio Bureau of Unemployment Compensation,
then entered private practice, which he maintained, with time out
for service in the Navy in World War II, until he began his
political career with election to the Ohio state Senate in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   Widely regarded as the most effective Democratic member of the
Republican-controlled legislature, Celebrezze mastered an amazing
range of specialties and handily won re-election in 1962, although
his impatience, blunt style and outspoken ways alienated some
Democratic powers in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Then an older brother, Frank, who had become a Municipal Court
judge, organized a ``Draft Tony for Mayor'' campaign. Campaigning
against the Democratic machine as a maverick who could not be
bought, Celebrezze was swept into office in 1953. Though initially
dismissed as a lightweight by many, he helped transform the city
and was repeatedly re-elected by increasing margins.
</P>
<P>
   A tight man with a public dollar, he won a national reputation
for his accomplishments and was elected president of the American
Municipal Association (now the National League of Cities) in 1958
and president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors in 1962. However, he
lost a bid for governor in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   He also campaigned hard for Kennedy in 1960, but turned down an
offer of a judgeship after Kennedy's election, saying he had more
to do in Cleveland. In 1962, however, while serving an
unprecedented fifth term as mayor, he accepted appointment as
secretary of health, education and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrezze was given major credit for a range of important
legislation, most notably in creating Medicare. But living in
Washington on a $25,000 salary proved such a personal hardship that
after running up $30,000 in debts, he asked Johnson to name him to
the bench in Ohio. The president swiftly obliged, naming him to the
6th circuit, which covers Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   As a grand old man of Ohio politics, Celebrezze, whose son,
Anthony Jr., served as state attorney general and whose grandson,
Anthony III, is now running for Franklin County court clerk in
Columbus, was a highly sought-after speaker in Ohio and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, the man who began his political career proclaiming
he could not be bought refused to accept fees for his speaking
engagements.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son and grandson, Celebrezze is survived by
his wife, Ann; two daughters, Jean Anne Porto of Washington and
Susan Marie Sullivan of Boston; a daughter, Mildred Ragucci, and
two brothers, Salvatore and John, all of the Cleveland area, and
nine other grandchildren.

 Fingerprint Technology for Everybody  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Grant Evans dreams of a day when millions of corporate workers will
routinely give their computers the finger.
<P>
   It's nothing personal. Evans is vice president of sales at
Identicator Technology, a San Bruno firm that sells tiny electronic
pads that read fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   For years the Pentagon has used this type of pad to ensure that
only people with the right fingerprints enter secure sites.
</P>
<P>
   Now this spy-proofing technology has gotten cheap enough for
everyday use. Next week, Identicator will announce that Key Tronic
Corp., a leading keyboard maker, will begin shipping a $149
keyboard that includes this built-in fingerprint security feature.
</P>
<P>
   Plug the keyboard into a PC. Install Indicator's BioLogon
software. Put a finger _ the index or middle finger is recommended
_ on the translucent square on the left side of the keyboard. A
tiny camera inside the keyboard will record the distinctive aspects
of your fingerprints and certify that you _ and only you _ access
that computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an end user, you'll never have to remember another
password,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe, one day, if corporations adopt fingerprint systems
to replace passwords. But this is such a new technology that
Identicator _ a private firm with 50 employees _ would be thrilled
if it can ship 55,000 of these new keyboard systems by the end of
the year. The target is corporate buyers looking for better
security.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So passwords will hardly vanish overnight. But Evans argued
that so-called biometric security devices are the wave of the
future. Biometrics is the science of identifying a person by
physical attribute, like fingerprints, retinal scans or voice
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas people often forget passwords or, worse, write them on
sticky notes where they can be copied or stolen, ``You can't leave
home without your fingerprint,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting desktop computers from unauthorized access is only
the beginning. &UR;  &LR; Evans said laptop computers with fingerprint ID
systems will start appearing next year. So even if someone steals
your laptop, at least they won't be able to access your data.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Cream puffs? &LR;  International headlines alerted us in February
when a Belgian man hit Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates with a cream
pie. And Leah Garchik blew the whistle when Nobel Prize-winning
economist Milton Friedman suffered a similar fate at an October 9
appearance in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   A shadowy group calling itself the Biotic Baking Brigade claims
``credit'' for some of these, and other less-known, cream puff
pranks. And the group seems to be stepping up the pace of the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   I spoke with a BBB agent who said it was one of his
collaborators who threw a pie at Monsanto Chairman Robert Shapiro
Tuesday night, just after Shapiro finished a speech at San
Francisco's Fairmont Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   And yesterday I got an e-mail that the same group, through
allies in the United Kingdom, planted a pie in the face of Renato
Ruggiero, Director General of the World Trade Organization, as he
was preparing to make a speech.
</P>
<P>
   My source said past BBB targets have included Charles Hurwitz,
the corporate raider who controls the Pacific Lumber Co. Indeed,
I'm told the BBB is headed by a dozen pranksters who my informant
says have a secret oven deep in the Headwaters Forest. Headwaters,
of course, is a shrine of the environmental movement. The state is
in the process of buying it from Hurwitz.
</P>
<P>
   This BBB collective is apparently plotting future pie attacks on
targets who personify greed, global trade, genetic engineering,
etc.
</P>
<P>
   Now I enjoy a joke as much as the next person, especially when
it's played on someone else. But the Biotic Brigade may be, shall
we say, half-baked, if I am correctly informed about future
targets.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it makes some sort of sense to list Senator Dianne
Feinstein and Congressman Frank Riggs. Both figured in the
Headwaters drama. But why is Apple Interim CEO &UR;  &LR; Steve Jobs the
prime target of a campaign to pie ``computer executives for getting
us into the ... Y2K (mess)?'' Hell, I could have seen pieing Jobs
last year, when he killed the Mac clones. But why punish him for a
programming shortcut that occurred before his birth?
</P>
<P>
   And I'm told San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown ``should know
there's a pie with his name on it.'' His crime: being ``one of the
most pompous politicians in modern time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeez, if that's a cause of action, even newspaper columnists may
not be safe!

 Bankrupt ISP Finds White Knight   &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
An Internet service provider that promised Net access for life was
resurrected from the dead on Halloween eve.
<P>
   The bankrupt San Jose company _  &LR; bigger.net _ was acquired by
Brigadoon.com last night for an undisclosed sum. Its new owner
vowed to continue the company's service to about 40,000 customers
who paid $60 for lifetime Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received an offer and accepted it,'' said Wendy Smith,
the &UR;  &LR; San Francisco attorney representing the U.S. bankruptcy court
trustee responsible for selling the remnants of  &LR; bigger.net.
``We're happy with what we got and, more importantly,  &LR; bigger.net's
customers will continue to receive the service.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; bigger.net filed for Chapter 11 reorganization last December,
but continued to operate until it filed for Chapter 7 liquidation
this month. In the past week, service has been limited.
</P>
<P>
   The tentative deal is subject to bankruptcy court approval.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, Brigadoon.com is required to pay a
``substantial sum'' by Monday to Concentric Network Corp., the
Cupertino company that has hosted  &LR; bigger.net services.
</P>
<P>
   Bankruptcy officials were given a deadline of yesterday to find
a buyer, or else Concentric would have pulled the plug on the
sputtering network, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said she received a pair of offers this week, but that
Brigadoon was by far the aggressor. The Bellevue, Wash., company is
a leading Internet service provider for schools, nonprofit
organizations and small- to mid-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
   In the confusion following the dismantling of  &LR; bigger.net, the
U.S. bankruptcy court of Northern California has acted as a
caretaker while looking for a buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried our best to keep the service running until the
transfer of ownership,'' said Barry Milgrom, another lawyer
representing the bankruptcy court trustee. ``I'll admit it's been
bumpy, and that some customers were not receiving service.''
</P>
<P>
   While most of  &LR; bigger.net's customers said they are happy with
the service, investors and creditors may never be repaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt many of us will ever see our money,'' said one former
executive. ``Good luck to the next crew running that place.''
</P>
<P>
   Creditors are owed $1.5 million, according to the bankruptcy
court. One investor, National Financial Trust, had sunk $2.8
million over the past nine months into the company.
</P>
<P>
   Former  &LR; bigger.net executives said it will require $10 million
to $15 million to get the troubled company back on track.
Telecommunication costs alone run about $100,000 a month, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the company has some upside. The company's name recognition
and customer base are enticing for potential advertisers, industry
observers said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two local Internet service providers _ Netcom and
Pacific Bell Internet _ yesterday offered discounted services to
 &LR; bigger.net users.

GAMBLING PROPONENTS BET $85 MILLION ON ELECTION

<P>
   Facing vital ballot initiatives and continuing to fight for
increased acceptability across the country, the gambling industry
and its supporters this year have contributed about $85 million to
influence next week's election.
</P>
<P>
   From the more than $71 million being wagered on a California
ballot measure that could legalize the state's tribal casinos, to
the thousands more being spent in an effort to oust South
Carolina's antigambling governor, contributions from casino
interests are increasingly affecting the nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   As gambling revenues have grown around the country, the
industry's money has spread far beyond the boundaries of Nevada,
the nation's gambling capital, and its contributions have increased
to members of both parties. According to an analysis conducted for
The New York Times by the Campaign Study Group, a research company
in Springfield, Va., contributions from casino companies to
candidates for national office and to political parties totaled
$4.9 million from Jan. 1 to the second week in October, with a
slightly larger share going to Republicans. Of that amount, the
largest party recipient was the National Republican Senatorial
Committee, which received $925,000, and the largest amount given to
an individual candidate went to John Ensign, the Republican
candidate for the Senate from Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, federal contributions to candidates and parties
from the gambling industry are slightly more than half of the
amount that the tobacco industry has poured into the system,
according to the analysis done for The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both political parties are obviously heavily dependent on
contributions from the gambling industry, which is having a major
influence on Washington,'' said James Dobson, a member of the
National Gambling Impact Study Commission, a congressional
commission studying the social and economic impact of gambling.
``I'm especially concerned about the influence of that money on the
GOP,'' added Dobson, who is also president of the nonprofit
organization Focus on Family and opposes gambling. ``The gambling
industry has bought and paid for the politicians,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In state races, gambling industry dollars are also having a huge
impact. In Missouri, voters will decide whether 11 of the state's
15 casinos may continue operating slot machines although they do
not sit on the Mississippi or Missouri Rivers as state law
stipulates. If the amendment fails, casino companies say they will
have to close. The casino industry is expected to spend about $8
million blanketing the state with advertisements, while opponents
of gambling are fighting with less than $200,000. Still, polls show
the outcome could be close, as Missouri residents, who legalized
gambling in 1992, still appear to be unsure about whether they want
to keep casinos around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too close to call,'' said Joe Coccimiglio, an industry
analyst at Prudential Securities. ``If we don't get a good voter
turnout, it could be difficult.''
</P>

   In Maryland, the Republican gubernatorial candidate, Ellen
Sauerbrey, received a recent boost to her campaign when Hilton
Hotel Corp., the owner of casinos around the country, contributed
$250,000 to aid the Republican National Committee's attacks on her
Democratic opponent, Parris Glendening, according to a report in
The Washington Post. Glendening, the incumbent in the race, has
opposed installing slot machines at the state's horse tracks.
Hilton owns a horse track in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   California's Proposition 5, which would legalize and likely lead
to expansion of the state's Indian gambling business, is being
vehemently opposed by Nevada casinos, which receive an estimated 30
percent of their business from California residents. But the
spending in the campaign has been large on both sides, with tribal
interests matching the deep pockets of Nevada's casino companies.
Recent polls show the proposition is likely to pass, but a lengthy
court challenge could follow.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. David Beasley, R-S.C., has found that his opposition to
establishing a state lottery and his attacks on the state's
mushrooming $2.5 billion-a-year video poker industry have caused
the gambling industry's dollars to pour in for his Democratic
opponent, former state Rep. James Hodges. The largest video poker
operator in the state, Fred Collins, has spent millions on
newspaper, radio and television advertisements urging voters to
``Ban Beasley.'' And to make matters worse for the governor, The
Republican Governors Association, whose members receive significant
support from gambling interests, recently retreated on a plan to
spend $500,000 for advertising on Beasley's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona voters are expected to approve a ballot measure that
would extend the operation of the state lottery through July 2003.
Without the passage of Proposition 304, the lottery would end in
July, but despite some opposition from religious groups, the
measure is expected to win easily and, consequently, campaign
spending has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   According to the analysis by the Campaign Study Group, the
largest individual contributor to federal candidates and parties
was Mirage Resorts, which gave $327,000 of a total of $442,000 to
Republicans. Mirage, a Las Vegas casino company, has projects
planned for Mississippi and New Jersey.

   President Clinton appealed to African-American ministers Friday
to urge their parishioners to turn out and vote as part of a
campaign to mobilize some of his most loyal supporters in the
closing days of the election season.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before about 100 black clergy at a hotel near Kennedy
International Airport in Queens, Clinton told the ministers, ``This
election is not an ordinary election, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``These are not ordinary times. There are huge
fights left out there to fight. Huge. And we need you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to return to the theme on Sunday morning at an
African-American Baptist church in Baltimore, and again on Monday
in several radio and television broadcasts from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to appear on the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner radio
show on a roundtable with Kweisi Mfume of the NAACP, the poet Maya
Angelou and the actress Cicely Tyson. He also is scheduled to
appear on the Tavis Smiley program on Black Entertainment
Television.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans have overwhelmingly supported the president in
his two election campaigns and have stood by him during the
Lewinsky scandal this year.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance with Charles E. Schumer, a Senate candidate
from Brooklyn, N.Y., Clinton told the ministers Friday that they
would see thousands of parishioners in their churches on Sunday and
he implored them to urge their followers to vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew it was a ``hassle'' for many voters to take time
out from a work day to go vote. He said that Republicans were
counting on low turnout among black voters, a generally reliable
Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our adversaries think a whole bunch of us will stay home,''
Clinton told the ministers, and urged them to thwart that tactic by
warning their parishioners of the effects of larger Republican
majorities in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember,'' Clinton said, ``everyone who doesn't show
can't gripe on Wednesday morning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schumer accompanied Clinton at the events with senior citizens
and the ministers, rare instances of the president appearing with a
candidate in a setting that was not a fund-raiser. This political
season, Clinton has attended very few candidate rallies, in part to
shield the candidates from any association with the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the ministers and senior citizens that it was
important to elect Democrats to the Senate and House of
Representatives to bring ``balance'' to Congress and to pass
legislation on health care, tobacco and school construction.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is a mirror image of Republican advertisements, which
urge voters to ``balance'' the liberal leanings of the president
with larger Republican majorities in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned the seniors at the Saint Sebastian Parish Center
in Queens that Republicans were threatening the solvency of Social
Security by diverting some of the federal budget surpluses to tax
cuts or new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
   He assured them that their Social Security payments were safe,
but warned that he could not guarantee benefits for their children
or grandchildren unless the retirement program's trust fund was
propped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we say, `well, heck, we waited 29 years for this surplus,
let's take the money and run, let's have a little fun, give me a
tax cut, give me a new program, give me this, give me that' before
we know whether we need this money to save Social Security,''
Clinton said, ``and we miss this opportunity, then what's going to
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sought to capitalize on the Middle East peace
agreement concluded last week and on the return to space of Sen.
John Glenn on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you felt good about the Middle East peace talks, if you
felt good when John Glenn went up into space,'' Clinton told the
black pastors, ``if you feel in your heart that you are a part of
my presidency, then I ask you just one thing: Realize this is an
important election.'' He then asked them to bring as many people as
they could to the polls on Tuesday.

   President Clinton appealed to African-American ministers Friday
to urge their parishioners to turn out and vote as part of a
campaign to mobilize some of his most loyal supporters in the
closing days of the election season.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before about 100 black clergy at a hotel near Kennedy
International Airport in Queens, Clinton told the ministers, ``This
election is not an ordinary election, folks.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``These are not ordinary times. There are huge
fights left out there to fight. Huge. And we need you.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to return to the theme on Sunday morning at an
African-American Baptist church in Baltimore, and again on Monday
in several radio and television broadcasts from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to appear on the nationally syndicated Tom Joyner radio
show on a roundtable with Kweisi Mfume of the NAACP, the poet Maya
Angelou and the actress Cicely Tyson. He also is scheduled to
appear on the Tavis Smiley program on Black Entertainment
Television.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans have overwhelmingly supported the president in
his two election campaigns and have stood by him during the
Lewinsky scandal this year.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance with Charles E. Schumer, a Senate candidate
from Brooklyn, N.Y., Clinton told the ministers Friday that they
would see thousands of parishioners in their churches on Sunday and
he implored them to urge their followers to vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew it was a ``hassle'' for many voters to take time
out from a work day to go vote. He said that Republicans were
counting on low turnout among black voters, a generally reliable
Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our adversaries think a whole bunch of us will stay home,''
Clinton told the ministers, and urged them to thwart that tactic by
warning their parishioners of the effects of larger Republican
majorities in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just remember,'' Clinton said, ``everyone who doesn't show
can't gripe on Wednesday morning.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Schumer accompanied Clinton at the events with senior citizens
and the ministers, rare instances of the president appearing with a
candidate in a setting that was not a fund-raiser. This political
season, Clinton has attended very few candidate rallies, in part to
shield the candidates from any association with the Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the ministers and senior citizens that it was
important to elect Democrats to the Senate and House of
Representatives to bring ``balance'' to Congress and to pass
legislation on health care, tobacco and school construction.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is a mirror image of Republican advertisements, which
urge voters to ``balance'' the liberal leanings of the president
with larger Republican majorities in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned the seniors at the Saint Sebastian Parish Center
in Queens that Republicans were threatening the solvency of Social
Security by diverting some of the federal budget surpluses to tax
cuts or new spending programs.
</P>
<P>
   He assured them that their Social Security payments were safe,
but warned that he could not guarantee benefits for their children
or grandchildren unless the retirement program's trust fund was
propped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we say, `well, heck, we waited 29 years for this surplus,
let's take the money and run, let's have a little fun, give me a
tax cut, give me a new program, give me this, give me that' before
we know whether we need this money to save Social Security,''
Clinton said, ``and we miss this opportunity, then what's going to
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sought to capitalize on the Middle East peace
agreement concluded last week and on the return to space of Sen.
John Glenn on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you felt good about the Middle East peace talks, if you
felt good when John Glenn went up into space,'' Clinton told the
black pastors, ``if you feel in your heart that you are a part of
my presidency, then I ask you just one thing: Realize this is an
important election.'' He then asked them to bring as many people as
they could to the polls on Tuesday.

SINGH LEADS AFTER SECOND ROUND OF TOUR CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The dour expressions, the clubs slammed to the ground
in frustration and the double-bogeys said it all. The season-ending
Tour Championship has become a grind, a grueling test at the East
Lake Golf Club on a course that is as demanding as it is
picturesque.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult was Friday's second round? For the first time in
his professional career, Tiger Woods completed back-to-back rounds
without a birdie, and he was alone in last place (11 over par).
</P>
<P>
   Only five players broke par today, even though the field
comprised the year's top 30 money-winners.
</P>
<P>
   Even Vijay Singh, who shot a brilliant 63 on Thursday, started
Friday in disastrous fashion: bogey, par, triple-bogey, bogey. So
instead of building his lead, Singh went into survival mode like
everyone else, happy to escape still holding first place.
</P>
<P>
   Setting up an unpredictable weekend on an unforgiving course,
Singh's even-par 70 Friday kept him at seven under par for the
tournament (133), two strokes ahead of Jim Furyk (five under par
after Friday's 68) and three strokes ahead of Hal Sutton, who shot
a 67 to equal the best round Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins this weekend will have accomplished something
special. The deep Bermuda rough and lightning-quick greens make
East Lake an adventure anytime, but Friday the wind picked up to
about 15 miles an hour at times, adding to the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Singh showed admirable resiliency and composure, regrouping
after his horrendous start, shooting five under par over his final
13 holes. Not only did Singh end the day with the lead, he also
ended it with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have shot 80 if I had lost it,'' Singh, who started
the day with a three-stroke lead, said. ``Yesterday's round was
free-flowing. Today, you're trying to crawl out of the hole you've
dug for yourself. It was always a battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very satisfied that I got it back and I'm still in the
lead. I know I'm not going to have that bad of a start tomorrow, so
I'm feeling good right now. A good night's rest, positive thoughts,
and tomorrow will be really good.''
</P>
<P>
   But other players, such as Billy Mayfair, may have trouble
sleeping. Mayfair shot a 66 on Thursday, but struggled to a 77
Friday. And it had to be embarrassing for Woods to see his name at
the bottom of board. Because there is no cut at the Tour
Championship, Woods must endure another 36 holes at East Lake.
Asked to describe Friday's 76 after shooting a 75 on Thursday,
Woods sounded like a part-time weekend player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it in the rough, the bunkers, the trees, the gallery,
the water _ you name it,'' Woods said. ``I had one six-foot putt
for birdie that I lipped out. The rest of the time, I had 20- to
40-footers. You can't make a living doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods never regrouped, but Singh did, even after taking a 7 on
the par-4, 387-yard No. 3. Singh's triple-bogey adventure started
when he hit his drive into a fairway bunker. He squirted the bunker
shot into another bunker. Then he skulled his bunker shot over the
green into the rough.
</P>
<P>
   Singh tried to bump his next shot through the rough and onto the
green, but the deep rough stymied him and stopped the ball before
it reached the green. Singh finally reached the green on his fifth
shot, pitching to five feet, but he missed the putt, then finally
tapped in.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you add them up, it comes to 7,'' Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   Singh three-putted on the next hole for another bogey, and
suddenly he was tied with Furyk and Sutton for the lead. But Singh
made a birdie on No. 6 to change the momentum and followed with
another birdie on No. 9. Then after a bogey on No. 10, Singh played
his best golf of the day.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a wedge approach shot eight feet from the cup at No. 12,
then made the putt for birdie. At No. 13, he hit another wedge
approach shot to eight feet, setting up another birdie.
</P>
<P>
   At the par-5 No. 15, Singh reached the greenside bunker in two
shots, then hit a beautiful bunker shot that landed three feet from
the cup, and he tapped in for birdie. Then Singh made his final
birdie at No. 16, making a 15-foot putt that put him back at seven
under par.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, with 10 players starting the weekend at even par or better,
almost anything could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sitting in a good position,'' Furyk, who had a bogey-free
round Friday, said. ``But there's still a lot of golf left.''

BOWL-STARVED TROJANS NEED A WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When he takes the Coliseum field today, linebacker
Chris Claiborne won't be thinking about USC's missed opportunities
or bowl possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be happy enough to finally face a Washington team that
doesn't enjoy the vast physical edge that has helped the Huskies
win the past two meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time since I've seen Washington they don't have
a huge running back and five huge linemen,'' Claiborne said. ``I
won't have to wear a tailpad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies no longer have a Corey Dillon or Rashaan Shehee in
the backfield, and their top two linemen from last season _ Benji
Olson and Olin Kreutz _ left early for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   But will that necessarily mean the Trojans can snap out of their
mini-funk, which has seen them drop two of their past three games?
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a whole lot of season left,'' wide receiver Billy
Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seniors haven't beaten Washington. That's motivation for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It just might be a narrow goal _ like finally beating the
Huskies _ that helps USC (5-3, 3-2) bounce back from its emotional
17-13 loss to 12th-ranked Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans need to win two of their final four games to become
eligible for a bowl, so today's encounter with the Huskies figures
to be crucial. If USC loses, it would have to beat Stanford next
week and either UCLA or Notre Dame at the conclusion of the season.
</P>
<P>
   As formidable as that sounds, USC coach Paul Hackett was still
talking about the Rose Bowl this week, even though the Trojans are
in fifth place in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we're totally out of the woods. It's a reach
right now,'' Hackett said. ``It would take some people helping us.
But I'm never going to come off that goal, this year, next year or
any year. It's not over until it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   It's highly unlikely the players actually believe that. Many of
them are tired of staying home the past two bowl seasons, and dread
the thought of another December watching bowl games on TV. They'll
be happy to go to any bowl, now that Rose Bowl aspirations have
virtually disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are sick of staying home,'' quarterback Mike Van
Raaphorst said. ``The last two years, everyone goes home and goes
their separate ways. It was tough last year watching other people
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Washington (5-2, 3-1) finds itself in a nearly
identical position. The Huskies barely beat Oregon State last week,
and now have a three-game stretch with USC, Oregon and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to find our personality with young players
and kind of mixing chemistry on both sides of the football,''
Washington coach Jim Lambright said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the backfield. The Huskies' running game has been
nonexistent; reserve quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo is the leading
rusher, with just 277 yards. Freshman tailback Willie Hurst is the
next-leading rusher, with 212 yards and a paltry 2.5 yards per
carry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't get worse,'' Lambright said. ``This game is typical.
We've got a couple freshmen, Willie Hurst and Braxton Cleman, who
are going to carry the load.''
</P>
<P>
   There's been much talk in Seattle about Tuiasosopo, who lined up
at tailback for a few plays last week, moving full-time to running
back. But the position switch was more of a smokescreen than
anything else, designed to keep the opposing defense off-balance.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Trojans, they need to find a way to revive their
struggling offense. It just might mean more passing today, as a way
to keep Washington's blitzing defense from becoming too
free-wheeling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way you can stop it. To throw quick stuff,''
freshman quarterback Carson Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett will start Van Raaphorst, and said he doesn't want to
try and place too much pressure on Palmer, especially after he
played well against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't want is to have a disaster. We've worked too hard
for success,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: A crowd of 60,000 is expected for USC's homecoming....
USC is hopeful defensive tackle Aaron Williams (neck stinger) will
be available. Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed will start in place of
Williams.

DEMOCRATS FAULT GINGRICH FOR HIS ROLE IN ATTACK ADS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seizing on Speaker Newt Gingrich's role in
approving new Republican campaign commercials that allude to the
Clinton scandal, Democrats led by Vice President Al Gore Friday
condemned Gingrich for using the commercials as a way to gain
support for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``These attacks, personally devised by Speaker Newt Gingrich,
are wrong,'' Gore said at a news conference. Gore said he was
``shocked'' to learn of Gingrich's involvement in the commercials,
intended to energize voters. He described them as ``more personal
ads, more personal attacks, more partisan investigations, more of
the politics of personal destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be an orchestrated strategy, the Democrats
resurrected Gingrich as the favorite target he was in 1996, when
they demonized him as the symbol of a dangerous rightward lurch of
the Republican Party. Now they plan to broadcast a radio commercial
naming him as the leading Republican force for impeachment and
blaming him for deflecting attention from issues voters want to
hear about.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority leader, joined Gore in
criticizing Gingrich. In a letter to Gingrich, Gephardt wrote that
the speaker's role in preparing the commercials had compromised his
promise to lead an impartial investigation into whether Clinton
should face impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that you have forfeited your legitimacy as speaker
through your involvement in these latest Republican attack ads,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Gingrich, Christina Martin, said the speaker's
contribution had been vastly overstated. She said he ``was aware
but not involved in either the scripting or the execution of the
ads.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact,'' she added, ``Newt Gingrich was no more a part of
these ads than Al Gore was a part of Bill Clinton's inappropriate
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Republican officials familiar with the development of the
commercials said that Joe Gaylord, the speaker's chief political
consultant, was the creative force behind them and that Gingrich
only approved the overall strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic response Friday was the latest twist in a
fast-moving story that began on Tuesday with the first reports that
Republicans had turned to the scandal involving Clinton to firm up
support for Republican candidates in close races. By all accounts,
early predictions of huge Republican gains in the House and Senate
on Election Day have in recent days given way to expectations of
moderate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to appeal to Democratic voters angered by attacks on
Clinton, Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, general chairman of the
Democratic Party, introduced the radio commercial and complained
about Republican tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never could it be more clear than it is now that the strategy
of the Republican Party as we approach the final days is to
concentrate every way they can to impeach the president,'' Romer
said. ``All their cards are on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   The new 60-second radio commercial opens with an announcer
saying: ``This is no ordinary time. Republicans have made removing
the president from office their top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   It goes on to say that Gingrich ``is personally orchestrating
these pro-impeachment negative ads.''
</P>
<P>
   That radio advertisement followed one that the Democrats began
broadcasting on Thursday. It opens the same way as one Republican
television commercial, with one woman asking another, ``What did
you tell your kids?''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with a constant Democratic theme this election season
_ hammering Republicans for legislation that did not pass, like
money for school construction _ the women review the Democrat
initiatives and one says: ``All Republicans talk about is more
investigations. They are obsessed with getting rid of the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' says the other, ``it's time to get rid of those
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Democrats' complaints, Jim Nicholson,
national chairman of the Republican National Committee, lashed
back, chiding Gore for what Nicholson called allusions to a
``partisan plot that was masterminded by the highest-ranking
elected Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a distraction,'' he said. ``The real issue facing voters
this weekend is a simple one: Knowing what we do about Bill
Clinton's judgment, will we reward him by giving him a Democratic
Congress again?''

   ``Yeah,'' says the other, ``it's time to get rid of those
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the Democrats' complaints, Jim Nicholson,
national chairman of the Republican National Committee, lashed
back, chiding Gore for what Nicholson called allusions to a
``partisan plot that was masterminded by the highest-ranking
elected Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a distraction,'' he said. ``The real issue facing voters
this weekend is a simple one: Knowing what we do about Bill
Clinton's judgment, will we reward him by giving him a Democratic
Congress again?''

   LITCHFIELD, Minn. _ Norman Degeest poked his head into the Main
Street Cafe on Wednesday morning to catch a glimpse of Norm
Coleman, the Republican candidate for governor, giving the
breakfast crowd a peppy plug for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Then Degeest strolled a few yards across Main Street to where
the Democratic candidate, Hubert H. Humphrey III, was politely
pressing the flesh on the sidewalk outside Jimmy's Pizza.
</P>
<P>
   It was a stroke of serendipity that both candidates happened to
be in this small southwest Minnesota farming town at the same time
(forcing the candidates to shake hands gamely with each other in
front of Doffing's Smart Wear). But it did not help Degeest make up
his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really too close to call for me,'' said Degeest, 63,
who drives a tanker for a chemical company. ``I like them both.
That's why I'm undecided. In fact, there's three good people
running for governor.''
</P>
<P>
   Degeest is hardly the only one expressing confusion about what
has become a surprisingly close governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   While Humphrey, the state attorney general who is the son and
namesake of the former vice president and senator, had been way
ahead in the polls, that is no longer the case. Two polls in the
last two weeks have shown Humphrey, known as Skip, running neck and
neck with Coleman, the mayor of St. Paul _ each favored by a little
more than a third of those surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   And in a strikingly strong performance by a third-party
candidate, Jesse Ventura, a former professional wrestler, action
film star and talk radio host, who is running on the Reform Party
ticket, was the favorite of nearly a quarter of the voters polled.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now a three-way race,'' said Professor Chris Gilbert,
chairman of the political science department at Gustavus Adolphus
College in St. Peter. ``Frankly, we the analysts and the media, we
regarded Ventura as a cute curiosity before the recent poll
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts still think it is unlikely that Ventura, a musclebound
and mustachioed 47-year-old nicknamed the Body, can win. But the
fact that Ventura, a former Navy Seal demolition expert who has
shown up at candidate forums in camouflage and whose governing
experience consists of a four-year stint as the mayor of the
Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park, has made such headway has spun
the election into near unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody saw it coming,'' said Steven Schier, chairman of the
political science department at Carleton College in Northfield.
``You got about a third of the state that's Republican and a third
that's Democrat. Very few people beyond those reliable votes are
moving toward Coleman and Humphrey.''
</P>
<P>
   Something about the colorful, straight-talking Ventura, who
describes himself as ``fiscally conservative and socially moderate
and liberal,'' has resonated in a state where populist messages
have often held sway and where 24 percent of the voters supported
Ross Perot, the Reform Party candidate for president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   A more substantive candidate than experts expected, Ventura has
easily articulated opinions on most issues, like his pledge to give
the entire state budget surplus back to taxpayers and his
opposition to merit pay for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going Jesse,'' said Greg Uken, a 28-year-old aircraft
mechanic in Willmar, about 100 miles west of Minneapolis. ``I don't
wear a suit and I don't put up with a lot of stuff and neither does
he.''
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, 56, has the advantage of his venerable name, his
father's revered reputation, and his achievements during 16 years
as attorney general, including his highly publicized fight against
tobacco companies. His views are largely in the tradition of the
state's Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, including a more modest tax
cut than his opponents have promised, a proposal to expand the Head
Start preschool program and a pledge to give tax credits to
families for help with day care, elder care and college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilbert said Humphrey had not managed to excite voters
enough, and that as a result his party risked losing both the race
for the governor's mansion and the party's control of the state
House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Around noon Wednesday, in Willmar, shaking hands at the Town
Talk Cafe, Humphrey's low-wattage Scandinavian-prairie style was on
display. He apologized for interrupting a meal and deferentially
asked people to vote for him Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, Coleman was showcasing a different style.
From a makeshift stage in the parking lot of Willmar Electrical
Services, he energetically promised the small crowd that he would
give $3 billion of the state's $4 billion surplus back to the
taxpayers. Somewhat more conservative than the outgoing governor,
Arne Carlson, a Republican, Coleman opposes abortion rights and
recognition of gay marriages, and favors the expansion of
Minnesota's existing school choice program, which does not involve
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, 49, seems quite a bit younger than Humphrey and in the
rough cadence of his speech it is easy to hear the grit of the
Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhoods where he grew up. A long-haired child
of Woodstock in the 1960s and a Democrat until two years ago who
once worked for Humphrey in the attorney general's office, Coleman
has been trumpeting his success in bringing economic development to
St. Paul, often considered the scruffy, rundown twin to
Minneapolis. Critics call him an opportunistic political chameleon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ventura continues his unconventional, low-budget
campaign, waged largely through interviews on talk radio stations.
He has just broadcast his first radio and television
advertisements, including one where children play with a Jesse
Ventura action figure who fights with Evil Special Interest Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a warrior at heart, I'm an ex-Navy Seal,'' said Ventura,
who is clearly enjoying his campaign. ``I'm too old to wage war
anymore and so now I wage it mentally. And so I find politics very
stimulating; it's war without guns.''

 DICK HIGGINS, 60, INNOVATOR IN THE 1960s AVANT-GARDE  
 (af)  
 By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dick Higgins, a writer, poet, artist, composer and publisher who
was a seminal figure in Happenings and the concrete poetry movement
and a co-founder of the anti-authoritarian Fluxus movement in the
early 1960s, died on Sunday while visiting Quebec City. He was 60
and lived in New York City and in Barrytown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was a heart attack, his family said. He was
staying at a private home in Quebec City while attending a
colloquium on ``Art Action, 1958-1998'' at a performance space
named Le Lieu.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins, who invented the term ``intermedia,'' had a long list
of achievements, most of which he enumerated in a carefully
maintained curriculum vitae that ran to 47 pages. Its table of
contents listed such headings as Visual Art, Movies and Videotapes,
Music and Sound Art and ``Selected Discussions of Dick Higgins,''
one category of which was ``articles, or interesting reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   The bibliography reflected a polymorphic involvement with
language, literature and books. It included books of theoretical
essays, plays, poems, word scores, musical scores, graphic music
notions and performance piece instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Titles could be strange: ``foew&AMP;ombwhnw,'' a 1969 book of
essays, is an acronym for ``freaked out electronic wizard and other
marvelous bartenders who have no wings.''
</P>
<P>
   This volume was a characteristic combination of the traditional
and the iconoclastic: while its pages featured columns of word
scores, visual poetry and essays that ran vertically from spread to
spread, the volume was bound like a prayer book, in leather, with a
ribbon bookmark.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Higgins' books were published by companies that he
founded, funded and ran himself, the best known being Something
Else Press. During its brief life span (1964-1975) it published
books and pamphlets by avant-garde writers and artists of several
generations, including Gertrude Stein, Richard Hulsenbeck, Merce
Cunningham, John Cage, Emmett Williams, Claes Oldenburg, the
Futurist painter Luigi Russolo and the 17th-century poet George
Herbert, whose pattern poems Higgins considered a precedent for
concrete poetry.
</P>
<P>
   As his books were extremely well made and Higgins was prone to
order reprintings on the slightest excuse, many Something Else
titles are still in print.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins was born in 1938 in Cambridge, England, the son of a
wealthy family that owned Wooster Press Steel in Wooster, Mass. He
was educated at several New England boarding schools, attended Yale
University and received a bachelor's degree in English from
Columbia University in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   He also studied at the Manhattan School of Printing, attended
John Cage's influential course on music composition at the New
School and studied with the avant-garde composer Henry Cowell.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1950s, Higgins was working for a book manufacturer
while immersing himself in the flourishing New York art scene,
where the increasing dissolution of boundaries between traditional
art media fit his sensibility. He was interested in anything that
was new and within a short time seemed to know nearly everyone
moving in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   With Allan Kaprow and others he planned and performed in the
first Happenings. With George Macunius, he established the loosely
knit group known as Fluxus, which accepted any activity as art and
played fast and loose with definitions.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Higgins' musical composition ``Dangerous Music No. 17'' of
1963 consisted of Higgins' wife, the poet Alison Knowles, shaving
his head. ``Dangerous Music No. 2,'' which Higgins had performed on
Sunday at the colloquium in Quebec City, involved screaming as
loudly as possible for as long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, Higgins' essay ``Intermedia'' _ published in the first
issue of the Something Else Newsletter _ drew on his experiences
with Happenings, Fluxus, concrete poetry and performance art. It
formulated the concept of works of art that combined different
forms _ film and dance, painting and sculpture _ that are today
often referred to as multimedia installation art.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ms. Knowles, whom he married in 1960, divorced in
1970 and remarried in 1984, Higgins is survived by their twin
daughters, Hannah, of Chicago and Jessica, of New York; a sister,
Lisa Null of Washington; a granddaughter, and his stepfather,
Nicholas Doman of New York.

SLOW-STARTING FRANCHITTI IN HIGH GEAR
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   FONTANA _ The numbers were unimpressive _ mediocre at best.
</P>
<P>
   But Barry Green, co-owner of the Team Kool Green racing program,
didn't become a successful talent scout on the FedEx CART
championship tour by relying on the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   So after watching young Dario Franchitti struggle through a
modest 1997 rookie CART campaign, Green ignored Franchitti's
20th-place finish in season points, pooh-poohed his season-best
ninth-place result at Australia and went out and hired the
25-year-old Scot away from Hogan Racing for the 1999 and 2000
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of people, I saw that he had very, very good
speed,'' said Green, who brought young Canadian Jacques Villeneuve
to the CART series in 1994 and won the series title with him in
1995. ``Even though he only had a ninth-place finish, it was pretty
easy to see this guy had talent.''
</P>
<P>
   What Green could see at the conclusion of the 1997 season
everyone is seeing now.
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti comes to Sunday's 1998 CART season finale at the
California Speedway in second place in season points, the winner of
three of the series' past five races. And he has won the pole
starting position a series-leading five times.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty slow to get going at the beginning,'' said
Franchitti. ``But in the second half of the season, we've really
been the number one contender.''
</P>
<P>
   Number One _ period _ of course, has been Alex Zanardi who comes
to Sunday's Marlboro 500 with seven wins and the 1998 season title
already zipped up inside the hip pocket of his firesuit. But by
being Zanardi's top adversary in the final races of 1998,
Franchitti has earned new status as one of the favorites to replace
the Italian champion when he departs CART for Formula One after
Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it is in any sport,'' said Franchitti. ``The older
drivers, they retire or they move on and it's up to us younger
drivers to move up.''
</P>
<P>
   A CART title in 1999 seems a long drive from Franchitti's
20th-place showing in 1997. But Don Halliday, Franchitti's race
engineer, said he realized early on that his driver has unusual
skill.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the course of last year, you could see flashes of
brilliance,'' Halliday said.
</P>
<P>
   Then Franchitti came to Team Green, and Halliday took him out on
the track for a test.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first impression was that he had a lot of what I would call
one-lap speed,'' Halliday said. ``I felt if we could multiply that
to race distance that we could win.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti came close for the first time with a runner-up finish
at the Long Beach Grand Prix in April. Then came a three-race
streak of accidents and mechanical problems that saw him finish
21st, 19th and 27th.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at the Havoline 200 at Elkhart Lake, Wis., in August,
Franchitti made his breakthrough, beating Zanardi by seven seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, he was first again at Vancouver. Then came a
fourth at Laguna Seca, another victory in Houston and a runner-up
finish two weeks ago in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Greg Moore, Franchitti's best friend on the tour, gives
his pal credit for skill and tenacity on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it doesn't hurt that he's driving the best package out
there,'' Moore said. ``Reynard (chassis), Honda (engine) has been
the best this year. I think he and Zanardi have proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a profession where drivers tend to go their own ways when not
competing, Moore, Franchitti and fellow driver Max Papis _ a trio
of young bachelors _ have become road companions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're kind of like the Rat Pack of racing,'' said Team Green
publicist Ed Nichols.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're about the same age,'' said Moore, who at 23 is the
youngest of the tour's young stars. ``We like to do the same
things. We'll do anything once.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of activities has included mountain biking, go-kart
racing and nightclub hopping.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In Australia, I went bungee-jumping,'' Moore said. ``That's
about the only thing that Dario has refused to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchitti, who was a protege of Scottish racing legend Jackie
Stewart in his early youth, seems quiet to those who don't know him
well, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   He'll have to get his two more-ebullient pals to teach him how
to open up. Because if he keeps on his present winning course, the
auto racing world is going to want to hear all about him.

UCLA OFFENSE EXPECTED TO SPLURGE
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ On UCLA's first offensive play of today's
homecoming game against Stanford, coach Bob Toledo will honor
alumni by recreating the serpentine huddle used in the 1950s under
legendary coach Red Sanders. The Bruins will break from their
huddle in a slithering movement and jog to the line of scrimmage
one behind the other.
</P>
<P>
   But from that point on, Toledo will blow tradition away with an
attack and philosophy unimaginable 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people believe you win with defense and special
teams,'' Toledo said. ``I've never believed that. I've seen great
defensive teams in 0-0 ties. If I wanted to do that. I'd go play
soccer...
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always argued with other coaches. How can you win if it's
a 0-0 tie? I'm different, I guess. But you've got to outscore your
opponent. It comes down to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Stanford's defense comes disguised as anyone else's, the
No. 2 Bruins will score this afternoon. Slow, small and carrying
one of the smallest senior classes in the country, the Cardinal not
only has the worst defense in the Pacific-10, but one of the worst
defenses in Pac-10 history.
</P>
<P>
   It's allowing 480 yards and 38.9 points per game; both figures
are last in the league and near the bottom nationally. It has
yielded an average of 47 points in three road games, including 63
at Oregon. The yards-allowed differential between Stanford and
ninth-rated Washington (95) is greater than that between Washington
and No. 1 Arizona (60).
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State scored 30 points against the Cardinal in a rare
Pac-10 victory. San Jose State scored 35 against Stanford. Even
Notre Dame scored 35, and the Irish offense moves at glacial speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, our defense is going to have to step up and
make plays,'' Stanford coach Tyrone Willingham said, declining to
give an exact date. ``You still have to win with defense, to some
degree.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal can't stop anyone and it can't run (88 yards per
game), but it can score. With playmaking receivers and a
three-quarterback rotation that includes Camarillo's Joe Borchard,
Stanford averages 332 passing yards per game and regularly
surpasses the 30-point barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Willingham may get the shootout he dreads. The Rose Bowl
scoreboard may get the workout of a lifetime, and the 3:30 p.m.
game may not end until 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to throw 50 times, and that's the way we like
it,'' said UCLA cornerback Jason Bell, who watched six hours of
videotape this week in preparation for the Cardinal attack. ``They
live and die off throwing the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford leads the Pac-10 in passing and passers. Todd Husak
will start at quarterback, with Borchard and Randy Fasani rotating
regularly. Against Arizona State 10 days ago, the trio sometimes
rotated by the play: Husak on first down, Borchard on second and
Fasani on third. Fasani, the No. 1 quarterback recruit in the
nation two years ago, may play tight end, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sought ways to involve them in the games, and ways they
could have an impact,'' Willingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Revolving quarterbacks won't alter UCLA's plan. The Bruins will
blitz from all angles, concede short passes, and try to overpower
the Cardinal with their running game. Perhaps the only obstacles
between UCLA and its 17th consecutive victory are turnovers and
lethargy.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Bruins have avoided lethal doses of each. But if
they require an enthusiasm injection, Toledo will remind them of a
21-20 loss to Stanford two years ago at the Rose Bowl. The defeat
ultimately kept UCLA from a bowl game, and it may have been the
lowest moment for Toledo and quarterback Cade McNown, who shared
blame for a malfunctioning two-minute offense.
</P>
<P>
   McNown doesn't plan on a repeat performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't look at any game as a breather,'' he said. ``Stanford
has good players who could erupt at any time. We have to be ready
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The first 10,000 fans entering on the east side will
receive a McNown fan mask....
</P>
<P>
   Between the first and second quarters, UCLA will honor Dr. Louis
J. Ignarro, who won the Nobel Prize for medicine....
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of more than 60,000 is expected, so fans are advised to
arrive early in the congested Arroyo. As usual, shuttle service is
available from the Parsons Engineering Building in Pasadena to the
Rose Bowl.

BLAKEY AN INSPIRATION FOR NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shayne Blakey's left elbow is the size of a Halloween squash, a
marked improvement from the pumpkin-sized swelling of a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Blakey, a senior linebacker at Cal State Northridge, can't
straighten his arm, and he endures a tingling sensation when he
moves it.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors still aren't sure if it's fractured, but that doesn't
matter at this point. X-rays show nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But _ and trust us here _ it's nothing compared to what Blakey's
been through before. Even if the elbow is fractured, it's nothing
more than the equivalent of a stubbed toe in Blakey's experience
over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a guy that has a lot of fun, is always on the edge,''
said CSUN coach Ron Ponciano, who recruited Blakey during his
assistant coaching days with the Matadors. ``He's learned how to
play in the middle and he's done a good job. He's been through a
lot the last couple of years. Right now he's not a guy that I have
to worry about off the field.''
</P>
<P>
   To talk to Blakey is both entertaining and educating. His
willingness to play last week against Montana State and today at
No.23 Weber State is an inspiration to his teammates. Those
surrounding CSUN's football program all speak very highly of
Blakey.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever there was a wrong-time, wrong-place kind of guy,
Blakey is it. Right down to his commitment to attend CSUN. That the
Matadors' season is on the line against Weber State is also a
wonderful irony for Blakey.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Blakey was in Ogden, Utah, he called the CSUN
coaching staff to say he would play for the Matadors. He was on an
official visit to Weber State when he was involved in a fight with
one of the players, former Wildcats strong safety Junior Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy just started hitting me,'' Blakey said. ``I didn't do
anything, and right then I knew I wasn't going there. I called
(Ponciano) then and told him I wanted to come here (to CSUN). I
never visited, but they offered me a free ride. I couldn't pass
that up.''
</P>
<P>
   There is more.Plenty more.
</P>
<P>
   There was the icy-cold relationship with his coach at Mesa
Junior College; the two didn't speak, aside from a few words when
absolutely necessary. Blakey left shortly after his first season at
Mesa and headed to Antelope Valley College for a year before coming
to CSUN, where he was immediately thrust into the appendectomy
fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   To refresh for a moment, Blakey was shot in the side at a party
prior to the season. But former head coach Dave Baldwin _ in an
effort to protect Blakey _ concocted a story that Blakey was out
for the season because he had his appendix removed. It eventually
resulted in athletic director Paul Bubb being suspended for five
days and Baldwin receiving an official reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   In January, his cousin William Randolph Bell, with whom Blakey
had grown up, was gunned down near a subway stop in Denver moments
after the Broncos won the Super Bowl. A few days earlier Blakey had
been in Denver, but he had returned to Southern California for
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to go back there again, except maybe to visit,''
said Blakey, a Denver native. ``It's not a place I really feel like
going back to.''
</P>
<P>
   So with CSUN's season on the brink of destruction, there was no
way Blakey would let anything trivial, like a possibly fractured
elbow, keep him home while the Matadors (4-3, 3-2 Big Sky) played
in Ogden. Not with four games remaining in Blakey's last regular
season, and probably his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a whole bunch of adversity,'' Ponciano said. ``He's
been to a lot of funerals in the last few years.''

 &HT;    Bohls: No repeat of '96 upset
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Nebraska will beat Texas today. Long limb, huh?
</P>
<P>
   History says I'll be right. Before you insult my ancestry and my
IQ, be reminded I picked Texas to upset Nebraska in 1996 and was
considered Looney-Tunes then. Two years ago, however, the Longhorns
had the surprise factor working, everybody but the Cornhuskers'
water boy supposedly had the flu, and Nebraska fans had already
booked every hotel in New Orleans for the Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the site ain't neutral, the fans certainly won't be,
the Big Red has better special teams, and Nebraska will have a mad
on for Texas _ all reasons the Huskers will prevail by 27-17. They
almost always do, don't they?
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska has beaten 67 of the last 71 teams to line up against
it. Nebraska has beaten the last 47 teams that have had the guts to
tiptoe into Memorial Stadium. Nebraska beats everybody, except
Texas A&AMP;M in years ending in '98.
</P>
<P>
   Why, you ask, do the Cornhuskers never have a falloff? Why do
Texas, Alabama, Louisiana State, Southern Cal, even Notre Dame and
especially Oklahoma all slip from their pedestals from time to
time, but for Nebraska a bad year is 9-2 and a fire-the-coach year
is 8-3? Actually, Nebraska hasn't even had a losing season since a
3-6-1 mark in Bill Jennings' final year back in 1961, emphasis on
the final year.
</P>
<P>
   Only Penn State comes close to matching the year-in, year-out
success of Nebraska, and both are mirror images of one another.
Secluded settings far from major media markets. Legendary head
coaches Joe Paterno, Bob Devaney and Tom Osborne. Continuity in the
coaching staff with 135 years of experience from Nebraska
assistants, three of whom have stayed in Lincoln 22 or more
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is the only Division I-A school in the state, meaning
unified, fanatical support, while 10 play in Texas. The Cornhuskers
do not have to share fans, dollars or limelight with a single pro
franchise, whereas the Longhorns share a stage with seven, if you
count the Dallas Mavericks. Twenty-eight states are represented on
the Huskers roster, plus a pair of I-backs hail from hotbeds
Belgium and Canada. Other than Gale Sayers (Kansas) and Larry
Station (Iowa), rare is the Nebraskan who leaves its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, Nebraska is a machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like the same players over and over again,'' Texas
tight end Derek Lewis said. ``It's almost scary. Nebraska's like GM
putting out great cars. They always have a fierce running back, a
smart quarterback, a front seven that keeps attacking you. It's
like they have 100 scholarships every year.''
</P>
<P>
   That isn't so far-fetched. Frank Solich's roster is 188 players
deep, thanks to more than 100 walk-ons. (Texas has 120 players.)
Nebraska has long been accused of profiting from ``county
scholarships'' in which each of the state's 93 counties financially
sponsors a walk-on who does not count against the school's
85-scholarship limit, a charge the program emphatically denies.
</P>
<P>
   Few schools can match Nebraska's walk-on numbers or its history
of success there with All-American players such as tackle Jimmy
Williams and all-conference players such as former tailback I.M.
Hipp. More than a third of the players on the team's current depth
chart, including quarterback Monte Christo, fullback Joel Makovicka
and the starting right guard and tackle, came as walk-ons. Having
the cheapest tuition rates in the Big 12 doesn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom knew the importance of walk-ons and carried it forward,''
Solich said. ``It's been vital to us at a number of positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Some schools cannot keep as many walk-ons because larger numbers
would affect their compliance with Title IX gender equity
requirements. Nebraska carries more women's sports (14) than any
other Big 12 school and recently added women's rifle, probably to
post sentries and ensure football's supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's male-female athletes (67 percent men, 33 women) do
not come close to mirroring the student body, which comprises 53
percent men and 47 women. But school officials point to more Title
IX compliant scholarship expenses of $2.3 million for men and $1.5
million for women.
</P>
<P>
   If you think a lawsuit like the one that resulted in Texas
starting women's soccer, softball and rowing would adversely affect
Nebraska football, think again. Nebraska spends $8.5 million a year
on football. It reportedly takes in about $28 million, which can
pay for a lot of rifles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nebraska has said they haven't had requests for more women's
sports, but that's like asking the fox if the chickens are OK,''
said Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports
Foundation. ``I don't see Texas cutting down its funding of its
football program any more than I do Nebraska. (A Title IX lawsuit)
would definitely be a red herring when it comes to killing a
football program.''
</P>
<P>
   And nothing is going to distract Nebraska from its football.

 &HT;    Debate surrounding highway proposal exemplifies race's intensity
 &HT;    By Ken McCall
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If anything shows the degree of attention the
race in Ohio's 6th District is getting, the fate of Lt. Gov. Nancy
Hollister's highway gambit does.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was run up to the very top of the political
flagpole and was killed by President Clinton's promise in
mid-October to veto the entire Omnibus Appropriations bill unless
the item was deleted.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor wanted to take money from the Portsmouth
bypass project in U.S. Rep. Ted Strickland's home base of Scioto
County and divert it to projects around the area. She got approval
of the state Department of Transportation and took it around to
local governments.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't get approval of the one body created by Congress
to administer federal economic and highway development in the
region: the Appalachian Regional Commission. Instead, she went to
Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Navarre, who got House Speaker Newt Gingrich
to put the proposal into the giant federal budget bill that was
Congress' last order of business this year.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland says he got wind of the proposal when he was asked
about it by other members of Congress. Strickland says he was
outraged to discover that Hollister was trying to circumvent the
established public process and ``sneak something into a huge
appropriations bill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Portsmouth and Scioto County had no idea this
was being done,'' he says. ``Here I see a longtime promised project
being stripped away with no public hearings.''
</P>
<P>
   In desperation, Strickland says he called the White House to try
to stop the end run around the process. He was promised a return
call by Clinton, but it never happened. Then, a few days later,
Clinton and Strickland were able to talk at a public function and
the president promised to strongly oppose the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 16, White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles wrote a
letter to Gingrich stating that if the item was included, ``the
President would veto the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Later that week, Hollister's campaign began faxing the letter
out to news organizations along with charges that Strickland had
killed $320 million for ``six major Southern Ohio highway
projects.''
</P>
<P>
   One Hollister press release was headlined: ``In Baffling
Reversal of Tactics, Strickland Hinges Campaign on Opposing
Progress for His Constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, however, no federal money was derailed, only
Hollister's ``de-designation'' of the Portsmouth bypass. The
district will still receive $25.5 million in federal funds for
highways.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister contends her plan would have cut through red tape, and
that much of the Portsmouth bypass is no longer feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you have,'' Hollister says, ``is somebody put dots on a
map 25 years ago and nothing can be built there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollister says she began having public discussions back in
February about the plan. In fact, she won endorsement of the
project from a number of public bodies, including the Portsmouth
City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland doesn't have a program, she says, and should get out
of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``This program is bigger than either one of us,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland admits that some parts of Hollister's plan ``make
sense,'' but he objects to circumventing the established public
process for setting highway priorities in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he points out, folks promoting a congressional action
simply for the good of the district almost always work through
their congressman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along, if this is not just a political maneuver,
why not bring it to me?''

JUDGES SAY SPAIN HAS RIGHT TO PROSECUTE PINOCHET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for polishing and general writethru.)  (mk) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain _ In a landmark ruling, an 11-member panel of
senior Spanish judges decided unanimously Friday that Spain had the
legal right to bring criminal charges against Chile's former
dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and to seek his extradition from
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The judges' decision is based on international law, including
conventions on genocide and torture, but contrasts with a ruling by
the High Court in London on how to deal with Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
   That court said on Wednesday that Britain had no authority to
arrest the 82-year-old general since it said he had immunity for
actions committed while he was head of state. Nonetheless, it
ordered that he remain in detention pending an appeal to the House
of Lords. Pinochet was arrested two weeks ago at the request of a
Spanish magistrate while he was on a medical visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The decision Friday was a sweeping finding that Spain had
jurisdiction over crimes committed by the Chilean and Argentine
dictatorships two decades ago. Some experts in international law
said the decision set a precedent because while international
conventions gave Spain or any signatory the right and obligation to
prosecute crimes against humanity, this right was seldom applied.
</P>
<P>
   The experts pointed out that several countries had prosecuted
crimes, for instance Nazi war crimes, that had been committed
outside their territory, but that the countries almost always tried
individuals who were on their soil.
</P>
<P>
   But the ruling here affirms Spain's jurisdiction over a much
broader claim: for a multitude of crimes against humanity committed
over a long period by a whole group of people not in Spanish
custody. Until now, such ambitious goals have been pursued only by
international tribunals.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish decision thus opens the way for Madrid's request for
Pinochet's extradition to face trial here on charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture. Friday's ruling may bolster the appeal
pending in Britain against granting the general immunity and
releasing him, by reinforcing Spain's legal case.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came from Spain's National Court, the country's
second-highest tribunal, but in this case no appeals are possible.
Thus the ruling ends a long struggle between Spain's conservative
government and two independent Spanish magistrates.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the magistrates, responding to the
relatives of victims, have been investigating the torturing and
killing by the Chilean and Argentine dictatorships. But the
government argued that they had no authority to do so and said the
investigations were complicating Spain's diplomatic and commercial
relations with Chile and Argentina. The National Court in Madrid
met to settle the issue of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   After seven hours of public hearings on Thursday and four hours
of closed-door deliberations on Friday, the 11-judge panel
announced its decision in a tense and crowded courthouse. As one of
the judges read out that by unanimous decision ``the jurisdiction
of Spain has been confirmed,'' there was a burst of applause and
sobs of relief from lawyers and relatives of victims of the South
American dictatorships. Some shouted, ``Viva, viva la justicia!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a breath of fresh air, a breath of justice, for all
us,'' said Patricia Isaza, a 38-year-old architect from Chile. Ms.
Isaza said she had been kidnapped at age 16 by Chilean security and
held and tortured for 26 months in a camp. ``Even if Pinochet goes
back to Chile, things will not be the same for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, Sergio Requena, a 52-year-old Chilean
engineer who was tortured and imprisoned for a year in 1975, said,
``The door of justice has opened just a crack,'' adding, ``I hope
that this is the beginning of the end of impunity.''
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling was announced, some lawyers and human rights
workers rushed to an upper floor of the court building to thank
Baltasar Garzon, the investigating magistrate who set in motion the
investigations into the crimes in Chile and Argentina. Garzon, long
seen here as a quixotic figure, filed the request that led to
Pinochet's arrest in London on Oct. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon earlier brought charges against 110 former and active
military and police officers in Argentina and issued international
arrest warrants against at least 11 senior Argentine military
officers, including a former president, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri.
</P>
<P>
   European legal experts said the Spanish ruling was a strong
signal of encouragement to prosecutors in France, Italy, Sweden and
Switzerland, where in recent days relatives of victims of the
Chilean dictatorship have filed suits against Pinochet and several
courts have sought his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The experts said that even if Britain eventually allowed the
former dictator to return home, the Spanish legal system would now
be able to pursue him as well as other senior Chilean and Argentine
military officers through arrest warrants if they travel outside
their countries and by blocking bank accounts they may have in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Spain could not try any of the suspects in absentia, but France,
for instance, could. France did try Capt. Alfredo Astiz of the
Argentine navy in absentia, sentencing him to life in prison for
killing two French nuns.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon had already signed a number of arrest warrants and asked
Switzerland to block bank accounts. But if the National Court had
said Friday that Spain had no jurisdiction, he would probably have
been forced to annul those steps.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials here said that as long as Pinochet remained in
Britain, Garzon would continue to seek his extradition, for which
the formal request will be filed in the coming days. Two British
government lawyers have been working with Garzon's team over the
last week as it prepares the extradition request. The reason for
their assistance, court officials said, is to insure that the
request matches British technical requirements.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish government, though it has been opposed to the
investigations, has said in recent days that it would comply with
whatever the judiciary decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government must now send on the request because it cannot
block it,'' said Diego Lopez Garrido, professor of constitutional
law at the University of Castilla-La Mancha at Albacete.
</P>
<P>
   The National Court in Madrid Friday did not outline the
arguments behind its ruling. Carlos Cazon, the judge who made the
announcement, said the court would provide written arguments next
week.
</P>
<P>
   But court officials said the ruling was based on Spanish law and
on the large body of international law adopted in recent decades,
including the Geneva Conventions and the U.N. conventions against
torture and genocide. Nations that are parties to these
conventions, including Britain and Spain, have the right and the
obligation to pursue crimes against humanity, without limit on
place or time.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon has argued that such grave crimes were committed against
civilians in Chile and Argentina. The Argentine military killed
10,000 of its political opponents between 1976 and 1983. In Chile,
according to a Chilean government report, more than 4,400 people
were killed during Pinochet's rule between 1973 and 1990, and many
thousands were imprisoned and tortured. Less than a dozen cases
were brought to trial in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a groundswell of support for international
humanitarian law,'' said Graham Blewitt, a senior prosecutor at the
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, that deals with war crimes in
the former Yugoslavia. ``Frankly, this support is very
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Slepoy, an Argentine lawyer who was in Madrid
representing the Argentine Association for Human Rights, also
celebrated the Spanish ruling. ``At last we have heard that the
great violators of human rights can be caught and tried anywhere,''
he told reporters, fighting back tears.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, we read this in international laws, but the
principle was rarely applied,'' he said. ``We waited 22 years to
try to achieve justice. We had to come to Spain to find the
beginning of it. Argentina and Chile have been in hiding. The
assassins are still walking in the streets.''

</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have opened a formal investigation into the comment
made by a French nationalist leader, Jean-Marie Le Pen, last year

or trivialize the Holocaust. Le Pen's immunity as a member of the
European Parliament was lifted on Oct. 6.

funds had invested $356 million abroad, mostly in Germany, Ireland,
