<HEADLINE> Three African Leaders Discuss Congo (K) Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Uganda, Rwanda
and Tanzania Tuesday met in central Tanzania's Dodoma town to
discuss the political situation in the Great Lakes Region,
particularly in the crisis of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu and their host Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa held
the discussions at the Chamwind State Lodge, sources from Dodoma
said.
</P>
<P>
The talks were also attended by Rwandan Vice-President and
Minister for Defense, Major General Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
However, no details were given on their talks, which have been
arranged as a continuation of the efforts to pursue peace in the
DRC, where rebels have been fighting to topple the government of
President Laurent Kabila since August 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
The war has drawn in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad
fighting for the government side, and Uganda and Rwanda in support
of rebels who have controlled more than 50 percent of the
Congolese territory.
</P>
<P>
On April 23, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba paid a short
visit to Tanzania and held consultations with President Mkapa on
the Congo (K) crisis#,in a move to accelerate the peace process in
the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, the peace facilitator nominated by the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), told reporters in Tanzania
that the regional summit held during April 17-18 on the DRC
situation in Libya was "in the right direction" and marked another
step forward to stop hostilities in the third largest African
country.
</P>
<P>
At the Libya summit, Uganda, a key player in the nine-month
war, signed a cease-fire deal with the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
The deal has been rejected by Rwanda, which has immense
military influence on the rebels in DRC. Uganda also played down
the significance of the deal after Rwanda expressed displeasure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chad announced on April 30 that it would pull troops
out of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Chiluba flew to Kigali, Rwanda as part of efforts
to harmonize contradicting positions of stake-holders in the
nine-month war.

KUWAIT CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah issued a decree on Tuesday to dissolve the

<HEADLINE> Botswana Concerned Over Namibia's Move on Diamond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Botswana has expressed concern
over the possible consequences to its own diamond industry after
Namibia said it would end the monopoly of De Beers over diamond
sales in its country, South African Press Association reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are not exactly excited about what might happen," Botswana
President Festus Mogae told a news briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A bill which is still under discussion at Namibian parliament
seeks to allow free possession of uncut and cut stones and any
trader licensed by the government to trade in them.
</P>
<P>
"That holds danger for the major producers," Mogae said. "We
are apprehensive that illicitly bought or stolen stones from
Botswana could find their way to Namibia and be openly traded."
</P>
<P>
Botswana's economy is based on the exploitation of its abundant
diamond deposits. It is the world's largest producer by value and
by the end of the year will also be largest by carat weight.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, it supplied 66 percent by carat weight of all diamonds
sold by De Beers' Central Selling organization (CSO). By value it
usually contributes 33 percent of CSO sales.
</P>
<P>
South African-based De Beers is the world's largest diamond
producer and dealer.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Repeats Threat of Retaliation upon EU Hormone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration on
Tuesday repeated its vow to impose punitive tariffs on hundreds of
millions of dollars worth of European Union (EU) products if the
EU does not lift its ban on imports of hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
"If the EU does not lift this ban, we will retaliate this
Summer," Peter Scher, agricultural ambassador with the U.S. Trade
Representative's office, told a Senate hearing.
</P>
<P>
His statement came on the heels of the EU's announcement that
it would not lift a ban on imports of hormone-treated beef after a
new report by the 15-member body found that a hormone commonly
used by the U.S. cattle industry could cause cancer.
</P>
<P>
In the report released Monday, the EU's Scientific Committee on
Veterinary Measures said the hormone 17 beta-oestradiol, one of
the six growth hormones contained in U.S. beef, "has to be
considered as a complete carcinogen."
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of American cattle producers feed hormones
approved by the government to make them grow faster and bigger.
</P>
<P>
Scher criticized the report as "a blatant attempt by the EU to
avoid its World Trade Organization obligations" and pointed to
numerous studies that found the hormones were safe. He accused the
EU of playing politics ahead of a May 13 deadline set by the WTO
for the EU to lift the ban.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government will issue a revised list of EU goods that
could be targeted for retaliatory tariffs by early June, Scher
said.
</P>
<P>
An initial list released one month ago includes products from
motorcycles to chocolate worth more than 900 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The United States does not currently have any meetings
scheduled with the EU to discuss the bitter trade dispute, Scher
said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade officials have said they would consider an EU
proposal to compensate U.S. cattlemen for the lost sales, but only
if the move was a precursor to the EU fully opening its borders to
hormone-treated beef.
</P>
<P>
Scher said the EU did not seem eager to offer adequate
compensation to the United States. "It's not clear to us that
there is a serious effort underway in the EU to offer
compensation," he said.

<HEADLINE> Russian Special Envoy Calls for U.N. Role on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Russian special envoy for
Yugoslavia, Viktor Chernomyrdin, Tuesday said that the United
Nations had to be engaged in solving the Kosovo crisis because no
other body had the same degree of diplomatic experience.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said after a 40-minute meeting with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan, his second in one week, that he came
to the United Nations because of "new developments" as a result of
his visit to Washington but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told reporters after his meeting with Annan that
the United Nations was "determined to participate in settlement in
crisis. There is no other organisation which has the experience of
the United Nations. It is very important to engage the United
Nations."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said he was going home now but could go to
Belgrade later. It was vital to "keep up diplomacy until this
conflict is resolved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that it will be resolved," he said, adding that this
would take "political will both in Belgrade and in NATO."
</P>
<P>
A U.N. statement said Chernomyrdin and Annan "identified a
number of areas on which further consultations with countries
concerned would be necessary."
</P>
<P>
Annan's two special envoys for Kosovo, whom he intends to
appoint later this week, would work closely with Russia "in the
attempt to move the political process forward," the statement
added.
</P>
<P>
One envoy is Eduard Kukan, Slovakia's foreign minister while
the other envoy has not yet been named, presumably because of U.S.
opposition to some of the candidates Annan is considering,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Annan, Chernomyrdin spoke to Norway's foreign
minister, Knut Vollebael, the current chairman of the Organisation
of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which had a
monitoring mission in Kosovo before the NATO bombing began on
March 24.
</P>
<P>
Annan had met Vollebaek earlier and "they pledged to work
closely together on plans for possible international action in the
region," U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Annan has cautioned against a quick political or diplomatic
solution. "We still have a lot of work to do on the political and
diplomatic front before I can say that we are on the verge of a
deal," he said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who last week visited Germany and Russia as well as
attending a European Union summit, said most leaders wanted to
pursue a diplomatic or political solution. But he was careful not
to mention the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"If anything, the trip to Moscow and Berlin has reconfirmed my
belief that we should do whatever we can to find a political
solution because the implication of the alternative is too
frightening to contemplate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Most nations want the 15-member U.N. Security Council to
approve any future measures taken to ameliorate the crisis. But
diplomats said first NATO and Russia had to speak with one voice,
which could occur at a Group of Eight meeting of major powers to
be held in Bonn on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Annan intensified diplomatic activities to seek a political
solution at a time when calls for a quick diplomatic solution are
increasing, but he said that there was no immediate prospect of
peace for the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led NATO has been bombing Yugoslavia for the sixth
week, leading to a large exodus of refugees and other serious
humanitarian crisis.

<HEADLINE> 36 People Killed in Tornadoes in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The death toll stood at 36
Tuesday after fierce tornadoes destroyed entire neighborhoods in
Oklahoma and Kansas States of the United States on Monday night,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Oklahoma State medical examiner said 31 people were killed
in Oklahoma alone in Monday's storms. The number of 40 deaths the
office had given out earlier in the day was only an estimate,
spokesman Ray Blakeney said.
</P>
<P>
The combined Oklahoma-Kansas death toll makes this the
deadliest tornado outbreak since 42 people were killed last year
in Florida.
</P>
<P>
The largest twister formed about 70 kilometers southwest of
Oklahoma City, capital of Oklahoma State, and cut a path at least
a half-mile wide. While many tornadoes are short-lived, this one
stayed on the ground for about four hours, said Wayne Ruff, a
National Weather Service meteorologist.
</P>
<P>
The number of houses destroyed in the Oklahoma City area
approached 2,000. Cars were tossed about and crushed. Natural gas
spewed from ruptured lines. Utility poles were splintered into
kindling.
</P>
<P>
Hospitals in the Oklahoma City metro area treated 563 people
for tornado-related injuries, police Capt. Charles Allen said.
</P>
<P>
About 240 kilometers north of Oklahoma City, a tornado spawned
by the same storm system tossed mobile homes like tin cans,
damaged houses and killed at least five people in Wichita City of
Kansas State and its suburb of Haysville. Hospitals treated more
than 100 people.

</P>
<P>
Investors will have opportunities in the Palestinian self-rule
areas, especially in housing, infrastructure and building of power
stations, Deifallah al-Akhras, undersecretary for public works,

</P>
<P>
Francexpo 99 was inaugurated on Sunday by Egyptian Prime
Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri and his French counterpart Lionel

</P>
<P>
The seminar was specifically held for discussion of the
economic development in and trade exchange with the Palestinian

<P>
Rawlings said this when Dr Mohammed Ahmed Sherif,
Secretary-General of the World Islamic Call Society, called on
him at the Castle, Osu, in Ghana, the GNA said.
</P>
<P>
Sherif, who arrived in Ghana last weekend, commissioned a
multi-purpose education center on Monday. The centre has computer,
vocational and medical wings and was built by the Society, which
is a Libya-based non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
 "The silence over what is happening in Yugoslavia is
disturbing some of us. Yugoslavia was given "a shock treatment"
in 1995 during the war in Bosnia but now it is not being given a
breathing space.

 "Why is the voice of the Moslem world not being heard?" he

Rawlings said if Moslem nations would not condemn the bombings
in Yugoslavia, then they should offer to take in some of the
refugees as some western nations are doing.

 "The refugees are human. You do not have to be a Moslem
before you do your duty. The silence of the world is not right."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and the visiting Russian special envoy for Yugoslavia,
Victor Chernomyrdin, Tuesday agreed to work together to seek a
political solution to the crisis of Kosovo, a Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came after the U.N. chief and the Russian special
envoy held a 40-minute meeting here, a follow-up discussion to the
talks they had in Moscow last Thursday on approaches to a
political solution to the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The two sides identified a number of areas on which further
consultations with countries concerned would be necessary, a U.N.
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"They agreed to continue working together and that the
Secretary-General's Special Envoys, to be appointed later this
week, would work closely with the Russian Federation in the
attempt to move the political process forward," said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin arrived in New York following his meetings in
Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other senior
Government officials.
</P>
<P>
The Russian special envoy said after his meetings in
Washington that he had delivered a plan from Moscow and Belgrade
to end the Balkan conflict, but did not give any further
details.
</P>
<P>
Annan, having returned from Europe tour, said Monday that there
was no immediate prospect for peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"We will have a lot of work to do on the political and
diplomatic front before I can say that we are on the verge of a

</P>
<P>
Last week, Annan met with German and Russian leaders, including
Chernomyrdin, but returned to New York with no concrete proposals.
</P>
<P>
The Annan-Chernomyrdin meeting took place at a time when the
calls for a quick diplomatic solution to end the conflict are
increasing after the six-week bombing against Yugoslavia staged by
the U.S.-led NATO since March 24 created a large exodus of refugees
and the death of many civilians.

<HEADLINE> Outmoded Customs Urged to Be Abandoned to Save </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Social workers in northern Ghana
have called on the country's Commission on Human Rights and
Administrative Justice (CHRAJ) to save women and children in
northern part of the country whose lives are threatened by
outmoded customary beliefs and practices.
</P>
<P>
They say these practices and beliefs are assuming alarming
levels and  causing panic in Garu in the Bawku East region,
according to a report by the Ghana News Agency (GNA) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
 Elsie Ayeh, Manageress of the Garu Presbyterian Social Unit
said particularly disturbing is the common belief that babies
whose mothers die during delivery are held responsible for their
deaths and are abandoned or left to die for fear that they could
kill other members of the family.
</P>
<P>
 Ayeh said when such babies do not get people to adopt them,
they are taken away by members of their families only to leave
them to die. They are then buried with curses not to return to the
earth anymore.
</P>
<P>
 Ayeh was speaking to reporters and human rights officials
shortly before she registered a four-week-old baby girl she had
rescued from the northern remote village, and brought down south
for adoption at an SOS village.
</P>
<P>
 "I could not just see this innocent child pass away like
that," she said almost in tears.
</P>
<P>
 Ayeh said in some parts of the Bawku East district, when a
woman in labor fails to bring out the placenta after delivering
the baby, it is believed that she got pregnant through an
extra-marital relationship.
</P>
<P>
 If the delivery occurs outside a health institution, pressure
is put on the laboring mother to mention the names of people with
whom she had an affair, adding that in some cases, the women die
from excessive bleeding or delayed medical attention.
</P>
<P>
 In most of the communities in the Bawku East district in the
Upper East region, twins and triplets are regarded as fairies who
have powers to decide how long they will stay on earth. They are,
therefore, not given parental attention as ordinary children.
</P>
<P>
Ayeh said most of twins and triplets are not properly taken
care of, resulting in the death of many of them. She therefore,
appealed to the CHRAJ to launch an education campaign in the area
to put an end to such outmoded and cruel customary practices.

the new round of talks Tuesday between U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and Russian envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin on the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Gore, along with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger, discussed Kosovo with
Chernomyrdin for 45 minutes at the vice president's residence on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I can't point to any single issue or breakthrough but it's
important we continue the discussions because of the role the
Russians can play in this," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any indication that there is anything new. They
just want to continue discussions."
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Russians can play a constructive role and
we will continue to talk," said a Gore spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said Gore had no more meetings set with Chernomyrdin, who
later flew to New York and met with U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
Gore and Chernomyrdin and top aides had talked on Monday night
until 11 p.m. after a White House meeting with President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said on Monday that he was closer to a diplomatic
settlement over the Kosovo crisis after meeting President Bill
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very complicated issue. We will keep on working. We
remain hopeful," Chernomyrdin added. "The stakes are very high."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin brought Clinton a letter from Russian President
Boris Yeltsin which he has said contained concrete proposals to
end NATO's air war against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The circumstances under which NATO might stop bombardment was
"the main issue" of their meeting, Chernomyrdin said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Portugal to Sign Agreement on East Timor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Portugal are
expected to sign an agreement on East Timor on Wednesday, it was
announced here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The pact will pave the way for 800,000 East Tomorese to decide
whether they choose Indonesian-proposed autonomy or independence.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the two countries under the auspices of the
United Nations began last year with the latest rounds achieving
progress on the way of determing the future of the territory.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia put forward a wide-ranging autonomy proposal this
year and said if the people on the territory reject it, Indonesia
will allow them to go their own way.
</P>
<P>
News reports said the autonomy package includes local people's
control over administration, education and cultural affairs, while
security and defense will remain under Indonesia's authority.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with an area of over 18,800 square kilometers, had
been a Portuguese colony since the 16th century. A civil rift
broke in 1975, followed by Indonesia's occupation. In 1976,
Jakarta annexed the territory.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has since been seeking a "just and comprehensive
solution" to the issue.
</P>
<P>
The latest meeting on April 23 between Indonesian and
Portuguese officials and U.N. mediator Jamsheed Marker decided
that a U.N. organized poll on East Timor's future be conducted on
August 8.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources said Indonesian and Portuguese officials are
putting the finishing touches on the agreement on Tuesday and
foreign ministers of the two countries will sign it here tomorrow.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Leading Economic Indicators Rise In March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The composite index of leading
economic indicators rose 0.1 percent to 107.3 in March, a sign
that the U.S. economy will continue expansion for at least six
more months, the Conference Board, a prominent research group,
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is the sixth consecutive increase in the leading index.
The revised reading is 107.2 in February.
</P>
<P>
"This is a normal-size increase for single month," said
Michael Boldin, director of business cycle research at the
Board. "But because the leading index is up 1.6 percent since
September of last year, there is a lot of confidence that this
expansion will continue at a robust pace."
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a report that rise in stock
price and a slight increase in the delivery of orders from
vendors led the index higher in March.
</P>
<P>
The index is designed to forecast economic activity six to
nine months in advance. The leading indicators are calculated
from a base of 100, set in 1992.

LUANDA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Foreign Affairs
and Co- operation Joao Miranda said here Tuesday that the main
objective of the country's foreign policy is to fight for,
safeguard and promote peace and national security, which is
indispensible to the development of Angola and the happiness of
its people.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to reporters while explaining the country's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said that a scientific concept of security should be
based on such fact that once a neighbor is invaded and its peace
and stability threatened, the national security of Angola is
directly affected.
</P>
<P>
He then came to the conclusion that Angola's peace and security
will be closely connected with peace and security in central and
southern Africa, which is why Angola is committed to be under the
framework of the collective security mechanism of the Southern
African Development Community and the Organization of African
Unity, and why it works hard to promote peace and security in the
region.
</P>
<P>
After recalling the country's foreign policy since independence
which has brought Angola to successfully join the United Nations,
the foreign minister noted that the future foreign policy of
Angola still gives priority to its relations with African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Other objectives, he said, is to "promote human rights,
democracy and the rule of law."

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Justice Minister to Face Vote of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Two motions for a vote of
confidence on a Kuwaiti minister held reponsible for the misprints
of 120,000 copies of Quran on Tuesday received sufficient backing
and will be subjected for approval.
</P>
<P>
The two motions targeting Minister of Justice and Islamic
Affairs Ahmad Khaled Al-Kulaib won support from 10 members of the
Kuwaiti National Assembly respectively, enough for them to get
qualified for a voting in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The two motions were tabled to the parliament before the
wrap-up of a grilling debate which is designed to question
AL-Kulaib for his part in the misprints of the holy book,
according to the Kuwaiti News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the parliament by-laws, either motion can be acted on
seven days after it is submitted.
</P>
<P>
To approve the motions needs a simple majority of 24 votes out
of the 47 elected lawmakers, regardless of how many are present to
vote.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's debate, MP Abbas Al-Khodari, who launched the
grilling motion, described the typos of the holy book as "a
disaster."
</P>
<P>
He also accused Al-Kulaib of failing to avoid the misprinting,
wasting public funds and forgery.
</P>
<P>
Defending himself, Al-Kulaib said "no one denies there was a
mistake, but there was no evidence these mistakes were
deliberate."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the typos to "carelessness of some workers in
the printing shop and mistakes of some employers receiving the
copies of Quran without cross-checking them."
</P>
<P>
As the questioning of the minister could result in a
no-confidence vote which might force him out of office, the
cabinet had tried to avert it, but failed in its attempt.

German presence in the NATO humanitarian forces in the region,
Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said Tuesday in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Eighty soldiers among them will make up a combat unit to

<P>
So far, Germany has deployed in the two countries 400 soldiers
including a telecommunication brigade and a helicopter brigade.
</P>
<P>
A new mandate from Germany's parliament, Bundestag, is needed
for the deployment. The cabinet under Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
on Tuesday afternoon sent an application to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Social Democrats (SPD) and its junior partner, the
Greens Party, had approved the application at the parliamentary

BEIRUT, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese army intelligence has
arrested two Lebanese recruited by the Israeli secret service,
the independent Central News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted security sources as saying the Lebanese
army arrested Sohail Barakat and Faisal Aridi a few days ago
after authorities found out about their activities.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli intelligence branch known as "unit 504" enlisted
the two agents to gather information about the anti-Israeli Muslim
group Hezbollah, the Lebanese army and political figures.
</P>
<P>
They were also asked to carry out explosions inside the
country, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north
from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting
to oust Israeli forces and its ally South Lebanon Army out
of the country.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, Lebanese security forces have intensified
crack-down on spy rings working for Israel and arrested
scores of suspects.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Kills Resolution to Expand War in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Tuesday defeated
an effort that would have allowed President Bill Clinton to use
"all necessary force" to force Yugoslavia to accept NATO's
conditions on Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, which its sponsors said was intended to give
Clinton the authority to deploy ground troops in Yugoslavia, was
set aside by a vote of 78-22.
</P>
<P>
The legislation sponsored by Senator John McCain, Senator
Joseph Biden and five others would authorize the president to use
"all necessary force and other means" to win the conflict in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During the debate, which began on Monday afternoon, McCain said
Clinton should "do what almost every experienced statesman has
said he should do -- prepare for the use of ground troops in
Kosovo if they are necessary to achieve victory."
</P>
<P>
"The president of the United States is prepared to lose a war
rather than do the hard work, the politically risky work, of
fighting it as the leader of the greatest nation on earth should
fight when our interests and values are imperiled," McCain said.
</P>
<P>
But opponents of the measure, including Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, said that it will be
dangerous to approve it since Clinton has not asked for the
authority.
</P>
<P>
Lott said that "This is the wrong language and it's at the
wrong time."
</P>
<P>
Senator Robert Byrd, a senior and influential Democratic
member, called the resolution "a bold and possibly risky stroke."
</P>
<P>
George Voinovich, a Republican senator from Ohio, criticized
the bombing of Kosovo as a "major foreign policy blunder" and
strongly urged NATO to suspend the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Indian Ocean Region Countries Meet on Comoros </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Ministers and senior officials
from the Indian Ocean region countries Tuesday called for the
immediate restoration of constitutional order in the Comoros.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued here by the Organization of African
Unity (OAU) quoted a communique as saying that representatives of
the Indian Ocean region countries met in Maputo, Mozambique
Tuesday and "categorically condemned" the coup d'etat which took
place in the Comoros on April 30.
</P>
<P>
The communique issued after the meeting which was chaired by
OAU Secretary-General Salim Ahmed Salim said, ministers and senior
officials from the Indian Ocean region countries considered the
coup d'etat as a serious and unfortunate development which could
only undermine the efforts of the OAU, the regional and the
international community at large to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and senior officials reaffirmed their full
support for the Antananarivo agreement signed on April 23 of this
year, which provides a sound basis for a lasting and just solution
to the crisis, the release said.
</P>
<P>
They called upon the Anjouanese party to sign the agreement
without further delay, so as to facilitate the early
implementation of its provisions.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and senior officials agreed to keep the
development in the Comoros in continuous review and to consult
with their respective leaders on what further measures, in concert
with the OAU, should be taken to overcome the current challenges
facing the people of the Comoros, added the communique.
</P>
<P>
Ministers and senior officials from Mauritius, Mozambique,
South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Tanzania, Algeria and Burkina Faso
attended the one-day meeting on the situation in the Comoros.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militia Officer Killed in S.Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 4 (Xinhua) -- An officer of the pro-Israeli South
Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and his driver seriously wounded
Tuesday by a roadside bomb in south Lebanon, Lebanese security
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded on a road near Jezzine, just outside the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has claimed
responsibility for the attack, saying one of its groups detonated
a huge bomb near Jezzine, killing a SLA security officer and
wounding his driver.
</P>
<P>
The blast raised to two the number of SLA militiamen killed in
south Lebanon since the start of this year. A total of 21 others
were wounded over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The latest casualties followed a series of deadly bomb
ambushes launched by Hezbollah in the past 48 hours in which an
Israeli officer was killed and another four wounded.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its ally
SLA out of the country.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) of
Pakistan has seized 62 kilograms of heroin worth Rs 1.2 billion
from a car in a major operation and arrested two persons, reported
the Associated Press of Pakistan Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
ANF Director General Brigadier Mukhtar said at a press
conference in Karachi Tuesday that the ANF team was following the
group for the past three months and two of them were arrested in
the southern Pakistani port city while carrying heroin in a Suzuki
car on May 2.
</P>
<P>
The ANF team is now trying to seize the other members of the
group, which were said to have been trafficking narcotics to
foreign destinations for the past several years, noted Mukhtar.
</P>
<P>
In another operation, ANF seized 602 kilograms of charas from a
drug smuggler. According to Mukhtar, the narcotic belonged to
international drug dealer Haji Asif Shah, who runs his own
launches on Karachi-Dubai route.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Haji Asif Shah is a partner of Masood
Billa, a very big name in international drug trafficking and said
more disclosures are expected in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Local Leaders Blamed for War in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A senior Ugandan official has blamed
some local politicians for the 12-year-old war in the Acholi land,
northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kakooza Mutale, presidential advisor on military affairs, made
the remarks here Tuesday at a full packed press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said efforts by the Uganda People's Defense Forces and other
 government forces to end the war have failed due to hindrance
from those holding public offices in the area.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the local officials for the prolonging of the war
which has destabilized the northern region since the National
Resistance Movement came to power in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The military advisor also released pictures of some of the
Aboke girls who were abducted by the Kony rebels. These girls are
now fighting the government, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kony rebels, based in southern Sudan, make surprise
abductions and killings in northern Uganda. Government troops
have failed to wipe them out because of the poor infrastructure in
the region.
</P>
<P>
The army has complained about the poor roads hindering the
movement of the armored vehicles and heavy weaponry.
</P>
<P>
Another report said President Yoweri Museveni will tour the
region again to boost soldiers' morale in fighting against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebels often infiltrate into Uganda to attack full packed
passenger buses or to kill villagers with the sole purpose of
tainting the government' s image among the public.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The British government has expended
assistance worth 2.4 million U.S. dollars to Uganda in support of
the implementation of the land bill and to strengthen efficiency
and capacity of its parliament.
</P>
<P>
The exchange of letters took place here Tuesday, Radio Uganda
reported in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Finance Minister Gerald Sendaula and Britain's
Secretary of State for International Development Clare Short
signed the letters at the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The support for land tenure reform which is worth 1.9 million
dollars is to be implemented over a three-year period and is
designed to assist the Ministry of Water, Lands and Environment in
the implementation of the 1998 land act.
</P>
<P>
The land act, approved by Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni in
July of 1998, provides a legislative framework for a more
effective and equitable land tenure system in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the fund aimed at strengthening the efficiency and
capacity of the parliament is expected to run for a period of one
year.

<HEADLINE> Romania Issues New Treasury Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Romania's Ministry of Finance
started selling Tuesday a new series of treasury bonds in national
currency lei.
</P>
<P>
The bonds, worth one, five, ten, 20 and 50 million lei at an 80
percent yearly interest, are redeemable after 91 days. People
having bank accounts will be able to buy treasury bonds through
bank transfers.
</P>
<P>
Hard currency treasury bonds are to be bought as well, over May
10-14, with an annual 8 percent USD interest for 182 days, 5
percent for 91 days, while in DM, the interest will go to 5.5
percent for 182 days and 5 percent for 91 days.
</P>
<P>
Starting with 1998, the Finance Ministry issued several series
of treasury bonds in national or hard currency for commercial
banks and population, a measure that was successful due to the
advantages offered to customers, such as interests much higher
than bank interests on deposits.
</P>
<P>
According to Viorel Marian Pana, president of the Bucharest
Stock Exchange, Bucharest Stock Exchange is ready to start
transactions with treasury bonds on secondary markets. The demand
of the secondary market for the treasury bonds transactions was
one of the World Bank's requirements in the April negotiations
with the Romanian Government.

<HEADLINE> Annan Has Heavy Schedule on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan began to meet with Victor Chernomyrdin, Russian special
envoy for Yugoslavia, at noon on Tuesday, a part of his heavy
schedule on Tuesday in his efforts to seek a political solution to
the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed talks between Annan and Knut Vollebael,
foreign minister of Norway, who is the current chairman of the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The Russian special envoy arrived in New York after his Monday
meetings in Washington with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other
senior U.S. Government leaders.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin said after his meeting in Washington that he had
delivered a plan from Moscow and Belgrade to end the Balkan
conflict, but did not offer any details.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday afternoon, Annan is scheduled to meet Reverend Jesse
Jackson, a U.S. civil rights leader who negotiated the release of
the three U.S. servicemen, caught somewhere inside the Yugoslav
territory about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
Annan, voicing his welcome to the Yugoslav decision to release
the three American soldiers, said Monday that there was no
immediate prospect of peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief, back from visits to Germany and Russia at the
end of April, last week met German and Russian leaders, including
Chernomyrdin, but returned to New York with no concrete proposals.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief is also expected to meet Sadako Ogata, U.N. high
commissioner for human rights before he briefs the U.N. Security
Council on his recent visit to Germany and Russia on the Kosovo
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Annan is likely to announce his appointment of two special
envoys for the Balkans in a bid to seek peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led military alliance has so far sidelined the United
Nations politically since the bombing of Yugoslavia began on March
24. But now that six weeks of bombing have created more serious
humanitarian crisis in Kosovo, including a large exodus of
refugees from the Serbian province, the calls for a quick
diplomatic deal to end the bombardment are increasing.

<P>
DHAKA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Power supply to some areas of
Bangladesh's capital city was disrupted on Tuesday as a 132-kv
transmission line snapped, the official BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The incident cut power supply to several parts of the capital
city, the news agency quoted a Power Development Board press
release as saying.
</P>
<P>
Within several minutes of the incident, power supply was
restored in the grid sub-stations through alternative arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The power outrage also hit the Bangladesh Sangbad Sansgtha

hours.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh has been facing an acute power shortage this year,
with loadshedding, or blackouts, becoming frequent in the summer
season between March and June.
</P>
<P>
Aging and inadequate infrastructure of power stations,
sub-stations, and the transmission lines are responsible for the
shortage of power supply, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Takes Measures to Preserve Ozone Layer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
completed a 650,000-U.S. dollar project to ensure the production
of ozone-friendly refrigerators among local manufacturers, an
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Vitalis Mugova, assistant ozone director of the Mines,
Environment and Tourism Ministry, told the Zimbabwe News Agency
that most of the funds were used to buy new equipment and train
technicians for the country's five major refrigerator
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"All refrigerators manufactured in the country are now
ozone-friendly, except for those imported from South Africa as
second hand units," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another 312,000-U.S. dollar project to recover and recycle an
ozone depleting substance called chloroflouro-carbons (CFC) also
used in the refrigeration industry had been completed, he said.
</P>
<P>
The CFC were removed during the repair and maintenance of the
old units and all the funding to reduce ozone depleting substances
was being provided by the United Nations under the Montreal
protocol ratified by Zimbabwe in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls on Regional States to Guarantee Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
here on Tuesday called on the regional states to guarantee
security of the region for the sake of their own interests.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Bahraini Foreign Minister Sheikh Muhammad
bin Mubarak bin Hamad Al-Khalifa, Khatami said the regional
states shoulder the historical responsibility toward the Muslim
nations.
</P>
<P>
"We are duty bound to have cooperation with each other under
the Islamic teachings," the Islamic Republic News Agency quoted
Khatami as saying.
</P>
<P>
He underlined cooperation and unity among regional countries
to end regional and international crises and to solve problems
facing the world of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Positive experiences of easing tension, confidence building,
cooperation and understanding are effective in improving relations
among regional states, the Iranian president said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that relations between Tehran and Manama
will be a source of blessing for the two states and will be a good
model for relations among Muslim countries in the Persian Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khalifa delivered an invitation message from Bahraini Emir
to President Khatami and said his country is keen on expansion of
relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini official, who arrived here on Monday, also hailed
Iran's initiative in creating an atmosphere of detente,
cooperation and understanding in the region.
</P>
<P>
He called for expansion of cooperation between the two
countries in all areas, the economic sphere in particular.
</P>
<P>
President Khatami thanked Bahraini Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin
Isa Al-Khalifa for his invitation message and invited the
Bahraini Emir to pay an official visit to Tehran.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Bank rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Canada dropped its
trend-setting bank rate by one-quarter of a percentage point
Tuesday to 4.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Today's move was the fifth rate drop in eight months. The last
increase was a one-point rise last August.
</P>
<P>
In the moving, the bank said despite significant uncertainties
in the global economy, international financial markets have shown
considerable improvement.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the benchmark Dow Jones stock market
average broke 11,000 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, the dollar closed Monday at 69.13 U.S. cents,
hitting the highest level in 12 months.
</P>
<P>
"Given the economic and financial backdrop, this interest-rate
reduction by the bank will help to provide monetary conditions
that would support continued economic expansion and keep the trend
of inflation comfortably inside the target range next year," the
bank said in a statement.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Tuesday declared 11 counties in Oklahoma State and one county in
Kansas State disaster areas, a move that he said would help in
"speeding the way for federal aid" to areas damaged by tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the most powerful tornadoes ever recorded swept
through these states last night," Clinton said. "Whole communities
have been leveled.... A lot of our fellow Americans have had
everything taken from them in those two states, and I know they
will be in your prayers."
</P>
<P>
Clinton dispatched James Lee Witt, head of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, to Oklahoma City, capital of Oklahoma
State, on Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The death toll stood at 36 Tuesday after fierce tornadoes
destroyed entire neighborhoods in Oklahoma and Kansas States
Monday night, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The combined Oklahoma-Kansas death toll makes this the
deadliest tornado outbreak in the United States since 42 people
were killed last year in Florida State.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks Protections for Consumer Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Clinton Tuesday
proposed legislation to control over information-sharing among
banks, insurance companies and security firms, so to protect
consumers' privacy.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also reasserted his support for a law that steers
investment to underprivileged areas.
</P>
<P>
Offering greater protections for consumer privacy, the
president pointed out that consumers receive 4 billion unsolicited
credit card offers every year and that some people are duped by
the small print.
</P>
<P>
"We all know that technology and competition have
revolutionized the financial services industry, but many people
don't have the knowledge to properly evaluate what is truly a
dizzying array of options," Clinton said at a White House
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
According to a memo distributed at the White House, the privacy
proposals are meant to address consumer privacy issues at a time
when cross-industry mergers and consolidation have given banks
unprecedented access to their customers' financial and medical
records.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said too many consumers "have fallen victim to abusive
practices" and the rule changes would give them "the tools and the
confidence they need to fully participate in a thriving but highly
complex 21st century economy."
</P>
<P>
The proposals Clinton offered included:
</P>
<P>
-- Requiring financial institutions to inform consumers of
plans to share or sell their personal financial information, and
giving consumers the power to stop such a transfer.
</P>
<P>
-- Restricting any sharing of medical information within a
financial conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing the Securities and Exchange Commission budget by
16.5 million dollars in the coming fiscal year to boost the
surveillance and prosecution of fraud in stock market and other
financial transactions over the Internet.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Air Force Declares Failure for Hopelessly Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force Tuesday
formally declared mission failure for an 800-million-U.S.-dollar
satellite that was launched into an orbit thousands of kilometers
too low last week at Cape Canaveral Air Station in New Mexico
State of the United States.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was needed before the Air Force could appoint
a board to investigate the accident, Air Force spokesman Aaron
Renenger said.
</P>
<P>
Air Force controllers have stabilized the Milstar communication
satellite and extended its electricity-generating solar wings
since its launch Friday aboard a Titan IV rocket.
</P>
<P>
But the satellite remains in a lopsided orbit with a high point
of only 4,960 kilometers. That orbit poses no threat of an
uncontrolled fall through the atmosphere, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force has yet to determine whether the satellite can be
boosted using on-board fuel and thrusters, whether it can be of
any use where it is, or how to eventually dispose of it. It's too
soon to say whether the satellite will be able to achieve its
original mission, Renenger said.
</P>
<P>
An investigation board is expected to begin its work this week
at Cape Canaveral Air Station. Preliminary indications are that
the Titan IV worked fine during the first several minutes of the
flight, but an upper-stage rocket misfired and failed to put the
Milstar in its intended 36,000-kilometer-high orbit.
</P>
<P>
It was the third failed mission in a row for the Air Force's
Titan IV, with losses totaling three billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The trouble began last August when a Titan IV carrying a spy
satellite blew up shortly after liftoff. Then a missile-warning
satellite was placed in too low of an orbit following its launch
aboard a Titan IV on April 9 this year.

<HEADLINE> Global Satellite Communications Industry Forecasted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The global satellite
communications industry is likely to grow by 17.5 percent annually
in the next decade, according to a Merrill Lynch research report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In revenue, the U.S. financial institution's report said, the
industry will grow to 171 billion U.S. dollars by 2008, from 36
billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Expansion in broadband-satellite services will lead the
industry's growth, rising to more than 30 billion dollars in 2008
from less than 100 million dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Among other drivers of the growth will be the continued
expansion of satellite television, the report said. By 2008, it
will attract 19.6 million subscribers, compared with 10.6 million
as of year end 1998.
</P>
<P>
Identifying investment themes that are expected to determine
the industry's "winners" at the turn of the century, the report
said that two measures of the leaders will be success in carrying
out quality execution of projects and an ability to take advantage
of continued momentum in direct broadcast satellite. Satellite
demand from data and Internet connections will grow tremendously
in the next few years. Meanwhile, the long-term demand for mobile
satellite services will also be a factor for companies in the
forefront.
</P>
<P>
Another defining measure will be a company's ability to deal
with the consolidation of global satellite operators that lease
capacity. There also will be an increased focus on reliability by
operators and manufacturers. The extraordinary number of in-orbit
satellite anomalies over the past few years has focused attention
on the importance of satellite reliability, the report said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Meeting on New Leader Ends Without Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Members of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) ended a five-hour meeting here Tuesday but were
still divided over which of the two candidates would be their new
leader.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting of WTO's ruling General Council, Chairman
Ali Mchumo of Tanzania repeated his proposal, which was first made
on Friday, that Michael Moore of New Zealand be appointed WTO's
new director-general.
</P>
<P>
But his proposal was again rejected by backers of the other
candidate, Supachai Panitchpakdi of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
In a formal proposal to the General Council, Kenya suggested
that consensus be now formed around the candidature of Supachai
because there is no consensus on Moore.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's proposal was supported by India and ASEAN countries.
They pointed out that the proposal tabled by Kenya was in
accordance with WTO's rules of procedures and should be addressed
fully at the General Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
There is no date set for the next General Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made public here Tuesday, former
Director-General Renato Ruggiero expressed disappointment that his
successor has not yet been selected.
</P>
<P>
"This organization needs now a director-general who is fully
empowered to help the preparation for the ministerial conference
and the subsequent negotiations," said Ruggiero. "I emphasize that
the strength of this organization is largely based on our reaching
decisions by consensus and it appears to me that there is no
reason why a consensus could not be reached on this issue."
</P>
<P>
Ruggiero, whose four-year term of office expired on April 30,
selected WTO Services Director David Hartridge on the same day to
handle the day to day affairs of the secretariat until the new
director-general assumes office.

ROME, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
said Tuesday that a negotiated settlement to the war in Kosovo is
drawing closer.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Italian radio interview on Tuesday, D'Alema said
he saw hope in the mission of Viktor Cernomyrdin, Russia's special
envoy on the crisis, and a solution that involved the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
"We are working intensely toward this end," D'Alema said of
ongoing efforts to bring an end to the fighting in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
However, He reiterated the NATO insistence that any solution
hinges on Serbian troop withdrawal from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"An agreement needs to be found that allows for the bombing to
be suspended simultaneously with a political solution that begins
with the pull back of the Serbian troops," D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
He added that an intelligent and innovate diplomatic solution
is to "put on the ground a third force which is neither NATO or
the Yugoslav government."

<HEADLINE> Murder Trial in Kenya to Move to London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The trial of the English tourist
Julie Ward murder, which happened in Kenya's famous Maasai Mara
Game Reserve in 1988, was adjourned Tuesday and will re-convene
in London on May 11.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Justice Daniel Aganyanya, who is presiding over the
trial, granted the order following an application by the
prosecutor H. Dhanji.
</P>
<P>
In his application, Dhanji told Justice Daniel Aganyanya, that
he had consulted with the Attorney-General and was informed that
"an informal precedent does exist".
</P>
<P>
The Julie Ward case has affected Kenya's tourism sector
negatively, arousing the concern of the foreigners over the
security in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer Pravin Bowry, who is representing the accused Simon
Basha ole Makallah, said the defense had no objection.
</P>
<P>
But Bowry told the judge that Makallah does not wish to be
present at the hearing in London.
</P>
<P>
Dhanji made the application after a 26th prosecution witness,
Aris Leonus Gramaticus, the managing director of Governor's Camp
in the Maasai Mara, gave his evidence that he met Makallah on
October 20, 1988 when going to the Governor's Camp.
</P>
<P>
Makallah, a former senior warden in the Maasai Mara Game
Reserve, is facing trial for the murder of Julie Ward in September
1988 in the game reserve.
</P>
<P>
The court will sit in the Kenya High Commission in London to
hear the evidence of two forensic experts, Austin Gresham and
Roger Thorpe.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Tuesday a
credit of 10 million U.S. dollars for a basic health project in
Bosnia and Herzegovina which will support the development of a
viable basic health system consisting of primary health care,
public health, and disease control.
</P>
<P>
More specifically, the bank said, the project will develop a
primary health care system based on cost-effective interventions;
reduce lost productivity due to preventable illnesses, and
premature deaths; and improve national capacity for managing the
health sector.
</P>
<P>
The project is the third in a planned series of three
operations in support of the government's Health Sector Recovery
and Development Program.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is 14.7 million dollars. The
credit will be provided by the International Development
Association (IDA), a member of the World Bank, on standard IDA
terms and will be repayable in 35 years, including a 10-year grace
period.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the World Bank commitments to Bosnia and
Herzegovina total approximately 560 million dollars for 26
projects.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Industrial Drive Behind Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Kenya is several months off target
in the industrialization by the year 2020 drive and the first
phase of the drive is dragging behind schedule, Permanent
Secretary Kang'ethe Gitu of the Ministry of Planning and National
Development said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a workshop of the Expert Consultations on Private
Sector Development in Kenya here, Gitu said it was projected that
the first phase (1997- 2001) was to put in place a mechanism to
make the private sector the driving force of the economy.
</P>
<P>
"We obviously are behind schedule for a couple of months, but
we are in the process of implementing. We need to go deeper and
faster in implementing the same," he said.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the legal frame work which gave foreign
manufacturers at the export processing zones an advantage over
local manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Gitu noted, "I do not find sense in having foreigners favored
at the export processing zones because they are manufacturing
goods for export when local manufacturers who export goods are not
given the same opportunity."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it was important to improve the trading
environment for both foreign and local investors.
</P>
<P>
Gitu said the government was undertaking a ministerial
expenditure review with the aim of improving the allocation of
resources in the public sector, adding that state corporations
should be restructured to make them cope with the rapidly-changing
liberalized environment.
</P>
<P>
Attended by technocrats from both the private and public
sectors, the workshop was organized by the U.N. Development
Program and the U N. International Development Organization,
jointly with the Planning and National Development Ministry.

reaching mutual understanding on the Kosovo issue, said Russian
presidential envoy on the Balkan conflict Viktor Chernomyrdin on

</P>
<P>
Ending a mediation visit to the U.S., Chernomyrdin told
reporters at Moscow airport that the two countries "have realized
indeed what is happening in the Balkans and have come to know what
to do".
</P>
<P>
The two sides had reached a consensus on the Kosovo crisis and
studied a joint action plan, he said, stressing that the United
Nations will take part in the further operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
"During the visit I made American leaders sure about the
Russian stand on the solution to the Balkan crisis: cease the NATO-
launched war, let the Kosovo refugees return to their homeland and
guarantee their security," said Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
He said that after the trip to the U.S., he became more
optimistic about a political settlement of the Kosovo crisis.

<HEADLINE> Joint Efforts to be Made on Cyprus Peace Process: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The United States, Britain and
Russia are working together in a bid to resume the stalled peace
process in Cyprus, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CNA quoted Greek Alternate Foreign Minister Yiannos
Kranidiotis as saying there is a proposed procedure on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The procedure is that after a meeting on Cyprus of the seven
most industrialized countries and Russia, and following the
formation of a government in Turkey, there will be a movement on
the part of the U.N. Security Council calling on the
Secretary-General to undertake the initiative to resume the talks.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis is currently in London to attend various events to mark
the 50th anniversary of the Council of Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Greek official said the process on Cyprus will resume
with proximity talks and be followed by direct talks.
</P>
<P>
He also said the idea is becoming more matured that Cyprus'
European Union accession talks should proceed without depending on
the political situation on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and occupied the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the
island, but the peace talks between the two sides have been
stalled sicne summer in 1997.

<HEADLINE> S'pore PM Calls for Creating Singapore Tribe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok
Tong has challenged his fellow countrymen to create the Singapore
tribe, as the country debates the Singapore 21 -- a report on
Singapore perspective in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
Joining in parliament debates on the report, Goh spelt out the
need for Singaporeans to build a harmonious nation out of
diversity.
</P>
<P>
He said Singapore is not a nation if a nation is defined as a
people with a shared tribe, language and ancestry.
</P>
<P>
"We do not all speak the same language, nor do we share the
same religion and customs. We have different ancestors," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he said Singapore is a multiracial society made up of four
overlapping circles with each representing one community.
</P>
<P>
"What we can do is to maximize the overlapping area. This is an
area where all Singaporeans, whatever their race, work and play
together," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Outside this common area, where the circles do not overlap,
each community has its own playing field. In this separate area,
each community can retain and speak its own language and practise
its own culture and customs," he added.
</P>
<P>
Whether multiracial Singapore can go on for the next hundred
years, Goh said, will depend on whether the different races can
"gel as one people, feel as one people and pulsate with the same
Singapore heartbeat."
</P>
<P>
"This cannot be done through nice sounding slogans ... It will
be built only when we have gone through fire together, and have
helped one another to survive," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister stressed: "We must try and make Singapore
work, build a Singapore nation."
</P>
<P>
"This is a never-ending challenge. The task is not going to get
easier. In fact, it is getting more complicated," he added.

In a speech to some 4,000 U.S. soldiers stationed at the air
base of Spangdahlem, west Germany, Clinton said the air strikes
were aimed at making Europe "undivided and democratic". Clinton
stressed NATO's tough line that the Yugoslav government must
withdraw its forces before NATO let up in the air strikes, and
Milosevic must accept an international troop, with NATO troops at
its core, in Kosovo. (NATO-Air)

ATHENS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation dropped from 3.4
percent in March to 2.8 percent in April of this year, Greece's
National Statistics Service (NSS) announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Greece's inflation was below the

</P>
<P>
Greece's inflation stood at 5.3 percent in April last year and

<P>
The NSS expected that the country's inflation would drop
further in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
Greece, which hopes to join the euro zone in 2001 and meet the
convergence criteria within this year, aims to contain inflation
to 2.0 percent by the end of the first half of 1999.

HEFEI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Much progress was achieved in China's

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Rebound in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department said
Wednesday that new orders to U.S. factories rebounded in March.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders rose 2.0 percent to a seasonally adjusted 350
billion dollars, compared to a 1.8 percent plunge in February, the
Department said.
</P>
<P>
The March recovery was stronger than analysts had expected. The
global economic crisis has severely cut into U.S. exports and also
exposed manufacturers to increased competition from cheaper-priced
foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
However, strong spending by consumers, fed by low unemployment,
income growth and stock market gains, has continued to cushion the
blow and kept the U.S. economy growing during the first quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The increase in factory orders was the fourth gain in six
months. During the first three months of 1999 orders were 3.6
percent higher than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in March was led by a 2.9 percent jump in orders for
durable goods -- big-ticket items expected to last three or more
years.
</P>
<P>
That March rebound followed a huge, 3.9 percent drop in
February durable-goods orders.
</P>
<P>
Orders for industrial equipment and machinery were up 3.2
percent, the first increase since December. Demand for electronic
and other electrical equipment rose 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
New orders to producers of primary metals, including steel
manufacturers, which have been among the hardest hit by the influx
of low-priced imports and are seeking government protection, also
increased by 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders from the military for equipment jumped a huge 38 percent
in March, recovering from nearly as large a drop in February.
Excluding the defense industries, however, durable-goods orders
still rose 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Demand for nondurable goods rose too in March, by 0.8 percent.
But orders for textiles and paper products fell.
Orders are a key barometer of future factory activity.

BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Public housing funds, which have
been established for providing houses for people working in
government departments and institutions, increased by 54 percent
over 1997, to reach 123.1 billion yuan in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Liu Zhifeng, a deputy minister of construction, disclosed the
figures at a national conference on the management of the funds
here today .
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Liu urged improvement of the management by
setting up a standard operational managerial system and internal
managerial system.
</P>
<P>
He called the funds "housing salary" of the employees, and
stressed that the funds must be used only for housing.
</P>
<P>
Any departments that divert the funds for administrative
expenses, office building construction, allowances and other
purposes will be punished seriously.
</P>
<P>
Housing funds first came into being in the country in 1994.
Since then, the new social welfare system has been introduced in
225 prefecture-level cities and 443 county-level towns.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 80 percent of government employees in the eastern
part of the country, 60 percent in the central areas and 50

<HEADLINE> China's New- and High-Tech Zones Gaining Scale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's fledgling new- and high-
technology development zones are regarded as greenhouses of new
economic growth to boost the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
This was agreed by development zone managers, who convened here
in a national workshop which closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the meeting reported that there are 53 state-
approved technology development zones in China, and they are home
to some 15,000 companies.
</P>
<P>
Last year, they earned 44 billion yuan in pre-tax profits and
eight billion U.S. dollars in foreign exchange. Some 600 companies
have realized an annual output value of over 100 million yuan each,
and 50 firms have reached more than one billion yuan each.
</P>
<P>
In large cities like Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, the
industrial output value of new- and high-technology zones accounts
for more than 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the managers held that the development of new-
technology industry has become a measure to increase a country's
comprehensive strength. They pledged to devote more effort to
attracting talented people and financing to expand the scales of
the zones.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Science and Technology has appointed the
development zones of Zhongguancun in Beijing, Yangling in Xi'an,
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, and Pudong in
Shanghai to be models for new-technology development in China.
</P>
<P>
Zhongguancun for example, has maintained such momentum since it
was founded in 1988, that it has been honored as China's "Silicon
Valley".

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Labor and Social
Security is encouraging laid-off workers of state-owned
enterprises to seek jobs in residential zones and small
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
City dwellers in China usually live in communities in separate
zones, where services are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey of seven cities, including Beijing,
Shanghai and Guangzhou, more than 70 percent of urban families are
badly in need of doorstep services, including maintenance of
appliances, newspaper sales and cleaning work. There are openings
for 11 million more workers in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The country has already implemented a series of policies in
terms of taxation and finance to gear the development of the
service industry to the needs of urban residential zones and small
enterprises.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Steps Up Medicine Advertisement Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar authorities are stepping up
control over advertisement of traditional medicines in the country
in efforts to conserve and promote the potency of genuine ones.
</P>
<P>
Producers of such medicines seeking to advertise their products
are being asked to obtain permission from the Traditional Medicine
Advertisement Supervisory Committee of the Myanmar Indigenous
Medicine Department.
</P>
<P>
The scrutiny will include words, designs and tapes of the
advertisement to be inserted in newspapers, magazines, journals,
radio and television, according to the committee.
</P>
<P>
Those who advertise their products without permission will be
punished under Myanmar's Traditional Medicine Law, the committee
warns.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar enacted the Traditional Medicine Law in July 1996 to
uplift the potency of indigenous medicine and to ensure safety for
users, issuing patents and licenses to entrepreneurs and testing
traditional medicines in advanced laboratories.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 local entrepreneurs have reportedly been
permitted to produce and sell their medicinal products.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been using traditional medicines since ancient
times and such medicines are still popular among people in both
urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a traditional medicine development project is being
carried out under Myanmar's current national health plan.

TEHRAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Agriculture Bank is to
receive 1.5 billion dollars in credit and various financial
schemes to facilitate the country's agricultural expansion,
mechanization program and processing industries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> S.Korean President Outlines Tasks for Lasting Peace on Korean Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung on
Wednesday outlined five tasks for enduring peace and stability on
the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
In a 30-minute live interview with the CNN, Kim said the time
was ripe for the resumption of dialogue between Seoul and
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The five tasks are inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation,
improvement of ties between Pyongyang and Washington and between
Pyongyang and Tokyo, helping Pyongyang open its doors to the world,
the control of armaments, and the shift of an armistice system
into a peace agreement on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
It would be desirable for the United States and Japan to begin
the process of improving and normalizing relations with the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We do not believe that the United States and Japan must come
to Seoul en route to Pyongyang. Nor do we believe we must make
contact with North Korea ahead of the United States or Japan."
</P>
<P>
The remarks marked a definite shift in position of previous
South Korean administrations.
</P>
<P>
He said the five tasks were the basis for dismantling the Cold
War structure on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"We must control and remove from the Korean peninsula weapons
of mass destruction such as nuclear bombs and missiles and realize
arms control. This is the heart of the task of dismantling the
Cold War structure on the peninsula and the top priority of a
peace structure," said Kim.
</P>
<P>
Kim pointed out that as long as a Cold War structure remained
on the Korean peninsula, it would be difficult to realize peace
and stability, not only on the peninsula, but also in Northeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We must push comprehensive negotiations in which all parties
concerned resolve all related issues -- not only security but also
political, diplomatic, economic and trade -- in a comprehensive
way," said the South Korean president.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a speech to some 4,000 U.S. soldiers stationed at the air
base of Spangdahlem, west Germany, Clinton said the air strikes
were aimed at making Europe "undivided and democratic".
</P>
<P>
The quarrel between NATO and Milosevic was triggered by
Yugoslavia's policy on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"We must repudiate it, we must reverse it and we intend to do
that," he told the American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Clinton stressed NATO's tough line that the Yugoslav government
must withdraw its forces before NATO let up in the air strikes,
and Milosevic must accept an international troop, with NATO troops
at its core, in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Clinton arrived at Spangdahlem after meeting in Brussels with
NATO leaders. His two-day visit to Germany will include talks
with German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Credit Guarantee System for Small Firms Due </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Finance Minister Xiang Huaicheng
said here today that China plans to establish a credit assurance
system for small and medium-sized enterprises in a step-by-step
manner.
</P>
<P>
Xiang made the remark at the city's meeting on credit guarantee
for small and medium-sized firms. He called it a step forward for
deepening the reform of the financial and investment systems to
create a better environment for financing.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that his ministry is now working on "
provisional regulations on financing guarantee business" in
accordance with the existing laws on guarantee and corporations.
</P>
<P>
The credit guarantee for small and medium-sized enterprises
must be conducted in line with market principles, Xiang said.
</P>
<P>
According to today's meeting, Shanghai, the largest industrial
and financial center in China, is going to adopt the new system
for its 300,000-plus small and medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has allocated 400 million yuan as
guarantee funds, and local banks are able to grant nearly five
billion yuan in secured loans to these firms.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has experimented with the system since 1997, and local
banks have so far provided nearly 800 million yuan in guaranteed
loans to small and medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, 17 small and medium-sized enterprises,
including three private companies and one Sino-foreign joint
venture, received a total of 21 million yuan in bank loans secured
by the Shanghai branch of the newly-founded China Economic and
Technological Investment Assurance Co., Ltd.

<HEADLINE> Turabi-Mahdi Meeting Helpful to Reconciliation in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said on Wednesday that a recent
meeting between Sudan's parliament speaker and a leading
opposition member will bring about national reconciliation in
Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Speaker of Sudan's National Assembly Hassan Abdulla al Turabi
met with Sadeq Mahdi, who was former Sudanese prime minister and
later became a key opposition member, on Saturday in London.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting could be a turning point that would lead to a
general reconciliation," Egypt's Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told
reporters when commenting on the situation in Africa.
</P>
<P>
"This general reconciliation could lead to a multi-party system
in Khartoum and to an acceptance of a change in the method of
thinking which prevailed in Sudan in the previous period," Moussa
said, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
If such a change comes about, it will be "a positive matter,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been in close contact with Sudan's opposition in what it
said an effort to help promote the southern neighbor's territorial
integrity. It fears that a possible dismemberment of Sudan could
jeopardize the Nile River, its main water source.
</P>
<P>
On the existing Egyptian-Sudanese differences, Moussa
said: "there are indeed efforts being exerted to end these
(differences)."
</P>
<P>
The relations between Egypt and Sudan soured in 1995 after
Cairo accused Khartoum of masterminding an assassination attempt
on President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egypt also blamed Sudan for harboring its Islamic militants,
who attempt to topple the secular Egyptian government and install
a strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has denied both charges.

<HEADLINE> IMF Asks Indonesia to Cut Bank Interest Rates Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund's
(IMF) director for Asia Pacific, Hubert Neiss, Wednesday said it
was time for Indonesia to cut further bank interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Neiss made the statement following a meeting with President
B.J. Habibie at the Merdeka Palace here on Indonesia's economic
recovery and its bank restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
According to Neiss, the process of Indonesia's economic
recovery has been impressive with the reduction in bank interest
rates and the decline in inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
Asked how much would be the ideal cut, he refused to cite any
figure, saying he was not good at predicting.
</P>
<P>
He said a further cut in bank interest rates would enhance the
market condition.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have fallen steadily over the past couple of
months, as the central bank seeks to ease pressure on Indonesia's
banks and real economy.
</P>
<P>
The average interest rate in the Indonesian national banks
dropped to 33.21 percent per annum last week from 34.54 percent
the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Inflation dropped in January and February and deflation set in
the next two months. The inflation rate from January to April
averaged 3.37 percent, compared to 4.7 percent in the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
Neiss noted that the Indonesian rupiah was also strengthening.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed at 8,055/8,095 to the U.S. dollar here
Wednesday, compared to Tuesday's close of 8,100/8,200.
</P>
<P>
Neiss disclosed that the IMF has decided to provide Indonesia
with one billion more U.S. dollars, which will soon be released in
stages.

MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is stepping

</P>
<P>
The initiatives include establishing one science high school in
every province and a National Science Instrumentation Center, the

</P>
<P>
The government is implementing its Youth Science Program, which
provides awards to students and out-of-school youths involved in

</P>
<P>
The government also extends educational aid to poor but
deserving students pursuing courses of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
As science and technology is an essential component for
national development and progress, the government aims to develop
the country's science and technology manpower and update the
students' capability, it said.
</P>
<P>
The government initiatives aim to sharpen the global
competitiveness of Filipino students, it said.
</P>
<P>
Expanding the poor's access to quality education tops the
concerns of government because this alone will equip
underprivileged Filipinos with the weapons needed in the campaign
against poverty and social injustice, it said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, South African Presidents Stress Bilateral Ties (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING,May 5 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
meeting with South African President Nelson Mandela here today,
said that China is willing to establish a constructive partnership
with South Africa geared to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang described the forging of diplomatic ties between the two
countries early last year as an important milestone in their
relations, and expressed appreciation for President Mandela's role
in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Since the establishment of diplomatic relations, bilateral ties
have grown smoothly, high-level contacts have increased, economic
and trade cooperation have steadily progressed, communication in
various fields has been carried out, and coordination in
international affairs has become smoother, Jiang said, voicing his
satisfaction with this progress.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China highly appreciates South Africa's role in
both regional and international issues, and agrees with its view
that developing countries should reinforce their consultation,
coordinate their stances, and jointly safeguard their legitimate
rights while dealing with world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he considered Mandela's visit as being of great
historical significance in that it marks a new peak in relations
between the two countries. He expressed the conviction that the
visit would lay a solid foundation for the consistent, stable and
healthy development of relations in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who visited China in October 1992 as president of the
African National Congress of South Africa, reiterated that the
South African government will continue to devote its efforts to
the stability and development of the country, and the peace and
stability of the African region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
He voiced appreciation for China's pursuit of an independent
foreign policy of peace, and its consistent efforts to safeguard
peace, stability and the development of Asia and the world as a
whole.

<P>
Jiang said that Mandela has devoted his whole life to the just
struggle to win racial equality in South Africa. Since the birth
of the new country, its government, under his leadership, has
scored considerable achievements in gaining racial reconciliation,
maintaining political stability, promoting economic growth, and
improving the people's living standard, he said, adding that it
has also made great contributions to the peace and stability of
Africa and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he and his delegation had been looking forward to
the present visit. China is a permanent member of the UN Security
Council, and plays an important role in international affairs.
China's struggle for liberation greatly encouraged the South
African people in their struggle against racial discrimination, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Chinese government for its support for the cause
of emancipation in South Africa, and expressed satisfaction with
the close relations between the two countries. He also
congratulated China on the 50th anniversary of its founding,
saying that China has made great achievements in the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade relations, Jiang said that
there is strong complementarity and great cooperative potential
between the two economies. At present, South Africa is China's
largest trading partner in Africa, and economic and trade links
have become a stabilizing factor in bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
So far, some South African companies have actively explored the
Chinese market, and made certain achievements. Jiang said China
and South Africa enjoy respective advantages in aviation
technology, military industry, and agriculture. The Chinese
government encourages more economic and trade cooperation between
them, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said he was deeply impressed by China's rapid economic
growth, expressing the hope that the two countries would further
increase their cooperation in investment, trade and economic
fields.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Accession of China's Mainland to WTO Creates More Chances for HK: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The successful accession of the
Chinese Mainland, the largest trading partner of the Hong Kong SAR,
to the World Trade Organization (WTO) will create more
opportunities and challenges to Hong Kong, a government official
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The entry of the mainland into the WTO will also have
significant impacts on the long-term development of Hong Kong's
economy, said Yvonne Choi, acting secretary for Trade and Industry
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), in response
to questions at the Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
In view of this, Financial Secretary Donald Tsang and the
relevant policy bureaus of the SAR have set up a research group to
conduct an in-depth analysis on issues arising from the accession
of the Mainland to the WTO and the associated market
liberalization measures, Choi said.
</P>
<P>
The research group will carry out a detailed analysis on
different sectors, such as commodity trade, retail and wholesale,
telecommunications, finance and other service sectors, with a view
to assessing the likely implications on the HKSAR and identifying
new opportunities that may arise, Choi said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government will also maintain close liaison with the
business sector to keep them abreast of the latest developments of
the bilateral negotiations between the Mainland and its trading
partners and to gather their views.
</P>
<P>
"We shall endeavor to complete the research as soon as possible,
and based on the findings of the research, attempt to develop a
strategy to promote further cooperation between the HKSAR and the
Mainland," Choi said.
</P>
<P>
The SAR government wishes to take the advantage of the
Mainland's accession to the WTO to position Hong Kong and prepare
positively for Hong Kong's advancement to the next century.
</P>
<P>
Since the research is still underway, the SAR government has to
await its findings and take into account other relevant factors
that may emerge before considering the need for setting up a joint
working group or adopting other means to enhance economic and
trading cooperation between the HKSAR and the Mainland under the
new emerging circumstances, Choi said.

GUIYANG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A reporter from southwest China's
Guizhou Province announced here today that he intends to ride a
motorcycle alone across the Lop Nur Desert, in the eastern part of
the Taklimakan Desert, China's largest, in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Huang Chengde, a reporter with the Guiyang Evening News, hopes
to set a new record by crossing the depopulated zone in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Huang plans to set off from Dunhuang, an ancient city on the
legendary Silk Road, on June 12, and the whole journey is expected
to take 14 days.
</P>
<P>
The Lop Nur Desert is known to the world, especially to
explorers, archeologists and geographers, for the mysterious
disappearance of Lop Nur Lake, which used to be the second-largest
in China, as well as a vanished ancient civilization.
</P>
<P>
The windy and scorching weather in June in the area creates an
ultimate challenge to human beings' physical and psychological
powers. There is a saying that "there can be no breakthrough in
June". Chinese scientist Peng Jiamu and explorer Yu Chunshun lost
their lives when they traveled there at that time of the year.
</P>
<P>
Huang has made several expeditions by motorcycle in China
already, and he is confident that he can conquer the Lop Nur.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN May 5 (Xinhua) -- NATO's Supreme Commander in Europe, U.S.
General Wesley Clark said Wednesday in Germany that the western
alliance was winning the war against Yugoslav forces which had
sharply reduced their operations in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The air campaign is working and it is working well," Clark
said at a news conference at the U.S. airbase at Spangdahlem in
western Germany.
</P>
<P>
Clark said NATO had effectively disrupted electricity supplies
in Yugoslavia, oil refineries had been bombed and one third of
petrol stocks had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
He said Serbian forces were reducing their activity in Kosovo
and there were reports of deteriorating morale and desertions.
</P>
<P>
Clark confirmed that the Apache combat helicopter which crashed
in Albania was involved in a training mission. He said the
training exercise in which two U.S. pilots died was continuing,
but he declined to name a date when the helicopters would be
deployed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen, speaking at the same
press conference, stressed the air campaign would go on until
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic yielded to all NATO demands.
</P>
<P>
"The NATO alliance remains committed to carrying forth the
campaign, he (Milosevic) must meet those five conditions and
anything short of that will not be accepted," Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
NATO's five conditions include an end to violence in Kosovo,
full withdrawal of all Yugoslav forces from the province,
deployment of an international peacekeeping force, the return of
refugees, and a political resolution to the conflict, Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Crackdown Due on Illegal Levies: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Supervision Minister He Yong today
pledged to continue cracking down on various kinds of illegal
levies in various parts China this year, as a focal part of the
government efforts to improve its work style.
</P>
<P>
Illegal levies include extra charges on farmers and factories
made by government departments, extra fees charged to students by
middle and primary schools, illegal tolls collected on highways,
and unlawful charging of patients for medicines.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the pledge here at a national conference on
improving the government's work style. He is a deputy secretary of
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) and head of a State Council office concerned
with improving the government's work style.
</P>
<P>
He reported substantial progress in crackdowns in 1998, when
local governments at different levels made strenuous efforts in
this field, in accordance with the demands of the CPC Central
Committee and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 8,994 excess government charges, worth 6.8 billion
yuan, on farmers were canceled in localities, while 26,710 excess
government levies on factories, valued at 98.5 billion yuan, were
abolished.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government handled 3,560 cases of illegal toll
collections, closing down 1,072 toll-collection points; uncovered
illegal charges by middle and primary schools involving 690
million yuan; and punished 837 officials who made overseas tours
using government funds, recovering 7.9 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
These efforts helped students save a total of 1.1 billion yuan,
and reduced the number of people going abroad at government
expense by 23,301.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia reiterated Wednesday
that it will only accept an unarmed international mission under
the United Nations in the strife-torn province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We need less arms, not more, in Kosovo," Foreign Ministry
Spokesman Nebojsa Vujovic told a regular press conference in the
Yugoslav Press Center.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the reports that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic may soften his stance and accept a lightly armed
international mission to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Vujovic said Belgrade was ready to engage in direct talks with
the United Nations on the type, size and mandate of the
international mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman condemned NATO's attack on a passenger bus on
Sunday where 20 civilians were killed and over 20 others were
severely wounded.
</P>
<P>
Vujovic said NATO was not only targeting military objects, but
"the whole civilian population", and that the air raids had
assumed a "genocidal character".
</P>
<P>
He accused NATO of violating international conventions by using
weapons like cluster bombs and attacking the country's power grid
with special graphite bombs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the black-out had made life difficult for
the most vulnerable in the population such as the elderly, infants,
the disabled and the sick.
</P>
<P>
The power supply had not totally returned to normal by
Wednesday noon. Trolley buses could be seen stopped in the street
because of the power cut.
</P>
<P>
Vujovic said Belgrade was not surprised by Russian special
envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin's failure to arrive in the Yugoslav
capital en route from the U.S. to Moscow, but Russia's diplomatic
efforts were continuing and Chernomyrdin would return soon.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's interment reform is going
ahead smoothly, with 39.6 percent of corpses now being cremated,
according to statistics revealed by the Ministry of Civil Affairs
today.
</P>
<P>
During the 1989-1998 period, the ministry noted, altogether 25
million remains were cremated, among which 3.19 million were
cremated last year.
</P>
<P>
The data pointed out that in Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai
municipalities, and Shandong, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Jilin and
Heilongjiang provinces, cremation has become the most common
method of interment.
</P>
<P>
However, in many of the country's rural areas, inhumation is
still a common phenomenon as it has been in China for thousands of
years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded,
the Chinese government has steadfastly advocated cremation, in
order to save both land and money.
</P>
<P>
According to a Ministry of Civil Affairs official, in the past
few decades China has built more than 100,000 public cemeteries in
rural areas, and more than 200 near cities. This concentration of
burial grounds has helped to save a large amount of arable land.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A senior member of Israel's Center
Party said on Wednesday that his party should join forces with the
left-wing Labor Party in the coming elections if the party leader
Yitzhak Mordechai continues to loss support.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous member made the comments to Israel Radio after
the Center Party leaders met for several hours on Wednesday
morning to discuss the drop in the support of Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
According to a public opinion poll published on Tuesday night,
Mordechai would win only 7 percent of the vote in the first round
of elections on May 17, compared to 12 percent in the last survey.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that Mordechai will loss to incumbent
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu if a second round of voting is
held between the two, while Labor leader Ehud Barak will defeat
Netanyahu in the second round.
</P>
<P>
The Center Party member told the radio that one of his party's
main aims is to prevent Netanyahu, leader of the right-wing Likud
Party, from being re-elected.
</P>
<P>
He said that it will be a mistake if a second round of voting
is forced to be held when none of the cadidates can get more than
50 percent of voting in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that Barak would win 37 percent of the votes in
the first round while Netanyahu would win 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
And it is possible that Barak would win in the first round if
Mordechai quitted and asked his supporters to vote for the Labor
before the elections.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Center Party told Israel Radio that until now
there is no plan for Mordechai to quit.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Yediot Aharonot said on Wednesday that the Center
Party is waiting for the results of some other opinion polls in
order to decide whether Mordechai will continue its competition
for the premiership.

<HEADLINE> Cochrane to Spend Twenty-Two Days on Wire in China's Chongqing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Jay Cochrane, the Canadian holder
of five skywalking world records, said here recently that he has
chosen the outdoor stadium of southwest China's Chongqing
Municipality as the place where he will live on a one-inch-thick
high wire for 22 days beginning on October 1.
</P>
<P>
The fifty-five-year-old Cochrane said late last month that he
hopes to challenge his own Guinness world record of living on a
wire for 21 days which he set in Puerto Rico in 1983. He came to
Chongqing last week during the Fourth International Three Gorges
Tourism Festival to select a location for his latest feat, and
decided on the Chongqing Stadium.
</P>
<P>
This will be his last time living on a wire for any length of
time, Cochrane said in an exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that while he is on the wire, live performances and
sports competitions will take place below him, including 2,000
children who will make drawings on a huge piece of cloth covering
the stadium grounds.
</P>
<P>
On opening day, he said, he will be landed from a helicopter
onto the wire suspended 300 feet above the ground, and will eat,
drink and go to the bathroom on the wire for 22 days. He will stay
there all day and night, and not come down under any circumstances,
including bad weather.
</P>
<P>
To keep in good physical condition, he said he will bring along
several chefs to prepare special food, which will be lifted up to
him in a small basket fastened to the wire.
</P>
<P>
When he needs to go to the bathroom, he will walk to a three-
sided small cubicle which will also be on the wire.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Grows in Chinese Provinces, Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Several Chinese provinces and cities
received more overseas investment in the first quarter of this
year than previously, Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and
Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng said here today.
</P>
<P>
Shi made this comment at a national televised conference on
utilization of overseas investment. He listed four provincial
areas -- Shandong, Sichuan, Gansu and Ningxia -- and Chongqing
City as models, which have witnessed a big increase in both
contractual and arrived overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Arrived investment in Shandong grew by 28.7 percent while that
in Sichuan nearly doubled in the first three months, compared to
the same period of last year, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
However, he warned that China still has difficulty attracting
enough overseas investment. The latest statistics show a decline
in the number of newly-approved overseas-funded projects and in
the volume of arrived overseas investment, along with a very
slight increase in contractual investment.
</P>
<P>
He called for more efforts and measures to attract more
overseas investment this year, which is closely related to the
success of China's reform, development and stability.

Cochrane said he has met with the mayor and other Chongqing
officials who fully support his show. "Now it's time to go through
the procedures and do the things necessary to prepare," he said.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why he has chosen Chongqing as the place to break
his world record, he said that he loves the Chinese people, who
are warm and friendly, and also that he wants to break another
world record in the same city.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Cochrane walked on a wire across the 2,098-foot-wide
Qutang Gorge, which is a part of Chongqing, one of the Three
Gorges on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Cochrane said that after he bids farewell to wire-living in
Chongqing, he hopes to do more skywalking at other world wonders,
including the Great Wall and Niagara Falls, before he retires to
teach in five or six years.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's National People's Congress (
NPC) Standing Committee plans to send five teams to the cities of
Beijing, Shanghai, Lanzhou, Xi'an and Shenyang to inspect their
implementation of the law on air pollution control.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jiahua, a vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, will
act as head of the law-enforcement inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first plenary meeting of the inspection teams
today, he pointed out, "China is confronted with a severe
situation of air pollution, which must be firmly dealt with, and
without delay."
</P>
<P>
The law-enforcement inspection, which will last one week, will
be focused on the prevention and control of air pollution caused
by the burning of coal and motor vehicle exhaust gas emission in
urban areas.
</P>
<P>
Zou urged the five teams to go deep into the grass-roots, and
adopt various means, including lectures, interviews and sample
surveys, to grasp the true situation concerning the implementation
of the law.

BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is glad that
Zimbabwe is playing an increasing important role in regional
political affairs in southern Africa, Chinese Defense Minister Chi
Haotian said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with his Zimbabwean counterpart Moven Mahachi this
afternoon, Chi, also vice-chairman of the Central Military
Commission and a state councilor, urged that the two countries
continue strengthening their friendly bilateral ties, in line with
the consensus reached between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.

Despite changes in the global situation, the friendship and
cooperative relationship between the two countries has never been
weakened, instead of consistently enhanced.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi, who is accompanying President Mugabe on his visit here,
replied that the Zimbabwean government and people have always
deemed China a trustworthy friend, and that the friendship between
the two countries has been well tested by time.

<HEADLINE> HK Police, Customs Join Hands in Combating Copyright Piracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) official said here today that the Police and the
Customs and Excise Department (C&AMP;ED) have cooperated closely in
combating intellectual property rights infringement activities
such as copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
Yvonne Choi, acting secretary for trade and industry, told
Legislative Council members that in the 12 months ending March
this year, C&AMP;ED and the Police have carried out four joint raids
against shops involved in the sale of pirated discs, arresting 54
persons and seizing over 350,000 copies of pirated optical discs
and other articles worth over 7.3 million HK dollars (935,897 U.S.
dollars) in total.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Police referred more than 320 suspected copyright
piracy or trade mark counterfeiting cases to C&AMP;ED, and as a result
more than 420 people were arrested and 1.8 million copies of
pirated optical discs were seized.
</P>
<P>
The Police referred 172 pieces of intelligence/information to C&AMP;
ED for investigation in 1998, Choi said, in response to inquiries
by Legislative Council members.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1999, 105 piracy or trade mark
counterfeiting cases were referred to C&AMP;ED by the Police,
resulting in the arrest of over 140 persons and the seizure of 640,
000 copies of pirated optical discs.
</P>
<P>
C&AMP;ED will continue with its vigorous enforcement action against
intellectual property rights infringement activities at both the
production and retail levels in order to enhance protection of
intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
The Police have also undertaken that they will continue to
support C&AMP;ED in providing intelligence, step up efforts in
investigating and combating any organized or triad related piracy
and counterfeiting activities, Choi said.

<HEADLINE> US Wary of EU-S. African Free Trade Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A free trade agreement between
South Africa and the European Union (EU) could result in a
significant loss in markets for U.S. companies, an assessment by
the U.S. embassy in Pretoria has indicated.
</P>
<P>
The analysis, distributed by the U.S. Commerce Department as a
bulletin to U.S. businesses, concluded that as a result of
scheduled tariff cuts on European goods, 75 percent of U.S.
exports to South Africa might become less competitive, the
Business Day newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The authors emphasized that the calculations were tentative
because full details of the free trade agreement were not yet
available.
</P>
<P>
Likely to be hit hardest were chemicals, the second-largest
U.S. export to South Africa, which accounts for 13 percent of the
total. By 2004 tariff cuts would give EU products in this sector
a 2.3 percent edge over U. S. rivals, with most of the advantage
coming in the first year of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade representative Charlene Barshefsky said her office
would be watching closely to see whether the agreement "created"
rather than "diverted" trade. It would be especially concerned if
it raised new barriers to goods from third countries, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear what alternatives the U.S has other than
seeking to negotiate its own free trade agreement with South
Africa. Barshefsky said the U.S. was interested in doing that,
but there appeared to be little enthusiasm on the South African
side.
</P>
<P>
Emily Solomon, director of the U.S.-South African Business
Council, said a far bigger worry for U.S. firms was that Pretoria
would favor European firms as "strategic partners" and for big
procurement contracts, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The prospect that U.S. exports might suffer as a result of the
agreement could increase calls for South Africa to be dropped as a
beneficiary of the African Growth and Opportunity Act which is
under scrutiny of U.S. Congress, said the paper.

<HEADLINE> Voter Support for S. Africa's ANC Rises: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Voter support for South
Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) rose from 57
percent to 62 percent in the four months leading up to March, a
recent survey has found.
</P>
<P>
The combined share of opposition parties fell from 39 percent
to 26 percent in the same period, according to the poll conducted
by the Human Sciences and Research Council (HSRC).
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey were released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The poll also showed that a rising pool of voters were unable
or unwilling to express preference for a particular political
party.
</P>
<P>
This figure jumped from four to 12 percent between December
1998 and March this year.
</P>
<P>
"With public satisfaction with government rising, opposition
parties face an uphill battle to win a large proportion of the
'uncertain' vote," South African Press Association Wednesday
quoted HSRC researcher Yvonne Muthien as saying.
</P>
<P>
Completed in late March, the survey was conducted among 2,200
people who claimed to have registered and said they intended to
vote in the June 2 election.
</P>
<P>
The New National Party was still the largest opposition party,
although its share of voters support fell from 12 to eight percent
in the four months under review.
</P>
<P>
Preference for the Democratic Party slipped from eight to six
percent. The Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) and the United
Democratic Movement (UDM) ended third and fourth with support
levels of four and three percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
UDM support stood at six percent in December, and that of the
IFP at five percent.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Front, the African Christian Democratic Party, the
Pan Africanist Congress, and the Federal Alliance each received
the backing of about one percent of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
Though the ANC appeared to be on the verge of a two-thirds
majority, it was too early to predict the outcome, Muthien said.
</P>
<P>
The significant shifts in party support levels from December to
March indicated a degree of fluidity among voters.
</P>
<P>
"With the most intense period of the political campaign still
to come, further shifts are quite possible," she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Shares on the Jakarta Stock Exchange
soared again on Wednesday, hitting a 15-month high on the
continued influx of foreign funds and improving confidence in the
recovery of the country's beleaguered economy.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Composite Index -- the main gauge of local stock
prices -- rose 15.59 points to close at 563.84, the highest since
March 1998.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers and analysts are optimistic that the index will
continue its upward movement until mid-May.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the rally on the Jakarta Stock Exchange could be
partly attributed to the brighter prospects of the corporate debt
restructuring driven by rupiah appreciation against the U.S.
dollar and lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah closed at 8,055/8095 to the dollar here Wednesday,
compared to Tuesday's close of 8,100/8,200.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the average interest rate in the national banks
dropped to 33.21 percent per annum last week from 34.54 percent
the previous week.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates have fallen steadily over the past couple of
months, as the central bank seeks to ease pressure on Indonesia's
banks and real economy.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor Syahril Sabirin Tuesday voiced optimism
that interest rates would continue to decline.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President On Sino-Japanese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin today
called on statesmen of both China and Japan to oppose and remove
all remarks and actions that are detrimental to Sino-Japanese
friendship and to the principle of peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Only in this way can a friendly and cooperative partnership
be established between the two countries, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the remarks during a meeting in the Great Hall of
the People here this afternoon with a delegation from the
Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ) headed by its leader Kan Naoto.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said he was much impressed during his state visit to
Japan last year by the strong aspiration of the Japanese people to
forge a permanent Sino-Japanese friendship and establish a
cooperative bilateral partnership devoted to peace and development,
an aspiration shared by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
 A Sino-Japanese friendly and cooperative partnership for
peace and development has rich contents, Jiang noted, adding that
both sides should dedicate themselves to peace and development in
order to serve the interests of the two peoples and contribute to
world peace and development.
</P>
<P>
 Jiang also said that intensive exchanges between the
political parties of the two countries constitute an important
part of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
 He voiced the hope that the major political parties,
including the DPJ, will eliminate any obstacles to bilateral ties
and play a larger role in the development of a normal, healthy and
stable Sino-Japanese relationship, in the spirit of drawing
lessons from history and looking to the future.
</P>
<P>
 So long as the two sides make concerted efforts, more people
will devote themselves to the growth of Sino-Japanese friendship,
which will then witness even better prospects in the next century,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
 Naoto told Jiang the delegation has received warm receptions
in China, and had also visited a memorial hall in the Beijing
suburbs dedicated to the war of resistance against Japanese
aggression.
</P>
<P>
 Naoto also said that the Japanese and Chinese people should
develop a friendly and cooperative relationship oriented to the
future on the basis of a correct understanding of history. The DPJ
is ready to make active contributions to this end, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also briefed the Japanese visitors on the situation in
China.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Improve Grass-Roots Democracy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Civil
Affairs has commended a number of model units in rural areas for
their contributions to the improvement of grass-roots democracy.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also urged the related departments to further
carry out the policy of "villagers administrating their own
affairs", saying that this policy will greatly promote grass-roots
democracy with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
According to Chinese State Councilor Ismail Amat, "villagers
administrating their own affairs" is a good form of democracy.
This policy, suiting the Chinese situation well, will provide a
complete guarantee for hundreds of millions of villagers to be
masters of their own destinies.
</P>
<P>
He added that China should by no means imitate the Western
political system, and both the democratic system of people's
congress and the system of direct elections at grass-roots are
part of China's socialist democratic system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the improvement of grass-roots democracy in
China's rural areas is also necessary for China's rural economic
reform. "The improvement of grass-roots democracy will
significantly push forward the coordinated development of China's
rural society and economy," he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton said
here Wednesday that the NATO allies will keep the war against
Yugoslavia going until Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
accept all the NATO conditions over the Kosovo crisis on the basis
of Rambouillet agreement.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved a loan
of 10 million U.S. dollars and a credit of 50 million U.S. dollars
to help China address its top-priority health needs, according to
World Bank's Resident Mission in China.
</P>
<P>
The money will go to the China Health Nine Project, which has
two components, one to improve maternal health and child
development, and the other to prevent and control serious
infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
The first component is designed to reduce maternal and child
mortality and morbidity, and to improve child survival rates and
development.
</P>
<P>
This component will be entirely focused on the poorest families
living in the poorest regions of China and will include programs
to improve the quality of maternal and child care services as well
as measures to make these services accessible to the poorest.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the second component is to prevent and control
sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV and AIDS, and other
blood-borne infections.
</P>
<P>
The second component will implement comprehensive and multi-
sectional public health policies and programs in four of China's
high-risk provinces, and will also build technical and management
capacities at the central level, and promote the involvement of
non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
The loan will have a grace period of five years with 20 years
to maturity, and the IDA credit will have a grace period of 10
years with 35 years to maturity.

<HEADLINE> HK to Import Equipment to Deter Drunk Driving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong Traffic Branch
Headquarters has ordered 90 sets of portable breath screeners and
four computerized evidential devices from a German firm to step up
drunk driving deterrence.
</P>
<P>
The equipment will be delivered in about three months and will
boost the force's efforts to cut the number of drunk driving-
related road accidents, said John Lau To-sang, chief inspector of
the Traffic Branch Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"Within a few months," he said, "We will have 330 screening
devices on the road with each traffic officer equipped with one
while on duty, and all our 1,300 traffic officers will be handling
drunk driving duties."
</P>
<P>
Since the drunk driving legislation was introduced in December
1995, almost 1,900 people have been convicted.
</P>
<P>
Of the 64,502 drivers tested since then, 2,983 have been found
over the limit.
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence of an increasing drunk driving trend,
deterrence must be maintained as about 10 percent of accidents
involved alcohol consumption, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, traffic officers are also trying out new camera
technology which allows them to record road offenses from police
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
Such a system was installed on a police bike last week and the
machine is now doing regular patrols throughout Kowloon West
Region.
</P>
<P>
The camera is mounted beneath the front headlight, and allows
the officer to tape-record the offenses of the vehicle he is
following.
</P>
<P>
Lau said: "We have six units similar to these on four wheels,
but this is the first one we have installed on a motorbike. So we
think it will help us record road offenses such as speeding,
reckless driving or crossing double lines, and will help us
produce evidence," he said.

<HEADLINE> Two Cannons Unearthed in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Two iron cannons have been
recently unearthed in Shanhaiguan, the east end of the Great Wall,
in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists believe the two cannons, discovered during the
digging of river courses, were made nearly 400 years ago in the
Ming Dynasty (1368--1644).
</P>
<P>
The barrels resemble bamboo and they are more or less of the
same size, both over one meter long, and about 100 kilograms in
weight.
</P>
<P>
The archeologists explained that the cannons were used for
defense and among the most powerful during the Ming Dynasty, as
most of the cannons from that period were made of stone.
</P>
<P>
Shanhaiguan was one of the crucial garrisons during the Ming
Dynasty and was rebuilt with stones and bricks in year 1381 from
the earlier earth redoubt.

<P>
YANGON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Jewoo Manufacturing Co Ltd of the
Republic of Korea (ROK) will set up a garment factory in the
capital of Yangon, official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The factory is to be established at an industrial ward in
Thakayta township, east of Yangon, with an investment of 3 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Under the land-lease contract signed here Tuesday between the
ROK company and the Department of Human Settlement and Housing
Development of the Myanmar Ministry of Construction, the company
will build the factory on a 0.81-hectare plot of land to
manufacture clothing such as long coats, half coats and jackets
numbering from 80,000 to over 100,000 dozens annually.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total production, 97.5 percent will be exported and
the remaining 2.5 percent will be distributed in the country.
</P>
<P>
The company will begin the production within two years, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another ROK company, the Daewoo International Ltd,
has been operating a similar factory since September 1991,
producing and exporting shirts, blouses and pajamas.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the ROK's investment in
Myanmar amounted to 99.33 million dollars in 20 projects up to the
end of 1998 since Myanmar opened to foreign investment in late
1988.

<HEADLINE> Quality of Iodized Salt Improving in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 90 percent of the iodized
salt made in China has reached state standards, according to the
latest survey by the State Bureau of Quality and Technical
Supervision.
</P>
<P>
This figure is twice that of five years ago, said the survey,
which was conducted among 105 enterprises in Liaoning, Hebei,
Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Gansu, Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan,
Guizhou provinces, and the cities of Tianjin and Chongqing.
</P>
<P>
Before 1994, less than 50 percent of all domestically produced
iodized salt met standards because of backward management,
according to several previous bureau surveys.
</P>
<P>
During the past few years, quality supervision departments at
all levels have strengthened their supervision over the production
and sale of iodized salt. Surveys in 1996 and this year showed
that on average more than 90 percent of the salt reached state
standards.
</P>
<P>
To further improve the quality of iodized salt, the central
government will rectify current standards, and will ban the
production of low-quality salt while tightening quality-control
standards.

<HEADLINE> Blair Expected to Reshuffle Cabinet in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
plans to reshuffle his cabinet in summer after elections this week
in Scotland and Wales, a government source said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The source said once the two regional assemblies were
established this month, there would be people to spare from the
government's Welsh and Scottish offices.
</P>
<P>
"There will probably be some sort of a reshuffle in July,
which is no great surprise," the source was quoted by Reuters as
saying. He added that Blair will no longer need seven government
ministers in the Scottish Office and three in the Welsh Office.
</P>
<P>
Elections will be held on Thursday in Scotland and Wales to
create local assemblies, giving the two regions wide self-
government powers as part of constitutional reforms by the Blair
government.
</P>
<P>
By Friday, Scottish Secretary Donald Dewar hopes to have
resigned from Tony Blair's government to become Scotland's First
Minister.
</P>
<P>
And if Welsh Secretary Alun Michael wins the election to
become head of the Welsh assembly, his current post could be
replace by Paul Murphy, minister of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Blair will retain the posts of Scottish and Welsh Secretary in
his cabinet after devolution but their importance will be much
reduced.

<HEADLINE> Asia Begins Its Road to Recovery: ANZ Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Asia was looking attractive as it
began the road to recovery following its far-reaching currency and
economic crisis, a leading Australian bank with extensive business
exposure to Asia said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
John McFarlane, chief executive officer of Australia and New
Zealand (ANZ) Banking Group Ltd, made the comment at a press
conference in Sydney Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
McFarlane said that the bank's presence in Asia would be
maintained, given the region's strategic importance to Australia.
</P>
<P>
ANZ group's exposure to Asia fell to 5.8 billion U.S. dollars
in the half year to March, from 6.1 billion U.S. dollars
previously.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen Asia coming off the bottom in the last few months
but there is still a long way to go," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It's an attractive time to start thinking about Asia as a
recovery play."
</P>
<P>
The bank Wednesday reported a stronger-than-expected net profit
of 472 million U.S. dollars for the six months to March 31.
</P>
<P>
The result was a 14.6 percent improvement on the prior first
half period.
</P>
<P>
In April, McFarlane told an Asia Pacific Cities Summit in
Brisbane, capital of east Australia's Queensland state, the bank
would consider further future investment in the Asia Pacific
region, where it was underweight compared to its investments in
the U.S. and U.K.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, ANZ experienced lower commercial lending
volumes, particularly in Asia, the Middle East and South Asia in
the first half.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to surge up
on the Singapore Stock Market Wednesday after Tuesday's
rising-through of the pre-crisis level on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Index ran up 33.28 points to
1965.18 points in heavy trading, 41.23 points higher than the
1923.95 points recorded on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The total volume declined to 626.43 million shares valued at
1,010.84 million Singapore dollars (about 594.40 million U.S.
dollars). Advancers outnumbered decliners by 239 to 82 with 117
counters unchanged.
</P>
<P>
CMTel topped the volume list of the day with 57.41 million
shares traded. It was followed by AFP that had 46.11 million units
done. Hotung was the next which saw 40.93 million counters
changing hands.
</P>
<P>

cents to finish at 5.00 U.S. dollars. Seaview jumped up 100 cents
to end at 8.40 Singapore dollars.

25 cents to finish at 9.00 Singapore dollars. Creative 50
retreated 20 cents to end at 21.30 Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dealers attributed Wednesday's strong rally to the rise of
property stocks which were given an added boost in the afternoon
following the government's statement that it would not resume land
sales until later this year.
</P>
<P>
They noted that property stocks gave a positive response to the
news because less supply translates into a tighter market and
higher prices.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Security Officials to Be Trained in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Twenty senior Kenyan government
officials will leave for the United States Friday for a week-long
training course on how to combat terrorism, the U.S. embassy has
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Chris Scharf, press attache at the U.S. embassy said that the
training is part of the assistance pledged by the U.S. government
following the Nairobi bomb attack on the U.S. embassy last August
7 which killed more than 200 people and injured some 5,000 others.
</P>
<P>
The program, the first of its kind offered to Kenyan officials
by the U. S. government, was designed to improve the capability of
the Kenyan security personnel to overcome terrorist threats,
Wednesday's Daily Nation newspaper quoted Scharf as saying.
</P>
<P>
The group to be trained comprises officers from the military,
the police, the immigration department, the Office of the
President and officials from several key ministries, Kenyan
government and U.S. embassy sources said.
</P>
<P>
They will learn how to gather forensic evidence and manage
crime scenes at the course taking place in Washington D.C., said
the sources.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in America, they will also study a course on
crisis management which includes how to counter terrorism. They
will train other Kenyan personnel when they return.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the U.S. government had offered similar
courses to Uganda and Tanzania police.

<HEADLINE> No Aircraft Grounded After Apache Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RINAS AIRPORT, Tirana, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. Army spokesman
said here that no military aircraft were grounded Wednesday after
a U.S. Apache helicopter crashed several hours earlier in Albania.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Lt. Col. Carrie Dornan, confirmed that the two
crewmen on the ill-fated Apache were killed on the spot of the
crash, which happened at 01:30 a.m. local time Wednesday (2330 GMT
Tuesday).
</P>
<P>
He said a rescue team was sent to the crash site and an
investigation into the cause of the crash was under way.
</P>
<P>
This was the second crash involving an Apache helicopter in
just nine days after their arrival in Albania on April 21.
</P>
<P>
A fire was reported on board of the aircraft before the crash.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that there is no indication that the first
crash, which occurred on April 26 during a night training mission,
was related to the second one.
</P>
<P>
Ammunitions the Apache carried exploded after it hit the ground
and the aircraft was basically destroyed, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
This latest crash "will not hinder the timeline and there will
be no delay in the timeline" of Apaches' mission.
</P>
<P>
"This is a combat and non-forgiving operation. We can never be
able to eliminate risks from this business," the spokesman said
when answering why two Apaches crashed in so short a time span.
</P>
<P>
Although an investigation was still under way, there was no
indication of hostile fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
There was also no indication that any civilians were involved
in Wednesday's crash.
</P>
<P>
The names of the pilots will be made available to the press
later Wednesday, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Labor Leads in Scottish Vote, Poll Shows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labor Party looks
set to win Scotland's first parliament election in 300 years,
according to an opinion poll on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Scotsman/ICM poll showed Labor was 12 percentage points
ahead of the pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP). The
historic election is to be held on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ICM poll showed Labor garnering some 58 seats and the SNP
about 40. The rest would be divided between the Conservatives, who
hope to make a partial comeback in Scotland after a disastrous
1997 general election, and the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Despite the comfortable lead, however, Labor will still
probably need to form a coalition to govern the 129-member
parliament, the first since Scotland united with England to form
Britain in 1707.
</P>
<P>
Almost a quarter of Scottish voters have yet to make up their
minds, the poll showed, holding out the possibility of a last-
minute surprise.
</P>
<P>
The poll of 1,005 adults had a margin of error of plus/minus
three percent.
</P>
<P>
The new parliament establishment is part of Prime Minister Tony
Blair's constitutional reform plan which devolves power to local
governments.

The use of U.S. troops in any eventual peacekeeping force for
Kosovo is also a hot issue in Washington.

GUANGZHOU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Young people in South China's
Guangdong Province have now oriented their self development on the
social needs for talents.
</P>
<P>
The reform and opening-up policy implemented in the past two
decades have brought great changes to China, and the reform in the
domestic economic system together with the ever-increasing
competitiveness have all helped change the youths' attitudes
towards values.
</P>
<P>
"Young people during the early period of the reform and opening
up featured active thinking, the ardent desire to chase things new,
and the conflict with out-dated ideas, while the youths now are
more realistic." said Dr. Li Ping, who has been engaged in the
study of youth affairs in Zhongshan University for years.
</P>
<P>
"Truth and Reality" has become the motto of many students in
this prestigious university in south China province. They have put
great efforts in broadening their minds and have shown great
interest in practical courses, computers, the English language,
accountancy and law. And a growing number of college students
would like to take part in academic affairs, considering it an
opportunity to improve themselves.
</P>
<P>
Also more and more young people have gone to study at colleges
and universities after they have made some achievements. And quite
a number of the youths taking postgraduate courses has been on the
rise in recent years.

majoring in the Enterprise Management for a masters degree. She
used to be the general manager of the private enterprise group "
Golden Sea Horse" in the city.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 young people last year applied to attend some
1,670 schools and academies in the province offering various
courses and training classes.
</P>
<P>
Young people nowadays are no longer impatient and in a rush
when new things appear. They instead have learned to make a
decision after thinking twice. A recent survey conducted among the
young indicates that they are showing less interest in pop singers,
actors and actresses from Hong Kong and Taiwan, or in doing
business, and part-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
Their focus has shifted onto more practical things, a suitable
career to show their potential, a happy and ideal family, and
reforms in various social sectors. And 86 percent of those polled
voiced agreement with the attitude that "practice is more
important than popularity".
</P>
<P>
Approximately 80 percent of the 230,000 technological personnel

<HEADLINE> Zambia Placed on Ebola Virus Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Several provinces in Zambia have been
placed on alert to Ebola virus and experts have been dispatched to
screen the refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
for the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
An epidemiologist from the Zambian Ministry of Health and
other experts had been dispatched to Kaputa and other areas in
Luapula and Northern provinces where there are at least 28,000
refugees fleeing the fighting in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The refugees would be screened for several other diseases to
ascertain their health status and that of villagers they mingle
with in the areas they have been settled.
</P>
<P>
"We have reactivated the surveillance on the borders with the
DRC in the North-Western, Luapula, Northern and the Copperbelt
provinces to ensure the moment Ebola is detected we move in to
contain it because it is deadly," the Zambian Central Board of
Health Spokesman, Ben Chirwa told reporters lately.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia had never experienced the disease. The closest
the disease manifested itself was in a Congolese town of Kikwit
which is on the fringes of the Angola, Zambia and the DRC common
border.
</P>
<P>
"Our health team is right now screening refugees for Ebola and
we are in touch with the World Health Organization (WHO) regional
office to coordinate the exercise," he said.
</P>
<P>
The central board of health said that the Ebola virus broke out
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) last week on its borders
with Uganda and Tanzania, claiming more than 20 people in the last
few days.

<HEADLINE> Software Companies Encouraged by Government Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has made
encouraging progress in protecting intellectual property rights, a
representative of the U.S. software giant Microsoft said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Fengming, deputy general manager and executive of law and
corporate affairs of Microsoft (China) Co., Ltd., said that China
is among the few countries that have underscored adherence to
copyright protection by issuing governmental decrees.
</P>
<P>
"The United States just adopted the same regulation last fall,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the State Council re-issued a circular prohibiting
all government institutions from using unauthorized computer
software. The circular was initially released by the State
Copyright Administration in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
Zou Bian, secretary general of China Software Alliance, said
that this official circular forwarded by the State Council is yet
another "substantial testament to China's ongoing commitment to
intellectual property rights protection." He said this policy will
create a favorable environment for the development of China's
software industry.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China has already developed a framework of basic
laws on intellectual property rights protection, with legal
provisions that are comparable to those of many other countries.
</P>
<P>
Liu made his remarks during the launching ceremony for the
Center for the Study of Rule of Law at Beijing University on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has made remarkable progress in the
protection of intellectual property rights in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
China now is making amendments to its existing copyright,
patent, and trademark law.
</P>
<P>
Robert Holleyman, president of the U.S.-based Business Software
Alliance, told Xinhua recently that efforts taken by relevant
government departments demonstrate that the Chinese government has
attached great importance to the protection of intellectual
property rights.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that the Chinese government is determined to enforce
relevant regulations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Bojun, president of the Beijing-based software company
Kingsoft, said that the government's efforts in this respect will
stimulate domestic spending and facilitate the expansion of local
software companies.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yifang, general manager of software-developer Sun Tendy,
said that software purchased by the government plays a pivotal
role in the development of the software market, because the
government can lead the way to guide and standardize commercial
practices.
</P>
<P>
"The State Council's prohibition of the usage of unauthorized
software has injected fresh confidence into the software community,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the wish that the government will allocate a
certain portion for software procurement in its information
technology budget to boost the domestic software industry and
expand the market share for original software.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China has great room for improvement in fostering
a core of qualified law enforcement personnel to effectively
implement the existing laws.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts believe that China will build a sizable
original software market as the government makes greater efforts
to promote legitimate and legal products. This move will sharpen
the competitive end of local software firms and strengthen public
awareness of the benefits of purchasing and using original
software. In the long-term, this will play a highly positive role
in spearheading the development of China's knowledge-based economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition to China, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand
and the U.S. have also issued government orders to protect
software intellectual property rights.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Spends $1.69M in Oil EXploitation in 15 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has so far
spent 10 billion shillings (about 169 million U.S. dollars) in the
exploitation of oil and gas since 1984, the East African Standard
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya Assistant Minister of Energy Shadrack Manga told the
on-going parliament session in capital Nairobi that the government
does not possess record of money spent since the work began in
1984 when the country signed an agreement with Shell Company.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the progress made in oil exploitation in the east
African country, Manga noted that his ministry lacked the capacity
and equipment to carry out oil exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Although oil had been struck in northern Kenya, it was not
commercially viable, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Some members of parliament urged the ministry to give chances
to other oil companies in the country's oil and gas exploitation
besides Shell.
</P>
<P>
An area of 300,000 square kilometers in the country is
considered suitable for exploitation, he added.

JOHANNESBURG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The South African military
authorities have agreed in principle to open the Waterkloof
Airbase, which is situated between Johannesburg and Pretoria, to
civilian transport, Business Day newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Waterkloof Airbase, one of the biggest of its kind in South
Africa, is capable of handling all types of aircraft, including

</P>
<P>
The commercialization of the airbase, designed to help fund its
 maintenance and running, had been accepted by the South African
Defense Force Staff Council.
</P>
<P>
The airforce has spent 100 million Rand (about 17 million U.S.
dollars) over the past two years upgrading runways, taxi ways and
movement control buildings at the airbase, South African Airforce
chief Willem Hechter was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Hechter, a feasibility study will be underway to

LONDON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in

</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A thousand refugees a week are to be flown to Britain after
a sudden decision to expand the government operation to move more
people out of camps in Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- The government was accused on Tuesday of betraying junior
doctors after it admitted lobbying Brussels for an extension to
their maximum working week.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The fiercest tornadoes to hit the United States for more

<HEADLINE> Abubakar Legalizes Nigeria's 1999 Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar Wednesday morning signed a new decree into
law to give legal backing to the promulgation of the 1999
Constitution which will guide the conduct of the in-coming Fourth
Republic.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the decree held in capital Abuja will legalize
the republic expected to come into being on May 29 this year when
General Abubakar will hand over power to President-elect General
Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Constitution was promulgated on Tuesday at the end of
a two-day meeting of the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC), the
highest policy-making body in the West African country, PRC
spokesman Major General Sarkin Muktar said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that the council had approved the
constitution which would come into effect as from May 29 this
year, the hand-over date of power by the military to a civilian
administration.
</P>
<P>
Although General Muktar declined comments on the contents of
the constitution, there were strong indications that the council
may have endorsed the principle of proportional representation in
the in-coming federal cabinet.
</P>
<P>
The highest ruling body had held several meetings to look into
the report of the Justice Niki Tobi-led Constitution Debate
Coordinating Committee suggesting that the 1979 Constitution
should be amended and adopted as the new constitution.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that the council deliberated, among
other things, the Decree 43 of 1993 which stipulates registration
of newspapers and was convinced that the decree grossly inimical
to the practice of journalism in the country and run contrary to
the principles of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, a decision was unanimously taken to repeal the
decree entirely while a new decree will be promulgated, according
to him.
</P>
<P>
It is the belief of constitution analysts here that the problem
in Nigeria has not been that of a practicable constitution but
that of the past constitutions be put to full use.

<HEADLINE> Pyongyang to Host South Korea vs. DPR Korea Workers' Football Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 5 (Xinhua) -- An inter-Korean workers' football
match is expected to be held in Pyongyang, the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea, on August 10 this year, said the Korean
Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached a final agreement with workers of the North to
help promote inter-Korean human exchanges and speed up the
unification,'' KCTU President Lee Kap-yong said at a press
conference after a KCTU delegation came back to Seoul from
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that the two sides set the match date at August 10 to
celebrate the 54th anniversary of Korea's liberation from the
Japanese colonial rule on August 15, 1945.
</P>
<P>
He said the KCTU plans to host a second match in Seoul in
August next year if the one in Pyongyang takes place successfully
as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
The proposed match, if realized, will be the first of its kind
since the Korean peninsula was divided into two parts over half a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
The KCTU, one of the nation's two umbrella labor group,
dispatched the two-man delegation to Pyongyang on April 26 to
discuss with its counterpart, the General Federation of Trade
Unions of Korea (GFTUK).
</P>
<P>
The two sides have decided to use an emblem for the soccer
match, which contains a soccer ball on the map of the Korean
peninsula.

<HEADLINE> Where Is China's TV Industry Heading? (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1996, a similar price war, also initiated by Changhong, hit
foreign brands hard as a result of the lower prices but also
because of improved quality advantages. This greatly benefited
domestic consumers.
</P>
<P>
The sales of domestic color TVs picked up in Beijing's large
department stores and by April Changhong, for instance, found its
daily sales had doubled. However, foreign TV brands such as
Toshiba and Phillips managed to maintain their sales levels.
</P>
<P>
The industry has kept a double-digit growth rate over the past
few years and still has big market potential.
</P>
<P>
Experts say, for example, that more than 70 million color TVs
will be replaced in the next few years while the demand for new
TVs is estimated at 10.5 million annually.
</P>
<P>
However, most TV producers are feeling the pressure of the
fairly saturated market. The problem is whether a price war is the
right way out for them.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that these TV makers have neglected the importance
of technology, which will give them some worries when competing
with foreign counterparts who are gearing up for the next
generation of television.
</P>
<P>
Others believe that domestic TV makers have obviously
underestimated the Chinese consumers' growing demand for TVs.
</P>
<P>
It is time that domestic producers realize the importance of
product quality if they are to compete with imports, other
industry experts believe.
</P>
<P>
A survey by the People's University reveals that among the
elements influencing the choice of consumers when purchasing high-
grade electrical appliances, a new brand name accounts for 23
percent, quality for 21 percent, service for 12 percent, and price
is only 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thus domestic TV producers are being urged to shift their
attention from the damaging price war to improving the
competitiveness of their technology so as to narrow the gap
between domestic and foreign brands in terms of product quality.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Where Is China's Color TV Industry Heading?   (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- With the outbreak of a new round of
price wars in the color TV sector, Chinese economists, the major
players in the business and "on-lookers" are all wondering where
China's TV industry is heading?
</P>
<P>
There have been five similar trade battles since 1998 and the
latest has been launched by the Changhong Electronic Group Co.,
China's biggest TV manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
But the company claims the move is not merely to boost sales
during a sluggish period of the market although skeptics point to
the fact that this is the third price war it has kick-started.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo Dexuan, deputy director of Changhong's
Marketing Department, the aim is to squeeze out weak competitors
but is also a preliminary counter measure against the invasion of
foreign brands when China's WTO accession allows them in.
</P>
<P>
Changhong presently has a 30-percent share of the domestic TV
market with an annual sales of 21.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Although many TV producers predicted the price-cut, joining in
was no easy decision for many of them and only market pressure and
the complaints of their sales agents won the day.
</P>
<P>
And against the trend Konka, the country's second largest TV
maker, announced it is raising the prices of its hi-tech and
patented products when it had, in fact, pledged to slash prices by
a bigger margin than Changhong.

<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Qian Shugen, deputy chief of the
General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), said
today that ties between the armed forces of China and Bangladesh
embody their good-neighborly friendship.
</P>
<P>
Qian made the remark during talks here with visiting
Bangladeshi Chief of the Army Staff Muhammad Mustafizur Rahman.
</P>
<P>
The development of state-to-state ties and military ties not
only accords with the fundamental interest of the people of the
two countries, but also benefits the peace and stability of the
region.
</P>
<P>
Mustafizur said that the two countries share consensus in many
international and regional issues, and have always supported each
other in struggles against foreign invasion for the preservation
of state independence and sovereignty.
</P>

The Bangladeshi government and army highly treasure their
friendly ties with China, and will continue to devote themselves
to the development of these ties, he said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu maintained on
Tuesday that it was his government's tough stance that deterred
the Palestinians from declaring statehood on May 4.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference to mark the date when Palestinian National
Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat had threatened to declare
statehood unilaterally, Netanyahu delared that "this is an
important success for Israel and for the government. It did not
come about on its own steam."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Palestinian National Authority (PNA) has postponed
until July its decision on whether to declare an independent
state, according to senior Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the PNA expected the Israeli political
situation to be clear by that time, making it possible to predict
Israel's policy on the continuation of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The officials reiterated that the declaration was deferred at
the request of the United States, with an intention to avoid
influencing the Israeli election.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- According to a public opinion poll published on Tuesday
night, Israeli Center Party leader Yitzhak Mordechai would win
only 7 percent of the vote in the May elections, compared to 12
percent in the last survey.
</P>
<P>
The Center Party is waiting for the results of some other
opinion polls in order to decide whether Mordechai will continue
its competition for the premiership.

<HEADLINE> Land Reclamation in Western China Should Handled Cautiously </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China should take a cautious
attitude in wasteland reclamation in its western region to avoid
deterioration of the natural ecological environment, warned some
environmental scientists.
</P>
<P>
"It's necessary to reclaim land in western China," said Shi
Yulin, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering. "But
it should depend on the potential of water resources."
</P>
<P>
Blind development with no plans and schedule will only have
negative results, said Shi, who is also the president of the China
Natural Resources Association.
</P>
<P>
China has 130 million hectares of arable land, and the per
capita arable land is only 0.1 hectare. The Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations has set the warning level of
per capita arable land at 0.05 hectare.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese economists proposed reclaiming wasteland in the
western part of the country on a large scale to increase arable
land.
</P>
<P>
After years of study of the natural conditions in the western
region, Shi pointed out that lack of water resources will restrict
the land reclamation.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural irrigation in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
and the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region uses
water from the Yellow River. Large scale reclamation in the region
will make the drying up of the river more serious, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
He said that the annual precipitation in the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region is less than 200 millimeters. The ecological
environment can not afford large scale reclamation.
</P>
<P>
He said reclamation in western China should be on small scale,
and water-saving irrigation technologies should be introduced in
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts said that rather than blind reclamation,
it's better to further exploit the potential of the existing
arable land and increase the per unit yield.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sets $3Bln Annual Tax Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Revenue Authority has
unveiled a new tax management program that will enable it to
realize a target of 180 billion shillings (around three billion
U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
The authority has put in place strict measures to deal with
fraud cases to enable it to attain the tax target and sustain its
revenue collection in all brackets through improved quality
control verification program, the Kenya Times newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting hosted for media fraternity in Nairobi
Tuesday, Commissioner General John Msafari noted that his
authority will not succumb to any pressure, saying that
disciplinary cases on employees involved in fraud will be meted on
the spot.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner stressed that any worker found condoning graft
will be sacked , then charged before a court of law and risked
having all his properties acquired illegally seized.
</P>
<P>
He also condemned officials in the authority who were colluding
with members of the business community to carry out corrupt
practices.
</P>
<P>
Among its new program, the Kenya Revenue Authority plans to
open centers countrywide fully equipped with current technology to
serve taxpayers with minimum wastage time, and to reopen its
Customs school in Mombasa and its Value Added Tax school in
Nairobi to train its workers.
</P>
<P>
Msafari noted that in so doing, the government aims to make tax
 administration more efficient and effective by eliminating
bureaucracy at all levels.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that since its inception in July 1995, the
authority's annual revenue had continued to rise at the pace of 14
percent and above for the last three years.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Build 230 Hospitals in Next 5 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will build 230 mini-hospitals
in the next five years to deal with emergencies and improve
community health education, State Minister for Health Philip
Byaruhanga has said
</P>
<P>
Launching a sanitation report here Tuesday, Byaruhanga said
that the mini-hospitals to be built are also responsible for
boosting the public health awareness.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, each constituency in Uganda will have
a mini- hospital where emergency surgical operations can be done,
guaranteeing that everybody has access to health services.
</P>
<P>
The New Vision newspaper Wednesday quoted the state minister as
saying that the rural poor still have little knowledge about
sanitation and public health.
</P>
<P>
In the northern district of Kitgum, the nearest hospital where
a woman who can get a caesarean operation is 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
On average, 51 percent of Ugandans have access to health
services and there are up to 27,140 persons per doctor.
</P>
<P>
In this fiscal year, government spending on health is 72
billion shillings (60 million U.S. dollars), half of which is
spent on Mulago hospital, the largest hospital in Uganda.

NAIROBI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen passengers aboard a
chartered plane destined for Kenyan capital Nairobi from Moyale
town in Eastern Province Tuesday escaped death as the automatic

<HEADLINE> Over 12,000 Registered as Nominated MPs in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Forty-six out of Indonesia's 48
political parties which will contest the June 7 general election
have submitted their lists of legislative candidates to the
Election Commission (KPU) by the closing of registration
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The registration closed at 00:00 local time Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to KPU, 12,196 members of the 46 parties have been
registered as prospective members of the House of People's
Representatives, which will be formed as a result of the general
election.
</P>
<P>
Parties also must submit their list of provincial legislative
candidates to provincial election committees and their list of
regency legislative candidates to regency election committees.
</P>
<P>
Two political parties, the National Christian Party and the
Indonesian Muslim Awakening Party, failed to meet the
above-mentioned deadline set for the submission of a list of
nominated legislators to the KPU.
</P>
<P>
These two parties will still take part in the general election
but will not be represented in the House.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Golkar (Functional Group) Party tops the list of
nominated legislators with 902 nominated legislators from all 27
provinces in Indonesia, followed by the Indonesian Democratic
Party with 870 nominated legislators, also from 27 provinces, and
the Justice and Unity Party with 660 nominated legislators from
all provinces.
</P>
<P>
The chairpersons of Golkar Party (Akbar Tanjung), the National
Mandate Party (Amien Rais), the United Development Party (Hamzah
Haz) and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (Megawati
Soekarnoputri) will join the competition for Jakarta's 18 seats in
the House.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a number of parties have put forward only a
small number of nominated legislators, such as the Workers'
Solidarity Party with 22 people from 8 provinces, the Democratic
People's Party with 31 candidates from 12 provinces, the
Unity-in-Diversity Party with 61 people from 20 provinces, and the
Indonesian People's Nationalist Party with 64 people from 16
provinces.
</P>
<P>
KPU Chairman Rudini has reaffirmed that the KPU will not
tolerate any late submission of the list of nominated legislators,
and that the deadline remains to be 00:00 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said parties would be given the opportunity to complete
necessary documents, such as the doctor's certificates, by May 9.
</P>
<P>
The commission will announce a permanent list of legislative
candidates on May 18, a day before the start of the campaign
period.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, voters are scheduled to elect 462 members of the
House of Representatives, who will join 38 appointees from the
Indonesian Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
The 500 House members will later this year meet with 135
delegates from regions and 65 delegates from various groups to
form the People's Consultative Assembly (MPR).
</P>
<P>
The MPR will convene in November to elect the next president
and vice president.

Estrada earlier ordered the resumption of the stalled peace

Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After his meeting with Russian presidential envoy Viktor
Chernomyrdin on Tuesday in Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton
said that he would be ready to ``make a pause'' of the bombings if
the Serbs start withdrawing their troops from Kosovo. Experts
considered this as a little opening by the U.S. president toward
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
-- At 8,300 meters of altitude, an American expedition team has
found the corpse of British explorer George Mallory, who died in
1924 when trying to reach the top of Everest. But the enigma
remains total as for whether he had really attained the summit.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- While the bombings of NATO continued in the day and the
night on Tuesday across all the territory of Yugoslavia, the
efforts of mediation and international initiatives seeking a
political solution to the Yugoslav crisis has not made any
concrete result. The meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton
and Russian presidential envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin ended without
any breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
-- While London, Bonn and Washington have stressed their policy
of cooperation with the International Court in charge of war
crimes in former Yugoslavia, France is keeping a low profile by
adopting a purely technical approach in its cooperation with the
tribunal, stressing efficiency rather than publicity.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Where Is China's Color TV Industry Heading?   (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- With the outbreak of a new round of
price wars in the color TV sector, Chinese economists, the major
players in the business and "on-lookers" are all wondering where
China's TV industry is heading?
</P>
<P>
There have been five similar trade battles since 1988 and the
latest has been launched by the Changhong Electronic Group Co.,
China's biggest TV manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
But the company claims the move is not merely to boost sales
during a sluggish period of the market although skeptics point to
the fact that this is the third price war it has kick-started.
</P>
<P>
According to Guo Dexuan, deputy director of Changhong's
Marketing Department, the aim is to squeeze out weak competitors
but is also a preliminary counter measure against the invasion of
foreign brands when China's WTO accession allows them in.
</P>
<P>
Changhong presently has a 30-percent share of the domestic TV
market with an annual sales of 21.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Although many TV producers predicted the price-cut, joining in
was no easy decision for many of them and only market pressure and
the complaints of their sales agents won the day.
</P>
<P>
And against the trend Konka, the country's second largest TV
maker, announced it is raising the prices of its hi-tech and
patented products when it had, in fact, pledged to slash prices by
a bigger margin than Changhong.

<HEADLINE> Oral Flu Drug Set For Trials in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- An oral form of a new class of flu
drugs which stop the virus from replicating is undergoing clinical
trials in Australia and New Zealand this winter.
</P>
<P>
More than 800 elderly people will take part in the study of the
drug GS4104, the Australian Associated Press reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Greg Tannock, professor of virology with RMIT University, said
the drug, taken as a tablet, is a neuraminidase inhibitor, acting
on the enzyme which releases new virus particles from infected
cells in the respiratory tract.
</P>
<P>
The first drug of this type, Relenza, marketed by Biota
Holdings Ltd. in partnership with Glaxo Wellcome, has to be
inhaled.
</P>
<P>
Relenza has been approved by Australia's Therapeutic Goods
Administration but is struggling in the race for the lucrative
U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Its initial application for approval was rejected by the United
States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but will be reviewed in
July.
</P>
<P>
F Hoffmann-la Roche Ltd., in a venture with Gilead, has filed
for FDA approval also and is banking on its drug's greater
acceptability to patients.
</P>
<P>
"This drug can be effective if taken even up to 36 hours after
symptoms start," Tannock said.

<HEADLINE> APEC Forum on Transportation Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A forum on satellite-based
transportation technologies opened here Wednesday under the
auspices of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
Transportation Working Group.
</P>
<P>
The forum is aimed at addressing how the use of satellite
technologies could provide safer, more efficient and
cost-effective land, sea and air transportation as well as
inter-modal transportation, said Singapore Minister-of-State for
Communications John Chen in his opening address.
</P>
<P>
Besides panel presentations and discussions, the three-day
forum will have demonstrations of satellite technologies as used
in all the above modes of transportation, said a press release
issued at the Singapore Aviation Academy.
</P>
<P>
The highlight of this forum will be a series of demonstrations
of satellite-based navigation technology for aircraft landing,
which will be the first of its kind in the Asia-Pacific region and
will be performed by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) with the support from its Singapore counterpart, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
For each demonstration, a specially-equipped FAA's B727
aircraft will be flying precision approaches into Singapore Changi
Airport using guidance from the U.S. Global Positioning System
(GPS) and a locally-installed GPS receiver station linking a GPS
network in the United States, according to the press release.
</P>
<P>
The Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) will also
demonstrate the use of satellite-based technology for air traffic
controllers to track aircraft beyond radar coverage and to
exchange operational messages with pilots.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is the first in the world to provide such integrated
services to suitably-equipped aircraft, said a CAAS official.
</P>
<P>
During the forum, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore
will also show its implementation of ship navigation and
positioning using satellites while the Land Transport Authority
will be demonstrating TrafficScan, its satellite-based road
traffic monitoring system.

<HEADLINE> China Producing Superthin Stainless Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's first stainless steel as
thin as 0.05 millimeters began coming off the production line here
recently.
</P>
<P>
The line was installed by the Shanghai Shida Precision
Stainless Steel Co. Ltd., a Sino-U.S. joint venture, and can
produce stainless steel that is 0.3 millimeters to 0.05
millimeters in thickness and less than 610 millimeters wide.
</P>
<P>
The superthin stainless steel is widely used in automobile
engines, computers, color TVs, and cameras but China has mainly
relied on imports in the past.
</P>
<P>
Shida was started by the Shanghai Shigang Steel Co. Ltd. and
the U.S.'s Allegheny Ludlum with 30 million U.S. dollars worth of
investment and has 12 million U.S. dollars worth of registered
capital. It is designed to produce 20,000 tons of precision
stainless steel annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Shandong province, one of its
leading exporters, had more than 16.6 billion U.S. dollars worth
of imports and exports in 1998, accounting for a fifth of the
province's GNP.
</P>
<P>
Manufactured goods account for 78 percent of the exports, a big
rise from the 35.6 percent in 1980, when the bulk of exports were
primary products.
</P>
<P>
Prominent businesses like the Haier Group and HiSense Group,
which produce household appliances, and the motorcycle
manufacturer the Qingqi Group have improved their business abroad
with quality products.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the province had used 23.3 billion U.S.
dollars worth of overseas investment and it now has more than 21,
000 overseas-funded enterprises, which contribute as much as 50
percent of the exports. It also has more than 12,000 companies
involved in foreign trade, 280 of which issue shares.
</P>
<P>
The province will spend a large amount of overseas money on
large, hi-tech projects and will give priority to exporting small
sets of equipment and processing and assembly work using imported
materials.

<HEADLINE> China Expanding Business Of Rural Credit Cooperatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's rural credit cooperatives,
which are important financial institutions in its vast rural area,
reported substantial increases in deposits and loans in the first
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank,
reports deposits in rural cooperatives of 1.26 trillion yuan by
the end of March, or 4.1 percent more than that at the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Loans extended by the cooperatives amounted to 861 billion yuan,
up 4.5 percent from the beginning of the year, with 300 billion
yuan going to agriculture, an increase of 6.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
A more diversified rural economy has meant various demands for
additional funds on top of a growing consumer credit market,
according to a recent edition of Financial News. And, to fuel
rural economic growth, rural cooperatives are looking for more
deposits and changing their management methods to cater to smaller
clients, economists say.
</P>
<P>
Economists have also called for better methods by rural
cooperatives for reducing financial risks and maintaining
stability in the rural areas.

<HEADLINE> Indoor Pollution More Harmful to Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Pollution inside the home is
becoming more serious than outdoor pollution as the Chinese use
more electric appliances and cook more with heated oil, according
to recent warnings in several Chinese newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Also, new interior decorations made of sub-standard materials,
and possible ill effects from computers and copying machines,
along with smoke from heated cooking oil or burning coal are
posing greater threats to human health than outdoor pollution in
China, they said.
</P>
<P>
People spend almost 85 percent of their time indoors, said the
China Women's News.
</P>
<P>
However, the level of air quality in many Beijing households is
far below national standards due to excessive suspended particles,
chemicals from decorative materials and smoking, which often lead
to headache, feeling oppressed, and allergic reactions, Dai Zizhu
of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine was quoted as saying
in today's China Youth Daily.
</P>
<P>
Harmful chemicals released from sub-standard building materials
and paints have made many modern office buildings which are
springing up all over Chinese cities "silent killers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Environmental problems fail to be treated in many of the
offices of some 5,700 hi-tech firms and 17,000 joint ventures in
Beijing, said Gao Xing, director of a Beijing center for testing
and identifying the toxicity of chemical materials.
</P>
<P>
Examinations conducted by the center revealed that the
pollution level of formaldehyde was astonishingly higher than
acceptable levels in many places, whether bedrooms or ministry
offices.
</P>
<P>
Staff members at a bank in urban Beijing began to complain
about being slow in reacting and poor memory about one month after
their offices were decorated, Gao said, explaining that this
syndrome might be caused by damage to the cranial nerve system
from toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Research in the south China city of Guangzhou and in Shenyang
in the north found that the risk of contracting lung cancer was
increased after people were exposed over a long period of time to
smoke released from heated cooking oil or burning coal.
</P>
<P>
Experts have called for stricter inspections and management of
chemical products, especially pesticide, paint, and building
materials.
</P>
<P>
The report in China Women's News advised people to ventilate
rooms or get air-purification devices.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Reaches Agreement With Comcast on Acquisition of Cable Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- AT&AMP;T Corp. reached an agreement
with Comcast Corp. Tuesday night that will allow it to acquire
MediaOne Group Inc. and avert a bidding war.
</P>
<P>
The agreement came only one day after MediaOne, a cable
company, announced that it broke a merger deal with Comcast and
planned to accept an offer to be acquired by AT&AMP;T. MediaOne's
decision sparked a bidding war between AT&AMP;T and Comcast and a
number of big companies such as Microsoft Corp., American Online
and MCI WorldCom that teamed up with Comcast to counter AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
Comcast made a deal to acquire MediaOne for 48 billion U.S.
dollars in March. About one month later, AT&AMP;T offered 55.8 billion
dollars to acquire MediaOne in a bid to thwart the Comcast-
MediaOne deal.
</P>
<P>
AT&AMP;T's agreement with Comcast will allow it to complete its
acquisition of MediaOne and MediaOne welcomed the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Comcast is the third-largest cable company in the United
States. Under the agreement, it will offer services under the AT&AMP;T
name in all of its markets and AT&AMP;T will exchange various cable
systems with Comcast in swaps that could result in an additional 2
million subscribers for Comcast and up to 9.2 billion dollars for
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
Coming on the heels of AT&AMP;T's 56 billion dollars purchase of
cable giant Tele-Communications Inc, the acquisition of MediaOne
would transform AT&AMP;T into the largest phone and cable company in
the United States. Five years from now, AT&AMP;T would like to be
selling consumers in-home movies, cable television, wireless phone
calls and Internet service, the Wall Street Journal said.

<HEADLINE> Three African Leaders Discuss Congo (K) Crisis  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Uganda, Rwanda
and Tanzania Tuesday met in central Tanzania's Dodoma town to
discuss the political situation in the Great Lakes Region,
particularly in the crisis of the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu and their host Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa held
the discussions at the Chamwind State Lodge, sources from Dodoma
said.
</P>
<P>
The talks were also attended by Rwandan Vice-President and
Minister for Defense, Major General Paul Kagame.
</P>
<P>
However, no details were given on their talks, which have been
arranged as a continuation of the efforts to pursue peace in the
DRC, where rebels have been fighting to topple the government of
President Laurent Kabila since August 2 last year.
</P>
<P>
The war has drawn in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad
fighting for the government side, and Uganda and Rwanda in support
of rebels who have controlled more than 50 percent of the
Congolese territory.
</P>
<P>
On April 23, Zambian President Frederick Chiluba paid a short
visit to Tanzania and held consultations with President Mkapa on
the Congo (K) crisis#,in a move to accelerate the peace process in
the vast central African country.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, the peace facilitator nominated by the Southern
African Development Community (SADC), told reporters in Tanzania
that the regional summit held during April 17-18 on the DRC
situation in Libya was "in the right direction" and marked another
step forward to stop hostilities in the third largest African
country.
</P>
<P>
At the Libya summit, Uganda, a key player in the nine-month
war, signed a cease-fire deal with the DRC government.
</P>
<P>
The deal has been rejected by Rwanda, which has immense
military influence on the rebels in DRC. Uganda also played down
the significance of the deal after Rwanda expressed displeasure.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chad announced on April 30 that it would pull troops
out of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, Chiluba flew to Kigali, Rwanda as part of efforts
to harmonize contradicting positions of stake-holders in the
nine-month war.

<HEADLINE> Peace, National Security Top Angolan Foreign Policy: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Minister of Foreign Affairs
and Co-operation Joao Miranda said here Tuesday that the main
objective of the country's foreign policy is to fight for,
safeguard and promote peace and national security, which is
indispensible to the development of Angola and the happiness of
its people.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks to reporters while explaining the country's
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Miranda said that a scientific concept of security should be
based on such fact that once a neighbor is invaded and its peace
and stability threatened, the national security of Angola is
directly affected.
</P>
<P>
He then came to the conclusion that Angola's peace and security
will be closely connected with peace and security in central and
southern Africa, which is why Angola is committed to be under the
framework of the collective security mechanism of the Southern
African Development Community and the Organization of African
Unity, and why it works hard to promote peace and security in the
region.
</P>
<P>
After recalling the country's foreign policy since independence
which has brought Angola to successfully join the United Nations,
the foreign minister noted that the future foreign policy of
Angola still gives priority to its relations with African
countries.
</P>
<P>
Other objectives, he said, is to "promote human rights,
democracy and the rule of law."

<HEADLINE> Rawlings Calls on Moslems to Help Kosovo Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He said some nations have come out with aid packages for the
refugees, who are Moslems, but nothing has been heard from
Moslems either in condemnation of the bombings or assistance to
the refugees, the Ghana News Agency (GNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said this when Dr Mohammed Ahmed Sherif,
Secretary-General of the World Islamic Call Society, called on
him at the Castle, Osu, in Ghana, the GNA said.
</P>
<P>
Sherif, who arrived in Ghana last weekend, commissioned a
multi-purpose education center on Monday. The centre has computer,
vocational and medical wings and was built by the Society, which
is a Libya-based non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
 "The silence over what is happening in Yugoslavia is
disturbing some of us. Yugoslavia was given "a shock treatment"
in 1995 during the war in Bosnia but now it is not being given a
breathing space.
</P>
<P>
 "Why is the voice of the Moslem world not being heard?" he
asked.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings said if Moslem nations would not condemn the bombings
in Yugoslavia, then they should offer to take in some of the
refugees as some western nations are doing.
</P>
<P>
 "The refugees are human. You do not have to be a Moslem
before you do your duty. The silence of the world is not right."
</P>
<P>
 He spoke about efforts being made to end the crisis through
diplomatic channel; saying, "let us pray a solution is found. Let
us create room for dialogue."

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian Airlines Resumes Flight to N. Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Airlines announced
Tuesday that it has resumed flight to northern Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Airlines suspended its flight to northern
Ethiopia after the Ethio-Eritrean border conflict broke out in May
last year.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian News Agency quoted an airlines official as saying
that "it had temporarily suspended its flight to the region as a
precaution due to developments around northern Ethiopia."
</P>
<P>
Although both Ethiopia and Eritrea have expressed their
acceptance of the framework agreement put forward by the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), the two sides haven't so far
reached cease fire.
</P>
<P>
In his monthly news briefing here Monday, Ibrahim Dagash, OAU
spokesman, called on both Ethiopia and Eritrea to immediately end
their border fighting and to start implementing the 11-point OAU
framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, OAU Current Chairman and President of Burkina Faso
Blaise Compaore will visit the Horn of Africa this week to meet
leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea for an immediate end to the
fighting between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Arid Chinese Province Making Full Use Of Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 5 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.43 million cisterns have
been built on the Loess Plateau in northwestern China to store
badly needed rainwater for drinking and irrigation purposes.
</P>
<P>
In Gansu, there has been no rain for the past 200 days, but the
1.3 million farmers in mountainous parts of the province have had
no difficulties in getting drinking water or water for their
fields thanks to the cisterns.
</P>
<P>
On average, each household has dug two cisterns, which provide
enough water for daily use and irrigation and have proven to be an
effective way to deal with the drought for people living below the
poverty line (meaning no more than 250 kg of grain annually),
according to Yun Xiaosu, vice-governor of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
So long as we raise the utilization rate of rainfall from the
current one-thousandth to one percent, there can be good economic
results, the vice-governor says.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with more details Two Pilots Killed in Apache Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Two U.S. Army pilots were killed when
an Apache helicopter crashed over Albanian during a training
mission early Wednesday, an Albanian radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted a U.S. Army spokesman as saying that the
helicopter crashed some 75 kilometers northeast of the Rinas
Airport where Apache helicopters are based.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman ruled out the possibility of the helicopter being
attacked by Serb forces in Kosovo, saying that it went down
because of "technical problem."
</P>
<P>
The first Apache crash occurred at 10:20 p.m. local time (0820
GMT) on April 26 during a night training mission.
</P>
<P>
One Apache helicopter was left behind at an Italian air base
because of engine problem on April 21.
</P>
<P>
The United States has moved 23 tank-killer Apaches, each worth
16 million dollars, to Albania.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, NATO Supreme Commander Wesley Clark said during his
routine visit to NATO troops in the Rinas Airport that the Apaches
were well prepared and sharpening their skills for their mission
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But he again declined to go into operational specifics as to
when the Apaches, 21 now in number, will be put into use.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will build 230 mini-hospitals
in the next five years to deal with emergencies and improve
community health education, State Minister for Health Philip
Byaruhanga has said
</P>
<P>
Launching a sanitation report here Tuesday, Byaruhanga said

According to the report, each constituency in Uganda will have
a mini- hospital where emergency surgical operations can be done,
guaranteeing that everybody has access to health services.

SHENYANG, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's state-owned enterprises
have begun to choose their own managers from applicants from all
over after years of decision making by higher authorities under
the planned economy.
</P>
<P>
Twenty large and medium-sized state-owned enterprises in the
city of Dalian last month chose their own people to fill vacancies
like the deputy general manager and assistants to the general
manager in charge of financial affairs, foreign trade and economic
cooperation, and technological management.
</P>
<P>
In Fujian Province, an advertisement was put in the People's
Daily to fill 36 vacancies in 22 companies, 17 of which were state-
owned, where 2 general managers, 18 deputy general managers, and
senior economic managers and senior accountants were needed.
</P>
<P>
Wu Bin, of the Liaoning Academy of Social Sciences, says that
these enterprises have always been a crucial part of China's
economy and China's economy now demands stricter requirements and
qualified managers.
</P>
<P>
Dalian's vice-mayor in charge of industrial economy, Wang
Chenmin, says that the managers will have a great impact on
enterprise development and the new selection process is expected
to provide qualified people the opportunity to show their
potential and to be better suited to the requirements of the
market economy.

<HEADLINE> Campaign in Qatar to Discourage Youth Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A retailer awareness campaign
aimed at discouraging youth smoking has been launched in Qatar,
local Khaleej Times reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The campaign has been designed to enlist the support of
tobacco product retailers in an effort to ban the sale of
cigarettes to those under 18 years of age," said the newspaper,
quoting Charles Hay, general manager of the Middle East Tobacco
Association (META), which initiated the campaign.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai-based organization, which represents major cigarette
manufacturers operating in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
states, is hopeful that the vast majority of the estimated 1,500
tobacco retailers in Qatar will choose to paticipate in the
program started on May 2.
</P>
<P>
According to Hay, the campaign is being supported by several
major cigarette manufacturers of the world.
</P>
<P>
"This program represents an effort by the tobacco companies
and their distributors to help retailers do their part in
discouraging youth smoking," he said.
</P>
<P>
Retailers will be given promotional material, including
leaflets explaining the program in English, Arabic and Malayalam,
lapel badges for retailer sales staff and specialized materials
for large-scale outlets like supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
Hay said Qatar is the fourth GCC country to launch this
program, after Oman, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The GCC states, which include Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman,
Qatar, Bahrain and the UAE, have taken a pledge to increase the
customs tariffs on cigarette and tobacco imports to 100 percent by
the year 2000 from the present 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The six states import nearly 30 billion cigarettes a year,
worth over 800 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> 2 Lebanese Civilians Wounded in Israeli Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Lebanese civilians were wounded
Tuesday night in Israeli air raids on the country's eastern city
of Baalbek, the Voice of the People radio reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes unleashed two missiles, hitting a small
building adjacent to the Imam Ali Mosque in the center of
Baalbek, a city near the Syrian border, wounding two Lebanese
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese security sources said that the building was used by
the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, as a communication
center.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army source also said that Israeli warplanes hit a
Hezbollah command post in Baalbek.
</P>
<P>
But, Hezbollah said in a statement that the compound was a
cultural center run by the mosque.
</P>
<P>
The blast came apparently in retaliation for earlier separate
Hezbollah bomb ambushes against Israeli forces and its ally South
Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
An Israeli soldier and an SLA officer were killed, four Israeli
soldiers and two SLA members wounded in the past two days during
the Hezbollah attacks in the Israeli occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The lastest casualties raised to nine the number of Israeli
soldiers killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year. A
total of 27 others were wounded over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israeli forces and its ally
SLA out of the country.

first accident of such nature happening in the army since
Zimbabwe's independence in 1980.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was normal that live mines were used in the
practical lessons since the students would have been exposed to
inept mines during their theoretical lessons. But only
instructors are allowed to conduct the demonstrations.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholars Criticize NATO Bombing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The reason the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has given for bombing Yugoslavia cannot hold
ground in view of the international law and international
relations and it will have an extremely negative impact on the
regional situation and world peace.
</P>
<P>
This is a view shared by numerous Chinese international law and
international relations experts in an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Noted Professor Liu Wenzong, who has been studying
international law for many years, said that the question of
whether human rights or sovereignty is supreme characterizes the
differences between the sides involved in the fight in Kosovo and
points to the fact that human rights were not within the category
of international law before World War II and that the United
Nations (U.N.), which was founded after the war, brought up the
human rights issue to a new height.
</P>
<P>
But, the U.N. Charter says nothing about allowing the wanton
and indiscriminate use of force against any country under the
pretext of human rights, he added, and the U.S.-led NATO bombing
itself is an infringement of international laws.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, Japan was tried for its war crimes at the
end of World War II, and NATO could face the same charges for its
acts in Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Experiences Calmest Night in 43 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Most Yugoslavians spent the calmest
night overnight since March 24 as NATO air raids entered the 43rd
day Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the official Tanjug news agency, NATO planes
bombed Uzice, a city 200 kilometers southwest of Belgrade, in the
only air raid overnight.
</P>
<P>
After air raid sirens sounded at 21:30 local time (1930 GMT)
Tuesday night in Belgrade, residents heard neither explosions of
NATO bombs nor the sound of anti-aircraft gunfire which had
occurred almost daily for over a month.
</P>
<P>
The all-clear was sounded at 06:15 (0415 GMT) Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
During the daytime Tuesday, industrial facilities and
residential areas in Pristina, Vranje and Kraljevo were targeted
by NATO planes, Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, in his meeting with top
military and police officials Tuesday, praised the country's army
and security forces for their "exceptional performance" in
protecting the motherland, countering enemy attacks and
safeguarding social stability, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
As night fell Tuesday, hundreds of Belgraders gathered on the
three bridges across the Sava and Danube rivers, which also link
the new and old parts of the capital, to continue their nightly
concerts in protest and defiance of, and as human shields against,
NATO bombings.

<HEADLINE> Thai-Cambodian Border Pass to Be Reopened </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A pass along the Thai-Cambodian
border will be reopened next week to facilitate cross-border trade
between the two countries, the Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Thai and Cambodian officials have held meetings in the
northeastern Thai province of Ubon Ratchathani to discuss security
and trade along the border.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian side requested reopening of the so-called An Ma
Pass for trade, which had been shut down due to the recent
conflict in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodian officials said Phnom Penh had already approved the
reopening of the border pass and wanted Bangkok to do the same as
border trade would help ease the food shortage in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia insisted that the civil war in the country had ended
and the country would strictly abide by its agreements with
Thailand to prevent and suppress the smuggling of war weapons and
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side was concerned about the smuggling of weapons,
illegal goods, stolen cars and drugs and urged Cambodian officials
to provide information about these illegal activities to ensure
security along the border.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to reopen the pass unofficially, with a
Thai market and a Cambodian market for trade located at either end
of the border pass.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Company Opens Furniture Factory in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A Malaysia-based company, the
Teakteam Ltd., opened a furniture factory Tuesday at the
Hlinetharya Industrial Zone in the northwest of Yangon, the
capital of Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
It is the second factory established by a foreign company to
produce value-added teak products in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian company injected 500,000 U.S. dollars for the
factory which will produce garden, office and household furniture
as well as other wooden goods such as flooring, official newspaper
The New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The annual output will be 200 tons to more than 900 tons, of
which 90 percent will be for export and the remaining will be for
domestic market, it said.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Malaysia-based Scansia Myanmar Ltd. set up the first
value-added teak factory in the Shwepyithar Industrial Zone, also
in the capital.
</P>
<P>
To promote the industrial sector, the Department of Human
Settlement and Housing Development of the Myanmar Ministry of
Construction has been granting land leases in the country's
industrial zones for local and foreign entrepreneurs to establish
value-added teak industry.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is rich in forest resources and the country's teak is
famous in the world market. Due to lack of modern technology for
maximum production and quality, the country is yet unable to
export it as a finished product, the report added.

<HEADLINE> Diarrhea Breaks Out in Southern Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 162 people have died of diarrhea
in southern Bangladesh so far since the water-borne disease broken
out in an epidemic form in the region a few months ago, press
reports here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 100 persons have died of diarrhea in the six districts
under the Barisal division in recent months and more than 17,000
people have been affected.
</P>
<P>
At least 500 people in the region are being struck down by the
disease every day, according to official estimates.
</P>
<P>
The situation there worsens with the fall in the production of
oral re-hydration saline, at the only government center there, by
two-thirds of its previous production capacity due to
load-shedding and lack of proper manpower. The center is now
producing about 9,000 packets of saline per day against the normal
production of 28,000 packets.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates show that the demand for the saline packet
in the region is 1.28 million packets while the stock is only
20,000.
</P>
<P>
A total of 395 medical teams are working in the southern
region, but there is no doctor in 193 teams, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
In Noakhali and Lakshmipur districts, under the southeastern
Chittagong division, the disease has also broken out, killing 62
people and affecting 5,000 others in the past one month.
</P>
<P>
Doctors said consumption of unwholesome food and contaminated
water is the main reason behind the outbreak of the disease.

KUALA LUMPUR, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government has
allocated 21.6 million ringgit (5.68 million U.S. dollars) this
year for water supply and environmental health projects in rural
areas, Deputy Health Minister Wira Mohd Ali Rustam said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said in the parliament that among the environmental health
projects are providing decent toilets and facilities for orderly
disposal of waste water and solid waste.
</P>
<P>
The projects are to ensure that every house in rural areas
would have basic amenities to ensure personal hygiene and
environmental cleanliness, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, about 90 percent of houses in rural areas
had clean water supply and 97 percent proper toilet facilities, he
said, adding that all houses are expected to have such facilities
by the end of next year.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Vector Control Held in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 5 (Xinhua) - An inter-country consultative meeting
is being held here to seek alternative approaches for vector
control in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting, which began Tuesday, sponsored by the
Myanmar Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization, is
attended by representatives of Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia,
India, Indonesia, the Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Singapore and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will improve the malaria-control approaches in
Southeast Asia while an initiative to roll back malaria is in the
preparatory phase in the region, Dr. Mya Oo, Myanmar deputy
minister of health, was quoted by Wednesday's The New Light of
Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
At the opening session of the meeting, Mya Oo said there were
about 60,000 malaria cases in Myanmar with 3,424 deaths in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is reportedly re-emerging again because of uncontrolled
population migration, changing climate conditions and behavior
changes and insecticide resistance of the vector. Limitation of
resources is also said to be another problem facing the countries
in the region.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 1.2 billion out of the 1.4 billion people
in Southeast Asia live in malarious areas. Of the 10 countries in
the region, only the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the
Maldives are reportedly free from indigenous cases of malaria.
</P>
<P>
Although 3.4 million malaria cases were reported from Southeast
 Asian countries in 1995, the actual number was estimated to be
six times higher, the deputy minister added.

<HEADLINE> Success In Protecting China's Terracotta Warriors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and German scientists have
developed a way to prevent the outer color of the terracotta
warriors in the tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang from being eroded.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 8,000 warriors and horses from the tomb of the
first man to unify China have lost their color. A study has shown
that the lacquer on the terracotta warriors is highly sensitive to
temperature changes and the warriors suffered further from drying
out when they were excavated from the damp earth, causing the
coating to shrink.
</P>
<P>
Over 20 different reinforcing agents that resisted shrinkage
have been tried and scientists have come up with a mixture of
polyurethane and polyethylene glycol that protects lacquer and
delays the drying and the technique will be used on all terracotta
warriors unearthed in future.
</P>
<P>
The find has been referred to as the 8th wonder of the world.
Thirty-four million people have visited the site since it opened
in 1979. It has been put on the UN's World Heritage list.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Leader Urges Ban on Illegal Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
Wednesday called on government departments to continue their
efforts
to ban the illegal ownership of weapons and described such a ban
as
one of the factors for maintaining social stability in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony to destroy some 4,000 illegal weapons
including B-40 rockets and hand grenades here, Hun Sen said, "It
is
crucial to control and destroy illegal weapons. It has great
influence on the socio-economic development and the enhancing of
social morality and the respect of the human rights."
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Hun Sen also handed over to Commander-in-Chief
Ke
Kim Yan a gold-plated pistol given to him by an Indonesian
official,
adding a personal touch to a new Council of Ministers sub-decree
banning private ownership of guns. But it was said that the gold
pistol will not be destroyed, but instead will be donated to a
Ministry of Defense museum.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also drove one of the 10 caterpillar tractors running
over
the firearms to break them. The metal will be melted down to make
a
statue representing peace and security, according to Chea Sophara,

Phnom Penh's first deputy governor.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the destruction is to show to the
international community the Cambodian government's determination
to
control illegal weapons and maintain social security.
</P>
<P>
The weapons were collected or confiscated in a month-long
security
crackdown, which saw a nationwide gun ownership ban and police
checkpoints to search vehicles for weapons.
</P>
<P>
However, the destroyed weapons were only a fraction of the
weapons
that still remain in Cambodia. The public destruction Wednesday is

only the beginning of a long process required to deal with the
weapons problem, the Working Group for Weapons Reduction in
Cambodia
said.

<HEADLINE> Transnational Company to Speed up Net Backbone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- A transnational
telecommunications company Tuesday disclosed plans to unveil new
networking technology that can potentially deliver speeds and
capacity 640 times better than current technology for fiber-optic
networks.
</P>
<P>
The technology, an optical amplification system, combines 160
separate channels of light into one beam, with each channel
carrying data at a rate of 10 gigabits per second for a total per
fiber capacity of 1.6 trillion bits per second, said the Ontario-
based Nortel Networks in a news release.
</P>
<P>
With this fiber capacity and speed, Nortel said, the entire
four-million book collection of the U.S. Library of Congress can
be transported to Los Angeles in just seconds through one single
strand of fiber. It can also support -- on a single fiber --
simultaneously Internet connections to 28 million households.
</P>
<P>
The technology is not due to ship commercially until next year.
Essentially, Nortel and its U.S. competitors hope to extend the
capabilities of a technology called dense-wavelength division
multiplexing (DWDM) to handle more data, video and voice-rich
services at high speeds.
</P>
<P>
The technology uses multiple lasers and transmits multiple
light signals simultaneously over a single optical fiber. Each
signal travels within its unique color band, which is modulated by
the data (text, voice, video, etc.). DWDM enables the existing
fiber infrastructure of the telephone companies and other carriers
to be dramatically increased.
</P>
<P>
Nortel, whose optical networking equipment carries 75 percent
of North America's backbone Internet traffic, said the new
technology would help create a better Internet -- an "optical
Internet."

nearly 100,000 people including diplomats and representatives of
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
At the ceremony, Hun Sen also handed over to Commander-in-Chief
Gen. Ke Kim Yan a gold-plated pistol which had been given to him
by an Indonesian official.
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of the destruction is to show to the
international community the Cambodian government's determination
to control illegal weapons and maintain social security.
</P>
<P>
The weapons were confiscated in the latest security crackdown,
which saw a nationwide gun ownership ban and police checkpoints to
search vehicles for weapons.

<P>
YANGON, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A working group of six nations in the
Mekong region is meeting here to discuss matters concerning
tourism in the Mekong region.
</P>
<P>
The two-day 9th meeting of the working group, which began
Tuesday, is attended by representatives of the six nations in the
region -- China, Cambodia, Laos, host Myanmar, Thailand and
Vietnam -- and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the Agency for
Coordinating Mekong Tourism Action.
</P>
<P>
Programs for making the Mekong region known to the world as a
tourism center are major topics of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar Deputy Minister of Hotels and Tourism Brigadier-General
Aye Myint Kyu addressed the opening session of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, economic ministers of the six nations met
for the eighth time at the ADB Headquarters in Manila, the
Philippines, and discussed enhancement of cooperation in regional
development programs including those on tourism and reviewed major
changes in the programs. They also approved agreements reached at
workshops, drafted programs for the period between 1998 and 2000
and approved points coordinated at the senior officials meetings.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the ADB, which plays a vital role in promoting
regional economic cooperation including tourism cooperation,
proposed such cooperation among the six nations in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The first planeload of refugees from
Kosovo arrived in CFB Trenton, Canada, on Tuesday, leading the
evacuation of Yugoslav refugees to non-European countries.
</P>
<P>
The 248 Kosovars were the first of the 5,000 ethnic Albanian
refugees expected to arrive in Canada over the next three weeks,
the CTV news reported.
</P>
<P>
Canada had originally planned to receive the Kosovars three
weeks ago, but the United Nations opted to keep them nearer to
their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The refugees are being moved to ease overcrowding at camps in
Macedonia, which have taken in 204,070 Kosovo refugees. Albania
has nearly 400,000.
</P>
<P>
The admission of 5,000 refugees to Canada is expected to cost
100 million Canadian dollars (69 million U.S. dollars), which will
cover their needs for at least the first six months, said Canadian
Immigration Minister Lucienne Robillard.

<HEADLINE> Thai Hotels Score in Top Value Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai hotels, cities and resorts
scored top marks in a survey of "The World's Best Value" holiday
spots published by Travel and Leisure Magazine in March, the
Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) said in a press release
available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok was rated the seventh-best value for money city in the
world, and Phuket, the famous island resort in southern Thailand,
the fourth-best value for money resort.
</P>
<P>
Thai hotels scored particularly well in the survey. The
Oriental was ranked the top value hotel in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Oriental and three other luxury hotels in Thailand, namely
the Shangri-La, the Regent of Bangkok, and the Royal Orchid
Sheraton, took four of the five top spots in the category of best
value Asian hotels.
</P>
<P>
"This is a clear reflection of the tremendous value for money
that Thailand is enjoying globally," TAT Deputy Governor Juthamas
Siriwan said.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that in spite of the floatation of the baht and
pricing pressure they faced, our top hotels have done nothing that
would in any way reduce the quality of the visitor experience,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
In a preamble to the survey results, Travel and Leisure
Magazine editors said they had asked readers to rate their
favorite hotels, resorts, cities and islands around the world
according to value.
</P>
<P>
The results were compiled from the average scores and for
hotels, the cost of a basic double room.

<HEADLINE> First Batch of Kosovo Refugees Arrive in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The first group of 41 Kosovo
refugees, including 14 children, from Macedonian refugee camps
arrived here Tuesday afternoon by air and will be settled in a
sanitarium in Buzau County, about 100 kilometers northeast of the
Romanian capital of Bucharest, an international refugee official
said.
</P>
<P>
Mihai Clondir, an official from the International Organization
for Migration, said the group originally included 60 refugees, but
19 of them refused to board the plane for Romania and pleaded to
be transferred to Canada or the United States.
</P>
<P>
Those who chose to go to the neighboring country of Romania,
wish to return home as soon as possible once the war has ended.
</P>
<P>
In response to requests from Macedonia, the Romanian government
decided on March 26 to take 3,000 to 4,000 Kosovo refugees from
Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian foreign minister later said the country could take
a maximum of 6,000 refugees but wished to receive financial help
from the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian Rompres news agency reported that Romania has
worked out concrete plans with relevant international
organizations to accept 3,000 refugees by June.
</P>
<P>
Since the North Atlantic Treaty Organization launched its air
campaign against Yugoslavia more than a month ago, Romania has
received about 200 refugees.
</P>
<P>
Romanian officials, however, claim the actual figure is higher
since the country has more than 30,000 Serbian residents. Many
Yugoslav refugees have settled in the homes of relatives and
friends in Romania instead of applying for refugee status through
official agencies.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Structural Adjustment in Chad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Tuesday a
credit of 30 million U.S. dollars for Chad to support the
government's structural adjustment program.
</P>
<P>
The project will continue to support the government's efforts
in improving its revenues which are still critically low,
preparing a civil service reform program, as well as directing
public expenditures towards priority sectors such as basic health
and education services, and demobilization and reintegration
programs, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
These measures are expected to directly impact Chad's growth
performance, contribute to poverty alleviation, increase public
services in social sectors, and establish a more favorable
environment for private sector growth.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the government of Chad has been implementing a
structural adjustment program that focuses on strengthening the
capacity of the state to fulfill its essential functions. The
program aims to restore critical public sector capacity, reorient
expenditures towards priority development sectors, and facilitate
the operation of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
With an average per capita gross domestic product of 240
dollars, Chad is one of the poorest nations in the world. An
estimated 80 percent of the population live under the absolute
poverty line.
</P>
<P>
The country's history of political instability has severely
hampered its economic development. However, since 1995, Chad's
macroeconomic performance has been impressive under the adjustment
program, with the average annual real growth from 1996 to 1998
recording about 5 percent, well over population growth.
</P>
<P>
The credit will be provided by the International Development
Association, a member of the World Bank, and will be payable in 40
years, including a 10-year grace period.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Tuesday a
credit of 14.3 million U.S. dollars to Ghana to fund the first
phase of a comprehensive public sector management reform project.
</P>
<P>
The project will improve the efficiency, effectiveness and
quality of public services in Ghana through institutional
development, capacity building, and complex organizational and
structural changes, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the program will concentrate on initial
reforms which will establish the framework for the overall program.
</P>
<P>
It will focus on restructuring and reforming implementing
agencies set up by the government to provide wide-ranging discrete
public services, public sector agencies at the central government
level, and the overall systems and processes in the public sector.
</P>
<P>
This will assist the government in implementing its public
sector reform strategy, "Public Sector Re-intervention and
Modernization Strategy for Ghana: Transforming Vision into Reality.
"
</P>
<P>
The outcomes of the first phase will determine how the second
and third phase of the program is designed to deal with
stabilizing system implementation, introducing additional systems
which are important for effective public sector operations, and
integrating the different systems into a comprehensive management
system for the entire public sector, the World Bank said.
</P>

<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's star women's shuttler
Mia Audina is apparently not ready to compete in the Sudirman Cup
and World Championships in Copenhagen from May 10 to May 23, The
Jakarta Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with the newspaper, Mia said she was
still grieving the death of her mother last week. Mia's mother
Lanny Susilawati died from a stroke.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not ready for the Sudirman Cup. It's really difficult. I
just lost my mother. I'm still in mourning," Mia said.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old shuttler sparked controversy when she married
Surinamese Tylio Lobman in March, then shocked fans again by
saying her father abused her as a child.
</P>
<P>
The vice chairman of the Badminton Association of Indonesia (
PBSI) Agus Wirahadikusumah said the association could not force
Mia to join the squad, because of her psychological condition.
</P>
<P>
"Chairman Subagyo Hadisiswoyo said Mia's readiness was decided
by coaches' evaluations of her physical, mental and technical
condition, and also the results of two simulations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Mia had asked to go to the Netherlands to calm down.
</P>
<P>
Despite poor preparation and several injured players, Agus said
Indonesia's squad was ready to compete in both competitions.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing is we are ready to fight and I'm
ready to bring the team", said Agus, who is also the team manager.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Army Recruits Tamil Youths </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan army has begun
recruiting Tamil youths after a lapse of more than a decade in an
islandwide recruitment drive, military sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the army expect to recruit 10,000 personnel
including from minority Tamils in the drive which started on
Monday and will continue until May 21.
</P>
<P>
Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's population of 18.3
million. But they account for less than 5 percent of the personnel
of the three security forces and the regular police force.
</P>
<P>
The government forces have been fighting a 16-year war against
the Tamil separatist rebels in the north and east of the country
and all new recruits are usually sent to the front as their first
assignment.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Tamil youths are being recruited
from the cleared areas of the north and east for the last several
years.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Criticizes Use of Force in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- UNESCO's Director General
Frederico Mayor Zaragosa said here Tuesday the NATO decision to
resort to force against Yugoslavia without UN authorization
constitutes a precedent of incalculable consequences and
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
Things happening in Kosovo are "a step backwards in the work of
forging a culture of peace," Zaragosa said at a meeting here.
</P>
<P>
The criticism of the military campaign of NATO against
Yugoslavia dominated the discussions in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot recommend and fight for democracy on a national
scale to face the national problems and later accept an oligarchy
on an international scale to resolve transnational problems," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The director general lamented that the undeclared war in
Yugoslavia deviated from the principle that only through dialogue
and compromise can this sort of conflict be overcome, as proved by
the Northern Irish experience.

<HEADLINE> NATO not to Launch Ground Attacks on Yugoslavia: Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Monday that NATO will not launch ground attacks on
Yugoslavia out of concern about an inevitable escalation of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks in an interview with the
Komsomolskaya Pravda paper and the story will be published
Wednesday, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Primakov denounced NATO's bombardments against Yugoslavia,
which have entered day 42, as irritating, noting the real purpose
of it is to set up a NATO-centered mode in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said the West has been taking some steps to destroy the
current world structure, which was shaped after the end of World
War II and designed to avoid military conflict during the Cold War
period.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the financial crisis in Russia, which broke out in
the second half of last year, Primakov said that it is far from
over.
</P>
<P>
He held that the crisis is a long process that needs to be
healed through large-scale structural readjustments and revision
of a series of plans.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted the most difficult time has passed, saying
inflation has dropped instead of rising, some other macro economic
indicators show improvement and local economies increase
moderately.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister concluded that the government has made some
progress in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Regarding to the presidential election in 2000, Primakov
reiterated that he has no intention to run for it, but expressed
support to all political forces dedicated to maintaining national
stability, strengthening national power and supporting democracy
on the basis of developing market economy.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan, Colombian Presidents Sign Joint Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
and his visiting Colombian counterpart Andres Pastrana signed a
joint declaration in Venezuela's border state of Tachira on
Tuesday, pledging to strengthen bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents had previously been scheduled to meet on
March 11 but the Colombian side later scrapped the meeting in
protest of Chavez' statements on the "political status" of the
Colombian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
In the Tachira Declaration, Chavez reaffirmed his commitment to
contribute to the continuing peace process in Colombia, where the
government is engaging in peace talks with major guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela served on two occasions -- February 5 and 15 of this
year -- as the meeting place for the delegates of the Colombian
government and the National Liberation Army of Colombia (the
second largest rebel group), for peace talks.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting Tuesday, the two presidents also discussed the
promotion of bilateral trade, which in 1998 totaled 2.6 billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pastrana arrived Tuesday morning in San Antonio, 680 kilometers
northeast of Caracas, where he was welcomed by Chavez. The
Colombian president was accompanied by Foreign Minister Guillermo
Fernandez de Soto, Interior Minister Nestor Humberto Martinez and
Defense Minister Rodrigo Lloreda.

<HEADLINE> Favorable Tax Policies Not For All Foreign-backed Firms In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-backed firms in China that
fail to get adequate foreign capital will not qualify for
favorable tax policies, according to the State Administration of
Taxation (SAT).
</P>
<P>
SAT was quoted by Wednesday's Shanghai Securities News as
saying that the new regulation applies to firms with inadequate
registered capital by the deadline and those that do not qualify
will be treated just like domestic companies for tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
Companies without sufficient foreign funds will continue to
qualify for favorable tax policies as long as they do not
disqualify officially. Those with paid-in foreign capital
accounting for less than 25 percent of their total capital,
however, will not qualify for the favorable tax treatment even if
they have qualified as foreign-funded companies.
</P>
<P>
They can re-qualify for favorable treatment by adding the
appropriate amount of foreign funds.

<HEADLINE> Ferguson Signs New Man United Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- English Premier League soccer club
Manchester United has been given the perfect boost ahead of the
European Cup final, after manager Alex Ferguson agreed a new three-
year contract on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The contract will keep him at the club until June 2002.
</P>
<P>
The 57-year-old Scot has been at Old Trafford since 1986 and
has been the most successful English manager of the last decade,
leading the club to a string of honours.
</P>
<P>
The Champions League is the only major honour to have eluded
Ferguson and there had been speculation that if United won the
final later this month, he might decide to call it a day.
</P>
<P>
However, after weeks of negotiation he has confirmed a contract
that will make him the best paid manager in the country.
</P>
<P>
He will reportedly earn five million pounds over the three
years, which works out as 1.67 million pounds a year or 32,000
pounds a week.
</P>
<P>
Despite the success of his teams, Ferguson's earnings have
compared unfavourably with other Premier League managers like
George Graham and Ruud Gullit - as well as some of his own players.
</P>
<P>
He will also be given a lucrative testimonial season, with much
of the potential million-plus proceeds going to his favourite
charities.
</P>
<P>
"I am delighted that the matter has been settled and that I
have a contract that will take me to 60 years of age," Ferguson
said in a statement issued by the club's board.
</P>
<P>
"My hunger for success remains undiminished and I will be
striving to ensure that the next three years are as successful as
the last 13 have been."
</P>
<P>
United's chief executive Martin Edwards described the
announcement as "fantastic news" for the club and all its
supporters.
</P>
<P>
"At the end of the contract Alex will have been manager for
almost 16 years, a remarkable achievement in the modern game of
football," Edwards said.

MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- A majority of the foreign and local
creditors of Philippine Airlines (PAL) have pledged their support
for PAL's rehabilitation plan, the Journal newspaper said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The European Credit Agencies, one of the biggest secured
aircraft creditors of PAL and the consortium of local creditor
banks openly declared their acceptance of the rehabilitation plan,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Marubeni Corp. of Japan earlier gave its approval to the plan.
KBC Bank said it believes PAL can be rehabilitated on the basis of
the plan.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, the Philippine government confirmed that it
may have to step in and take on the job of looking for new
investors to prevent PAL from collapse, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The financially ravaged national carrier needs 200 million U.S.
dollars in fresh equity, it said.

reforms into the management of such firms and in the last few
years importing 11 most advanced process lines at a cost of 500
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Hebei Scientific and Technological Research Institute
for Electric Wire and Cable has been established with the
coordination of over 70 scientific institutions both at home and
abroad and involving more than 960 senior technicians.
</P>

Bolivian Defense Minister Fernando Keiffer said on Tuesday that
the U.S. troops were on a civic mission in Chaco, south-east of La

Anibal Michel, president of the National Union of Passive Military
Service of Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
Keiffer said the 30 U.S. soldiers that arrived in the country
Monday, are the forerunners of the 240 troops that will arrive
here in the next few days as part of the civic "New horizons"
program.
</P>
<P>
The 30 soldiers that arrived on a "Galaxy" aircraft with a
cargo of various large boxes of materials and trucks, and
according to Michel, toxic waste.

a lie. In addition, the whole arrangement to bring those troops is
legal."

The U.S. soldiers, according to the joint plan with the
Bolivian army, will repair bridges, construct schools, drill water
wells and install medical camps for local peasants.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks and
Sacramento Kings clinched the last two NBA playoff spots last
night, completing the 16-team field.
</P>
<P>
Now the only questions to be answered in the final two days of
the 50-game regular season tonight and Wednesday are who exactly
is playing who -- and where -- when the playoffs begin Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With their victories, the Knicks earned their 12th consecutive
trip to the playoffs and the Kings will make their first trip
since 1996. It is only their second playoff trip since the
franchise moved to Sacramento from Kansas City in 1985.
</P>
<P>
The eight teams in the East: Miami, Indiana, Orlando and
Atlanta are battling for the top four seeds; Detroit, Philadelphia,
Milwaukee and New York are jockeying for positions five to eight.
</P>
<P>
In the West: Utah, San Antonio and Portland all have a chance
to finish with the NBA's best record; Houston and Los Angeles are
on a seesaw with the four and five spots; and the sixth, seventh
and eighth spots are a tossup between Minnesota, Phoenix and
Sacramento.

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The New Jersey Nets have signed
free agent center Gheorghe Muresan for the remainder of the 1998-
99 season, it has been announced by John Nash, the Nets general
manager today.
</P>
<P>

that category," said Nash. "I don't anticipate a significant
contribution over the final two games this year, but this signing
will enable us to work with Gheorghe in the offseason and evaluate
his readiness for next season."
</P>
<P>
Muresan has sat out the entire 1997-98 campaign with a
stretched tendon in his right ankle. This past June, Muresan
underwent back surgery to relieve stress on compressed nerves and
has not played this season.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Likely to Sign Free Trade Accord With EU Late 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Mexico believes that the fifth
round of negotiations with the European Union (EU), due to begin
on May 17th in Brussels, could accelerate the signing of a free
trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
Mexico may sign a trade agreement with the EU late 1999 or
early 2000, officials of the Ministry of Commerce and Industrial
Promotion said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Mexico's second largest trading partner after the
United States, but its trade with Mexico has shrunk since Mexico
entered the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Mexico will enable the EU to be given the
same tariff benefits the United States and Canada enjoy under
NAFTA's terms, beginning in 2003.
</P>
<P>
Mexico currently levies a 10-percent tariff on European exports,
while the average for U.S. products is three percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Li Xiaoyan, a 19-year-old rural girl
in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, has been receiving 250 yuan
every three months from a kind-hearted man in Shenzhen to help
subsidize her college expenses since her parents died last year.
</P>
<P>
She is one of the beneficiaries of the Red Phoenix Project,
launched in 1996 by Shaanxi Provincial Women's Federation to
support female students with financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
They started the project with 315,000 yuan of funds raised by
an auction of embroidery work made by over 1,000 handicraft women
in Shaanxi during the Fourth World Women's Congress held in 1995.
</P>
<P>
With limited funds, the project can support only 10 poverty
stricken girl students each year, while the number of girls who
apply for help exceeds 150 annually. Consequently, it opened a
site on the Internet in October 1998, calling on all those with
love and care to offer a helping hand, which received a positive
response from both home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
"We've received E-mails from all part of China and a dozen of
countries including the United States, France and Russia. They
have already rendered financial assistance to 110 out of the 148
applicants we named on the site," said Ning Huanxia, a project
official.

<HEADLINE> Manila Says No to Higher Treasury Bill Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary Edgardo
Espiritu insisted that domestic interest rates can still drop and
vowed to resist efforts to raise the rates of the Treasury bill
(T-bill), the Journal newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed investor clamor for higher rates of the T-bill in
the coming weeks, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that the government can afford to
reject so-called "unreasonable bids" at the auction of the T-bill
because of its healthy cash position.
</P>
<P>
Securities traders earlier said still lower rates for the
six-month and one-year T-bills will result in a negative
investment yield as inflation was seen to drop only to 8.5 percent
for April from 8.7 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
They also argued that T-bill rates could in fact go higher, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said this will not be the case since inflation for
April was expected to range "lower" without indicating how low the
rate could get.

STOCKHOLM, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev said Tuesday that Russia would like to play a leading
role in organizing an international peacekeeping force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement in the Norwegian city of Stavanger, where
he was invited to attend a meeting of the Nordic Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
He added that the peace-keeping mission should not include
those countries which have been part of the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the peace mission must first be approved by
the United Nations, and then by Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said Nordic countries can play a very important role in
building the international peace-keeping force, citing their great
influence in Europe and their non-participation in NATO's bombing
on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe he was in fact inviting Denmark and
Norway to join the Kosovo peace mission.
</P>
<P>
Nordic defense ministers said they are ready to cooperate in
building such a force in Kosovo and attach great importance to
Russia's pivotal role in a peaceful solution to the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Economic Crisis Boosts Divorces in Bogor, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The divorce rate has leapt through
the roof since the onset of the economic crisis in July 1997 in
Bogor, about 60 kilometers south of the Indonesian capital, The
Indonesian Observer reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A local religious court in Bogor has revealed that it is
dealing with about 80 to 100 divorce cases every month, a
300-percent increase since the crisis commenced.
</P>
<P>
"It's a surprisingly high number, compared with previous years.
Before the crisis we dealt with about 20 to 30 divorce cases a
year," Secretary of the Bogor Religious Court Achmad Sudjai said.
</P>
<P>
He said the court is now processing 704 divorce cases, most of
which were filed this year.
</P>
<P>
"There are various factors that have brought about the
increased divorce rate in Bogor, including financial matters,
irresponsible husbands and the presence of 'third persons'.
Nevertheless, the financial factor has been the main cause," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Sudjai said most of the divorces are filed by women, many of
whom complain that their husbands can no longer support the family
financially.
</P>
<P>
"Of the 704 cases, about 10 percent involve families where the
bread-winner has been laid off. Having been sacked from their
jobs, many husbands are unemployed and can't support the family
financially," he said.
</P>
<P>
By ditching an impoverished husband, a woman hopes she will be
able to marry a wealthier man, who can support her children and
relatives.
</P>
<P>
"The really unique thing is that relatives and neighbors often
have no idea about it when a couple is getting divorced," he
added.

PRAGUE, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of the Czech
Republic decided to lower its interest rate on Tuesday from 7.2 to
6.9 percent for bi-weekly commercial loans. This is the bank's
second rate reduction for commercial loans since April 10.
</P>
<P>
Finance experts said the rate reduction will help boost the
growth of domestic demand. The bank is expected to further cut the
rate to 6.5 percent in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
For years, the Czech Republic has followed stringent monetary
policies which raised bank interest rates to 15 percent. Though
high banking rates helped control inflation, they also led to
tight credit for businesses and sagging production and exports.

BUENOS AIRES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Fossilized remains of a
prehistoric animal, which may have been a bear, were discovered
during the construction of the Unique Stadium of La Plata, the
Museum of Natural Science of La Plata said Tuesday.

</P>
<P>
Experts from the museum explained that the pre-historic animal
had lived in the region around 700,000 years ago, and went extinct
around 10,000 years ago, possibly because of a post-glacial
drought.
</P>
<P>
In December 1997, the skull and tibia of a giant glyptodont,
which went extinct over 6,000 years ago, were found in the region.
The animal is believed to be the predecessor of the armadillo.

<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The central government intends to
invest large amounts of money in the next three years to
facilitate the buildup of the educational infrastructure, today's
"China Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Vice Education Minister Wei Yu as saying that
the move aims to construct multilevel, multiform and
multifunctional long-distance education networks in a bid to
provide lifelong learning systems for citizens.
</P>
<P>
Building long-distance education systems has been listed as a
key projects by the Ministry of Education in its Action Plan on
the Revitalization of Education for the 21st Century, implemented
early this year.
</P>
<P>
These systems will help to speed up the reduction in the number
of illiterate people aged between 15 and 50. Most of the country's
145 million young and adult illiterates live in poor and remote
areas where education is hindered by a lack of schools and
teaching staff, Wei said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has taken giant strides in reducing the
number of illiterates in recent years. Teachers from developed
areas are regularly sent to remote areas to help local educational
departments and schools eliminate illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
In addition, long-distance education has a role to play in
reducing illiteracy, by such methods as education by
correspondence, television and computers.
</P>
<P>
With the help of local teachers who help them understand the
materials, some illiterates have mastered some farming skills by
means of long-distance education.
</P>
<P>
The departments of the Education Ministry will co-ordinate the
establishment of networks to supplement the national education
infrastructure, says the paper.

<P>
SOFIA, May 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria's National Assembly on
Tuesday ratified on voice vote an accord with NATO on the alliance
aircraft's transit passage through the country's air space.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 154 in favor and 83 against with one abstention,
approving an agreement concluded on April 28 between the
government and NATO on the alliance's access to the Bulgarian air
space during its operation in Yugoslavia, Bulgaria's neighbor on
the west.
</P>
<P>
MPs of the Socialist-dominated Democratic Left Parliamentary
Group (DLPG), who voted against the accord, walked out of the
debating chamber after the session, vowing they would boycott the
National Assembly sittings for a week to protest the ratification
of the accord.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the parliament defeated a motion of independent MP
Vesselin Bonchev proposing that the National Assembly has the
right to denounce, at any moment, any international agreement that
Bulgaria is a party to. The motion of independent MP Nansen Behar
for demanding war compensation by NATO was also voted down.
</P>
<P>
"Today will be remembered as one of the darkest days in
Bulgaria's history," DLPG MP Roumen Ovcharov said after the voting.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ivan Kostov defended the accord, saying "it will
make us stronger, it is justified morally and politically and is
aimed to preserving Bulgaria's national integrity."
</P>
<P>
"Euro-integration means sharing responsibility before the whole
world," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The accord specifies technical parameters of the transit
passage that NATO aircraft are allowed through Bulgaria's air
space and designate the no-fly zones, which include the nuclear
power plant at Kozlodoui and big cities.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The war waged by the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization against the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia over the Kosovo conflict has caused quite substantial
economic damage to neighboring countries, a U.N. Commission said
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary,
Romania, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia have lost
important markets and traditional suppliers in Yugoslavia, the
U.N. Economic Commission for Europe was quoted by U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Commission noted that transport links to and from the
Southeastern part of Europe have been severely damaged, as
navigation along the Danube has been paralyzed by the destruction
of bridges in Novi Sad and all traffic through Yugoslavia has been
brought to a halt, Eckhard told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
The negative consequences are especially severe for the trade
flows between Western Europe and the countries locked in the
Balkan region, the Commission added.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said the Commission called on NATO's European and other
members to provide Southeastern transition economies with
emergency support, especially for sustaining their balance of
payments.
</P>
<P>
The Commission underscored the need to consider how to approach
the issues of post-conflict reconstruction, the spokesman said.

consuming more and more green products, and boost the fresh flower
industry, as the province's varieties of plants and animals make
up more than 60 percent and 50 percent, respectively, of the
country's totals.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the global annual sales of pharmaceutical
plant products alone has reached 30 billion US dollars-worth, and
that of fresh flowers has been increasing at an average rate of
ten percent annually.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the province has implemented a comprehensive
biological development plan, selecting 18 key products, such as
foodstuffs, flowers and perfume, for faster development.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry and development of biological resources
cannot catch up with the tobacco industry in terms of output value
in a short period of time, but they will prove to have much vigor
in the long run. The tobacco industry is, after all, a "sunset
industry", a local official noted.

<HEADLINE> Hubei to Strengthen Cooperation with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 5 (Xinhua) -- The Hubei provincial government in
central China is formulating more preferential policies in a bid
to strengthen cooperation and exchanges with the European Union (
EU).
</P>
<P>
The EU-funded projects now total more than 200 in the province,
with contractual investment amounting to 722 million U.S. dollars,
according to a senior provincial official.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the EU became China's second largest trade partner,
replacing Japan.
</P>
<P>
To date, the EU has established a milk production and
processing center and an information center in the province.
</P>
<P>
The EU has also decided to invest 19 million dollars in
building a Sino-European exchange and training center in Wuhan,
the capital of the province, to strengthen cooperation between
European nations and Hubei.
</P>
<P>
France, one of the 15 EU member states, has already undertaken
48 projects in the province involving contractual investment of
270 million dollars. It has also opened a consulate general in
Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
The Dongfeng-Citroen Automobile Co. Ltd., the largest Sino-
French joint venture in China, now has an annual production
capacity of 150,000 Citroen cars. And sales of the car is expected
to reach 60,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, trade volume between the EU and Hubei stood at 400
million dollars, accounting for 12.7 percent of the province's
total import and export volume. That percentage rose to 14.4
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hubei in central China enjoys convenient transportation, with
the Beijing-Guangzhou and Beijing-Kowloon railways, the country's
two trunk railway lines, running through it. It ranked eighth in
the country in terms of its economic development, and its growth
rate has surpassed the national average over the past five years.

<HEADLINE> Furniture Exports Set to Grow 25 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 5 (Xinhua) -- China's Furniture exports are
expected to grow 25 percent this year, according to China Light
Industry News.
</P>
<P>
Fiercer competition from both home and abroad are forcing
Chinese furniture makers to seek more sales in foreign markets,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
China-made furniture will be mainly exported to the United
States, Japanese, European and Middle Eastern markets this year,
said Jia Qingwen, president of the China Furniture Association.
</P>
<P>
He said that 1999 is a turning point for China's furniture
industry as it will undergo major restructuring and significant
technological upgrading.
</P>
<P>
The industry established comprehensive sales outlets in 1998
and has enterprises dealing with imported furniture both wholesale
and retail.
</P>
<P>
Stimulating domestic demand is the focus of this year's
development and housing construction is still a key sector, Jia
said, adding that restoration of houses after last year's summer
floods will help to boost the furniture sector.
</P>
<P>
In addition, urban and rural residents are saving more these
days to purchase residences in the future and thus the potential
of the furniture market is great, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is to establish more joint ventures this year, especially
with European countries and the United States and eastern China
will become the major investment area.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Supports Agricultural Growth in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Tuesday a
credit of 101.8 million U.S. dollars to increase Vietnam's Mekong
Delta agricultural production, which accounts for 40 percent of
the country's agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The credit will provide assistance to the Delta area, often
called "Vietnam's rice bowl," in continuing to play a vital role
in supporting and sustaining Vietnam's economic growth and rural
poverty reduction, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The project will support the government's efforts to encourage
multiple cropping in order to maximize land usage and agricultural
production. This means that areas now limited to a single wet
season crop, or to two unstable crops, can have multiple cropping
as measures are taken to improve irrigation, drainage, flood
protection, and salinity control.
</P>
<P>
The project would also provide clean water to parts of the
rural population that do not have quality water supplies for
drinking and domestic uses.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank, the project will not only increase
production and alleviate rural poverty, but will also aim to
improve living conditions in the project area through integrated
water resources development, and will focus on facilitating
sustainable water resource development, management, and monitoring
in the Mekong Delta.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is 147.6 million dollars. The
credit will be provided by the International Development
Association, a member of the World Bank, and will be payable in 40
years, including a 10-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Backs Annan's Diplomacy on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
supports the efforts by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
facilitate a political solution to the Kosovo crisis, the
president of the 15-nation council, Denis Dangue Rewaka of Gabon,
said here on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
In a brief statement read to reporters, the president said that
members of the Security Council "expressed their continuing deep
concerns" on what is going on in Yugoslavia, which has been under
intensified bombardment by the U.S.-led NATO since March 24.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after Annan briefed the Security Council on
his recent visit to Germany and Russia last week, during which he
met with German and Russian leaders, but returned to New York
without concrete proposals.
</P>
<P>
Annan Tuesday began a flurry of diplomatic activities by
meeting with the Russian special envoy for Yugoslavia, Viktor
Chernomyrdin, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, the American civil
rights leader who has negotiated the release of three U.S.
soldiers, who were reportedly caught somewhere inside the
territory of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The diplomacy is being beefed up as the NATO air strikes, which
has entered the sixth week, created a large exodus of refugees and
growing civilian casualties and the calls for a quick diplomatic
solution are increasing.

<HEADLINE> European Markets End Marginally Lower as Dow Dips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON May 4 (Xinhua) - European markets closed marginally down
Tuesday relinquishing early sharp gains as Wall Street slipped
below the 11,000 level which it broke for the first time Monday.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 suffered a 130-point reversal of fortune that
took the benchmark index from a record high of 6663.8 to a closing
level of 6533.1 - 0.29 percent below where it had begun the
session.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking on Wall Street weighed on shares in the market,
along with concern that the Bank of England will keep UK interest
rates on hold later this week.
</P>
<P>
"The profit-taking in London was inevitable after the Dow
pushed so far yesterday," said, Robert Dickson, salesman at UK
Charterhouse.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these overseas investors are looking at sterling's
strength and think that a lot of these stocks look overvalued," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Germany's electronically traded Xetra Dax, after hovering below
the key resistance level of 5,500, erased its early gains to close
down 0.1 percent, at 5,377.40.
</P>
<P>
"We're seeing profit-taking now but a rise to 5,500 is still
possible, we'll have to keep an eye on New York," one trader said.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 eased 0.1 percent to 4,438.55 after
hitting an intraday life high of 4,438.94 earlier in the session
on the back of a record close on the session.

<P>
NEW YORK, May 4 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial average
moved lower Tuesday as investors took profits after a buying spree
that drove the blue chip stocks above 11,000 Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Dow closed down 128.58 at 10,886.11. The index rose 225.65
at the record closing high of 11,014.69 in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Dow index also dragged as a strong economic outlook in two
reports caused fears among investors that the Federal Reserve
could raise interest rates to cool off the economy. The Conference
Board reported that the composite index of the leading economic
indicators rose 0.1 percent in March while the Commerce Department
said the Housing market remains robust in the same period.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 22.63 at 1,332.00 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 50.46 to 2,485.12.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index was down 8.08 at 636.10 and the American Stock
Exchange index was down 0.97 at 785.70. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies was down 0.69 at 432.59.

Declining issues outnumbered advancers by an 8-to-7 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,383 up, 1,598 down and 583
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> World Economic Growth Expected to Pick up in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 4 (Xinhua) -- World Economic Growth is
expected to pick up modestly this year and continue to strengthen
into the next century, according to a group of well-known experts.
</P>
<P>
A gradual pick-up in world growth may be expected in 1999 to a
rate of about 2 percent for the year with some further
strengthening in 2000 and 2001, the United Nations Department of
Public Information quoted the experts as saying on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This represents a reversal of the decline recorded in 1998,
when world growth fell to a rate less than 1 3/4 percent, half its
earlier pace, the U.N. department said.
</P>
<P>
Continued strong growth is expected in North America,
especially the United States, where output is forecast to expand
by 3 1/2 percent, and some recovery is forecast for developing
countries where real gross domestic product per capita is expected
to rise in 1999 after falling 1/2 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Slower growth in Europe and a continuing decline in the
production performance of Japan are seen as reduing the average
rate of expansion in developed economies to only 1.8 percent in
1999, a light decline from the average recorded for 1998.
</P>
<P>
A recovery in both Europe and Japan in 2000 and 2001 should
strengthen these economies and help support faster world growth
forecast for the early years of the next century, DPI reported.
</P>
<P>
The experts said Russia may remain in recession in 1999 and
2000 and growth in Central and East European countries is forecast
to slow with a recession continuing in the Czech Republic and
Romania, and slower increases in Bulgaria and Poland.
</P>
<P>
The economists expected developing countries to experience a
strengthening recovery in 1999 and a further improvement in growth
in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
Economic activity in Latin America, however, is forecast to
decline in 1999, affected by recessions in Argentina, Brazil and
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
A moderate recovery to a pace of 3.3 percent is forecast for
this region in 2000.
</P>
<P>
DPI's report was released when the experts group has been
holding a three day session from Monday to Wednesday on the world
economic outlook at United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The main set of forecasts reviewed were prepared by an
international economic research network of more than 60
economists from all over the world led by Nobel Laureate
Lawrence Klein of the University of Pennsylvania.

WASHINGTON, May 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton, as
he was leaving here Tuesday for Europe, said he was willing to
explore every diplomatic avenue to end the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
Upon his departure for the two-day trip, Clinton said in the

possibility", but also repeated NATO's key demands to stop its
six-week bombardment of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"I reaffirmed what all the allies agree those requirements are,
including withdrawal of Serbian security forces from Kosovo and
the deployment of an international security force with NATO at its
core," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
"Only then will the refugees have the confidence to return,
which is after all what we are working for," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I reaffirmed our support for his efforts and our willingness
to seize every diplomatic possibility for Serbian authorities to
meet the requirements that NATO has articulated," Clinton said.
</P>

Clinton will go to NATO headquarters in Belgium Tuesday for an
update on the air campaign in Yugoslavia and then to Germany to

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 4 (Xinhua) -- More than half of Internet users
in the United States looking for news online turn to newspaper
sites, said the Newspaper Association of America (NAA) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Releasing preliminary results of an online usage survey, NAA
said that U.S. consumers continue to value what newspapers deliver
-- both in print and online, noting that 82 percent of the online
newspaper audience is reading the printed product with the same or
increased frequency.
</P>
<P>
The study conducted for NAA by Scarborough Research of New York
surveyed online users in the top 50 U.S. markets. It found that 51
percent of those who use an online service, the Internet or World
Wide Web to get world or national news said that they read or
looked at an online newspaper in the past six months. Among those
seeking local or community news online, 54 percent turn to online
newspapers, and 46 percent turn to online newspapers to get
information about events or things to do in their local
communities.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary findings from the study also indicate that 56
percent of all adults in the top 50 markets in the United States
used an online service in the past year and 54 percent did so
during the past six months, representing a projected 72.8 million
adults. Three-quarters have gone online for world, national or
local news and information. More than one-third of all online
users have read or looked at newspapers online during the past six
months.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the findings, NAA said that newspapers were among
the first media to see the potential of digital distribution and
they are maintaining their competitive position. Among current
online users, online newspapers are read or looked at as much as
all other online sources of news combined, including radio,
television, magazine and portal sites.
