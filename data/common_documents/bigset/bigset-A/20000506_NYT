LAW BARRING INSURERS' TIPS ON CAR SHOPS IS TOSSED OUT
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a decision that could affect all drivers in New
York state, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled this week that state
regulators could not prevent two insurance companies from
recommending specific auto repair shops to their policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, filed Friday in U.S. District Court, involves a
state law prohibiting insurance companies from providing lists of
repair shops unless customers specifically ask for a
recommendation. In his decision, issued Thursday, Judge Richard
Casey found that the law violated the companies' constitutional
right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Although Casey's decision was written to apply to the two
companies that had sued the state, Allstate and Geico, an industry
trade group said the decision would probably apply to all insurers
that write policies in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision should be interpreted broadly, not just for
Allstate and Geico,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist for
the Insurance Information Institute, the industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Hartwig said insurers' repair policies were basically the same.
He said the companies wanted to be able to recommend repair shops
that provided cheap and reliable service to minimize their costs.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer who represented the State Insurance Department in the
case said he had not had time to review the judge's ruling and
could not say whether the state would appeal, or whether the ruling
would affect other insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   The law prohibiting referrals, enacted in 1974, was intended to
protect consumers' ability to choose their own repair shop. It was
amended in 1983 to allow insurance companies to recommend auto
glass repair shops, although the change was not extended to general
repairs. The judge said the Insurance Department approved the 1983
amendment in expectation that it would result in lower claim costs
and premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The state law also prohibits insurance companies from requiring
policyholders to use certain shops. Geico and Allstate did not
challenge that part of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate writes the most auto insurance policies in New York
state, insuring 1.6 million cars, or 20 percent of the market,
according to the Insurance Department. Geico insures about 7
percent of the market, or 560,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict began in 1992, after state regulators threatened to
fine Allstate for posting a sign at offices informing customers:
``If you have no shop preference, your adjuster is prepared to
recommend several conveniently located repair shops.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said the sign, erected as part of a company program
to evaluate approved repair shops, violated the prohibition on
recommending shops to policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   But Casey found that policyholders were not denied the ability
to select their own repair shops. He also said the state law
deprived customers of important information by barring insurance
companies from telling their customers which shops had a proven
track record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although the state does have a legitimate interest in
protecting consumers,'' he wrote, ``the court does not accept the
notion that consumers' lack of intelligence requires the state to
deprive them of options or limit their choices to those which the
state thinks are acceptable. The court finds that the programs
offered to Allstate's and Geico's insureds afford them additional
opportunities, protection and truthful information. The speech at
issue is not deceptive, misleading or illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce E. Clark, a lawyer for Allstate, said the company was
``gratified'' by the decision, but he declined to comment further
until he had reviewed the ruling.

COMPANIES REFUSE TO GUARANTEE ABC ON CABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Executives of Time Warner and ABC told City Council
members Friday that they could not guarantee that ABC programming
would not be disrupted again as they proceed with bitter contract
negotiations in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Rosenblum, president of Time Warner Cable of New York
City, and Thomas P. Kane, president of WABC, ABC's New York
station, had been called before the new Select Committee on Media
Services and Consumer Rights by Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone
under threat of subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   And while the media executives appeared contrite, acknowledging
that the blackout of ABC on Monday and Tuesday had provoked
widespread anger among their viewers and subscribers, both balked
at repeated attempts by Vallone to obtain their assurances that it
would not be repeated by either company in an effort to gain
leverage in their contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious to me that eight million New Yorkers are not
party to this dispute, and they have a right to watch their
televisions,'' Vallone said. ``Is it asking so much to just shake
hands and get this over with?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be difficult to do that,'' responded Rosenblum, whose
company the Federal Communications Commission's Cable Bureau found
at fault in the blackout and said might face fines. He said legal
questions hanging over the company's negotiations with ABC and its
parent, the Disney Co., prevented him from offering any guarantees.
But he added that he found another service interruption ``hard to
fathom.''
</P>
<P>
   Kane, referring to the complex negotiations taking place,
responded to Vallone's request of a public handshake by the two
sides by saying, ``We'd need 100 people on each side of the table
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the outcry after the blackout has encouraged both sides
to resolve their differences quickly, he said, ``I can offer no
guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   At the core of the corporate standoff is an attempt by ABC and
Disney to obtain commitments from Time Warner of more widespread
and profitable distribution of Disney programming on Time Warner
Cable. For its part, Time Warner is pressuring Disney to revise its
contractual agreements, made under 1992 federal guidelines, to
arrangements that would require the cable operator to provide
uninterrupted ABC programming but would weaken Disney's hand in
other negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblum testified Friday that Time Warner had decided to cut
off the ABC signal in the New York area and in six other broadcast
markets only after Disney had repeatedly insisted on short-term,
interim operating agreements, forcing Time Warner, under federal
law, to repeatedly warn its viewers that ABC service might be
permanently dropped.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, ABC complained that Time Warner launched a
surprise attack by cutting its signal during ``sweeps,'' a ratings
period of special importance to advertisers and broadcasters. The
network's charge was upheld by the FCC.
</P>
<P>
   When Time Warner restored ABC's signal on Tuesday, the two
companies agreed to resume contract negotiations, which had halted,
until at least July 15 if the issue is not resolved sooner. The
public protest provoked by the blackout centered on what many
called the near monopolistic powers of the conglomerates, and could
prove most damaging to Time Warner because its pending merger with
America Online requires federal approval.
</P>
<P>
   To placate critics and compensate its subscribers, Time Warner
said on Thursday that each of its affected customers would receive
a rebate for two days of basic cable service and 30 days of an
additional premium cable channel free. Rosenblum told the Council
committee that the rebate would be worth about $1, based on Time
Warner's basic service cost of $15 a month, and the 30 days of
service with a free premium channel would be worth an average of
$13.95.

GENERAL MOTORS TO UPDATE FAIRFAX PLANT, CHANGE PRODUCT LINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDOLPH HEASTER and STEVE NICELY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ General Motors Corp.
announced Friday that it would build a new generation of passenger
cars at its Fairfax plant beginning in 2003, providing job security
to 3,500 area GM employees for the foreseeable future.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plant manager Paul Marr, along with leaders of United Auto
Workers Local 31, made the announcement to the Fairfax workers at a
quarterly meeting held in a plant auditorium, said Tara
Condon-Tullier, a plant spokeswoman. The meeting also was broadcast
via closed-circuit television to the production floor.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to invest more than $500 million in the facility to
build cars under the Epsilon platform, the company's worldwide
building process for its next generation of cars.
</P>
<P>
   Although GM declined to identify which models would be built at
Fairfax, union officials said the Chevrolet Malibu and Pontiac
Grand Am were the vehicles assigned to the plant. Those models
would replace the Pontiac Grand Prix and the Oldsmobile Intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   GM is the second automaker in recent years to make a sizable
reinvestment in an area plant. Ford Motor Co. has been retooling
and expanding its Claycomo facility for nearly two years to prepare
to launch a new compact sport utility vehicle later this month.
Ford reportedly spent $750 million to adapt the plant.
</P>
<P>
   GM's announcement Friday pleased union officials at Fairfax,
particularly after a bill in the Kansas Legislature to give GM tax
relief for the Epsilon project failed to gain the support of key
area legislators.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful we've been approved for the new product,'' said
Jim Russell, president of UAW Local 31. ``It's good for our
membership, and it ensures that our younger people will have a
future here.''
</P>
<P>
   Both GM and the UAW credited the plant's employees for the
automaker's decision to bring the new product line to Fairfax
despite the lack of a tax-incentive package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we got the Epsilon because of a great work force and
good labor-management relations,'' Russell said. ``I know it wasn't
because of the Unified Government (of Wyandotte County and Kansas
City, Kan). They flat knocked us down.''
</P>
<P>
   GM's Condon-Tullier agreed. ``The significant factors were the
(plant's) excellent work force, safety record and the quality,''
she said. ``But the tax climate will weigh heavily on future
program allocations and investment decisions at Fairfax.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite GM's concerns about the tax climate, the company's
decision was welcome news in Wyandotte County, where the plant is
the largest taxpayer. GM currently pays about $10 million a year in
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's excellent news,'' said Dan Schenkein, president of the
Kansas City, Kan., Area Chamber of Commerce. ``It's a testament to
this production facility's...ability to produce a quality
product.''
</P>
<P>
   Unified Government Mayor Carol Marinovich said General Motors
was a major corporate citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Epsilon project will provide stability to this business
and the jobs it provides,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   GM announced its plans for the Fairfax plant before it concluded
negotiations for tax breaks with the Unified Government, which
surprised some officials.
</P>
<P>
   GM's push for a bill granting permanent tax abatement on tools
and dies did not pass the Legislature, partly because it lacked
solid support among lawmakers from Wyandotte County and their
constituents. The Fairfax plant had received total property tax
breaks on its current plant for 10 years and had resumed normal
payments three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But GM did not strike out completely during the recently
completed legislative session. A bill passed exempting GM from
sales taxes on new machinery and equipment and the cost of
installing it. Another bill also makes the plant eligible for $1.5
million in training aid for its work force.
</P>
<P>
   The Unified Government also has the authority to grant property
tax breaks of as much as 100 percent for 10 years. It routinely
grants breaks equal to 50 percent of property taxes for 10 years
for major plant expansions and new businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Unified Government Administrator Dennis Hays said there had been
no discussions about taxes with GM since the Legislature adjourned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to work with GM with all licenses and permits
for them to move forward,'' Hays said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   GM plans to continue building the Pontiac Grand Prix at Fairfax
through 2002. Grand Prix assembly then is expected to be
transferred to a GM plant in Canada. The Oldsmobile Intrigue, which
has suffered slow sales after an impressive debut, will be
discontinued sometime in 2003, according to the union's Russell.
</P>
<P>
   GM will begin preparing the Fairfax plant for the Epsilon
platform as early as this summer, when U.S. automakers
traditionally shut down for two weeks, Condon-Tullier said. It is
too early to tell whether unscheduled shutdowns will be necessary
for construction at the facility over the next 2 years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Malibu will move to Fairfax from GM's plant in Oklahoma
City. The Fairfax plant mainly will produce Malibus, but it also
will supplement production of the Grand Ams, which primarily will
be made in Lansing, Mich., according to Russell.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfax plant currently employs about 3,000 hourly workers
on two shifts. Russell said GM is hoping to reduce the hourly work
force to about 2,500 through attrition and retirements over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
   However, both company and union officials said a third shift
could be added if the new Epsilon cars do well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have hopes for a third-shift operation, but that
depends on how well the car does,'' Russell said. ``If there's
strong demand when GM kicks off the Epsilon, naturally they'd look
for a way to meet that demand by adding another shift.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said a third shift could boost the number of hourly
workers by 700 to 800 people.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Fairfax plant's gaining the Chevrolet Malibu and
losing the Pontiac Grand Prix, one auto analyst called it ``an even
swap.''
</P>
<P>
   Annual production of the Malibu is normally between 200,000 and
250,000 units, said George Magliano, director of automotive
research for the WEFA Group in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volume numbers are roughly the same. But you can build a
few more units of the Malibu, because it's easier to make than the
Grand Prix,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Malibu has an advantage over both the Grand Prix and the
Grand Am, according to Magliano.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Malibu is a volume-car sold more to consumers than to
rental fleets, unlike the Grand Am,'' he said. ``The Grand Prix has
become an enigma; it's lost some of the positioning in the market
that it used to have. Are you better off having the Malibu instead
of the Grand Prix? You probably are.''
</P>
<P>
   The Malibu generally sells more units than the Grand Prix.
Through April of this year, GM reported Malibu sales of 73,528, an
increase of 10.2 percent over the same time last year. The Grand
Prix has sold 51,793 units through April, a 3 percent gain from
last year. (30)

PROSPECT OF SHIPPING NUCLEAR WASTE VIA I-70 STIRS UP MISSOURI
SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   WASHINGTON _ Sen. John Ashcroft and Gov.
Mel Carnahan, who is running against Ashcroft for the Senate, are
at odds over who is more opposed to having hazardous waste shipped
across Missouri on Interstate 70.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ashcroft voted this week to override President Clinton's veto of
a bill that would have placed a nuclear-waste storage site at Yucca
Mountain, Nev. Waste from temporary storage sites in the East was
to move to Nevada by rail and by truck, with some of it crossing
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The veto stood after a 64-35 override vote fell short, but
Carnahan thinks Ashcroft's support for the Nevada site runs
contrary to statements he made at a Missouri news conference two
weeks ago that waste shouldn't be shipped on Interstate 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to give the appearance he opposes it,'' said Tony
Wyche, communications director of the Carnahan for Senate
committee. ``It's a flip, flop, flip.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft appeared at a news conference in Jefferson City, Mo.,
on April 19 and held up a chunk of broken pavement from I-70 to
demonstrate that shipping nuclear waste on such a deteriorated
highway would be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft's remarks that day were not related to the Yucca
Mountain bill but to plans by the Department of Energy to ship a
truckload of spent nuclear fuel from South Carolina to a storage
site in Idaho later this year. He called on the Energy Department
to find another route.
</P>
<P>
   David James, communications director for the Ashcroft 2000
committee, said that the Yucca Mountain bill dealt with storage,
not shipment, and that the senator's support of it did not mean he
was willing to have waste sent across Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Energy decides the shipping routes,'' James
said. ``If Mel Carnahan wants to get this material off the
dilapidated, crowded roadbed of I-70, he needs to call his friend
Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department has determined I-70 would be among routes
used for shipments to Nevada. Carnahan doesn't want the highway
used for any shipments, Wyche said, and has written the Energy
Department to that effect.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft wrote a letter to Energy Secretary Bill Richardson on
April 18 to suggest transporting any radioactive waste shipments
through alternative routes in Iowa, which he said experienced four
to five times fewer accidents than I-70 in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Wyche said Carnahan agreed that other routes would be better,
especially because I-70 passes through the major population centers
of St. Louis and Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The Ozark chapter of the Sierra Club is among environmental
groups strongly opposed to shipping waste across Missouri. The
chapter opposed the Yucca Mountain site partly for that reason and
thinks shipping waste anywhere is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the states are unequipped to deal with high-level
radioactive waste accidents,'' said Ken Midkiff, director of the
Ozark chapter. Nuclear storage plants, not the U.S. government,
should be responsible for safe storage and shipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Midkiff criticized Ashcroft for backing the Yucca Mountain site
while at the same time coming out against shipping waste across the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just political hypocrisy _ a finger-in-the-wind
gesture,'' Midkiff said. (30)

NASD DIRECTOR RETIRES AFTER 30 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ After 30 years, Jack
Rosenfield is a citizen again. He has spent three decades, more
than half of it in Kansas City, as a cop on the stock market beat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   He retired Friday as vice president and district director for
the National Association of Securities Dealers. His start came May
4, 1970, as an NASD examiner in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD is the industry's self-regulatory arm that polices
brokers and brokerages. It operates under the watch of the federal
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield, 60, recalled on Wednesday that an examination in
1970 meant stopping by with ``a pad, a pencil and a 100-page
questionaire.'' Today, examiners carry laptop computers, tap into
databases and tailor audits to fit each firm's activities.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield has witnessed the creation of the Nasdaq Stock
Market, industry computerization, the advent of online trading and
day trading, a surge of public participation in the stock market
and the seamy side of Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a regulator you have to hurt someone for doing wrong,''
Rosenfield said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also was praised by some of the area NASD members whom he
has regulated for decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point in time, everybody in town had some contact with
Jack and most of it was good,'' said William H. Coughlin, president
of George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City. ``He's been good for the
business and I think he's been good for Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield helped to bring a delegation of top Japanese
securities dealers to Kansas City in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He unwittingly had laid the groundwork in the late 1970s in New
York. He had been tapped to serve as host to a visiting group of
Japanese dealers and stayed in touch with one of the lower-level
visitors. That official rose through the ranks until becoming
secretary general of Japan's version of the NASD.
</P>
<P>
   When the group toured the U.S. securities industry four years
ago, its top delegates, including the secretary general, started
with a visit to Kansas City and Rosenfield.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield had transferred here in November 1981 to become
director of the NASD's District 4 office. The promotion meant he
was the chief NASD regulator in Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska and
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival closed what had been something of a revolving door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, before he got here, we had maybe four other guys in
a span of a few years,'' said Bob Smart, chairman of the Perkins,
Smart &AMP; Boyd Inc. investment firm in Fairway.
</P>
<P>
   A reorganization in 1991 expanded Rosenfield's District 4
territory to seven states in the Midwest. The district's staff has
grown to 47, from 16 when he arrived in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the industry recognized Rosenfield's 30 years
of service with a good-natured roasting of their retired-that-day
regulator. The send-off by about 150 industry members at the Kansas
City Club also raised nearly $30,000 that will go to charities of
Rosenfield's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to get a very warm send-off,'' Smart said early in
the week.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenfield said the idea of a roast was intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   He is decidely low key. Despite his post and tenure in it,
Rosenfield rarely has appeared in The Kansas City Star. He said
that was by design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the type of person who, in the morning, opens the paper
very slowly lest, on the back page, my name might be there
somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He had hoped to say a few goodbyes. But Brent Weisenborn,
chairman of Security Investment Co. of Kansas City, organized the
roast to Rosenfield's surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Weisenborn also serves as chairman of the NASD member committee
that hears charges against NASD members in the district. He
credited Rosenfield not only for keeping members in compliance but
also for serving them.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Weisenborn said, Rosenfield began visits with
chief executive officers and compliance officers at NASD member
firms in the district. The group sessions were aimed at preventing
problems rather than issuing sanctions for them after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Weisenborn said other NASD districts have taken up the practice.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield said retirement won't mean ending his long
involvement with the stock market or an exit from Kansas City. He
plans to take a couple of months to rest and update his resume,
then he plans to job hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than photography, my life is the stock market,'' he
said. ``I really don't go anywhere without my Wall Street Journal,
New York Times, CNBC and Bloomberg.'' (30)

Indian troops, was rapidly losing confidence under the assault, a
Western diplomat reached by telephone in the capital of Freetown
said. He added that after the latest captures, on Thursday, the
entire mission, meant to secure the peace after eight years of
civil war, was in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   He described the chances of an effective continuation of the
mission, one the most ambitious peacekeeping efforts by the United
Nations, as only ``50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Talks were underway in Freetown between several commanders of
the insurgent Revolutionary United Front and Western diplomats to
try and stop the fighting, the diplomat said. But it was unclear
what progress was made.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hostages was a contingent of about 200 Zambian
soldiers, a U.N. spokesman said. Their weapons were taken and they
were stripped of their clothes, this spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   About a dozen armored vehicles belonging to the Zambians were
also confiscated and were now being driven by the rebels, according
to reports from the field. Another contingent of more than 100
Nigerian peacekeepers was stripped of weapons and then released,
said the spokesman, Fred Eckhart.
</P>
<P>
   Further undermining the morale of the U.N. effort,
parliamentarians in Kenya Friday called for the withdrawal of the
Kenyan contingent of the peace force after four of their soldiers
were missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. peacekeepers were also taken hostage by the hundreds during
the Bosnian war. In May 1995, Bosnian Serbs held more than 350
peacekeepers, some for several weeks, as insurance against air
strikes by NATO. Under a peace accord signed last July, the rebel
leader, Foday Sankoh, whose forces have terrorized the country with
a campaign of chopping off hands, feet and arms, was brought into a
new national government.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, some U.S. officials questioned the wisdom of
bringing such a violent leader, who has become rich from plundering
Sierra Leone's diamond mines, under the government umbrella. It was
now becoming obvious, some officials said, that Sankoh was using
his new government position as a temporary breather before making
more war.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the assault by the rebels, who began their
operation on Tuesday, seemed very precise, several administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's troops _ assumed by the administration to number about
6,000, with many of them unemployed teen-agers _ chose a window of
opportunity just after many Nigerian troops had withdrawn from
Sierra Leone and before the U.N. force was up to full strength.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels also took advantage of a U.N. force that appeared to
be ill-trained, easily intimidated and equipped with only light
infantry armor, administration officials said. Some of the troops
were not following elementary military rules such as securing the
perimeters of their bases, barracks and offices, one official said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from the field in the last few days showed that some
U.N. troops were so frightened by the reputation of the rebels that
they abandoned their vehicles as soon as they were stopped at a
roadblock by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Describing how the U.N. troops gave up so easily, the official
said: ``Some will say that's what you get by hiring third world
armies. But in Somalia we had the same with first world armies.''
This was a reference to U.S. forces who withdrew from Somalia in
the first year of the Clinton administration after 17 soldiers were
killed in a firefight.
</P>
<P>
   As the situation in Sierra Leone continued to deteriorate,
senior Clinton administration officials met at the White House to
assess options.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, a senior State Department official said that a team
of British military experts would arrive in Sierra Leone on
Saturday to review the U.N. operation from ``top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are continuing to do is look very carefully at whether
the forces there and the reinforcements that can be brought in can
have a useful effect,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has said it is considering a request from the
United Nations to provide transport planes to ferry some of the
3,000 Jordanian, Bangladeshi and Indian troops still scheduled to
go to Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   There was absolutely no consideration of sending U.S. soldiers,
officials said. In similar situations in the past, though, the use
of U.S. transport planes has required U.S. troops to help secure
the airport to ensure that the aircraft and military personnel
involved do not come under attack.
</P>
<P>
   On the diplomatic front, Washington was asking regional leaders,
including the president of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, to put
pressure on Sankoh to stand by the peace agreement of last July,
officials said. The State Department also asked the Rev. Jesse
Jackson to ask President Charles Taylor of Liberia to call for the
rebel leader, who is a colleague, to cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, diplomats described how the Zambian
convoy of 208 soldiers, who had arrived in Sierra Leone only two
days earlier, was overwhelmed, and lost its 13 armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The troops were dispatched Thursday from Lungi, a port north of
Freetown, to reinforce beleaguered peacekeeping troops at Makeni in
the northern hinterland. But they lost radio contact with the U.N.
headquarters in the capital. The Zambians passed through two rebel
checkpoints and then at a third found themselves boxed in by a
force of heavily armed guerrillas. The convoy's commander, faced
with a battle that he felt he was sure to lose, negotiated a
surrender.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 208 Zambian soldiers, an estimated 110 other
U. N. peacekeepers, military observers and civilian workers are
being held by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Under the mandate authorized by the Security Council for Sierra
Leone, the peacekeepers may defend themselves but are not equipped
for conventional combat.
</P>
<P>
   A former U.S. assistant secretary for Africa, Henry J. Cohen,
said Friday that the peacekeepers should have been more robustly
equipped, including with artillery, to be able to give a ``show of
strength.'' Cohen said the peacekeeping force now faced two
options: ``appease and lose face'' or use strong force against the
rebels, including helicopter gunships.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen added that if the U.N. force pulled out as it had in
Somalia in 1993 and several years later in Rwanda, then Sankoh's
forces would ``sweep into power.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In the coming days, the immediate task, according to the Western
diplomat in Freetown, was to see what ``you can do for the
battalions that are not affected. The key is to get the rebels to
turn it off and to resolve some of the U.N. problems of
organization and communication.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyans, who were the first target of the rebels, appeared
to have encountered rebels who were ``more numerous, more
committed.'' But why the Kenyan unit unraveled so quickly was not
clear, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   A Western diplomat said the peacekeepers were surrounded in
unfamiliar terrain by armed adversaries. ``They're authorized to
defend themselves but they're not required to fight to the last
man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some embassies in Freetown began evacuating dependents and
nonessential people. More than 100 workers for nongovernment relief
organizations were also reportedly been evacuated by U.N.
helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan expressed concern in Paris on
Thursday that the deteriorating situation in Sierra Leone might
have a ripple effect in making member countries hesitate to
contribute troops to a more complex peacekeeping operation being
assembled for Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The efforts right now are political in nature: to get anybody
who has influence on Foday Sankoh to convince him to come back into
compliance with the peace agreement,'' Eckhard said Friday. ``If
that fails, I don't want to speculate what could happen next.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leader, who remains at his residence in Freetown,
continued to deny Friday that his fighters have taken any U.N.
peacekeepers hostage, asserting that they must have gotten lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here was that there are people missing in the
area because they are not familiar with the terrain, so I ordered
my commanders to try and search for them,'' Sankoh said, according
to Reuters.
</P>
<P>
   Four U.N. helicopter gunships were supposed to have arrived last
month, the diplomat said, but as of several days ago had still not
shown up. Whether the gunships would have been useful in the clash
between the Kenyans and the rebels or the Zambians or the rebels
was an open question, the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are rather indiscriminate,'' the diplomat said of the
helicopters. ``As long as U.N. troops are with rebels I'd be more
cautious than sending up gunships to do their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the options being discussed at the State Department in
the last several days has been charging Sankoh with war crimes and
trying to remove him from the scene, several officials said. But
this seemed an unlikely outcome, especially while Sankoh's forces
controlled U.N. troops.
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said they were concerned that if Sankoh was
removed, the rebel group would become even less manageable because
it would fall into the hands of a number of disparate commanders.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the peace accords of last summer, Sankoh was given a
position as head of a commission designed to control the flow of
illegal diamond exports from Sierra Leone. The U.S. contributed $1
million to setting up the commission, an administration official
said.

LASORDA NAMED U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM COACH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Give Tom Lasorda five minutes and he can motivate
a rock to roll up hill. Give him 25 young players, send him to
another country, and the hope is he can turn that to gold.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, widely recognized as baseball's grandest ambassador,
will step on an international stage of which even he hasn't been
on. The Los Angeles Dodgers senior vice president and Hall of Fame
manager was named manager of the 2000 United States Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was anticipated for the past month, but Lasorda
said that didn't lessen the luster when he found out Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a lot of great thrills in my lifetime, and the 51
years I've been with the Dodgers, but something like this really is
something special to me,'' Lasorda, 72, said at a press conference
behind home plate at Dodger Stadium. ``I stood here in front of
this dugout many, many, many, many times, listening to the national
anthem, seeing the American flag up there and always saying at that
time, `Thank God I was born in the greatest country in the world.'
I would always say that every time I heard the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, to be able to represent our country, I think that's
really special. And let me tell you something. I am really inspired
by this. I want to do everything in my power to make this showing
over in Australia a great one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda's coaching staff could be named at a later date. The
members of Team USA won't be selected until August. Team USA will
compete in the Olympics in Sydney, Australia, Sept. 17-27. Team USA
will train in Brisbane, Australia, Sept. 2-13.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be able to represent our country, `Wow,'`' Lasorda said.
``I hope and pray everything will turn out right. I'm excited about
it. I want to get back in that uniform one more time, and, man, it
would be great to bring that gold medal back to the United States,
where it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Having accomplished everything else in his managing career,
including leading the Dodgers to two World Series titles, Lasorda
made it known he wanted to lead Team USA when the possibility was
first mentioned in March.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda was chosen ahead of Jim Lefebvre and Terry Collins by a
19-member panel of consisting of people from Major League Baseball
and USA Baseball. Lasorda was clearly the front-runner throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years and years and years I've known how important Tommy's
been to Major League Baseball in the United States,'' said Dodgers
president and chief operating officer Bob Graziano. ``But it wasn't
until I was walking through the streets of Seoul (Korea), Nagoya
(Japan) and Tokyo (Japan), and people of all different backgrounds
were walking up to Tommy and talking about baseball, that I
realized how much Tommy meant to baseball all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Darren Dreifort is the only member of the Dodgers
to play in the Olympics, competing in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992. He
said the selection of Lasorda is perfect. The Americans are yet to
win the gold medal since baseball was sanctioned for the 1992
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have probably the greatest ambassador to the game of
baseball there is, representing America's team, and that's not the
Atlanta Braves,''Dreifort said. ``They picked the best guy to send
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Former USC and Olympic coach Rod Dedeaux presented Lasorda with
the Team USA cap he wore while coaching the Team USA in 1984 - when
baseball was a demonstration sport at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   But before accepting the post, Lasorda spoke with Graziano,
general manager Kevin Malone and Dodgers managing general partner,
chairman and CEO Bob Daly about it since it will call for him to
leave his position for a few months. Nobody had a problem with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy Lasorda is one of the most accomplished managers in
baseball history and we are very fortunate to have him managing the
2000 Olympic Baseball Team,'' said Bob Watson, co-chairman of the
steering committee for USA Baseball. ``Tommy is a great motivator,
a great teacher and a great leader.''

 COMPLETE SEQUENCE OF GENES LINKED WITH dOWN SYNDROME TO BE MADE (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALAN BAVLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The complete sequence
of genes associated with Down syndrome will be published soon, the
chief of the Human Genome Project announced Friday during a visit
to Kansas City.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This should be a big leg up for Down syndrome researchers,''
Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research
Institute, told students and faculty at the University of Kansas
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a physician-geneticist, was in Kansas City at the
invitation of Republican Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas to meet with
local scientists and students and to visit research centers such as
KU Medical Center and the Stowers Institute for Medical Research.
</P>
<P>
   The Down syndrome chromosome, called chromosome 21, will be the
second chromosome sequence the government-sponsored Human Genome
Project has published since December.
</P>
<P>
   Chromosome 21 is also the site of genes that can cause Lou
Gehrig's disease, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the Human Genome Project will be completing work on
additional chromosomes at an accelerating rate. He predicted the
gene sequences of all human chromosomes will be published within
two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see chromosome after chromosome appearing,'' Collins
said. ``Then we'll have a full sequence (of genes) that will stand
the test of time.''
</P>
<P>
   An international team of scientists is mapping the human genetic
code. The project will help scientists understand diseases at the
molecular level and to develop treatments and even cures.
</P>
<P>
   Down syndrome researchers hailed the completion of the
chromosome 21 gene sequence as a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be a historic step for research,'' said geneticist
David Patterson, president of the Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in
Denver and chairman of the science advisory board of the National
Down Syndrome Society.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, we'll know the genetic information on
chromosome 21. That will be critical to devising ways to help
people with Down syndrome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Every person has 23 pairs of chromosomes, for a total of 46. A
full set of chromosomes is contained in the nucleus of every body
cell.
</P>
<P>
   Each human chromosome holds thousands of genes, the bits of DNA
code that control the growth, repair and function of cells.
</P>
<P>
   Most research on genetic diseases focuses on locating defective
genes that cause disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, or make a
person more vulnerable to illnesses, such as certain cancers.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, doctors may be able to use this genetic
information in several ways. They may recommend risk-reducing
lifestyle changes to people with a genetic susceptibility to an
illness. They may provide tailor-made drugs to counter the effects
of a malfunctioning gene. Or they may be able replace defective
genes with healthy ones.
</P>
<P>
   Down syndrome researchers, however, face a different set of
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Down syndrome there is an overabundance of genes. Persons
with the disorder have three, rather than two, copies of chromosome
21, for a total of 47 chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   Down syndrome, which occurs in about one in every 700
pregnancies, causes learning disabilities that range from mild to
severe, and other problems such as congenital heart disease and
Alzheimer's disease by age 40.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson is involved in research to identify the genes on
chromosome 21 that are associated with Down syndrome learning
disabilities. Once these genes are known, researchers may try to
use drugs to subdue the harmful effects of the extra set of genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hope is that's going to ameliorate some of the learning
problems people with Down syndrome have,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   Patterson was among the researchers who discovered in 1993 the
defective gene on chromosome 21 that can cause Lou Gehrig's
disease, also called amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. In the late
1980s, other researchers discovered a chromosome 21 gene that can
cause Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of scientists around the world have been working on
(chromosome 21) for a long time,'' Patterson said. ``That made it
an attractive target for sequencing.'' (30)

FORMER TOBACCO EXECUTIVES TELLS STUDENTS ABOUT HEALTH RISKS OF
SMOKING AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DONALD BRADLEY  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Students at Truman
High School in Independence, Mo., saw ``The Insider'' on Friday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not the movie _ the man.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Wigand, the subject of the Oscar-nominated movie, is the
former Brown &AMP; Williamson executive who broke the tobacco
industry's code of silence when he appeared on ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the now-famous interview with Mike Wallace, he told how toxic
chemicals were added to tobacco to enhance the addictive quality of
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Wigand's message to Truman students, however, went far beyond
the health risks of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   He told them about the bullet in the mailbox and the
middle-of-the-night death threats. He said Brown &AMP; Williamson
squashed the First Amendment by using courts to bully CBS into
postponing the ``60 Minutes'' segment.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry was desperate to shut him up, he said,
because he knew the secret of how cigarette companies hustled 3,000
teens each day into becoming habitual smokers. And he knew how they
ensured future sales with addictive, lethal additives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When used as intended, cigarettes kill you,'' Wigand told the
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Insider'' starred Russell Crowe as Wigand and Al Pacino as
a producer for ``60 Minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   At the movie's start, in March 1993, Wigand is chief of research
and development for Brown &AMP; Williamson, earning more than $300,000
annually. He and his family live in an upscale home and drive
luxury cars. His children attend private school.
</P>
<P>
   When he refuses to toe the company line, he is fired.
</P>
<P>
   Death threats are called to his house. His wife leaves. He is
tailed. When Brown &AMP; Williamson threatens to sue CBS, the network
drops the Wigand interview and the story is leaked to newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   By movie's end, he'd been divorced, deemed unhireable in his
profession, sued by his former employer and made a target in a
national smear campaign. He was teaching at a trifle of his
previous income.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday at City Hall, where Kansas City Mayor
Kay Barnes presented a proclamation to him, Wigand looked back on
the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how the industry treated defectors,'' he said. ``It was
emotionally devastating, but was it worth it....
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I do it again?...Yes, absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   ``60 Minutes'' eventually showed the interview with Wigand, and
in 1998, 46 states negotiated a $206 billion settlement with the
tobacco industry. The remaining four states settled for $40
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement put new restrictions on how tobacco companies
marketed and advertised cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson also agreed to drop its lawsuit against
Wigand.
</P>
<P>
   Since his ordeal, Wigand founded Smoke Free Kids, an
organization that advocates tobacco-use prevention. He was the
keynote speaker Friday at a World No Tobacco Day luncheon at
Rockhurst University and was scheduled to take part today in a
youth workshop at North Kansas City Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   At Truman High on Friday, Wigand implored students not to be
deceived by ads that used sexuality, fun and athleticism to sell
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Girls, he said, are prime targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a sweet, you're going to get fat,'' he said. ``But
if you have a smoke, you will stay skinny.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Rebecca Walker said Wigand's message, because of the
movie, was stronger than most anti-smoking strategies.
</P>
<P>
   In a local angle Friday, Wigand said Kansas City's largest law
firm, Shook, Hardy &AMP; Bacon, played a role in his story by
instructing him _ when he was hired at Brown &AMP; Williamson _ how to
``interpret'' scientific research that concluded smoking was
unhealthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to convince me the research was flawed,'' Wigand
told the students.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Cofer, a Shook, Hardy &AMP; Bacon partner who works on tobacco
cases, confirmed that the firm represented Brown &AMP; Williamson (and
still does) but said he could not comment because of
attorney-client confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what light we are put in, our lips are sealed,''
Cofer said.
</P>
<P>
   Not Wigand's. And he's getting some help.
</P>
<P>
   He said a few ``insiders'' at tobacco companies send him things
occasionally. (30)

STARTOUCHERS GET RETORTS ON TERMS, TOILETS AND MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star   Apologies are due all the loyal
StarTouchers. They've been asking a lot of questions lately but
haven't been getting any answers from Uncle Fearless. The time has
come to end this benign neglect:
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they say the economy is growing at a (certain) annual rate,
what is that a percent of? I never know.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation process is simple. The gross domestic product
measures the value of all U.S. economic output. At the end of each
quarter the government estimates this value and compares it with
the previous quarter. If the economy is growing, the magnitude of
economic expansion will be quantified by subtracting the previous
quarter's lower number from the current quarter's higher number and
figuring the percentage increase on an annualized basis. If the
economy is in recession, the process is reversed. To adjust for
inflation, the current calculation is based on constant 1992
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   You should use the terms Kansas City and Kansas Citians to mean
the people of Kansas City, Mo. Whenever you talk about the metro
area, it should be stated specifically.
</P>
<P>
   Well, excuuuuse me!!! This has always seemed a distinction
without a difference. When traveling abroad in this fair land and
strangers ask, ``Where you from?'' the answer is Kansas City, not
Lenexa, Kan. New Yorkers are New Yorkers, regardless of which
borough they inhabit. Kansas City's suburbs may not be precisely
analogous, but they're close enough for column work. Besides, we're
all one big happy family, right?
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything we can do about our (1.6)-gallon flush
toilets?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, media types don't pay much attention to this
outrage, but the latest word isn't encouraging. A House
subcommittee, reports The Weekly Standard, took up the matter of
repealing the stingy-flush toilet mandate recently, but voted
narrowly to retain the current law. Critics contend no water is
saved by refusing to allow consumers to choose the old 3.5-gallon
model, as if saving water is necessary in the first place, because
the stingy-flush models often take two or three tries to get the
job done. Officious government, however, thinks it more important
to control such matters than allow average citizens to make
common-sense judgments about such private aspects of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   How will the economy benefit from paying down the national debt?
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't make much difference to average Americans.
Treasury has been paying down the publicly held marketable portion
of the debt, but as of April 30, the total debt was still $100
billion higher than a year ago. The problem is that Uncle Sam has
been spending excess revenues from Social Security taxes and money
collected for such things as highways and airports faster than he's
paying down the public portion of the debt. When trust funds for
Social Security and the like are credited with IOUs after the
surplus revenues are spent, these obligations are added to the
national debt. So, what we're seeing is a substituion of debt. The
amount we owe investors, institutions and foreign governments and
central banks shrinks, while the amount we owe future Social
Security recipients expands. Meantime, the shrinkage of marketable
Treasury securities may create problems for financiers everywhere.

WHITE'S STATUS UNCERTAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers orthopedist Frank Jobe called
the tear in Devon White left rotator cuff ``slight'' on Friday but
added it would be two weeks before the team knows if season-ending
surgery is required for the switch-hitting center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   White, 37, was injured Tuesday night diving for a ball hit by
Atlanta's Brian Jordan. It is the same shoulder that required
surgery last winter, but Jobe said the new injury is in a different
location.
</P>
<P>
   Jobe said he was encouraged by White's range of motion during an
examination Friday. He added that because White's non-throwing
shoulder was injured, the recovery time probably is shorter. But he
stopped short of putting White back in the lineup anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best-case scenario is that he continues to get better
every day and starts to play in two weeks,'' Jobe said of White,
who was batting .289 in 22 games. ``The worst-case scenario would
be that he stops getting better and we have to operate on him. If
we do then it's a season-ending injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora returns: Alex Cora was devastated when he didn't make the
Dodgers out of spring training. The starting shortstop position was
his to lose and he lost it.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Cora is back in the big leagues, called up
Thursday when Kevin Elster was placed on the disabled list with a
strained groin. Cora started Friday night against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Cora did more than just catch a break. At the time of the
promotion, he was batting .394 (39 for 99) at Triple-A Albuquerque,
including a 13-game hitting streak, which prompted Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson to put him back in the everyday lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is up here to play,'' said Johnson, who kept veteran Jose
Vizcaino in the reserve role. ``He went down to the minors, did
what he had to do and persevered.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy at first.
</P>
<P>
   The adjustment to minor-league camp at the end of spring
training was difficult. Cora, who hit .176 with a club high four
errors, was unhappy and let everyone know.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then I realized that if I kept complaining and had my head
down, I was going to be in the minors a lot longer than I wanted to
be,'' said Cora, brother of former All-Star second baseman Joey
Cora. ``I had put too much pressure on myself in spring training.
The most important change for me was keeping things as simple as
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Cora, 24, recognized that people thought his spring average was
just more of the all-field, no-hit tag that had followed him since
he was selected in the third round of the 1996 draft out of the
University of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past few years, Cora's numbers have improved.
Although he batted .121 and .167 in brief stops with the Dodgers,
Cora had a strong second half at Albuquerque in 1998 and batted
.308 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've had that tag on my head ``Defense'' for a long
time,'' he said. ``But I feel very comfortable at the plate right
now. This is a great opportunity.''

GORE OFFERS PLANS TO IMPROVE QUALITY AND PAY OF TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)   (CLARIFIES Gore quote in 5th graf) 
 (SUBS to insert new material on Bush after 6th graf; new quotes
from teachers' union officials after original 11th graf) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. _ In a speech here outlining his proposals to
improve the quality of the nation's public school teachers, Vice
President Al Gore offered a spoonful of sugar to help the medicine
go down.
</P>
<P>
   He said that as president he would spend $8 billion over 10
years to recruit 1 million new teachers and another $8 billion over
10 years to increase teacher salaries if the states and teachers'
unions agreed that all new teachers submit to testing and meet
rigorous national standards and if teachers are hired on the basis
of expertise and not seniority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will ensure that
there is a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every single
classroom, everywhere in this nation, before the next four years is
out,'' he declared in a speech here to the Michigan Education
Association.
</P>
<P>
   His proposals are based on the theory that the quality of
teachers is the most significant factor within a school's control
in improving student achievement. And education ranks near the top
of voter concerns, especially in important battleground states like
Michigan, where Gore conducted his fourth ``school day'' Friday,
spending an entire day at the high school in nearby Holt. (He also
conducted his first ``school day'' in Michigan, in McComb County.)
</P>
<P>
   ``In communities where schools, teachers, community groups and
lo- cal businesses agree on effective plans to raise teacher
quality, let's give every qualified teacher a $5,000 raise,'' the
vice president said here. Gore said that by 2004, he would require
states to make sure that teachers are fully qualified to teach the
subject they are teaching. As of now, he said, only 36 percent of
teachers consider themselves to be very well-prepared to meet the
standards of their state or school district. In high-poverty areas,
as many as 50 percent of the math teachers have not studied math.
</P>
<P>
   Education is an area to which Gore's Republican rival, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, has devoted considerable attention in
hopes of wooing swing voters. Polls show he has been successful in
this attempt, which is uncharacteristic for a Republican. The Gore
campaign is countering Bush's initiatives with proposals that do
not just allocate federal money but also make demands of teachers
and school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposes to require teachers to have majored in their
subject area in college or pass a competency test in it. And he
would reward outstanding teachers and help schools improve or
remove bad teachers quickly, within the academic year as opposed to
the three years that such a process can take now, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``While we absolutely must respect due process, we have to put
an end to endless delays in removing those few teachers who really
do need to be removed,'' Gore said. He also said principals should
be allowed to hire teachers for reasons other than seniority. ``No
teaching contract should be a lifetime job guarantee,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Teacher testing and seniority hiring are highly controversial
matters among educators and have been strongly resisted by the
teachers' unions, which believe that standardized testing does not
measure the intangibles of good teachers. Others object to
standardized testing of both teachers and students as a step toward
giving up local control of education.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the teachers' unions have heartily endorsed Gore's
presidential candidacy. Against that backdrop, his speech Friday
was intended to be seen as a daring, principled stand, the kind
that his political advisers have been eager for him to take to
demonstrate that, contrary to the popular impression as registered
in public opinion polls, Gore does not just blow with the political
winds and pander to every group he addresses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It was what Gore aides called a ``Sister Souljah Moment,'' a
reference to Bill Clinton's tough speech during the 1992
presidential campaign when he took on the black singer face to face
for lyrics he said were offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech comes after the American Teachers Federation, the
nation's second-largest teachers' union, endorsed the idea last
week of toughening teacher standards.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory King, a spokesman for Sandra Feldman, the president of
the American Federation of Teachers, said Gore consulted with Ms.
Feldman on his proposals. He said that she was heartened that Mr.
Gore would cede some decisions on teacher hiring to ``principals
working with teams of teachers, and not just principals.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Elizabeth Teasley, the director of government relations for
the nation's largest teachers' union, the National Education
Association, said her union was comfortable with Gore's suggestion
that seniority not be the only criterion in teacher hiring. She
emphasized that Gore was not dismissing seniority as a
qualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe what he is putting forth is the notion that we
should consider credentials and expertise, and that seniority could
be a factor, it's just not the only factor,'' she said. ``We can
work with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been trying to demonstrate his commitment to education
in multiple ways, including by spending a full day at a school
somewhere in the country every week or so. He spent Friday at Holt
High School after spending the night with Margot Strong, a computer
teacher, her husband, Jay, who teaches first grade, and their two
children, Nick, 10, and Anna, 6. Gore arrived at their house after
midnight Wednesday night and stayed up late enough to watch four of
the five overtimes in the hockey playoffs on television.
</P>
<P>
   Holt was the first high school Gore has visited during this
campaign, and the older age of the students was evident in some of
their by-play with the vice president. In a morning physics class,
when Gore asked the students what the most interesting thing was
they had learned, Tonia Van Every, 18, called out: ``About Mr.
Pulver's personal life,'' a reference to the teacher, Eric Pulver.
``I'm one of the sarcastic kids,'' she told a reporter later.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the school newspaper, Gore was asked about
abortion. He said he believed it was up to a woman to decide what
to do, but he said he also believed in abstinence.
</P>
<P>
   And he revealed that his glory moment in high school was
shooting _ and sinking _ a long shot at the final buzzer, but only
after the basketball hit the backboard. Asked to list his favorite
sports, he said: ``Football, basketball, track, art.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his most difficult moment as vice president has been,
he answered without much hesitation: ``The day our soldiers in
Somalia were killed.''

MCCAIN, BUSH FINALLY TO CONFER LIKELY TO BE AMICABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JEFF BARKER  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
 Republic Washington Bureau  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
WASHINGTON - The Tuesday, May 9, long-awaited ``summit'' between
George W. Bush and John McCain is likely to produce smiles and
handshakes, but it is far less certain that the GOP rivals will
manage the sort of meaningful reconciliation that party regulars
are hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's top advisers have reportedly said the Arizona senator
will not formally endorse the Texas governor at the Pittsburgh
meeting, preferring to wait until later in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   That apparent coyness on McCain's part is disturbing to some
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't endorse (Tuesday), I will not understand why,''
veteran Republican consultant Lyn Nofziger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, a guy who can go over and endorse the North Vietnamese
certainly ought to be able to endorse George Bush. He's had more
than a month since the primaries to get over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, during his eighth trip to Vietnam, McCain again told
reporters that he is not interested in being Bush's running mate -
a topic likely to come up Tuesday in one way or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I would want to talk to him about it,'' Bush said in an
ABC-TV interview broadcast Friday night. ``If he wants to talk
about it, I'd like to talk about it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he'd prefer to play an active role in the
Senate, where he chairs the Commerce Committee, than to perform the
often ceremonial functions of a vice president. He has also said
that he and his wife, Cindy, would prefer to avoid an invasive
procedure in which the family's taxes and finances are scrutinized.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is certain to make clear at Tuesday's summit that he
supports Bush and that the two share a common goal of defeating
Democratic Vice President Al Gore in November. McCain has said he's
been delaying his endorsement because he wanted to achieve a
``greater comfort level'' with Bush's positions and out of respect
for his own voters during the primary elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's problematic for the Bush campaign, because McCain does
have a unique appeal, and an outpouring of McCain support for Bush
would clearly be beneficial to Bush's hopes,'' said Frank Luntz, an
analyst for YROCK.com, a political Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Nofziger said the longer McCain waits, the greater the
opportunity will be for Democrats to say, ``See, Bush is so bad
that even McCain won't endorse.''
</P>
<P>
   Nofziger recently participated in a GOP strategy session
organized by the Bush campaign. Among the attendees was former
McCain adviser Ken Duberstein _ evidence, Nofziger said, that
McCain's ``people,'' if not McCain himself, have gotten over the
bad blood of the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   McCain suspended his campaign two days after decisive defeats in
the ``Super Tuesday'' balloting on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and McCain had some memorable campaign squabbles.
</P>
<P>
   McCain complained when a Bush radio ad questioned his commitment
to breast-cancer research and when the Texas governor appeared with
a veteran in South Carolina attacking McCain's Senate voting
record.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush was outraged at negative phone calls suggesting
he was anti-Catholic and by a McCain ad comparing his level of
truthfulness to President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Since the campaign, McCain and Bush have become reluctant
suitors. Bush would like to tap into the Independent and Democratic
voters who declared their allegiance to McCain during the
primaries. McCain wants to be seen as aiding Bush to avoid the
charge that he is a bad loser who is disloyal to his party.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won't rule out seeking the White House again in 2004 if
the circumstances are right. His hero, Ronald Reagan, lost his bid
for the nomination to Gerald Ford in 1976 but won the presidency
four years later.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who labeled himself the reform candidate, says he wants
to ask Bush at their meeting about his specific proposals for
overhauling campaign-finance reform, Medicare and the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   Bush told Gannett News Service that ``the agenda is going to be
how do we work together, to fight for and campaign on personal
savings accounts in Social Security, or campaign-funding reform.
John and I have a lot of agreements.'' &QL;

CONSERVATIVE? LIBERAL? ONE BISHOP PROCEEDS WITH AN EFFORT THAT'S
JUST IMPORTANT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were two Roman Catholic priests from New York and one
out-of-town bishop sitting in front of the audience. The priests
were the ones in black clerical garb. The bishop was the one in a
pale blue sweater and a sports shirt.
</P>
<P>
   This was three weeks ago in the parish hall of St. Paul the
Apostle Church on Manhattan's West Side. Bishop Kenneth Untener of
the diocese of Saginaw, Mich., was there to address several hundred
people at a one-day conference on spirituality and social justice.
</P>
<P>
   Untener is considered one of the more liberal members of the
Catholic hierarchy, and not just because he shows up casually
dressed at events like this. Although he is anything but a
firebrand, from time to time he says things out loud, on topics
like birth control and the ordination of women, that a number of
other Catholic bishops say only privately.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular morning, however, Untener said nothing that
Pope John Paul II would not heartily endorse, and he said it all in
an easy, direct, enormously good-humored manner that totally won
his audience's attention and trust.
</P>
<P>
   He did not delve into specific social or political injustices,
about which his audience probably needed little education. Instead,
he stuck to basic theology and spirituality. He unselfconsciously
made passing references to life after death that could have come
from the most old-fashioned pastor. The ultimate focus of his
remarks was the Sunday Eucharist.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when New Yorkers are scanning the horizon for the
successor to Cardinal John O'Connor, Untener's remarks, and an
interview with him later that day, are a reminder of the limits of
the categories often used to describe church leaders, and not only
Catholic ones.
</P>
<P>
   The terms ``liberal'' and ``conservative,'' for example, are
notoriously slippery, depending on whether one is talking theology
or politics. A little better is the tool kit of familiar types: the
political churchman joining in civic debates, the doctrinal
churchman teaching from the pulpit, the administrator making church
agencies run smoothly or the comforter offering solace and
performing good deeds.
</P>
<P>
   These stereotypes are not completely useless; nor are the
categories of ideology, ethnicity and fund-raising abilities that
the news media, as in their reporting on prospective archbishops of
New York, readily import from the arena of party politics and
presidential tickets. But they are all seriously insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   What Untener was eager to talk about, for example, didn't fit
any of these categories, and yet, more than doctrine, sex, politics
or finances, it may be the key to Catholicism's future in this
country. His concern was the quality of Sunday worship.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Untener began meeting with his priests and
deacons in groups of five to review and improve their preaching.
Each person, including the bishop, was asked to record a live
sermon, and the six tapes were sent to the whole group for
listening before the gathering. Transcripts of these homilies, to
use the more current term, were also made, and a veteran journalist
working for the bishop marked them up the way a tough-minded editor
would.
</P>
<P>
   Each group engaged in this process for four meetings. More
recently, Untener has initiated a similar process, but this time
with the videotaping of entire Sunday liturgies (again, his own
included). Priests can review their manner of presiding, the degree
and nature of congregants' participation and the effect of the
music. The meetings will begin, say, with analyzing how one priest
or another conducted the opening prayers or the Eucharistic prayer.
Always keeping the church's liturgical theology in mind, the
participants discuss what ``worked,'' and what did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conversations can get very spiritual,'' Untener said,
``for example how hard it is to pray, really pray, in front of
other people _ not just performing prayer _ so that when Ken
Untener says, `O God,' it is really talking to God. And there's no
one single way to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the tapes reveal general problems of congregational
participation, for instance, the bishop has authorized limited
liturgical experiments in a few parishes, although not in search of
``a hokey gimmick for each week.''
</P>
<P>
   One key to this whole process is honesty, he said. For priests,
the gatherings can be ``a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to hear
some straight talk from a cross section of experienced peers,'' he
wrote in ``Preaching Better'' (Paulist Press, 1999), a practical
little book he has written for preachers.
</P>
<P>
   Another key, of course, is that the bishop is part of the same
process as his priests. ``Once the priests found out it's not top
down but helping each other,'' he said on his New York visit, ``it
wasn't threatening. It was welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   That may all sound egalitarian and liberal. But another key to
the process, Untener said, is that it is mandatory. Is that
hierarchical and conservative?
</P>
<P>
   Other dioceses, including New York's, have set up liturgical
teams that are ready to attend and analyze parish liturgies at a
pastor's invitation, but by all reports relatively few parishes
avail themselves of this kind of critique.
</P>
<P>
   Untener works through the diocesan roster of priests in
alphabetical order. ``We make financial reports mandatory,'' he
pointed out, so why be any less insistent about the quality of
worship? Church people say that ``liturgy is the most important
thing in a parish,'' he said, ``but that's not where we invest our
thought.''
</P>
<P>
   No archbishop of New York could exercise leadership in the way
that a bishop of Saginaw can. The New York archdiocese has 15 times
the number of Catholics, four times the number of parishes and
perhaps 10 times the number of priests in them. A New York
archbishop would have to find and appoint perhaps half a dozen
liturgical mentors like Untener.
</P>
<P>
   But the real point is not the applicability of a ``Saginaw
plan'' to New York. It is that this kind of pastoral strategy and
creativity, although it touches on the very heart of church life,
escapes virtually all the categories and labels tossed around in
descriptions of future church leadership here or just about
anyplace else.

PETER S. O'BRIEN, 70, SCHOOL UNION LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., Mich.)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Peter S. O'Brien, a founder and former president of
the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, a New York school
union, died on Wednesday at his home in Glen Rock, N.J. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York and a graduate of St. John's University,
O'Brien spent 27 years in the Marine Corps and its reserve,
retiring as a lieutenant colonel.
</P>
<P>
   He served in the Korean War and was a specialist in flight
control.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien worked 34 years in the New York City public schools as a
teacher, an assistant principal, a principal and the superintendent
of Community School District 30. He retired in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the council, which was founded in 1966, he
supported a strike by the United Federation of Teachers in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped found a national group, the American Federation
of School Administrators, and served as its president.
</P>

ANTONIO BUERO VALLEJO, 83, SPANISH PLAYWRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Antonio Buero Vallejo, a highly admired Spanish playwright who
made his name as a dissident during Franco's long rule and who in
1986 was awarded the Cervantes Prize, the country's highest
literary honor, died on April 28 in a hospital in Madrid, Spain. He
was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Buero Vallejo, whose work was distinguished by a commitment to
freedom and justice, was among a small circle of Spanish
intellectuals who remained in Spain as dissidents during the Franco
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Having fought in the Republican ranks in the Spanish Civil War,
he was arrested in 1939 and condemned to death, but the sentence
was commuted and he was released from prison in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   Theater was always central to his life. He was born in
Guadalajara, Spain, and enjoyed playing puppet theater as a child.
When he was a teen-ager, he moved to Madrid to study at the School
of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   But his literary ambitions were interrupted when the Spanish
Civil War broke out in 1936. His father was immediately arrested
and executed by Franco's forces, leading the young man to join the
Republican forces.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of war and prison influenced his writing
throughout his career. His best-known work, ``Historia de una
escalera'' (``The Story of a Staircase''), written in 1949 and
still widely performed, captured the physical and moral decay of
Spain in the early years after the civil war. Even though this work
and subsequent ones portrayed the dark side of life under Franco,
their performance was rarely banned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 he was awarded the National Theater Prize for ``Hoy es
fiesta'' (``Today Is a Holiday''). In 1962 he wrote ``El concierto
de San Ovidio'' (``The Concert of San Ovidio''), a parable about
blindness in which he portrayed Spanish society as depressed and
paralyzed by fear.
</P>
<P>
   Other works that reflected the hardship of daily life were ``El
tragaluz'' (``The Skylight''); ``El sueno de razon'' (``The Dream
of Reason''); and ``La fundacion'' (``The Foundation'').
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, in the dying years of the Franco era, he was elected to
the Spanish Royal Academy, an occasion he used to praise Federico
Garcia Lorca, the playwright murdered in 1936 by Franco's forces.
Buero Vallejo's most recent work was ``Mision en el pueblo
desierto'' (``Mission in an Empty Village'').
</P>
<P>
   Even after suffering a stroke in the autumn, he remained engaged
in theater. One week before his death he went to the Maria Guerrero
Theater in Madrid to see his wife, the actress Victoria Rodriguez,
perform in Friedrich Durrenmatt's play ``The Visit of the Old
Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Buero Vallejo is also survived by one of their two sons; their
other son died in a car accident some years ago.

ALONZO CRIM, 71, FIRST BLACK SCHOOLS CHIEF IN SOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Calif., Ill.)   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Alonzo A. Crim, the first black superintendent of schools in
a major city in the South, died Wednesday at a hospital in Atlanta
after an automobile accident. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, involving Crim's car and two others, occurred a
few blocks from a high school named for him. The other drivers
suffered some injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Crim was Atlanta's school superintendent from 1973 until he
stepped down in 1988. He was the superintendent of a school
district in Carmel, Calif., when he was invited to take over
Atlanta's public school system, thus becoming the first black
superintendent ever hired by a major Southern school system.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to Atlanta, he said he would build a system ``where
students would know that people cared about them'' and would help
them achieve.
</P>
<P>
   He is widely credited with reaching that goal, and he received
an honorary degree from Princeton and another from Harvard for
being ``a wise and perceptive schoolman who has rallied his city to
the cause of better public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Crim was appointed superintendent in fulfillment of a settlement
regarding school desegregation that stipulated the appointment of a
black superintendent and a balance between black and white
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   When Crim took over the Atlanta school system, it was in
disarray, with standards plummeting, teachers and students being
shunted from school to school for racial reasons, and its
institutional structure unraveling.
</P>
<P>
   In a community where power was split between blacks and whites,
he endeavored to foster stability, accepted goals and academic
standards, and advancement as measured by those goals and
standards.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, by 1986, student performance levels in basic skills
were higher than the national average. School attendance had
increased 6 percent to 8 percent, and automatic promotions were
being abolished.
</P>
<P>
   He was also applauded for having raised the graduation rate to
over 70 percent, and school attendance to over 92 percent. He was
recalled this week by The Atlanta Journal as ``the courtly,
optimistic superintendent who brought Atlanta schools through
tumultuous years of desegregation and white flight, and managed to
teach the city something about civility in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles V. Willie, a retired professor at Harvard's graduate
school of education, where Crim received a doctorate in 1969, said,
``We always pointed'' to what Crim was doing in Atlanta ``as the
work of an outstanding superintendent, in desegregation and in the
area of curriculum change.''
</P>
<P>
   By early 1986 Crim was the longest-tenured black superintendent
of schools in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, he was mentioned as a possible successor to New York's
retiring schools chancellor, Nathan Quinones.
</P>
<P>
   Crim retired in 1988, and a year later it was reported that
student scores on standard tests had begun to drop while he was
superintendent. In addition, enrollment declined while he was
superintendent, because white students moved out of the system.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring, he taught educational administration at Georgia
State University.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Chicago, he served in the Navy in 1945 and 1946.
</P>
<P>
   He received a bachelor's degree in 1950 in sociology from
Roosevelt College, did graduate work at Chicago Teacher's College
in 1953 and 1954 and received a master's degree in education
administration in 1958 from the University of Chicago, and a
doctorate in educational administration in 1969 from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Gwendolyn, died in February of a heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include a son, Timothy, and twin daughters, Sharon
C. Mercer and Susan Crim-McLendon, all of Atlanta, and eight
grandchildren.

SOX BEAT RAYS
</HEADLINE>
 RAYS-RED SOX-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mention the last-place Devil Rays to the Red Sox, and you don't
get the reaction you would expect.
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. Tampa Bay may have won only 69 games a year
ago, and may be in the basement in the American League East, but it
beat the devil out of the Red Sox last season, winning 9 of 13
games. It was only one of three AL teams to have such an advantage
on the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay came to Fenway Friday night for the opening of a
three-game weekend series, expecting to pick up where it left off
last season.
</P>
<P>
   But on an 80-degree evening, the Red Sox showed a sellout crowd
of 32,479 and the Devil Rays a combination of things in posting a
5-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Begin with starting pitcher Ramon Martinez, who gave a solid
five-inning (plus two batters) effort (eight hits, three runs)
before giving way to Rich Garces and Derek Lowe, who closed down
the Devil Rays the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Move over to a balanced offense that produced 10 hits, including
a pair of doubles by designated hitter Brian Daubach; a two-hit
effort by right fielder Trot Nixon, who also made a marvelous
run-saving catch in the sixth; another home run by center fielder
Carl Everett, who appears just as hot in the first week of May as
he was in April when he blasted seven home runs and had 23 RBIs;
and a three-hit effort by second baseman Jose Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good, clean game,'' said Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams. ``If you give yourself a good, clean game, good pitching,
good hitting, good fielding, you give yourself a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere Williams looked Friday night, he had reason to smile.
Martinez, for example, turned in what Williams said was his best
effort of the season. ``He had probably his best stuff,'' said
Williams. ``Maybe it was the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who threw 99 pitches, didn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt nice,'' he said. ``This is the kind of weather I
like.''
</P>
<P>
   But as has been the case in almost all of his starts, it took
him awhile to get going.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a leadoff triple to center fielder Gerald Williams,
which turned into a quick run when left fielder Greg Vaughn lined a
single to right.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always takes me awhile to get started,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez (2-2) also got considerable support; the most the Sox
have given him since a 13-4 romp over Minnesota in the home opener
April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach drove in a run in the first following another Nixon
double (his fifth in the last three games), and back-to-back
doubles in the fourth by Jason Varitek and Wilton Veras (following
the Everett home run) highlighted a three-run inning that gave the
Sox a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they do against everybody else,'' said Jimy
Williams. ``But they do a lot of good things against us. Hit good,
pitch good.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays chipped away at Martinez with a run in the fifth,
and then picked up another run in the sixth when Jose Canseco hit a
moon shot over the left-field screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit a few homers in this park,'' said Canseco, whose shot
carried an estimated 415 feet. ``But we still lost. I told myself
to be aggressive on anything around the plate, and I got a ball I
could drive.''
</P>
<P>
   That was all for Martinez. Garces came in and threw two shutout,
hitless innings, aided greatly by a marvelous running catch by
Nixon on the warning track in right field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You keep your eye on the ball, you get a feeling of where you
are on the field, where you are on the warning track,'' said Nixon.
``You keep an eye on the ball until it gets into your glove. If you
hit the wall, you hit the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon didn't, and Tampa Bay did when Lowe came in and closed the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone did a great job,'' said shortstop Nomar Garciaparra.
``Ramon did a great job settling down after the first inning, the
bullpen did its job, and we did the job behind them as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like Jimy Williams said. A good, clean game that turned out
the way the Red Sox had hoped against the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   Finally.

EDITORIAL: THE LOCKERBIE BOMBING TRIAL  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 6:
</P>
<P>
   There may never be a full accounting of the terror plot that
brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, just
before Christmas in 1988. But the trial of two suspects that began
this week in the Netherlands offers the best chance so far to
establish at least a measure of responsibility for the attack,
which killed 270 people. That the case has come to court at all is
a tribute to the persistence of British investigators and some
skillful diplomacy by Kofi Annan, the secretary-general of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The two Libyan defendants, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen
Khalifa Fhimah, were indicted nine years ago in the United States
after one of the most intensive manhunts in history. They are
accused of packing plastic explosives inside a Toshiba boombox and
shipping the device in a suitcase from Malta to Frankfurt to
London, where it was placed aboard the Pan Am flight, which was
headed to New York. Investigators say the two men, who have denied
any role in the attack, were Libyan intelligence agents.
</P>
<P>
   The trial reflects the diplomatic maneuvering that made it
possible. The site is a former NATO airbase in the Netherlands, but
the trial is being conducted under Scottish law before three
Scottish judges, who will render the verdict. This satisfies Libyan
demands for a neutral location without compromising prosecution of
the case. Annan was helpful in making these arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives of some of the 189 Americans killed in the attack
fear the prosecution is misguided because it failed to implicate
others who may have ordered the bombing, including top Libyan
officials. Some relatives also believe that Syria and Iran may have
played a central role in the plot. These concerns are valid, but
they ought not to diminish the importance of the trial. If the
guilt of the two Libyans is established by hundreds of witnesses
who will testify and the thousands of bits of evidence that will be
introduced, they should be convicted and sentenced to life in
prison in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It is unfortunate that the Clinton administration seems ready to
consider a thaw in relations with Libya as the trial opens. Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, has behaved with greater
moderation in recent months, and Britain re-established diplomatic
relations with Libya last summer. But it is far from clear that
Gadhafi has made a full conversion after years of promoting
terrorism around the world. As part of the compromise arrangements
for the trial, U.N. sanctions against Libyan air travel and imports
of vital industrial equipment have been lifted. That is sufficient
relief for now. Separate U.S. sanctions against Libya should remain
in place.

EDITORIAL: PAYING FOR A TRIP, ETHICALLY  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 6:
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George Pataki got a mostly favorable ruling this week from
the New York State Ethics Commission on the controversial financing
of his two trips to Hungary in 1995 and 1996. The commission found
no violation of the state's ethics law in allowing the
Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit trade group
largely financed by companies lobbying the governor's office, to
pay for his trips, which were combined trade missions and family
vacations. The panel said its ``extensive inquiry'' supported the
governor's claim that neither he nor anyone else in his
administration knew that the chamber was soliciting funds for the
trips from companies with significant business pending in Albany.
These included Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette maker,
Pepsico and two pharmaceutical giants, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers
Squibb.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the commission's finding does not exonerate the governor
for his poor judgment in having his senior economic adviser,
Charles Gargano, contact the Hungarian-American Chamber and request
that it pay for the travel. The chamber had few resources of its
own and thus had to go out and raise the money.
</P>
<P>
   Even a five-member ethics panel with three gubernatorial
appointees felt compelled to express ``ethical concerns'' about the
indirect financing of the trips by four companies disqualified
under state law from directly providing such benefits. Citing the
potential for companies' gaining improper influence in such cases,
the commission announced that in the future, state officials would
be required to ask proposed sponsors if they would be soliciting
money to pay for the trip, and if so, from whom.
</P>
<P>
   That is progress, but it would be even better if state law
simply barred officials from accepting free travel from any
individual or group. Meanwhile the commission's verdict still
leaves Pataki with some unfinished business. Now that he can no
longer claim ignorance about the unsavory role of the lobbying
companies in underwriting his Hungarian excursions, the only
honorable course is to return the chamber's money. That portion
allocable to state business can be paid by the government. The rest
should be paid from his own pocket.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Going into the week of April 10 _ otherwise known as Fright Week
by technology investors _ the shareholders of the Vignette Corp.
had more reason than most to be optimistic about its stock price.
The company's new V/5 e-commerce software series, an integrated
program for improving and expanding corporate systems, were about
to be introduced, and a 3-for-1 stock split was to take effect that
week.
</P>
<P>
   The stock, like so many others, was pummeled throughout the
Nasdaq plunge. It fell even further when the split took effect that
Friday, and finished at $42.25, down 37 percent for the week and 57
percent from its high of $99 on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Wrona, portfolio manager of the $3.02 billion PBHG
Technology and Communications fund, watched the price dive and felt
``painfully sick'' _ sicker than perhaps any other Vignette
shareholder, save the software maker's executives. Vignette, a
company that Wrona said has great prospects for both long- and
short-term growth, represented his largest e-commerce software
holding ``by far.''
</P>
<P>
   In the days that followed, Wrona and others asked themselves a
question: What exactly to do with the business-to-business
e-commerce stocks they had poured so much money into in the
previous months?
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business, or b-to-b, Internet stocks had restored
e-commerce's good name in investor circles this spring. They did so
during an abysmal showing by business-to-consumer Internet stocks
like eToys, CDNow and scores of others that had basked in Nasdaq's
glow last year, but collapsed in value amid disappointing Christmas
performances. Indeed, a casual observer, looking at the performance
of the two stock groups, might have thought that investors were
shoveling the cash they had pulled out of eToys _ which fell by
half from Dec. 31 to March 10 _ into the Vignettes of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Just as quickly, though, the b-to-b group turned into the prime
killing ground for overvalued technology stocks. The Merrill Lynch
B2B Internet Holders Trust, a security that tracks 20 such
companies, fell 68.6 percent from March 10 through April 14. Over
that period, the Nasdaq composite fell 34.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There were a couple of reasons for the severity of the sell-off.
One was the outrageously high prices to which many of the stocks
had rocketed. The Internet Capital Group, an incubator for
industry-specific b-to-b marketplaces, went public at $12 in August
and screamed to an intraday high of $212 a share. A dozenb-to-b
stocks _ including Internet Capital, Ariba, Commerce One and
PurchasePro _ which were not yet public before the middle of last
year _ had soared to garner $125 billion of market capitalization
in roughly six months.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem was the rising tide of skepticism that seemed to
engulf the sector. Indeed, much of it was well-founded. In the
mania, many a company that had ever sold a good or service over the
Internet rolled out a ``b-to-b play,'' hoping to net a quick jolt
in its stock price. In March, Yahoo, the Internet portal company,
announced the creation of a business marketplace where industries
could research and buy goods. That came five days after eBay
announced its own b-to-b exchange.
</P>
<P>
   While bidding up the stock prices of the early marketplace
leaders, investors failed to account for the very real threat posed
by industry incumbents like General Motors, Ford Motor and General
Electric, whose entry promised to undermine the revenue dreams of
so-called pure-play Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks certainly got way ahead of themselves,'' said Ed
McCabe, a Merrill Lynch analyst. ``B-to-b addresses huge market
opportunities, but today there's still little traction, so these
stocks are discounting a rosy future. When you discount 20 years of
good news, even slightly bad news today can have a significant
effect on the present value of those stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors had come to look at information through the rosiest
glasses. One of the most widely quoted statistics on the
business-to-business sector was one put forth by the Gartner Group.
It estimated that a staggering $7.3 trillion worth of global
corporate spending would go through the Internet in 2004, up from
$145 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Few people, however, cited the more salient figure in that same
Gartner report: that nearly two-thirds of that money would go
directly from manufacturers to suppliers, not to the b-to-b
Internet companies providing software, technology and the
marketplace platforms to clear the path for that spending.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that leaves roughly $2.7 trillion for the b-to-b Internet
market _ a healthy number by any standard, even if it is not enough
to justify market euphoria. The recent sell-off has done nothing to
diminish the prospects of the b-to-b sector generating that much
business, analysts and institutional investors said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Geri Spieler, a Gartner analyst, there will be
``enormous pressure from both buyers and suppliers'' to adopt
e-commerce over the next five years because of the enormous cost
savings involved. Spieler said that in 2005, when the first round
of corporate technological buildup nears completion, ``the entire
supply chain between suppliers and buyers will be automated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Any company will be able to order anything on the Web and have
it customized, whatever,'' she added. ``That's nirvana.''
</P>
<P>
   Given such a picture, the stunning decline in prices could now
be viewed as a positive for investors who still have a taste for
b-to-b stocks. According to Andrew S. Cupps, portfolio manager of
the $850 million Strong Enterprise fund, the sell-off will benefit
the larger players, because smaller e-business software and
technology companies may now be unable to go public or make
secondary stock offerings necessary to grow their businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, some companies will grow and come public,'' he
said. ``But fewer will do it, and they'll do it more slowly. It
really creates a better environment for those who've made it
through the window.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is precisely why the early leaders _ and those with the
strongest cash positions _ were the stocks that held up the best in
the April deluge.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptics say that one major correction can be followed by
another _ and that the 250.99-point drop in the Dow Jones
industrials on Wednesday is evidence that markets remain
extraordinarily volatile. More important is the assertion that the
promised profits of the b-to-b marketplace are just so much pap _
that the reality will never approach current forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   But that ignores an unpleasant fact. If the b-to-b group does
not pan out, investors are unlikely to find any safety under the
technology umbrella. So important is the b-to-b group to the
prospects of blue chips like Cisco Systems and Intel that a failure
of the new-business paradigm to live up to expectations would
almost certainly put a serious dent in many technology companies _
high-priced as they still are.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the spring massacre has served to make the job of
picking winners and losers that much easier. Money managers and
analysts who follow and invest in this class of stocks say they
remain convinced that each b-to-b Internet sector has companies
with extraordinary investment promise, especially for investors who
are willing to dig.  &QL; 
(MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   One problem in picking a smart business-to-business investment,
of course, is that any small company armed with a T-1 line can
pitch itself as a business-to-business stock. And many do.
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, established companies like Oracle, which
sells software that helps corporations manage their databases, and
Sun Microsystems, which makes servers, the workhorse computers
behind the Web, are now called b-to-b plays too, since so much of
their future growth is predicated on the growth of e-commerce.
There is the enormous overlap among companies that do business in
various categories.
</P>
<P>
   Experts divide the business-to-business Internet world
differently, but many settle on several key categories, beginning
with so-called infrastructure and architecture companies that make
the gear and software that store, retrieve, organize and send bits
back and forth across the World Wide Web. These services are meant
to support the back end of a corporation's e-commerce system _
Oracle's database software and EMC's data storage systems are but
two examples.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the software that the companies use within their
business-to-business systems to serve their customers _ software
that is more closely aligned with, say, the sales process or
customer relations than a corporation's internal information
technology department. B-to-b e-commerce software can help
companies buy goods from suppliers or pitch their customers'
products on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Firms that advise and guide companies through the maze of
introducing their e-commerce business plans are another
business-to-business sector. Call them e-guidance firms if you
like.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the b-to-b marketplaces, roughly the business
equivalents of eBay, through which companies exchange goods that
are at the core of their business processes. The sector also
includes those companies that make software needed to run the
exchanges. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the appeal of Internet architecture and
infrastructure companies is clear. ``If you're in a war, you don't
want to take sides _ you just want to sell the guns,'' said Bob
Turner, chief investment officer of Turner Investment Partners of
Berwyn, Pa. ``That's what these guys do.''
</P>
<P>
   The heavy artillery includes the hardware, routers, software and
technologies that move huge amounts of data as quickly as possible
through an Internet connection and are usually things made by Cisco
and Sun.
</P>
<P>
   But many money managers are also bullish on the EMC Corp., a
pre-Internet company that has flourished in the data-rich
environment of the Web by selling data storage systems that
stockpile a wealth of information, along with software, networks
and services to manage that data. Its products are the runaway
favorites among corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``To distill it, EMC is the best at what they do, bar none,''
said Bill Lewis, an analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q. ``They're absolutely the
dominant supplier of enterprise storage systems, and the
competition is behind,'' he added, referring to IBM, Compaq, Sun
and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   All blue-chip companies have a lot of sales that are not
business-to-business. So in approaching a company like EMC as a
b-to-b play, analysts said to focus on its revenue streams from its
push into e-commerce. According to Lewis, while just 12 percent of
EMC's sales are to pure-play Internet companies, the vast majority
of the remainder go to the Internet operations of traditional
companies. He is forecasting earnings growth of 30 percent over the
next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   The stock has weathered the Nasdaq storm well, closing on Friday
at $138, just below its 52-week high of $144 on March 7. Last week,
EMC announced a 2-for-1 stock split payable June 2.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the number and strength of its rivals are cause for
worry down the road, Lewis said: ``Each of those companies has
increased their efforts in storage because they're losing money to
EMC. The question is: Does the competition catch up, and when? But
so far, we've been expecting more than we've gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the pace of corporate e-commerce, Lewis said the
demand for data storage would grow.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis rates EMC a buy, but has no price target.
</P>
<P>
   One infrastructure stock that has retained favor among money
managers _ despite the steep fall in its share price _ is Exodus
Communications, which builds and hosts Internet systems on its vast
``server farms'' for corporations. ``With the acceleration of
e-commerce, a lot of companies have realized they lack the internal
resources to manage their Web operations'' with their own
information technology departments, said Andrea Grosz, an analyst
at First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think 20 percent of companies outsource some piece of I.T.
today, and 50 percent will by 2002,'' Grosz continued. ``Exodus
will be one of the major beneficiaries of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has roughly 30 percent of the overall market now,
she said. More important, that figure includes 50 percent of the
most visited Web sites, including Yahoo, Lycos and eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Data hosting, Grosz said, represents 40 percent of Exodus
revenues and, again, the stock's risk lies in the fact that rivals
are trying to muscle in on its business. ``Large telcos like Qwest
and Level3,'' she said, are among those pushing, ``and that could
create a commoditization, and price pressure along with it,
particularly in the data hosting piece.'' Exodus shares suffered
mightily in the technology sell-off. On Friday, they closed at
$85.75, about half their high of $173.3125 in March. Still, Grosz
has a 12-month price target of $130 on the stock. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Business-to-business software products seem to metamorphosize
monthly amid a roiling mass of shifting corporate alliances.
</P>
<P>
   Among the melange of products: procurement software, to manage
the buying and selling of products; content management and database
management software, to analyze and present content on company Web
sites; personalization software, to tailor the content to different
users, like human resource employees; and customer relationship
management software, which allows salespeople to work more
effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The best tactic for investors, money managers said, is to focus
on the market leader in each category. Companies with a reputation
for having the best product are likely to flourish. Among others,
money managers cited Broadvision, which makes personalization
software; Interwoven which sells content-management software; and
Vignette, which makes specialized software used for everything from
running site content to automating some customer-service functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This a very niche-oriented software market now, but it will be
consolidated, because sites will want to get it done with two or
three different vendors,'' said Wrona of PBHG. ``That just
reinforces why you want to have the best-of-breed.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to figure out the best software products
themselves, investors can look at the products that the leading
companies are buying. ``It's a very, very good indicator of
quality,'' said Storm Boswick, a portfolio manager for J&AMP;W
Seligman. ``It shows the market understands the product, that these
are the companies that GE and others are willing to go into battle
with.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the fact that Merrill Lynch chose to buy its
customer personalization software from Vignette is evidence that it
is a leader in that category, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stephen Sigmon, an analyst with Dain Rauscher
Wessels, Vignette is on track to achieve ``one-stop shop'' status,
the ability to furnish most software needs to customers, through
its V/5 series, which is being rolled out slowly, and the array of
applications that the company has either developed on its own or
added through acquisitions. ``All the key metrics _ market share,
customer acquisition growth, revenue growth _ are going in the
right direction,'' he said. The stock closed on Friday at $56.3125;
Sigmon has a 12-month price target of $100. &QL;
</P>

<P>
   Armies of consultants stand ready to coax Internet-shy
executives into the e-commerce revolution _ and collect hefty fees
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, both institutional investors and analysts said, is
that companies that provide Internet business development
strategies _ Scient, Viant, AppNet _ are seen as ``body shops.'' In
other words, they are regarded as businesses whose futures hinge on
the quality and number of consultants they can muster.
</P>
<P>
   Not all service companies should be avoided, and the technology
stock sell-off may have provided relatively attractive valuations,
money managers said. ``The best bets here are companies that have a
different approach in the marketplace, and large companies,'' said
Alan Harris, senior portfolio manager at Munder Capital Management
in Birmingham, Mich. In particular, he cited Diamond Technology
Partners, whose consultants advise the highest levels of corporate
management.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, said Richard Leggett, an analyst with
Friedman, Billings, Ramsey, a small investment bank based in
Arlington, Va., Diamond consultants generate the most revenue per
person of any publicly traded company, at $360,000 to $400,000,
compared with the industry average of $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The company's clients renew their contracts with Diamond 81
percent of the time, compared with an industry average of 60 to 70
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the dependence on human capital is likely to be a
hindrance over all. ``The company can only scale so much,'' Leggett
said. ``And this market is growing at 60 percent a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamond shares fell 50 percent from their high of $100 on March
9 to $49.0625 on April 14. They have since rebounded to $83.625
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   No category has done more to push business-to-business
e-commerce to the front of investors' minds in recent months than
the debut of online marketplaces, often referred to as exchanges.
These are one-stop shops for various industries that give
commercial buyers and sellers a place to display their goods, sell
them at auction, put out requests for proposals and perform other
business functions that used to be the domain of the telephone and
fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   The sector has two parts. First are those companies that build
or run the exchanges, like VerticalNet, Ventro and the Internet
Capital Group. Second are the companies that want to sell software
to the exchanges, like FreeMarkets, Oracle, Ariba and Commerce One.
</P>
<P>
   The smart way to assess the viability of a particular
marketplace is to look at its industry relationships. ``The key
thing to look at with these exchanges is who's got the big fish in
every industry,'' said Harris, of Munder Capital. ``Once they sign
him up, the big fish goes to the suppliers, and says, `You need to
standardize on this platform if you want to continue doing business
with me.'''
</P>
<P>
   That means the exchange category is particularly vulnerable to
old-economy giants. GE Medical Systems and Johnson &AMP; Johnson, for
instance, recently announced the formation of an online marketplace
to serve the medical industry. That is bad news for Neoforma.com, a
business-to-business exchange focusing on the same category.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges best able to defend themselves against old-economy
competition are those that address more fragmented markets, where
the power is not consolidated among a few hands. That leads Steven
Frankel, managing director of Adams Harkness &AMP; Hill, to recommend
eMerge Interactive, an exchange that serves the cattle industry.
EMerge ``doesn't have to fear the big guys,'' he said. ``The beauty
of it is there aren't any industry giants here.'' EMerge shares
closed on Friday at $21.8125, percent off their March high of
$66.875. Frankel said he had no price target on the stock, but that
he continued to ``pound the table on this one.''
</P>
<P>
   To spread one's bets, some analysts and money managers have
gravitated toward the Internet Capital Group, a b-to-b incubator
that invests in dozens of exchanges and has helped take them
public. It closed on Friday at $38.625, down 81 percent from its
closing high of $200 on Jan. 3. ``We're still with ICG,'' Turner
said. ``If b-to-b is to survive, ICG will have to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   McCabe, of Merrill Lynch, said he, too, remains bullish on
Internet Capital. But in the short term, he said, the company is
``very dependent on the market sentiment regarding
business-to-business, and the IPO market.'' He has no price target
for the stock but rates it buy-accumulate.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of companies that sell software to the exchanges were
also battered in the spring sell-off. Ariba shares fell from a high
of $165.50 on March 8 to $54.4375 April 17; they closed on Friday
at $76.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange software companies followed the decline in the
exchanges themselves because they often get a small share of every
transaction completed on exchange sites that use their software.
When GM and Ford indicated that they might not accept such a
revenue-sharing model for their proposed exchange, investors feared
that the exchange software companies would end up like, well,
ordinary software companies, searching for reliable, recurring
revenue streams.
</P>
<P>
   However, Scott Phillips, an analyst with CIBC World Markets,
said he expected Ariba to get a share of exchange revenues
regardless _ if not from a per-transaction fee then from a share of
flat fees that exchange participants will likely pay in the future.
Such recurring revenue, Phillips said, gives the company ``a
compelling business model.'' He has a 12-month price target of $150
on Ariba. &QL;

ISRAELI SPY INQUIRY FINDS NOTHING, OFFICIALS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   (ADDS 7 grafs after optional trim)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal authorities conducted a highly
classified espionage investigation into whether Israeli
intelligence agents used a software company in Missouri to
intercept telephone conversations from the White House, the State
Department and other agencies, government officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The counterintelligence inquiry did not find evidence that
government telephone systems were penetrated, the officials said.
The investigation focused on Amdocs Corp., a publicly traded
corporation founded by Israelis, but failed to unearth evidence
that anyone at the company or connected to it had tried to listen
to government communications illegally, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just weren't any facts to support a penetration,''
said a government official who closely followed the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of the inquiry emerged Friday after Insight
Magazine, which is published by The Washington Times, reported that
the investigation had uncovered a security breach in the White
House telephone system. Other news organizations quickly spread the
story over their Web sites, but the accusation of a major espionage
problem collapsed almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials denied the account, and their comments
were immediately followed by denials from representatives of other
intelligence, national security and law-enforcement agencies. These
officials confirmed that an inquiry had been carried out, but said
that it had led nowhere and was currently inactive, although as one
official put it, ``You can never say `never' in these things.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials also denied that the Israeli government had
intercepted phone conversations of U.S. officials. A spokesman for
the Israeli Embassy was quoted by The Associated Press as saying,
``I don't listen even to the phone conversations of my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel does not spy on the United States,'' the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ginsburg, a spokesman for Amdocs, said Friday night that the
company was unaware of any FBI investigation ``until we heard about
it from reporters last evening.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that,'' Ginsburg said, ``we'd welcome the opportunity
to work with any investigators or any investigation from any kind.
We have not been contacted by the FBI or any other government
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began several years ago as an offshoot from
another inquiry at the State Department. That inquiry prompted
law-enforcement and intelligence officials to suspect that Israeli
spies might be capable of using technology that was so
sophisticated that they could overhear conversations of specific
U.S. officials in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation shifted to the White House in September 1998
when Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, reported in
his impeachment referral to Congress that the Israelis might have
listened to amorous conversations between President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky. The White House and the Israelis dismissed the
reports.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The accusations resurfaced in March 1999. Gordon Thomas wrote in
a book about the Israeli intelligence service, ``Gideon's Spies:
The Secret History of the Mossad,'' that the Israelis had
eavesdropped on hours of intimate phone calls between Clinton and
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The book said the Israeli secret service ``pondered how to use
the highly embarrassing taped conversations; they were the stuff of
blackmail, though no one suggested any attempt should be made to
blackmail the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials again denied the account.
 &UR;  &LR; In using office telephones, top officials conduct conversations
over unsecure phones, which can be tapped by outsiders, and secure
phones that use sophisticated electronic scrambling techniques to
deter eavesdropping. Most conversations are held over open phones,
which were the ones that the authorities feared might have been
compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Amdocs is the world's largest telecommunications billing
services company, providing software that allows phone companies to
prepare bills for millions of customers.
</P>
<P>
   With $600 million in revenues in 1999, the company has been
listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1998. Its clients
include Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Sprint and Vodafone AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   The company operates in 20 countries, and its research and
development operation is based in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Amdocs provides billing software to Bell Atlantic, which
provides the phone systems to government buildings, including the
White House and the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg said he doubted that the company even had the
technological capability to eavesdrop, in real time, to phone
conversations of it clients' subscribers.

BITING BACK: STARS TAKE 3-1 SERIES LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Joe Nieuwendyk spoke quietly about missed
chances and frustration before Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   He hadn't scored since Game 1. Not good since scoring is what
the Stars expect him to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' he said, ``you are judged on what you put in the
net.''
</P>
<P>
   What Nieuwendyk put in the net Friday night were the Stars'
final two goals, including the game-winner, in their 5-4 victory
against the San Jose Sharks in Game 4 of the Western Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels good obviously,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I look forward
from here on in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are one victory away from a rematch of last season's
Western Conference Finals with the Colorado Avalanche, who defeated
the Detroit Red Wings in five games. The Stars could do so with a
victory in Game 5, scheduled for Sunday in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   To do so Friday night, the Stars had to survive four blown
leads, more ill-advised penalties, another gritty performance by
the Sharks' Owen Nolan and a mini-meltdown by goalie Ed Belfour in
the third period.
</P>
<P>
   They did so with excellent penalty killing, another superb
performance by center Mike Modano, and Belfour bailing himself out
of his own jam. He finished with 31 saves, nine of them after his
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he composed himself really well,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``What really settled him down is when they were on
the power play he made some big saves. ... A couple of years ago,
we would've had a pretty good mess on our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Referees whistled Belfour for roughing at 3:03 of the third
period. Thirty-seven seconds later, he did it again. The Sharks had
one minute and 23 seconds of a 4-on-3 power play. They didn't get a
shot. They had 37 seconds of 5-on-4 with Belfour making great saves
on Patrick Marleau and Alexander Korolyuk to preserve the Stars'
5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might have been the best thing for him,'' Stars captain
Derian Hatcher said. ``(Belfour) told me before the game he didn't
feel great. So maybe it was good. He was great in the third
period.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Belfour: ``Sometimes you need that (something like the
penalties). It gets you into the game a little more. I've always
been that way when things aren't going that well.''
</P>
<P>
   Four times before, the Stars took leads. Four times, they lost
them.
</P>
<P>
   The last lead, the one they didn't lose, came on a pretty play
between Jamie Langenbrunner and Nieuwendyk, who beat everybody up
the ice, took a pass from Langenbrunner in the circle and put the
puck past Sharks goalie Steve Shields at 18:07 of the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said before the game that he thought Nieuwendyk was
due to break out and be make a difference in the series.
</P>
<P>
   But not even he could've predicted this.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a smart guy,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I was pushing hard, and
it paid off with a couple of goals.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game Hitchcock called ``pivotal'' and ``as big of a game as
we've played for a while,'' the Stars' best players _ for the most
part _ delivered. In a series in which scoring goals had been a
problem, the Stars' forwards solved it.
</P>
<P>
   The lead they all followed, though, was once again Modano's.
</P>
<P>
   He scored 68 seconds into the first period to extend his streak
of playoff games with a point streak to a career-high eight, the
longest current streak in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   So began the back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   See if you can keep up.
</P>
<P>
   With Nieuwendyk and Hatcher both in the penalty box, a flashback
to Game 3, Sharks center Vincent Damphousse scored at 8:52 of the
first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' penalty kill answered when Guy Carbonneau took a pass
from Mike Keane on a 2-on-1 to give the Stars a 2-1 lead at 10:21
of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks tied the score with two minutes and 26 seconds left
in the first period as Sharks center Mike Ricci scored from the
edge of the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars responded with another short-handed goal. It was
defenseman Sergei Zubov this time. He took a pass from Modano and
pumped it in 56 seconds into the second period with Hatcher in the
box. The Sharks were 2-for-7 with a man advantage Friday night, but
allowed the Stars two short-handed goals as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks tied the game at 3-all with a short-handed goal of
their own. Nolan beat Hatcher in a foot race down the ice and put
the puck into the far corner of the net at 7:48 of the second
period. No lead, however, was safe. Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk took a shot from the point that Hull tipped, Morrow took
a swipe, and Nieuwendyk buried at 10:52 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks finally scored a non 5-on-3 power play goal at 14:08
of the second period when former Stars winger Todd Harvey snuck
behind the Stars players and went five-hole on Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be better defensively,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``And we
certainly don't want to come back here for Game 6.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us back to Nieuwendyk's game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't say he'd score it. Nieuwendyk doesn't have any Joe
Namath in him. All he said before Game 4 was he'd be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's putting the puck in the net, it makes our team go,''
Stars winger Blake Sloan said.
</P>
<P>
   Which, in the end, is how he really should be judged. nn

OUT-OF-CHARACTER STYLE SUITS STARS

   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ What the heck was that? Instead of a Dallas
Stars' kind of playoff game, it might as well have been Arena
League football. Or maybe the Roller Derby. Hully-gully hockey is a
foreign factor in the Ken Hitchcock scheme. Showtime is almost
never dough-time for the button-downed Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ...
</P>
<P>
   After Friday night on the West Coast, step out in the yard this
morning, and look due northwest from any vantage point in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That jagged outline way off in the distance, it has to be the
Rocky Mountains. The Western Conference finals are coming, and the
Colorado Avalanche earned the right to be there again Friday night,
completing a surprising quick kill of the Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   And now, despite being totally out of character in this Game 4,
the Stars are all but ready for a rematch of last year's thrilling
head-knocker with the Avalanche. San Jose, which never goes easy,
is on the verge of going away.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-4 victory by the Stars tells the story, just by the goal
count. These two clubs are 1-0, 2-1 kind of outfits.
</P>
<P>
   But as Joe Nieuwendyk welcomed himself back to the playoffs with
two goals, the Stars never trailed nor led by more than one goal.
You want defensive breakdowns, stupid penalties, and even almost a
return to Eddie Belfour's old ways of coming unglued in crunch time
... well, Belfour and the Stars were guilty of all that.
</P>
<P>
   But Nieuwendyk gave Mike Modano an offensive alternative, and in
the end that was the most important difference. Many goals were
needed, many were scored.
</P>
<P>
   And for an added bonus, there's not a Stars fan alive who
couldn't appreciate one special first period moment. Bryan
Marchment, in great pain, was unable to make it to the San Jose
bench, and also unable to slow Mike Keane, who was going to dump
the puck on a penalty kill, only to spot the wounded Marchment.
</P>
<P>
   Keane wheeled around the big lug, as two other Sharks rushed to
cover for Marchment. That left Guy Carbonneau free to whistle
unchecked down the other side of the San Jose zone. Keane's feed
was perfect, and Guy nailed a hummer past Steve Shields, the
short-handed goal giving the Stars a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, a disgusted and hurting Marchment stumbled toward
the bench after the goal, tried to leave for the dressing room, but
collapsed next to a water cooler. He wouldn't return. While
Marchment appeared to be dragging a knee, the Sharks announced a
groin injury. Whatever, something was hurting, and bad. In all
North Texas precincts, that's a beautiful thing.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes, however, to Hitchcock's version of a beautiful
thing, he wants a tight-checking, defensively sound performance for
82 regular season games. In the playoffs, you can double that
Hitchcock command.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are normally so good at following this Hitchcock game
plan, they wear the national label of boring. They also wear
Stanley Cup championship rings because of that style..
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, none of it applied. Not the discipline of
Hitchcock's system, and certainly not the label of boring.
Everything the Stars aren't supposed to do, they did. But the one
thing the Stars wanted most of all, they also did. Nothing else
mattered as long as there was a win in Game 4, meaning a big tilt
in the series.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars took the chartered flight home in the wee hours,
winging all the way back to Texas with a 3-1 advantage, and gunning
for the close-out of San Jose on Sunday night at Reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, the Stars don't win when the two best defensemen,
Derian Hatcher and Sergei Zubov, commit critical turnovers that
lead to goals. At least, however, when Zubov lost the puck behind
the Dallas net Friday night, it was a forced error and a good
defensive play by the Sharks' Marco Strum. Hatcher, who had his
worst playoff game in a while, simply bobbled the puck at the blue
line, and the always persistent Owen Nolan scooped it up, beating
Belfour while the Sharks were shorthanded.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Stars' penalty kill unit had two short-handed
goals of its own, as San Jose also went into an unusual defensive
funk.
</P>
<P>
   But the goal that counted the most came from Nieuwendyk late in
the second period, and while it was 5-on-5, the Sharks again were a
defensive mess. Kirk Muller carried the puck across the blue line,
got it to Jamie Langenbrunner in the circle and Jamie slid it to
Nieuwendyk, who rolled in unchecked on Shields.
</P>
<P>
   With Friday night's game, Nieuwendyk doubled his goal total for
the playoffs, and now has three.
</P>
<P>
   A hairy moment for the Stars came in the third period when
Belfour was twice called for roughing penalties. Nolan was
pestering Eddie all night, verbally and otherwise, and it appeared
to be taking a toll on Belfour. But Eddie responded on those power
plays, and was in total control of both himself and the Sharks down
the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   `'It was wild,'' said a smiling Hitchcock afterward. But with
the win, he could actually accept wild, at least for one night. nn

   WASHINGTON _ Having put in a magnificent performance as a
stand-up comic at last weekend's White House correspondents'
dinner, President Bill Clinton was back on deadly serious form on
May 2, tackling two of America's most worrying problems: the glass
ceiling that prevents parents from rising to the top at work, and
the difficulty of raising teenagers. All those honest folk who once
had to choose between climbing the greasy pole or weaning their
daughters off Black Sabbath will now be able to get the best of
both worlds _ and sue if anybody tries to stop them. &QL;

   ANNAPOLIS, MD. _ Is the high-tech party over, as Nasdaq bucks
and slides? Not if messing about in boats is any indication. Over
the past two years, yachting and power-boating have taken off in a
big way, particularly among the techies of the Pacific Northwest.
Total sales in the American recreational boating market were up
more than 19 percent in 1999. The link between boating and
confidence in laptop land appears to be a strong one. Despite the
travails of Nasdaq, larger purchases are still holding up; when the
high-tech admirals start leaving their vessels at the pier, it may
be time to bail out. &QL;

   XAI-XAI _ Two months after horrifically devastating flood waters
destroyed a large part of the country, Mozambique is asking for
$450 million to rebuild roads, homes and lives. The government held
a joint summit with aid agencies in Rome on May 3 and 4 to extract
pledges of outside help while memories are fresh. It will be money
well spent. Helped by the donations already received, Mozambicans
have been working hard to rebuild their battered country. A
generous injection of charitable liquidity could well restore it
rapidly to health. &QL;

Sam, the help he needed in New Jersey. Sam is autistic, and his

is the likely key to a momentous decision that will ultimately come
before the U.S. Congress: whether to take down the Snake River dams
altogether. That once-unthinkable idea has emerged in several

restoring healthy salmon runs. But many people bitterly oppose that
plan as an assault on the area's agricultural economy. By Sam Howe

   WASHINGTON _ Having put in a magnificent performance as a
stand-up comic at last weekend's White House correspondents'

May 2, tackling two of America's most worrying problems: the glass
ceiling that prevents parents from rising to the top at work, and
the difficulty of raising teenagers. All those honest folk who once
had to choose between climbing the greasy pole or weaning their
daughters off Black Sabbath will now be able to get the best of

Total sales in the American recreational boating market were up

confidence in laptop land appears to be a strong one. Despite the

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   BEIRUT _ It has begun. It was only a convoy of trucks, a pile of
communications equipment and a few occupation soldiers. But the
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon _ so desired by Israel, so
hated by Lebanon unless it is accompanied by a retreat from the
Golan Heights _ is now underway.
</P>
<P>
   At the hilltop at Taibe, so frequently attacked by Hezbollah
guerrillas, 85 Israeli soldiers simply climbed onto their trucks
and headed south Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them were redeployed elsewhere in the 10 percent of
Lebanon still occupied by Israel. But another few square meters of
land were given up.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the Israelis pulled out of two of their
positions in the Bekaa Valley and escorted their increasingly
demoralized ``South Lebanon Army'' militiamen out of their bunkers,
blowing up the bunkers as they departed.
</P>
<P>
   At their three revetments Tuesday, they simply bulldozed the
earthworks flat before the astonished gaze of a few local Lebanese
who have lived under Israeli occupation for almost a quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the Israelis blasted their way into Lebanon. In 1982,
they did the same again, with 40,000 troops and more than 17,000
dead, most of them Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But they withdrew like mice Tuesday, leaving before dawn, in
silence and in secret. One of the positions was only a few hundred
yards from the Israeli frontier to which the Israelis _ so they say
_ will all have retreated by July.
</P>
<P>
   But will they? In at least four locations in southern Lebanon,
the Israelis have moved their frontier wire forward _ a ``technical
fence' as the United Nations like to call it in their ingratiating
way _ and there are no signs that these strips of land will be
handed back to Lebanon when the Israeli retreat has finished.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there the slightest sign that the retreat will be a
peaceful one.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement with Syria and a concomitant pullout from
Golan _ for which Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has already
apportioned funds for further Jewish settlements _ the bulk of the
Israeli army will have to fight its way out of Lebanon in the late
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is activity all the time and this is part of the
preparation for the withdrawal,'' an Israeli army spokesman said in
Tel Aviv. But this is unlikely to save the occupation army.
</P>
<P>
   To withdraw even a thousand men could mean the temporary
insertion of a brigade _ a prime target for the Hezbollah whose
wire-guided missiles are now cutting through the toughest armored
skin of Israel's Merkava tanks.
</P>
<P>
   And if Israel's army is under fire, its air force will wreak its
usual retaliation. Israel's foreign minister has already told
Lebanon _ a country with which it reportedly wants to make peace _
that its land will ``burn'' if rockets fall on northern Israel;
which they will if Israel kills Lebanese civilians during its
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, France and the U.N. are already issuing their
usual calls for restraint _ appeals that usually mean it is time to
put on flak jackets _ while the halfhearted promise from the
Lebanese prime minister that U.N. forces will have to fill the
``security vacuum'' left behind has reassured no one.
</P>
<P>
   Only a week ago, a Hezbollah suicide bomber blew up a truck next
to an Israeli post inside southern Lebanon, wounding three SLA men
and virtually demolishing the gun battery. It could well be a sign
of things to come. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ It has begun. It was only a convoy of trucks, a pile of
communications equipment and a few occupation soldiers. But the
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon _ so desired by Israel, so
hated by Lebanon unless it is accompanied by a retreat from the
Golan Heights _ is now underway.
</P>
<P>
   At the hilltop at Taibe, so frequently attacked by Hezbollah
guerrillas, 85 Israeli soldiers simply climbed onto their trucks
and headed south Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them were redeployed elsewhere in the 10 percent of
Lebanon still occupied by Israel. But another few square meters of
land were given up.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the Israelis pulled out of two of their
positions in the Bekaa Valley and escorted their increasingly
demoralized ``South Lebanon Army'' militiamen out of their bunkers,
blowing up the bunkers as they departed.
</P>
<P>
   At their three revetments Tuesday, they simply bulldozed the
earthworks flat before the astonished gaze of a few local Lebanese
who have lived under Israeli occupation for almost a quarter of a
century.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the Israelis blasted their way into Lebanon. In 1982,
they did the same again, with 40,000 troops and more than 17,000
dead, most of them Lebanese civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But they withdrew like mice Tuesday, leaving before dawn, in
silence and in secret. One of the positions was only a few hundred
yards from the Israeli frontier to which the Israelis _ so they say
_ will all have retreated by July.
</P>
<P>
   But will they? In at least four locations in southern Lebanon,
the Israelis have moved their frontier wire forward _ a ``technical
fence' as the United Nations like to call it in their ingratiating
way _ and there are no signs that these strips of land will be
handed back to Lebanon when the Israeli retreat has finished.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there the slightest sign that the retreat will be a
peaceful one.
</P>
<P>
   Without an agreement with Syria and a concomitant pullout from
Golan _ for which Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has already
apportioned funds for further Jewish settlements _ the bulk of the
Israeli army will have to fight its way out of Lebanon in the late
spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is activity all the time and this is part of the
preparation for the withdrawal,'' an Israeli army spokesman said in
Tel Aviv. But this is unlikely to save the occupation army.
</P>
<P>
   To withdraw even a thousand men could mean the temporary
insertion of a brigade _ a prime target for the Hezbollah whose
wire-guided missiles are now cutting through the toughest armored
skin of Israel's Merkava tanks.
</P>
<P>
   And if Israel's army is under fire, its air force will wreak its
usual retaliation. Israel's foreign minister has already told
Lebanon _ a country with which it reportedly wants to make peace _
that its land will ``burn'' if rockets fall on northern Israel;
which they will if Israel kills Lebanese civilians during its
withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, France and the U.N. are already issuing their
usual calls for restraint _ appeals that usually mean it is time to
put on flak jackets _ while the halfhearted promise from the
Lebanese prime minister that U.N. forces will have to fill the
``security vacuum'' left behind has reassured no one.
</P>
<P>
   Only a week ago, a Hezbollah suicide bomber blew up a truck next
to an Israeli post inside southern Lebanon, wounding three SLA men
and virtually demolishing the gun battery. It could well be a sign
of things to come. &QL;

   (UNDATED) _ The murder last week of Zika Petrovic, head of the
Yugoslav airline JAT, has set the rumor mill working in Belgrade.
But rumors and conspiracy theories are so thick on the ground that
it seems unlikely that anybody will ever know for certain who was
responsible for his death.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade is one of the most violent cities in Europe, where
assassinations have become almost par for the course.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the republics and provinces in former Yugoslavia have
been directly exposed to the violence of war in the past decade of
President Slobodan Milosevic's rule.
</P>
<P>
   On the territory of Serbia, excluding Kosovo, there has been no
war. There is, however, an increasing sense of anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   This year alone, those who have died have included several of
the most important figures in Belgrade. The paramilitary leader
Zeljko Raznatovic, better known as Arkan, was killed in January.
The Yugoslavian defense minister, Pavle Bulatovic, was shot dead in
a restaurant the following month.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the deaths cluster together, like in a real-life
version of ``The Godfather.'' Branislav Lainovic, a paramilitary
leader, was gunned down on March 20; two other members of the
underworld were killed three days later, while returning from his
funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, those who died included a Belgrade police chief and a
newspaper editor. The death of Petrovic _ shot dead while walking
his dog _ is merely the latest in a long line.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's assassination of newspaper editor Slavko Curuvija is
widely assumed to have been a political revenge killing on behalf
of Milosevic, who had many reasons to be offended by what Curuvija,
a former friend of the Milosevic family, had published in his
increasingly outspoken paper, the Dnevni Telegraf.
</P>
<P>
   The other deaths, however, are much murkier to explain.
Politics, the black market and the violent underworld overlap so
much in Serbia that it is hard to disentangle all the strands.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's son, Marko, has profited enormously from a string of
smuggling operations, especially with gasoline and cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions against Yugoslavia that were imposed during the
Bosnian war made life much more difficult for ordinary Yugoslavs _
but also provided rich pickings for those who were involved in the
import of forbidden products, and could sell them on at a huge
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can be in any doubt that to cross Marko's path is
dangerous. But many in the Belgrade establishment are almost
equally keen to make money for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Petrovic was a close associate of Milosevic, and was born in the
president's hometown of Zarevac. The Serbian media promptly
described his death as a ``terrorist'' killing, when he was
murdered just a few hundred yards from the police headquarters in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there can be no question that this was the work of
professional hitmen: the gunmen used silencers, and no one was
aware of the city-center killing until passersby found the body.
</P>
<P>
   Petrovic _ who was a member of the JUL party which is controlled
by Milosevic's wife, Mira Markovic _ may have been killed because
he got his hands too dirty, or because he refused to get his hands
dirty, or because he got his hands dirty without sharing the
spoils.
</P>
<P>
   In modern Serbia, any of those can be a lethal crime.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he announced the privatization of JAT, which has
just received permission to fly to European destinations once more.
</P>
<P>
   It is universally assumed in the Balkans that the huge profits
for individuals involved in such privatizations are much greater
than the benefit to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Outside bogeymen are sometimes blamed for the deaths. But
Belgrade has plenty of home-grown killers. Few Serbs believe a
convincing suspect will ever be tried for killing Petrovic. Nor do
they believe he will be the last prominent member of the
establishment to die a violent death. &QL;

<P>
   Should the United Nations have an army?
</P>
<P>
   The 8,000-strong peacekeeping force in blue berets in Sierra
Leone is not powerful enough to take on and defeat the rebel forces
should they decide to resume full-scale civil war. Its role is to
police last year's peace agreement between the democratically
elected government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Seven peacekeepers have been killed, however, and now 50 have
been taken prisoner, as they are dragged into increasingly direct
military confrontation with the bandit army of Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that the U.N. will find itself in a Bosnian
situation _ at best observing; at worst caught up in a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   So, should the U.N. engage more forcefully in this desperately
poor African country to protect its people from the rebels who are
living off the diamonds that are Sierra Leone's main natural
resource? Of course it should, if it can, but the issue is hardly
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   The usual model would be for the U.N. to approve intervention by
a concerned regional power. That is, indeed, how the rebels were
ousted and the legitimate government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah restored
two years ago _ by Nigerian forces assisted by British mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did that cause a little domestic difficulty for British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who said he did not know what his
subordinates were up to, but it meant relying on the Nigerian
military dictatorship, which has many previous convictions for
human-rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Nigerians cannot do it, who can? After the United
States's ill-fated attempt to intervene in Somalia in the early
1990s, direct involvement by Western forces under a U.N. mandate
seems unwise.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative would be for the U.N. to have greater military
forces supplied by member countries but under U.N. command and able
to engage in peacemaking rather than just peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But despite brave talk after the Kosovo war by Britain and other
Western nations providing units for a U.N. rapid-deployment force,
it is hard to see how a credible multinational force can be
anything other than several years away.
</P>
<P>
   The way forward in Sierra Leone, therefore, is bound to be one
of messy compromises, both with the rebel leaders and with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. is right to increase the peacekeeping force to 11,000
troops, but they cannot be expected to fight the Sierra Leoneans'
civil war for them.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair and Cook need to be more explicit
about why Britain cannot always do ``what it takes,'' which is what
Blair promised in Kosovo, to right every injustice in the world. &QL;

resource? Of course it should, if it can, but the issue is hardly
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   The usual model would be for the U.N. to approve intervention by
a concerned regional power. That is, indeed, how the rebels were
ousted and the legitimate government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah restored
two years ago _ by Nigerian forces assisted by British mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did that cause a little domestic difficulty for British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who said he did not know what his
subordinates were up to, but it meant relying on the Nigerian
military dictatorship, which has many previous convictions for
human-rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Nigerians cannot do it, who can? After the United
States's ill-fated attempt to intervene in Somalia in the early
1990s, direct involvement by Western forces under a U.N. mandate
seems unwise.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative would be for the U.N. to have greater military
forces supplied by member countries but under U.N. command and able
to engage in peacemaking rather than just peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   But despite brave talk after the Kosovo war by Britain and other
Western nations providing units for a U.N. rapid-deployment force,
it is hard to see how a credible multinational force can be
anything other than several years away.
</P>
<P>
   The way forward in Sierra Leone, therefore, is bound to be one
of messy compromises, both with the rebel leaders and with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. is right to increase the peacekeeping force to 11,000
troops, but they cannot be expected to fight the Sierra Leoneans'
civil war for them.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair and Cook need to be more explicit
about why Britain cannot always do ``what it takes,'' which is what
Blair promised in Kosovo, to right every injustice in the world. &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ed Moose knew the cell-phone craze had gone too
far when one customer at his trendy San Francisco restaurant picked
up the phone to talk to another customer sitting at the other end
of the bar.
</P>
<P>
   It was hardly the first instance of such behavior to hit this
city _ capital, after all, of the world digital revolution. Moose
knew of other restaurants where three or four customers at a single
table would be deep in conversation, not with each other but with
their separate interlocuters on the other end of the line.
</P>
<P>
   This was more than Moose could stand, so he took action. He was
sick of the constant chirping emanating from the bowels of
handbags, the sight of customers gesticulating into empty space
with one hand while clamping the other to their right ear, so he
decided to ban cell phones from his establishment altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see it coming and I wanted to stop it before it became
bad,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Moose's restaurant is a hot spot for the movers
and shakers of San Francisco's political and media worlds, many of
whom like to wear mobiles on their hip just like gunfighters with
their weapons in the Old West; the cellular crowd has now been
banished to the pavement, along with that other group of
Californian outcasts, the smokers.
</P>
<P>
   And Moose's establishment is hardly alone in taking a stand.
Several other restaurants in San Francisco, and in Silicon Valley
an hour's drive to the south, have already taken similar steps.
</P>
<P>
   Golf clubs, country clubs, San Francisco's celebrated ACT
theatre, the Museum of Modern Art, even a Silicon Valley branch of
Alcoholics Anonymous have all told mobile-phone users to switch off
or get lost.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, pressure is increasing to ban cell-phone use in cars
_ there has already been one attempt to push legislation through
the state assembly and another attempt may not be far off.
</P>
<P>
   At least one host on San Francisco's public radio station, KQED,
has told listeners he won't take their calls if they are in their
cars and moving.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a total backlash going on,'' said Carolanne Lynch, bar
manager at Dine, a restaurant in San Francisco's so-called
Multimedia Gulch area where everyone has a cell phone but nobody is
allowed to use them any more.
</P>
<P>
   If the backlash is beginning in San Francisco (there is nothing
comparable going on even in Los Angeles, 400 miles to the south),
it is partly because it is the epicenter of cell-phone use in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 15 percent of America's 90 million mobile
subscribers are in California, and well over half of those are in
the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   But it also speaks to San Francisco's rebellious nature and the
deep social divisions that the dot.com revolution has created.
</P>
<P>
   Only in a city as contrary as San Francisco would the mayor,
Willie Brown, declare his undying hatred of mobile phones and even
claim not to have one. (The claim has been skeptically received,
but the point is well taken).
</P>
<P>
   ``Three times this one guy's goddamn cell phone went off,''
Brown fumed last week following a much-interrupted press conference
on affordable housing. ``I think the state of California has got to
do something.''
</P>
<P>
   His erstwhile challenger for the mayoralty, the San Francisco
Board of Supervisors' president, Tom Ammiano, would agree. He has
stipulated that people attending his meetings do as he does and
switch their mobiles off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rude. It's self-centered and somewhat pretentious, I'd
say,'' Ammiano said. ``Particularly annoying are the little musical
numbers. I really don't want to hear `Row row row your boat' when
we're taking testimony about someone being evicted. It trivializes
the whole democratic process of a committee or board meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudeness isn't the only problem. Mobiles cause traffic accidents
and, as a result, cost the city money it resents having to spend.
</P>
<P>
   One intersection where a mobile-wielding driver killed a
pedestrian recently has been kitted out with special smart lights
that flash on the asphalt when a pedestrian steps onto the
crossing.
</P>
<P>
   When the lights were inaugurated last month, Brown made sure he
was there to lord over the proceedings. In San Francisco, embracing
hi-tech lights is good politics; whipping out a mobile _ in the
street, in your car, over lunch _ has become a big no-no. &QL;

DOWN 15-7, RANGERS' RALLY SETS CLUB RECORD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas Rangers pitcher John Wetteland has 299
saves in major-league baseball games. Friday night he got his first
victory in a major-league slow-pitch softball game.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland was the only pitcher left unscathed when Mike Lamb
lined a one-out bases-loaded single to deep center in the bottom of
the ninth to give the Rangers a 17-16 victory over the Oakland
Athletics at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   Lamb's base hit capped the biggest rally and one of the most
incredible games in Rangers history. By any standard _ American
League, juiced ball or otherwise _ this one defied belief.
</P>
<P>
   All the Rangers know is they rallied from being down 15-7 with
10 runs in the final three innings to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was crazy,'' Rangers starter Darren Oliver said.
``I've never seen a game like that. It was wild. The only thing you
can say is you're glad you won. If you score 16 runs and lost it
... wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis started the winning rally with a single to left
against losing pitcher Jeff Tam and was forced at second by Ivan
Rodriguez's grounder. Rafael Palmeiro then drew a walk, and Ruben
Mateo reached when Tam bobbled his grounder for an error.
</P>
<P>
   With the bases loaded and one out, Oakland manager Art Howe went
with a five-man infield, but Lamb foiled the strategy with a drive
to deep center beyond the reach of the remaining two outfielders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those games, last one up, wins it,''
Palmeiro said. ``It would not have been a good one to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most amazing was both teams were playing with depleted
lineups. The Athletics were missing Matt Stairs, John Jaha and
Randy Velarde _ all injured _ and the Rangers had David Segui
(strained hip flexor) join their list of wounded that already
includes Rusty Greer, Gabe Kapler and Frank Catalanotto.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers and Athletics even outdid one of the local
slow-pitch softball leagues. As of 10:30 p.m. Friday night,
Softball World in nearby Euless had completed 22 slow-pitch games
and the most scored in any one game was 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look up there and you just don't do that,'' manager Johnny
Oates said. ``I don't care how much fight you have in you, you just
don't come back from a deficit like that. But that's proof I lied
because we just did that.''
</P>
<P>
   All 18 starting offensive players scored at least one run, the
first time that's been done in American League history. It tied a
1996 26-7 victory over Baltimore for most runs scored by two teams
ever in a Rangers game. There were 37 hits and 13 walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm exhausted,'' said first baseman Scott Sheldon, whose
single in the eighth scored two and tied it at 16-16. ``You hear
about teams that have done stuff like come back from being 10 runs
down but I've never been a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez started the comeback with a home run in the seventh
off Oakland reliever Luis Vizcaino. Run-scoring singles by Tom
Evans and Luis Alicea later in inning made it 15-10.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Zimmerman gave up a homer in the top of the eighth to
Terrance Long, but the Rangers were hardly daunted. They just came
back with six more in the bottom of the inning. They started the
inning with six straight singles and Jason McDonald's sacrifice
bunt then set up Sheldon's game-tying single.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Pudge hit that homer, then Raffy got that single, I
thought, this game's not over,'' Sheldon said. ``Then, when we got
within four runs, I thought, we've got a shot to win this.''
</P>
<P>
   The unholy mess began with the starting pitchers, especially
Oliver who was given a 5-0 lead in the second inning and couldn't
hold it. Instead he gave up a three-run homer to No. 9 hitter Frank
Menechino in the fourth and a two-run homer to No. 8 hitter Ramon
Hernandez in the fifth, making it a 5-5 game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took a 7-5 lead in the bottom of the fifth but the
Athletics came back for 10 in two innings off reliever Matt
Perisho, who was pitching for the first time in nine days. The fans
showed their displeasure, hardly realizing the fun was only
beginning. nn

PAINFUL ANKLE KEEPS LEHTINEN OFF ICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD AND MAC ENGEL 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Dallas Stars winger Jere Lehtinen is closer
than ever to returning to the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Close, however, wasn't close enough for Game 4. He skated in the
pregame warmup, but didn't play in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he doesn't dress, then he's not able to deal with the
discomfort that is going with the injury,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``The injury (right now) is can he deal with the
discomfort, and that's the area if you can deal with it and know
it's there and play. And if he can't deal with it, we just have to
buy more time.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Stars is Lehtinen's right ankle did feel
strong enough to skate yesterday after a vigorous practice on
Thursday. The Stars made the decision not to play him between the
morning skate and the pregame warmup.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said Lehtinen's ankle, which caused him to miss all
but 17 regular-season games and the nine playoff games, ``is going
to be painful for the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If he can't perform (without worrying about it), we're better
putting somebody else in there,'' Hitchcock said. ``When people do
that, I usually find that's when people get hurt again in a
different area of body.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said they'll wait another day or two, which means
Lehtinen could be ready for Game 5 on Sunday. LANGENBRUNNER RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   While most of the talk of a returning forward focused on Jere
Lehtinen, who didn't play, another Stars forward did make his
return: winger Jamie Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   After missing Game 3 with a bruised shoulder suffered in Game 2,
Langenbrunner was back to his normal line spot, alongside Joe
Nieuwendyk and Scott Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   ``What puts us over the edge in these games is forwards,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   It took a period, but after missing on a combined nine scoring
chances in Games 1 and 2, Langenbrunner cashed in. He had two
assists in the second period, including one on Nieuwendyk's goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my type of series,'' Langenbrunner said.''It's hard to
find ice, and I like those types of situations.''
</P>
<P>
   If Langenbrunner had any fears of hurting his shoulder again, it
didn't show. Through the first 40 minutes he had four hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I liked them a lot better without Langenbrunner,''
Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said. BELFOUR BOILS OVER
</P>
<P>
   Amid a cascade of taunts and Sharks crashing the crease, Stars
goalie Ed Belfour finally had enough, and in the third period he
let it show.
</P>
<P>
   With Sharks wingers Tony Granato and Dave Lowry establishing
position in front of the net, Belfour slammed his forearm into
Granato's face. Both Belfour and Lowry were given penalties at the
3:03 mark of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-seven seconds later, another scrum in front of Belfour
ensued, this time between Stars defenseman Richard Matvichuk and
Sharks forward Owen Nolan. Belfour got into it again and was
awarded a hooking penalty, giving the Sharks a four-on-three, which
the Stars killed. TRIPLE-OT MEMORY
</P>
<P>
   The seven-hour playoff game between the Philadelphia Flyers and
Pittsburgh Penguins on Thursday night had the Stars' remembering
their late-night playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they won the Stanley Cup in triple overtime in Game 6
last season in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first overtime you go in and you got the bicycle pump
going and you are pumping up the rah-rah. After that, you don't
even go in the dressing room,'' Ken Hitchcock said. ``I talked to
the team in Buffalo after the second one, and there were six guys
in the dressing room. The rest of the guys were lying on tables out
in the hallways, sitting in the washroom. Your team just
evaporates.'' ANOTHER VOTE FOR BELFOUR
</P>
<P>
   Not that Stars general manager Bob Gainey needed the
reassurance, but Sharks coach Darryl Sutter likes Stars goalie Ed
Belfour better than St. Louis goalie Roman Turek.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks upset the No. 1-seeded Blues in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter was asked what differences he saw between the Stars and
Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depth, more experience definitely top to bottom,'' Sutter
said. ``Better goaltending is the biggest difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Gainey had to decide which player to leave unprotected last
summer for the expansion draft. He ended up trading Turek to the
Blues right before the deadline. The move drew criticism as Turek
and the Blues went on to win the Presidents' Trophy this season.
THE SKINNY ON KEANE
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Mike Keane was teammates with Sharks center Mike
Ricci on the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Ricci remember about Keane?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dessert,'' Ricci said. ``The guy's a skinny little bone rack.
He eats a lot of dessert.'' ZUBOV'S VALUE
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock likes the way Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov has
played since returning to the lineup. He missed the first round
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   There is one problem, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the thing that concerns you is he's made four or five
plays where, quite frankly, if everybody on the ice was awake we
could've scored without the goalie in the net,'' Hitchcock said.
``He surprises the hell out of us.'' MATTER OF POSITIONING
</P>
<P>
   The Stars learned a lesson in location during their Game 3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they had a lot of scoring chances. No, they didn't have
enough chances in front of the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we have to get more things around the net,'' Stars
center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ``We've had some time in their end
where your face is up against the glass and you are holding the
puck in your feet. Somehow, we have to battle through that and get
the puck to the net and beat people off the boards.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock said the Stars changed up some things
strategically to help them get the puck to the front of the net.
The biggest change the Stars needed to make, he said, was work
harder. nn

SHARKS KNOW LOSS AT HOME LEAVES THEM WITH A FORMIDABLE TASK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The San Jose Sharks had an opportunity to
return to Dallas with their Western Conference semifinal with the
Dallas Stars knotted at two games apiece. With Friday night's 5-4
loss, it's do-or-die for the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   The series has taken the same twists as the Stars' first-round
matchup against Edmonton. The Stars closed out that series in five
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the playoffs, it's the start,'' Sharks center Vincent
Damphousse said. ``If you can shut down the home team and silence
the crowd a little bit, that's usually when the home team plays the
best, early on when the juices are flowing and the crowd is getting
behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks are 2-4 on the road in the playoffs, but are no
strangers to big road victories. They took Game 2 and Game 7 in St.
Louis to win that first-round series.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the road you need to play good defense and that gives you a
chance to win,'' Sharks winger Todd Harvey said. ``If you play good
defense, get good gaoltending, then you have a chance to win on the
road. It's not a flashy game; it's a hard-working, grind-it-out
game when you're on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are 4-0 at home in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've played well at home for a long time now so it
doesn't really change,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks now must win three consecutive games, including twice
in Dallas, to win the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never had any doubts that we could beat Dallas,''
Damphousse said. ``It's up to us to make it very interesting.''
RISKY LINE
</P>
<P>
   Sharks coach Darryl Sutter kept his lines intact for the second
consecutive game, keeping left winger Jeff Friesen with Owen Nolan
and Vincent Damphousse.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter continued to use his speed lineup, which includes
20-year-old center Patrick Marleau and young Russian Alexander
Korolyuk on the same line with winger Niklas Sundstrom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little riskier line,'' Sutter said. ``You can probably
get away with it a little more at home.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Sutter has last change, meaning he has the advantage to
match up his lines with the Stars' defense. A SPECIAL GOAL
</P>
<P>
   As long as the Sharks are on a 5-on-3 power play, the
special-teams unit is fine. Vincent Damphousse scored his first
goal of the playoffs and the team's second 5-on-3 goal in as many
games. The goal tied the score at 1-1 at the 8:52 mark of the first
period.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration was short-lived. After the 5-on-3 expired, the
Stars had an odd-man rush and Mike Keane fed a cross-slot pass to
Guy Carbonneau, who beat Shields for a short-handed goal and a 2-1
lead at 10:21. AN EARLY TEST
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks' struggling penalty kill, which had allowed 10 goals
in 10 games, was put to the test early with the Stars already
leading, 1-0. With Bryan Marchment in the penalty box for four
minutes for high-sticking to Aaron Gavey, the Sharks killed the
first two minutes allowing no shots.
</P>
<P>
   After Joe Nieuwendyk got off a weak shot at the goal mouth that
was smothered by Sharks goalie Steve Shields, Nieuwendyk and Sharks
winger Owen Nolan tangled. Nieuwendyk was hauled off to the box for
roughing. The four-on-four ensued for 48 seconds and the Sharks
went on the power play for 1:12. ANOTHER FIRST GOAL
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth consecutive game, the Sharks allowed the Stars to
score the first goal. After surrendering a goal to Mike Modano at
the 3:35 mark of the first period in Game 3, Modano struck again
Friday night. On another assist from Brett Hull, Modano rifled a
one-timer past Steve Shields at the 1:08 mark of the opening
period. BOYS WILL BE BOYS
</P>
<P>
   Stars defenseman and captain Derian Hatcher and Sharks winger
and captain Owen Nolan didn't take long to rile each other. They
pushed and shoved, with Nolan winning the battles. Hatcher was
called for two penalties against Nolan in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher's first penalty, for high-sticking at the 8:31 mark of
the first period, gave the Sharks a five-on-three, resulting in a
Vincent Damphousse goal to tie the game at 1-1. The second, with
less than 10 seconds left in the period, allowed the Sharks to
begin the second period with the man advantage. MARCHMENT INJURED
</P>
<P>
   Sharks defenseman Bryan Marchment left the game with a groin
pull in the first period right after the Stars scored to make it
2-1 and did not return.

STARS SHUFFLE LINES TRYING TO GIVE MODANO SCORING HELP
</HEADLINE>
 LINES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif._ This is what Stars winger Mike Keane wanted:
Moving with the puck toward the net and linemate Guy Carbonneau on
the opposite side.
</P>
<P>
   Keane threaded his pass by three San Jose Sharks to Carbonneau,
who sent a low wrister past Sharks goalie Steve Shields for the
short-handed goal.
</P>
<P>
   That goal, which came at the 10:21 mark of the first period in
Friday night's 5-4 Stars victory snapped a 148:33 streak where all
of the Stars' goals were either by center Mike Modano, or his
linemate, Brenden Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to just be this defensive-minded line,'' Keane
said. ``That's no good during the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Carbonneau's goal, Modano had scored the Stars past three
goals.
</P>
<P>
   The goal marked a degree of immediate success by the Stars
playing the line-shuffle in hopes of adding something that outside
of Modano's line was lacking: Offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why you need the third and fourth lines producing,''
Keane said, ``to take a little pressure off. You score a couple
goals so Joe (Nieuwendyk) gets a little more loose.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk did finally shake loose, scoring two goals in the
second period, and for the first time since Game 1, the Stars
displayed scoring balance throughout their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we can get a line like Modano's that's playing
any better right now,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``We've
played the whole playoffs and won a lot of games with different
people chipping in, but I think we've maxed with what were doing
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to find a different way to get other people to chip
in. Whether it's changing up the third and fourth lines and giving
them a different role, it's a fine line.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Hitchcock's alterations began. Try to follow the
bouncing ball:
</P>
<P>
   Normal fourth-liner Kirk Muller to the checking line with
Carbonneau and Keane.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Langenbrunner to his normal spot on the second line with
Joe Nieuwendyk and Scott Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   Blake Sloan to the fourth line with Roman Lyashenko and Aaron
Gavey, and scratching winger Grant Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate results? Carbonneau's goal, Keane's shot late in
the first period that narrowly missed going into the net, his
short-handed shot late in the second period, and more goals in the
first 32 minutes than they had scored in the previous 120 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At least nine Stars scored points, including Langenbrunner, who
assisted on Sergei Zubov's short-handed goal and one of
Nieuwendyk's second goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would like to think that a good strength of our club is
depth,'' Muller said. ``Everyone knows they can chip in here and
there. No one line is going to carry you. It's important for a mix.
We have to do that and take a little pressure on Modano's line.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, the pressure was off. nn

SHARKS' RICCI A PLAYER FANS LOVE TO HATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Mike Ricci showed Friday night why his
teammates love him and opposing fans hate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every night he's getting into traffic areas, battling in front
of their net, helmet off, hair all over his face,'' teammate Jeff
Norton said of Ricci, always consistent, but suddenly the Sharks'
hottest player in this increasingly heated conference semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just consistency, every night,'' Norton said. ``It's an
82-game season, but it seems like he's always in the middle of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricci, easily identifiable by the long locks of black hair
flowing out the back of his helmet, was again in the middle of
nearly everything Friday night in Game 4 at San Jose Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci, selected Wednesday a Selke Trophy finalist _ awarded to
the league's top defensive forward _ is continuing his best
offensive season (20 goals, 24 assists) since 1993-94 when he had
51 points (30 goals) with Quebec. He scored his second goal in as
many games Friday night to tie a wild, high-energy affair at 2-2 at
the 17:54 mark of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   Where was he? Positioned perfectly at the left side of the
crease when Niklas Sundstrom looked off Stars goalie Ed Belfour in
the slot and assisted Ricci, who flipped the puck into the open
left side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci's name won't be in the box score on the Sharks' first
goal, but his tough work in the crease shielded Belfour and gave
center Vincent Damphousse a shooting lane on a 5-on-3 power play at
the 8:52 mark. That goal tied the game at 1-1. It was almost
identical to Ricci's first goal of the series in Game 3 when he
camped in the crease and redirected a Gary Suter slap shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest strength is he is always in position with his feet
to play the puck,'' Damphousse said. ``He keeps the other player
always in a defensive position. He is a very smart player out
there; he is always thinking and he knows where all the other guys
are on the ice.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharks coach Darryl Sutter called the 1998 trade that brought
Ricci to the Sharks from Colorado, where he won a Stanley Cup in
1996 along with Stars winger Mike Keane, ``the greatest trade the
organization ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   A soft-spoken veteran of 10 years, Ricci is a player opposing
fans love to hate. He's a close second in that distinct category to
Sharks villain Bryan Marchment. Much of that has to do with Ricci's
long hair and scruffy, bad-boy look. Mostly, though, it's his
everyday grittiness and commitment to doing the hard-hat work in
all the difficult places.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to be myself,'' said Ricci, who has five goals in
the playoffs. ``I think people like me when I'm off the ice. On the
ice, I'm not trying to make many friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricci, 28, broke into the NHL with the Philadelphia Flyers in
1991, a team that had Stars coach Ken Hitchcock as an assistant. He
played two seasons with the Flyers before being traded to Quebec,
along with current Avalanche star Peter Forsberg, in exchange for
Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a passionate guy; he wears it on his sleeve,'' Hitchcock
said. ``He's a heck of a player.''
</P>
<P>
   He's doing everything he can to keep the Sharks alive. nn

SONICS FORCED TO SETTLE FOR MORAL VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ Sometimes, a team just gets beat.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, more complicated explanations are thrown about at
season's end.
</P>
<P>
   This guy screwed up. That coach blew a decision. Somebody
choked. And, of course, the referees botched the big calls.
</P>
<P>
   Not this time. Not Game 5 between the Seattle Sonics and Utah
Jazz Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   This went exactly according to form. Two good teams that split
eight previous games in the 1999-2000 season played well, hard and
close. Stars shone, role players were heroic, every play mattered
and the excruciating drama in a vibrating Delta Center drew down to
the final shot.
</P>
<P>
   Boink.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz 96, Sonics 93.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks for the season. G'night, everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't ask them,'' said Sonics coach Paul Westphal of his
team, ``to give any more than they gave.''
</P>
<P>
   As his Utah counterpart, Jerry Sloan, put it: ``The homecourt
advantage was obviously the difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are coaching clich &UR; gfacute &LR; es, but the thoughts become
clich &UR; gfacute &LR; es because they are true. And sometimes there is
nothing more complicated about a basketball came than the plain
truth.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics did not falter from pressure, lapse from the game
plan, or make more than the standard number of mistakes. After five
games over two weeks that included collapse and resurrection, they
were three points short.
</P>
<P>
   As Gary Payton said: ``Shots that didn't fall for them in our
building fell in their building.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Jazz get the anticipated victory, and the Sonics, as the
underdog seventh seed, get the moral victory.
</P>
<P>
   The jock world always likes to say that moral victories don't
mean anything, but the Sonics won something over this fortnight _
credibility and even admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire that in people, when everybody thinks the world is
against them and they fought back,'' said Sloan of the Sonics. ``To
me, that's one of the most important things you can do in sports:
Show that kind of ability to be able to fight, when everybody wants
to take a foot and just step on top of your head.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics had sneaker prints all over their noggins following
losses in the first two games here. They deserved most of them. The
had lost 13 of their past 18 games, and Westphal seemed to be
deriving his lineups from a dartboard.
</P>
<P>
   But in five days off, they fixed a lot of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we left here after Game 2, they were reeling a
bit, didn't quite know what it was that made them a good team,''
said Utah's John Stockton, with whom Payton conducted a splendid
battle between true warriors. ``They were a very good team
throughout the rest of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter Friday, the game appeared to get away from
the Sonics. When the Jazz lead ballooned to 72-59 and the Jazz
fans' mocking chant of ``Ga-ry! Ga-ry!'' rocked the joint, the
Sonics went on a 24-12 run to make it a game the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of watching the Sonics disintegrate during that stretch,
it was the Jazz who got emotional and foolish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was driving Jerry crazy,'' said Stockton. ``When we got
excited about the lead, we forced the issue and missed some fast
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Jazz had no killer instinct, there was one development
that broke form and turned the game: Olden Polynice.
</P>
<P>
   Olden Polynice!
</P>
<P>
   The two-time ex-Sonic, the guy who would be voted least likely
to do a worthwhile thing, was the hero. The center with the worst
hands in the NBA did the unexpected: He caught the ball and put in
in the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Six times, ending up with 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   In the Sonics' two-game turnaround, the newly installed trapping
defense largely counted on the ball ending up in the hands of
Polynice or his backup, the often-befuddled Greg Ostertag.
Typically, they would heave the ball into the Great Salt Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Said Westphal: ``They found a fifth player in Olden.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, however, how it often happens in the NBA postseason: A
minor miracle from an unheralded player. The Sonics received solid
games from nearly everyone, but didn't get the unexpected
contribution, something from somewhere that would negate homecourt
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   If that is their biggest shortcoming, the Sonics can consider
their return to the playoffs after a one-year absence a relative
success. Some will argue with the selection of Chuck Person for the
final shot, given that he hadn't played for the Sonics since he
weighed under 270 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that he ended up with a clean, undefended shot from
straight on, and missed the game-tying trey by about three inches,
suggested that not much better could have been achieved, since the
entire state of Utah was stationed beyond the arc.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics did not resolve all their woes in one week. But they
did make matters exciting, and offered a glimpse of a future that
includes contention.
</P>
<P>
   Given where they were 12 days ago, the turnaround is nearly as
amazing as the vision of Polynice the Conqueror.

MARINERS' BATS COME ALIVE TOO LATE AGAINST ANAHEIM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Mariners had no shortage of fall guys Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of a 6-5 loss to Anaheim that dropped the Mariners
into a tie with the Angels for the AL West lead, starting pitcher
Aaron Sele and center fielder Mike Cameron kicked themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have won that game,'' Sele said. ``You don't have to
look any further than the starting pitcher for a reason why we
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   For seven innings, Sele allowed just two runs, and although the
Mariners were behind, 2-0, they weren't out of the game. Then, with
two out and a man on second base, Sele faltered.
</P>
<P>
   He threw a 2-2 fastball so fat the ball needed extra stitching.
He threw it to exactly the wrong guy. Tim Salmon had doubled twice
on similar pitches early in the game. This time, Salmon homered,
and the Angels went on to score three two-out runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make it very difficult for him at all,'' Sele said.
``I gave him a good pitch to hit. I pitched a good game for seven
innings, but you can't give up three runs in the eighth after two
men are out.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the Mariners had scratched out four runs in the
bottom of the eighth, Cameron got fooled, then felled, by a
catchable Darin Erstad line drive in the top of the ninth. Erstad
wound up with a triple and eventually scored what would prove to be
the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was hit right to me, and I froze,'' Cameron said.
``Those are the hardest balls to know where they're going. I still
thought I had it, but I lost my footing. And that hurt. That was a
big ol' run.''
</P>
<P>
   That it was. But the run needn't have been so crucial if the
Mariners had flexed a little of their offensive muscle _ five runs
in the final two innings _ in the first seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the second and in the seventh, the Mariners loaded the bases.
In the second, Carlos Guillen popped out to end the inning, and in
the seventh, Mark McLemore grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Both Guillen and McLemore have underachieving batting averages,
.122 and .204, respectively. The Mariners are particularly
concerned about Guillen, who also made the final out of the eighth
inning, grounding out with Cameron standing on second base as the
potential tying run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guillen had a big hit (Tuesday) in Minnesota that helped us
win a game,'' batting coach Gerald Perry said. ``I was hoping that
would help him catch fire, build his confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hit here or there tonight would have helped. It's been a
tough go for him. He started slow, then he got injured. He's
struggling now, and (lack of) confidence has a lot to do with it.
He's working hard, though, trying to get it together. It's not for
lack of work that he's struggling. He's out there working every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners need Guillen. And McLemore. And David Bell (.132).
Seattle has a good offense, but the power that was in evidence in
the 1990s isn't there. To get big offense, Seattle needs lots of
hits and walks. One or two an inning won't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   The final two Anaheim runs _ a two-out blooper for an RBI single
by Troy Glaus in the eighth and the Erstad triple that set up a run
in the ninth _ were particularly galling to Seattle manager Lou
Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early in the year, we weren't giving up add-on runs,''
Piniella said. ``Lately we've been doing it a lot. We've got to
stop that.''
</P>
<P>
   At least the Mariners never gave up Friday. Down 5-0, their
engine turned over, with Javier proving to be the ignition switch.
Javier opened the eighth inning with his first home run of the
season. It didn't seem like much at the time, but it was the start
of big doings.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Rodriguez singled, and one out later, Edgar Martinez
singled to right. Rodriguez steamed around to third, and when
Salmon blew the pickup, Martinez took second.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lampkin doubled home both those runners, Cameron doubled
home Lampkin, and suddenly the Mariners were one hit away from
being tied.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get it. Raul Ibanez lined out and Guillen grounded
out, meaning the Mariners would have to come back against
flame-throwing reliever Troy Percival _ if they were to come back
at all.
</P>
<P>
   They would have made it as John Olerud drove in a run in the
ninth. But by then it was a two-run game, thanks to Erstad's liner
tricking Cameron for a triple, followed by Adam Kennedy's RBI
single, good for Anaheim's sixth run.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the Mariners' third in four games and came as
Seattle is beginning a 10-day stretch against AL West teams.
</P>
<P>
   Games Saturday and Sunday against the Angels will be followed by
three games in Texas and four in Oakland, and the Mariners, shut
out for seven innings, can only hope that last night was not an
omen of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got five runs the last two innings,'' Piniella said.
``Let's hope that's a portent of things to come.''

OFF BY A NOTE: SONICS TAKE UPSET BID DOWN TO FINAL SECONDS AGAINST
JAZZ 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ In so many ways, the final ride was a microcosm
of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   But despite taking the Utah Jazz through every possible twist,
dip and hairpin turn, the roller coaster that was this Sonics
season came to a halt Friday night in a hard-fought, 96-93 Game 5
loss in the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics failed in an attempt to become just the sixth team in
NBA history to come back from an 0-2 deficit and win a first-round
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Losing 3-2 in the best-of-five series, however, did not diminish
the scare the seventh-seeded Sonics threw into the No. 2 Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sonics clearly walked away with a sense of pride, Utah
took a case of whiplash into its Western Conference semifinal
matchup with Portland.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept getting better and better, and tougher and tougher
to deal with,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said of the Sonics. ``That's
a credit to them. They went through a little turmoil, according to
what everyone was saying. It's really kind of aggravating, because
Paul Westphal did a great job to get his team back in a tough time,
to put them in a situation to compete like they did. They were just
that close to winning tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Showing the resilience they displayed throughout the series, the
Sonics came within inches of stealing the decisive road game
several times.
</P>
<P>
   Their last opportunity to extend the season came with nine
seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics controlled the ball for the game's final play after
Utah's John Stockton sank a pair of free throws. Following a
timeout, Westphal inserted Chuck Person into the lineup with
Rashard Lewis, Brent Barry, Vin Baker and Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   When Payton received the ball after the inbounds pass, he ran
around a Person screen at the top of the key. Stockton and Malone
followed Payton, who whipped a pass back to Person.
</P>
<P>
   Person pump-faked as a defender flew by before launching a
three-point attempt to tie the game. The ball bounced off the front
of the rim and time expired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players don't relish the opportunity,'' said Person, whom
Westphal called the ``designated shooter'' in those situations.
``But, for me, it was easy to go in and to get the shot. I just
missed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Person, a 36 percent shooter from 3-point range over his 13-year
career, dialed just 25 percent from long distance this season but
hit the game-winning 3-pointer Jan. 26 against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Westphal, not wavering from the strategy that forced a Game 5,
played a hunch, played the odds and played to the unpredictability
of his team.
</P>
<P>
   That is how everyone wanted to go down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they were going to double me,'' said Payton, who
finished with 27 points, nine assists and six rebounds. ``It was a
good shot by Chuck. I don't regret not taking that shot. I'd rather
for us to get a good look than for me to force something over two
people.
</P>
<P>
   `` ... It hurts a little bit. But I'm proud of this team and the
way they played. With a young team like we've got, we came into a
place that's really hard to win and had a chance to win. I take my
hat off to all the young guys. They came here and played really
well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics used the same trapping defense that was successful in
Games 3 and 4. This time, though, Stockton was more active in
fending off the double teams. Stockton had his best game of the
series, countering Payton with 17 points, 15 assists and seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we left here after Game 2, they were reeling a little
bit,'' Stockton said. ``They didn't quite know what it was that
made them a good team and they figured it out early in the third
game. They were a very good team throughout the rest of the series.
So we feel real fortunate for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton said Utah's execution finally won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew what was going on,'' Payton said. ``They were
running their plays, and it was just a matter of us trying to stop
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics knew they had to also deal with an emotional,
pumped-up Delta Center crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Payton and Lewis (20 points, 7 rebounds) were the starters
visibly immune to the hostile environment created by Jazz fans.
Ruben Patterson brought his usual energy and added 15 points off
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   That trio was mostly responsible for not allowing the Sonics to
wilt after Utah took a 72-59 lead late in the third quarter. Lewis'
3-pointer at the end of the third got the Sonics to 79-70.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a lot of character,'' said Baker, who finished
with 17 points but had just two rebounds. ``We were supposed to be
done 1{ weeks ago. But we fought. I'll take this team in a dogfight
any day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics remained in a game in which they were outshot,
outrebounded and led just once (by three points in the second
quarter), and Westphal was pleased with the effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got beat by a great team,'' said Westphal. ``I think we
could have finished it, except for a couple of little things. They
got a lot of second shots in the last four minutes. We played good
defense, and somehow they came up with the rebound. And then if
Chuck makes that shot ... I think we would have won in overtime.''

DODGERS WIN, BUT BROWN DOESN'T
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jeff Shaw is winning games, but he's not making
friends.
</P>
<P>
   One out from a save Friday night, Shaw allowed a home run to
Houston's Lance Berkman that tied the game and overshadowed an
outstanding performance by Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Los Angeles Dodgers scored in the bottom of the
ninth to beat the Astros 3-2, the boos of 45,428 fans turned to
cheers and the club had its fifth victory in seven games on the
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   And Shaw had another win.
</P>
<P>
   If it seems as if Shaw, who saved 34 games last year, has been
in this spot before, he has. Last Saturday he allowed a game-tying
ninth-inning home run to Florida's Derrek Lee only to get the
victory when the Dodgers scored in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going out there with a same gameplan every time out; it
never changes,'' said Shaw (2-1), who has three blown saves in 10
opportunities. ``The home runs don't change my perspective any
because I'm out to do my job, which is to save ballgames. And if I
don't save it, I try to put my team in a position to win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Shaw gave up a home run to Berkman, who came to the
plate with one hit in 12 at-bats this season. But Shaw wound up
with the victory after Todd Hollandsworth singled past a drawn-in
infield to score Alex Cora with the winning run against reliever
Doug Henry (0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Cora, in his first game since being called up to replaced
injured shortstop Kevin Elster, opened the inning with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Cora was sacrificed to third and Hollandsworth, now the starting
center fielder with Devon White (torn rotator cuff) gone for at
least two weeks, made enough contact to get the game winning RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers opened the Houston series as a team in transition,
activating the rookie Cora and relief pitcher Antonio Osuna after
Elster (groin) and White were placed on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Cora started at short and Dave Hansen replaced Adrian Beltre
(tight hamstring) at third.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna, who has missed most of the past two seasons with elbow
trouble, technically gave the Dodgers 12 pitchers, but reliever
Mike Fetters was unavailable because of elbow soreness.
</P>
<P>
   Until the ninth, the only Dodger that mattered was Brown, who
limited the Astros to three hits and one run in eight innings. He
needed just 103 pitches to get that far, but getting his third
victory in four decisions would prove far more elusive.
</P>
<P>
   He was given the lead with a fourth-inning home run by Todd
Hundley, but never did figure out Jeff Bagwell, who had a
fourth-inning home run and a seventh-inning single.
</P>
<P>
   Brown got his revenge later that inning when the Astros loaded
the bases with two outs. With Tim Bogar at the plate, Brown threw a
breaking ball in the dirt that skipped past Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, that would have been a run. This year, the backstop
has been moved in from 83 feet to 58 feet to accommodate new seats.
As Bagwell broke for home, Hundley hustled for the ball and threw
to Brown covering the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Brown made a sweeping tag. Bagwell was out and Brown's 2-1 lead
was intact until turning the game over to Shaw in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play at home plate was a tough situation with the bases
loaded,'' Brown said. ``Instead of tying the game, we stopped a
run. The tag is not something you think about. It's just
instinct.''

<P>
   SEATTLE _ While other scores around the American League more
closely resembled those found in T-ball, Kent Bottenfield brought a
National League-like flavor to the Northwest on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield, an 18-game winner with the Cardinals last season,
threw 6 scoreless innings and the Anaheim Angels rode the hot bat
of Tim Salmon to beat the Seattle Mariners 6-5 before 38,307 at
Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield (3-3) allowed four hits while striking out seven and
walking three, but had to watch as the Angels bullpen hung on -
barely. He left the game with two on and one out in the seventh
inning but was saved by reliever Mark Petkovsek, who got out of the
inning with the Angels still leading, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored three times in the top of the eighth inning -
two coming in on Salmon's eighth home run of the year - and it
turned out they needed every one. Petkovsek got hit hard in the
bottom of the eighth, giving up four runs in the inning before
Shigetoshi Hasegawa got the final two outs of the inning with the
potential tying run at second base and the Angels clinging to a 5-4
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy's RBI single in the top of the ninth made it 6-4,
which turned out to be big. Troy Percival gave up a run in the
ninth but closed it out with the tying run on third for his eighth
save.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have won three in a row and trail the Mariners in the
AL West by percentage points (.538 to .533).
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck yes,'' Percival said when asked if the win was big.
``Bottenfield did a good job of holding them down. And any time you
hold 'em under six runs, I don't care when they score 'em, that's a
good win for us. Everybody's not going to be sharp every day. As
long as we win, I don't care if it's 20-19.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival got the first two batters in the ninth, including a
line drive by Stan Javier that hit the base of his palm and caromed
to shortstop Benji Gil, who made the play at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia ran out to check on Percival, who waved
him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't trying to be rude, but it hit me pretty good and I
wanted to hurry up and get it over with before my elbow locked
up,'' Percival said.
</P>
<P>
   Percival, who had the imprint of the baseball's seams on his
hand after the game, said he felt stinging all the way up to his
elbow. But X-rays taken after the game were negative.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners then strung together a walk by Alex Rodriguez, a
single by John Olerud and an RBI single by Edgar Martinez to make
it 6-5. With pinch-runner Charles Gipson at third, Percival got Tom
Lampkin on a fly to right to end it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mark of two clubs that aren't going to quit,'' Scioscia
said. ``We're going to see games like this all year. These two
teams match up well.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon had three hits, including two doubles and the home run.
On the current road trip, Salmon is hitting .533 (8 for 15) with
three homers and six RBI.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Bottenfield's third consecutive quality start that
set the tone Friday. Since he got ripped in Toronto on April 20,
Bottenfield has allowed only four earned runs in 21 innings
covering three starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was textbook Kent Bottenfield,'' Scioscia said. ``He has
command, he moves the ball around, he's an intelligent pitcher.
He's at a point where his last three starts he's about as good as
he can get.''
</P>
<P>
   A noticeable addition to Bottenfield's game is added velocity.
He hits the low 90's on the radar gun, where he used to be in the
high 80's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been playing a lot of long toss between starts, extending
the muscles and getting my shoulder stretched out,'' explained
Bottenfield.
</P>
<P>
   The result has been 16 strikeouts in his past two starts.

A FINE FEAST FOR SHAQ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It remains an indisputable fact of life in the
NBA: When Godzilla wants to snack on a small city, you stay out of
the way of his fork.
</P>
<P>
   And the Lakers' Godzilla, Shaquille O'Neal, dined on the state
capital of California Friday night at Staples Center. In the first
half of a game the Lakers never expected to play, a deciding Game 5
of their first-round playoff series with Sacramento, O'Neal scored
20 points and outrebounded the Kings all by himself, 14-12.
</P>
<P>
   His line after the 113-86 win, a game that was anti-climactic
after the first quarter, was exactly what one would expect in a
must-win game by the NBA's MVP-to-be -- 32 points, 18 rebounds, 3
blocks, 4 assists, and total domination regardless of what
combination of players the Kings threw at him, quite literally on
some occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq turned to me right before the start and said `let me
start this game off,' '' said Lakers coach Phil Jackson. ``He
wanted to display his dominance. It means a lot to him. He's going
to be named the MVP in a few weeks, and he wants to prove to
everybody that he is.''
</P>
<P>
   But truly, Shaq Fu had nothing to prove Friday, and neither did
No. 1-A in the Lakers entry, Kobe Bryant, who contributed the kind
of poised, totally-in-control game we now have come to expect (17
points, 6 assists, 3 blocks, 1 turnover). They weren't the source
of the two losses in Sacramento that created Friday's must-win
game, and while the result bore their imprint, it was what everyone
else did that mattered.
</P>
<P>
   The best two-man team in the NBA today, or even the best duo of
the league's past, is incapable of winning a NBA playoff series if
everyone else decides to spectate. (Please note that the phrase
``two-man'' does not include the retired Michael Jordan and anyone
else).
</P>
<P>
   That was the Lakers' problem in the state capital. Glen Rice,
A.C. Green, Robert Horry and friends were all inanimate objects.
They didn't play poorly, they just didn't play. In the 148 minutes
of Game 4 played by those not named Shaq or Kobe, they contributed
just 10 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, they all played. In the first quarter, the choir made
6-of-13 field goals, including three baskets by the oft-invisible
Rice. In the second quarter, they made 6-of-10, five of them coming
off the bench, from Horry and Derek Fisher. The Lakers had more
assists in the first half Friday (18) than they had in all of Game
4 (12).
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and played the kind of game we talked about,''
Jackson said. ``The bench was very good. I didn't even tell Derek
before the game that he'd play. The minutes Travis Knight and Rick
Fox were also important within the context of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also came out and told the refs to watch the Kings'
illegal defense, a source of complaint in the two games in
Sacramento. It was the last words Shaq said before tipoff, and the
Kings were called for a zone three times in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame we have to play to that rule and demonstrate the
obvious,'' said Jackson. ``What it did was keep them from playing
so compacted on Shaq. They had to bring (Chris) Webber out, and it
gave us much better spacing.'' So at least for the moment, the
upset-o-meter can be set aside. Being forced to the max in the
first round recalled the miseries of the last three seasons, with
the added cloud of a league-best 67-15 regular season record. The
tale of the 1981 season was often told, that first round loss to
Houston in an idiotic best-of-three three series.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmists now can harken back to 1990, when the Lakers went
63-19 in the regular season and lost their second round match to
Phoenix, the same franchise that is on-deck. All this history
matters not at all to Jackson, but it is interesting to note that
this is new territory for the man who directed the AME Church -- as
in Air Michael Entertainment -- in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In nine previous seasons as a head coach, Jackson never faced a
series-deciding final game in the first round. His record in first
round games before the Sacramento series was 27-2, including seven
3-0 sweeps. His only first-round losses were by his first Bulls
team (1990) and one without Jordan (1995).
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Kings series was only the fifth time in 32 series
that Jackson, owner of a NBA record 114-43 postseason mark, has
ever been forced to a deciding game. In nine seasons in Chicago,
the Bulls were forced to a Game 7 just four times, and Jackson went
2-2 -- losses in 1990 (Eastern finals to eventual champion Detroit)
and 1994 (second round to New York without Jordan), and wins in
1992 (round two, New York( and 1998 (Eastern finals, Indiana). For
someone who has done more in a decade of coaching than some coaches
do in three, it's sort of intriguing that there's actually some
unchartered territory here.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Jackson was taking the same character test Friday night as
his players. ``Sacramento gave us a lot of push,'' he said. ``We
grew because of that. We learned a lot about ourselves. We needed a
trial by fire. We need to think as one. We are still a ways away
from that mental grip, but this is part of the process you have to
go through to win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever sage advice or eastern philosophy he fed the team
Friday obviously worked. When we're all done with these playoffs,
and the Lakers have stapled another title flag to the wall, we may
look back on Game 5 Friday as a key moment. Then again, maybe we're
all just having a good time watching Godzilla eat his way across
America, and Jackson's true genius was getting invited to dinner.

LAKERS ROUT KINGS, SUNS NEXT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A funny thing happened on the way to the greatest
upset in NBA history. A predictable thing, actually. The team that
was favored to win, the one on its home floor, the one with the two
superstars and the legend for a coach, the great record and even
greater expectations, made a stand.
</P>
<P>
   Just like 67-win teams are supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   One major stand, one major rout, and the Los Angeles Lakers had
snuffed out the upstart Sacramento Kings in a fabulously easy
113-86 victory Friday night before an energized sellout crowd of
18,997 at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   After watching a 2-0 series lead slip to 2-2, the Lakers finally
finished off the Kings - and avoided becoming just the third No.1
seed ever to lose to a No. 8.
</P>
<P>
   They rediscovered their swagger, and perhaps restored their
standing as budding champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't really worried about anything,'' said Shaquille
O'Neal, who led the way with 32 points and 18 rebounds. ``We knew
if we didn't bring our `A' game, then we were going to make history
tonight. We didn't want to make history that way. So everybody
brought their `A' games, and my hat's off to my teammates. They
played well.''
</P>
<P>
   The first team in the regular-season standings became the last
team to clinch a second-round berth. And there will be little time
to savor the win - the Lakers open the second round Sunday
afternoon against the Phoenix Suns at Staples.
</P>
<P>
   They'll head into that series with renewed confidence after
holding the league's most potent offense to 86 points and 33.8
percent shooting. With O'Neal clicking early, Kobe Bryant and Glen
Rice contributing immediately and a rejuvenated bench, the Lakers
shot 52.2 percent and led wire-to-wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big performance by this team,'' said Lakers coach Phil
Jackson. ``They came out with a lot of guns and a lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, having survived teetering on the brink of elimination, are
a better team for the experience, Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to congratulate the Sacramento Kings on their effort,
their tremendous effort as a basketball club,'' he said. ``They
gave us a lot of push. And we needed that as a basketball team if
we're going to advance and continue on. And I think that we grew
because of that as a team. Hopefully, we learned a lot about
ourselves in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kings, who frustrated the Lakers throughout the season and
beat them convincingly just three nights earlier in Sacramento, had
nothing left. They watched the Lakers take a double-digit lead a
minute into the second quarter and never got closer than 15 points
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   There were no more chest-thumping heroics for Sacramento's Chris
Webber. After dominating the Lakers for most of the series, Webber
labored to get 20 points (on 7-of-21 shooting) and got no help from
his teammates. No other King scored in double digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hurt,'' Webber said. ``I'm very discouraged, mad, sad and
all those words.... Those guys were ready at home.''
</P>
<P>
   It all stood in stark contrast to the Lakers' two losses at Arco
Arena. But then, that's just what the Lakers said would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God,'' O'Neal said, ``for homecourt advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   As with any Lakers romp, everything began with O'Neal. After
struggling through two games in Sacramento - his ``Clark Kent
games'' - O'Neal brought back his Superman cape and made 15 of 24
field goals in 34 minutes of work. He also blocked three shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank my father for keeping me straight,'' O'Neal
said. ``I was kind of down on myself because I had two bad games at
Sacramento. He said, `You idiot, you always play bad at Sacramento.
Just play good at home.' ``
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant pitched in 17 points and six assists (his high for
the series), making 7 of 16 shots in 34 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Every move the Lakers might have scripted, every need Jackson
had identified, every hope they had for a turnaround, played out
perfectly in the first half, netting them a 59-44 lead by halftime.
</P>
<P>
   They needed O'Neal's aggression, and he opened the game with a
turnaround jumper over Vlade Divac to give the Lakers the only lead
they needed, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaquille turned to me before the game started and said, `Let
me start the game off first,''' Jackson said. ``It was a very good
indication.''
</P>
<P>
   They needed a resurgent bench, and Derek Fisher - who didn't
even play in Game 4 - hit all four of his field-goal attempts in
the first half, leading a bench effort that produced 14 points by
halftime and 36 in the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was also clear from the outset that the officials intended to
end the ongoing debate over illegal defense. The Lakers were called
for their first violation 56 seconds into the game. The Kings got
tagged for a violation 69 seconds later - then got hit again six
seconds after that for a technical foul.
</P>
<P>
   That got the Kings off of O'Neal's back, and the Lakers offense
did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had faith in the system,'' Bryant said. ``We knew it was
going to be tough for any team to beat us three times in a row.''

KINGS EXPECT MORE NEXT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was different this time for the Sacramento
Kings, losing in the first round of the playoffs for the second
straight season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, success was such a new feeling it was an achievement
just to be playing the postseason. This year, getting there wasn't
enough, nor was pushing the top-seeded Lakers to a fifth and
deciding game before falling 113-86 at Staples Center on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento did the same thing a year ago against the heavily
favored Utah Jazz, losing in overtime in game five.
</P>
<P>
   That's getting old. Sacramento wants more now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being America's sweetheart team and playing on TV's not
enough,'' Chris Webber said.
</P>
<P>
   At times Webber seemed to be playing alone Friday, although he
finished with just 20 points on 7 of 21 shooting. But those numbers
were huge compared to Vlade Divac (four points ) and Jason
Williams, who had more gestures to the crowd than assists - he
finished with one.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Corliss Williamson (two points ) and Nick
Anderson (three points), who provided nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us on this team need to know that in order to make
names for ourselves we need to play big in big games,'' Webber
said.
</P>
<P>
   The blowout loss exposed the Kings for what they were this year:
A good home team that struggled on the road. That's enough to get
teams into the playoffs, but insufficient to advance.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzied atmosphere at Sacramento's Arco Arena lifts the
emotional Kings to another level. On the road they're merely
ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento was 30-11 at home this year and 14-27 everywhere
else.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast was especially evident Friday by the lack of
contributions Sacramento got from everyone else besides Webber,
especially reserves who played so well in two wins in Sacramento.
Pedrag Stojakovic, who had 19 and 12 points up north, had only
eight. Tony Delk, the steady backup point guard who broke the
Lakers' spirit the last two games, wasn't a factor with eight
points and one assist.
</P>
<P>
   It showed too in Sacramento's body language. The hard double and
triple teams that frustrated Shaquille O'Neal weren't nearly as
aggressive or sharp Friday, resulting in three illegal defense
violations and two technical fouls. O'Neal took full advantage,
ripping the Kings with 32 points and 18 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're going to be a better team we've got to learn to play
on the road,'' Sacramento coach Rick Adelman said. ``We haven't
been that way this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the energy the Kings played with at home was absent
in Los Angeles, especially at key points. They couldn't close in on
the Lakers to end the first half, then collapsed in the third
quarter, falling behind 89-62.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the game right there,'' Adelman said.

NO LONGER MISSING IN ACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Imagine the Sacramento Kings' surprise. It turns
out the Los Angeles Lakers really do have more than three players.
Turns out - shock of shocks - they even have a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' stars came through in their stunning 113-86 victory
over the Kings in Game 5 on Friday night, but look who else showed
up.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!!off!Derek Fisher, a guy who couldn't even get off the
bench in Game 4,hit his first four shots and helped shut down
Sacramento sparkplug TonyDelk (2 for 9).
</P>
<P>
   --A.C. Green, who looked like he had little interest in playing
in the last game, scored 10 points and added six rebounds, three
assists and two steals.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Horry, who hit but a lone field goal in Game 3, had
eight points, seven rebounds and teamed with Green to make the
Kings' Chris Webber (7 of 21) look very human.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally our supporting players showed up,'' Horry said. ``We'd
been missing. I think the key was Fish coming in and hitting his
first shots. That kind of got us going.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher was an unexpected Friday star. This came after he never
left the bench Tuesday in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely bothered me,'' Fisher said. ``I'm not sure why I
didn't play. We fell behind and I guess (coach Phil Jackson) needed
Kobe (Bryant) in there most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was definitely trying to help us get out to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Not much was going to go wrong for the Lakers on this night.
Diesel was refueled, Bryant was connecting, Glen Rice was a factor,
and for the first time, the Staples Center crowd had the arena
throbbing.
</P>
<P>
   And then all those background players got into the act. Suddenly
the Lakers were playing with energy, were more active, more
confident more like the team that won 67 games in the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   A team that learned it could count on production from more than
their Big Three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not going to go down, not being aggressive,'' Green
said. ``I was looking for my shot. Phil wanted me to, and it's
going to be the same way against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one was ready tonight. Even little A.C. the Bear in my
pocket was trying to get out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers bench had been outscored 44-8 in Game 4, but Fisher
made it known quickly that would not happened again. He hit his
first four shots - including three jumpers from about 18 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sort of the way it worked out,'' Fisher said. ``You
know the three big guys are going to score, but it's been awhile
since several guys came off the bench and contributed
offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Aided by a fourth quarter that became an entire period of
garbage time, the Lakers bench scored 36 points. Six less than
Sacramento's, but a significant amount no less.
</P>
<P>
   The background players had caught a glimpse of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are professionals, they know what to do,'' Green
said. ``They wanted to win, and their competitiveness came out
tonight.''

SHAQ WAVES HIS MAGIC WAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If producing under pressure was easy, there'd be
as many players of the hour as there are hours in the day.
</P>
<P>
   There's a reason the common fan doesn't cry out, ``You one of da
men!''or try to tug on Supermen's capes.
</P>
<P>
   The plain truth, one-time Laker Tom Hawkins has said, is more
players than not don't want the basketball in tight spots, their
fear of looking bad overriding their driving ambition.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for players big and really, really tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Wilt was that way,'' Hawkins once said, referring to
Wilt Chamberlain, his 7-foot-1 teammate on the 1968-69 Lakers,
``partly because he knew he'd be the first player to be blamed for
any defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain averaged an astonishing 50 points one season and
routinely led the league in rebounding. Yet it wasn't until he won
his first NBA title, in his eighth season, that he was able to lose
the underachiever label that others had pinned on him.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal found himself in Chamberlain's shoes Friday and
naturally everyone was straining to see, were they made of cement?
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 7-foot-1 center was fresh off an exquisite regular
season in which he ranked in the top-three in the league in
scoring, rebounding, blocked shots and field goal percentage. The
NBA was his smorgasbord; all the other players were reduced to
begging for his scraps.
</P>
<P>
   Then came two bad playoff performances in Sacramento and in the
span of 48 hours O'Neal's detractors were flocking to his side to
apply the Heimlich maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Another uninspired performance in the Lakers' decisive Game 5 of
their first-round playoff series against the Kings and the six
sensational months that preceded it would have been forgotten
faster than yesterday's fad.
</P>
<P>
   Shaq's name would have been O'Heel.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Neal was Wilt-ing under the white-hot spotlight, he hid it
well from his teammates. He seemed his same old imperturbable self
before the game; indeed, he sidled up to Phil Jackson and
respectfully asked to be fed the ball for the first shot. Once the
game started, it was little wonder why.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal left little doubt that this year's league MVP was in the
building.
</P>
<P>
   And no, Sacramento fans, we aren't talking about Chris ``Call Me
Pained'' Webber.
</P>
<P>
   On the Lakers' first possession, O'Neal converted a feathery
hook over his nemesis Vlade Divac. He made five of his first six
shots, outrebounded the entire Kings team 14-12 in the first half,
blocked three shots and added four assists for the heck of it to
carry the Lakers past Sacramento, 113-86, and into the second
round.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's fast start (10 points and seven rebounds in the first
11 minutes) was so sweet, it seemed to give all his teammates a
sugar rush. Derek Fisher, who didn't play in Game 4, came off the
bench and contributed eight points in his first nine minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Another reserve, forward Robert Horry, made three of his first
four shots on his way to eight points. He also grabbed seven
rebounds, five of them on the defensive end. On the strength of
Fisher's moxie and Horry's muscle, the Lakers turned the benches on
the Kings; Sacramento's reserves had outscored their L.A.
counterparts 140-64 in the first four games but the Laker reserves
pretty much held their own on this night with 36 points.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was less a center than a symphony conductor, establishing
the tone and timbre of the Lakers' four-part harmony.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings were so helpless to stop O'Neal, they picked up three
illegal defense calls in the first quarter trying.
</P>
<P>
   The Staples Center sellout crowd was so relieved to see the
highlight reel O'Neal, it cheered loud enough that, for a change,
ears were ringing instead of cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq was ready to play,'' said Lakers forward A.C. Green. ``He
was motivated. He was hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   Next up for O'Neal and Co. is Phoenix, which was winless in four
games against the Lakers during the regular season. If O'Neal can
make the Suns set, his detractors will dwindle to an obstinate few.
</P>
<P>
   Despite everybody's nit-picking, O'Neal's championship plate
looks to be replenished and his appetite, again ravenous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like he gobbled up every defensive rebound,'' said
Fisher of O'Neal, who had 11 defensive boards. ``He can give us 30
points every night. But what he brings defensively makes us a great
team instead of a good team.''
</P>
<P>
   It also moves O'Neal ever closer to getting his due as a great
player instead of merely a very, very gifted one.

   A tempest is brewing in Washington, all because of an 11-inch
blonde bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   Mattel, in association with two nonprofit women's groups,
recently announced plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll, a
power-suited, high-heeled White House hopeful who comes complete
with a pearl necklace and a Girls' Bill of Rights. Mattel says it
hopes the doll will ``broaden girls' vision of what's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately the protests sounded. Last week in an article
on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, the former Colorado
congresswoman and one-time presidential candidate Patricia
Schroeder assailed the plastic politico as a giant leap backward
for womankind. ``Why should we feel great about a message that says
a woman can go to the White House if she looks like Barbie?''
Schroeder asked. ``I'm sorry, but I just can't get enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, why shouldn't American children learn about civics
and the virtues of public service via their favorite playthings?
Rather than jeer at this star-spangled Barbie, let's extend the
concept to other shelves at Toy Barn.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Potato Head
</P>
<P>
   What better way to teach the country's youth about the
versatility of the modern politician than by crossing a U.S.
senator with everybody's favorite synthetic spud? But instead of
the traditional plug-in eyes, nose, lips and limbs, Sen. Potato
Head (Independent of Idaho) comes equipped with interchangeable
position papers, a removable spine and a special ``two-face''
feature that allows the toy tater to talk out of both sides of its
mouth. (Manufacturer's note: On the Dan Quayle model of Sen.
Potatoe Head, the extra ``e'' is sold separately.)
</P>
<P>
   Tickle Me Reno
</P>
<P>
   The events of recent weeks have put a clearly beleaguered
Attorney General Janet Reno back in the national spotlight. Lest
children believe the job of AG is completely joyless, here comes a
fluffy, happy effigy of the nation's top cop that giggles and
chortles on command. This huggable toy was developed after several
failures, notably the ill-fated Tickle Me Zoe and Tickle Me Kimba
dolls, which, despite repeated efforts, never found anything to
laugh at.
</P>
<P>
   GI Joe Lockhart
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the battle fatigues, helmet and rifle. In their place a
tailored gray suit, briefing book and White House podium. Still, GI
Joe Lockhart, a pocket-sized version of the embattled press
secretary, is every bit as prepped for trench warfare as his
fox-holed predecessor _ he's the ultimate spin-controlling war
machine. Roll up his sleeves and let him slug it out with Sam
Donaldson; slip on his windbreaker and breeze him past reporters as
he boards the presidential chopper (not included). This is truly
one ``fighting Joe from head to toe.'' (Coming soon: A special
two-pack that includes a companion Helen Thomas doll.)
</P>
<P>
   Curious George Stephanapoulos
</P>
<P>
   Kids will love this video adaptation of the classic book series
starring the former White House aide as the mischievous monkey. The
first three releases: ``Curious George Goes to Washington,''
``Curious George Writes a Memoir'' and ``Curious George Can't Get
His Calls Returned.'' (James Carville co-stars as the Man in the
Yellow Hat.)
</P>
<P>
   Talking Head Teletubbies
</P>
<P>
   That colorful quartet of cuddlies with antennae on their heads
and TV screens in their bellies now features running political
commentary on the tummy monitors, courtesy of America's leading
pundits. Each Teletubbie is assigned its own talking head _ Tinky
Winky (Tim Russert), Dipsy (George Will), Laa-Laa (Cokie Roberts)
and Po (Matt Drudge) _ which means tykes can play in silence for
hours on end as their adorable Tubbies hash it out among
themselves. (Plans for the Charlie Rose Teletubbie were canceled
when manufacturers were unable to get the doll to stop talking.)
</P>
<P>
   Jujitsu Justices
</P>
<P>
   Step aside, Justice Scalia; take a powder, Justice O'Connor _
there's a new Supreme Court in town. The first Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers to sit on the high bench, this collector's set of robed
action figures metes out justice in ways the Rehnquist court can
only dream about. Miranda warning? Forget about it. First
Amendment? You've got to be kidding. This gang totes lasers, not
gavels. Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemonica
</P>
<P>
   And you thought Pikachu was the coolest member of the gang _
well, here comes the toughest pocket monster of them all. The only
Pokemon character to have survived battles with such nemeses as
Starrmander and Trippleypuff, Pokemonica is available in a variety
of sizes, comes with her own sports car and designer cell phone,
and boasts a wardrobe of more than two dozen dresses. None of them
blue.

two-pack that includes a companion Helen Thomas doll.)

   Curious George Stephanapoulos
</P>
<P>
   Kids will love this video adaptation of the classic book series
starring the former White House aide as the mischievous monkey. The
first three releases: ``Curious George Goes to Washington,''
``Curious George Writes a Memoir'' and ``Curious George Can't Get
His Calls Returned.'' (James Carville co-stars as the Man in the
Yellow Hat.)

<P>
   Talking Head Teletubbies
</P>
<P>
   That colorful quartet of cuddlies with antennae on their heads
and TV screens in their bellies now features running political
commentary on the tummy monitors, courtesy of America's leading
pundits. Each Teletubbie is assigned its own talking head _ Tinky
Winky (Tim Russert), Dipsy (George Will), Laa-Laa (Cokie Roberts)
and Po (Matt Drudge) _ which means tykes can play in silence for
hours on end as their adorable Tubbies hash it out among
themselves. (Plans for the Charlie Rose Teletubbie were canceled
when manufacturers were unable to get the doll to stop talking.)
</P>
<P>
   Jujitsu Justices
</P>
<P>
   Step aside, Justice Scalia; take a powder, Justice O'Connor _
there's a new Supreme Court in town. The first Mighty Morphin Power
Rangers to sit on the high bench, this collector's set of robed
action figures metes out justice in ways the Rehnquist court can
only dream about. Miranda warning? Forget about it. First
Amendment? You've got to be kidding. This gang totes lasers, not
gavels. Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemonica
</P>
<P>
   And you thought Pikachu was the coolest member of the gang _
well, here comes the toughest pocket monster of them all. The only
Pokemon character to have survived battles with such nemeses as
Starrmander and Trippleypuff, Pokemonica is available in a variety
of sizes, comes with her own sports car and designer cell phone,
and boasts a wardrobe of more than two dozen dresses. None of them
blue.

<P>
   Ridley Scott's $107 million epic ``Gladiator,'' now splashed
across movie screens nationwide, is the latest and most opulent
contribution to the sword-and-sandal genre. When the film opened
last week, the timing was uncanny: Steve Reeves, best known for
playing Hercules and other beefcake roles in Italian gladiator
flicks in the 1950s and '60s, had died just days earlier. And
starting Sunday night, NBC is rolling out a two-part production of
``Jason and the Argonauts.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's because the producers were not up to the lofty
subject matter _ and in some cases maybe it's just the bad dubbing
_ but the earlier sword-and-sandal epics often had a unique way of
yielding, well, memorable utterances. It didn't matter whether the
plots were derived from the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of
ancient Rome _ or, more typically, some unholy mixture of the
three. The dialogue frequently managed to range from the ponderous
to the purple, and sometimes to the plain preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, these immortal phrases plumb the great themes of the
human condition. Some classic _ if not exactly classical _ examples
follow.

   It's Getting Lean (and Mean) Out There
</P>
<P>
   Accusations of a ``secret plan'' that would bankrupt Social
Security. Intimations of a laxity in the war on drugs. Allegations
that gun lobbyists would be virtual residents of the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore went on the offensive again and again
last week, using a series of campaign appearances across the
country not only to advance his own policy initiatives, but to sow
suspicion about the goals of his presumed opponent in the general
election, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he would pick Charlton Heston as the next surgeon
general,'' Gore said in Chicago, referring to the financial backing
Republicans are getting from the National Rifle Association, whose
president is Heston.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's hammering away was a leading indicator of a new, more
aggressive phase of the campaign. The retreat of Elian Gonzalez
with his father to a Maryland estate seems to have opened up space
again on America's front page for campaign machinations, much of
them testier. In California, a conservative group, Shape the
Debate, has begun running anti-Gore commercials; last week, Handgun
Control introduced a spot that said Bush had signed a law that
allows concealed guns in churches and amusement parks.
</P>
<P>
   The ammunition for Gore's attack was provided on Wednesday, when
it was disclosed that the nation's gun companies had broken off
settlement talks with 31 municipalities across the nation over
lawsuits relating to gun violence, in hopes Bush would win the
presidency and usher in a more favorable environment. (In other
signs of the changing environment, a panel of Republicans proposed
altering the current primary system, to allow only smaller states
to vote first.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, professed to be unfazed by Gore's jabs,
although he couldn't help expressing some disgust. ``Totally
pathetic,'' Bush said to a reporter after being informed that Gore
tells Hispanic audiences that he had hoped his second grandchild
would be born on Cinco de Mayo.

   Goodbye to the Youths of the '90s
</P>
<P>
   Sex. Drugs. Suicide. Divorce. Alcoholism. Gun violence. Are
these topics relevant to teen-agers? Of course, they are _ always
have been, always will be.
</P>
<P>
   Does it follow that such topics should be splashed all over the
television shows that teen-agers _ and younger children _ watch?
Yes, some say: the shows should reflect reality. No, others
respond: it inundates children, too young, with situations they're
not yet emotionally ready for.
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, though, Ozzie-and-Harriet-land has long since
given way to stark dramas on teen-age issues. A pivotal show was
``Beverly Hills 90210,'' which was born 10 years ago and went on to
deal with everything from racism to condoms to school violence. And
though not as big a hit, ``Party of Five,'' arriving several years
later, was also in this tradition.
</P>
<P>
   So it is something of a milestone that these shows, both from
Fox, end this month. To a young audience obsessed with youth, the
shows _ and their stars _ were simply too old.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean Dobie Gillis will rush back to fill the void? Not
a chance. The lineup is chock full of ``90210'' wannabes and their
descendants, like ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Felicity'' and ``Popular,''
all frantically tackling every teen-age subject imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   Realism has its limits, though; nearly every character is still
absurdly gorgeous.

   An `I Love You' Virus Becomes Anything But  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A rogue software program, borne by an e-mail message proclaiming
``I love you,'' propelled itself around the world, jamming and
crashing e-mail systems and destroying data on millions of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Known as a ``worm,'' the program may have been launched in the
Philippines, and it left angry computer users cautiously opening
their electronic mail. The White House, the Pentagon, Congress and
the British House of Commons were among the victims of the program
that swept through many nations' computer networks in less than a
day.

   Round-the-Clock Trading  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a major realignment, the London and Frankfurt stock exchanges
announced plans for a merger and a tie-in with New York's Nasdaq
exchange. The deal reflected the rapidly changing face of European
markets, where investors are demanding faster and cheaper trading
and an end to national distinctions between the continent's
fragmented exchanges. The announcement created the biggest European
exchange by far. The smaller Milan and Madrid bourses also plan to
join the alliance.

   Chinese Treasures Reclaimed  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chinese antiquities are hot, but as Christie's and Sotheby's
learned in Hong Kong, some may be too hot to handle. The houses'
offer of three bronze animal heads and an exquisite vase looted
from the Old Summer Palace near Beijing in 1860, when it was sacked
by British and French troops, provoked a visceral response from
Chinese officials, who condemned the sale and unsuccessfully tried
to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, two Chinese companies bought the items, vowing to
return them to the motherland. The world's art dealers had to
wonder whether a more assertive Chinese government might upset the
lucrative trade in relics _ many of which have shady pasts.

   A Long-Delayed Trial  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 12 years after Pan Am 103 plummeted from the night sky
into the small town of Lockerbie, Scotland, two Libyans accused of
planting a bomb on the plane went on trial in a most unusual venue:
a Dutch air base declared Scottish soil for the occasion. The deal
was worked out so Libya's leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, could get
United Nations sanctions lifted while still saving face. The
prosecution plans to call more than 1,000 witnesses over a yearlong
trial.

<P>
   Three of the 13 Iranian Jews accused of spying for Israel
confessed, but neither human rights activists, foreign diplomats
nor their own lawyers were convinced.
</P>
<P>
   While international concern about the case brought extraordinary
public assurances from Iranian officials that the closed-door trial
will be fair, defense lawyers said the government has not provided
any evidence that the men _ most of them shop clerks and part-time
Hebrew teachers _ had access to or transmitted state secrets.

   The Clinton administration announced that it would strengthen
its rules on regulating the safety of genetically engineered foods
because of growing consumer concerns. Under the plan, biotechnology
companies will have to talk to regulators about the safety of their
new foods before putting them in supermarkets. That discussion is
now voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups, who said the plan does not go far enough,
want the government to require each food to be labeled and
thoroughly tested for safety.

FRANCE GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST MAD COW DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
  By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUELLAS, France _ At first, the veterinarian said that it might
just be milk fever. Then the possibility of a brain tumor was
discussed. But as the laboratory took longer and longer to report
test results, Guy Jambon accepted the inevitable. It was mad cow
disease, although none had ever been detected in this southeast
region of France.
</P>
<P>
   The health department trucks came a few days later, on Feb. 18,
and in one morning all 670 of Jambon's cows were taken for
slaughter and incineration, leaving the barns, the pens, the
milking room and the fields empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part that got to you was how quiet it was,'' said Jambon,
who with his brother and two other partners had built up the herd
over 25 years. ``I was saying to myself: We don't really understand
anything. How did the cow get this disease? How did this happen
here?''
</P>
<P>
   Jambon is not alone in raising such questions. The number of
cases of mad cow disease discovered in France has been climbing
steadily. The totals are still minuscule compared with those in
Britain, which has reported 178,000 cases of the deadly
degenerative brain disease since 1986 and endured a ban on its beef
by European nations.
</P>
<P>
   But what is alarming in France is that the numbers are going up,
given that preventive measures were introduced in 1991 and even
stricter ones were ordered in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is that mad cow disease continues to loom over
Europe like an advancing shadow, many experts say, with much about
it still a mystery. In the last few years, more and more countries
have reported cases of the disease, which is also known as bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE.
</P>
<P>
   It has now been discovered in native-born cows in 10 European
countries, including Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal,
Liechtenstein and Luxembourg. Switzerland, which began a testing
program a year ago, has discovered more than 350 cases so far. In
France, six cases were detected in 1997, 18 in 1998 and 30 in 1999.
In the first four months of this year, 16 cases have already been
detected, roughly one a week.
</P>

   Using newly developed tests, France intends to start a random
testing program of cows that have died after exhibiting suspicious
behavior. The program should look at as many as 50,000 of France's
21 million head of cattle each year. Martin Hirsch, the head of
France's new food safety agency, is, like many other officials
here, bracing himself for the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could certainly show that there is much more mad cow out
there than we have detected so far,'' Hirsch said. ``We just don't
know. There is so much we don't know about this disease, we can
hardly say with confidence that it is under control. We'll have to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   French scientists are not the only ones concerned. Earlier this
year, a group of scientists advising the European Union on the
issue warned that millions of Europeans may be at risk of catching
Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease, the fatal human version of BSE, despite
their governments' contentions that their countries are free of the
disease. The union has been urging broader preventive measures
throughout its 15 member countries. But some countries have
refused, maintaining that they do not have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see these measures taken,'' said Beate
Gminder, a spokeswoman for David Byrne, the European food safety
commissioner. ``The number of cases of mad cow may be much larger
than we know. It could be that cases exist much more extensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still highly puzzled by the disease, which was
first recognized in cows in 1986. It appears that it is not a
bacteria, a virus or fungi, but stems from infectious particles
called prions, perhaps acting in concert with a virus or other
agent. The disease kills cells in the brain, leaving it full of
holes like a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   Since the human form of the disease was first recognized in
1995, more than 35 people have died of it in Britain. Estimates of
how many people are likely to be infected by the disease range
widely. Some British scientists have speculated that 75 more people
will die of the disease in the next 20 years. Others say 80,000,
depending on the incubation period and how the infection is passed
from animal to human.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows how much infected meat someone must eat before
the lethal brain-wasting disease takes hold, or if some other
factor must be present, too. Efforts to prevent the disease in cows
so far have centered on eliminating animal feed that is laced with
infected animal parts.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts believe that apart from foodstuffs and
cow-to-calf transmission, there may be a third, and yet unknown,
mode of transmission.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   France's agriculture minister, Jean Glavany, recently set off an
uproar here by merely mentioning that possibility in a newspaper
interview. But experts studying the disease said his speculation
was nothing new.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This disease is one of the great mysteries of the century,''
Hirsch said. ``We don't know exactly what is the nature of this
disease, so we don't know what steps to take to prevent it. We do
have many questions about modes of transmission. We are looking at
different things.''

<P>
   So far, France has taken perhaps the most conservative position
in Europe, refusing to even accept British beef despite assurances
by European Union officials that it is as safe as any other beef on
the market. (The union is currently moving forward with a lawsuit
against France over the matter.)
</P>
<P>
   But while the union may feel France has gone too far in trying
to protect itself from British meat, it is urging many European
countries to take more precautions against mad cow disease than
they have been willing to take so far.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven European Union countries, including Britain and
France, have taken the strictest preventive measures, Not only do
they control the animal feed, but they also prevent the parts of
the cattle most likely to carry prions, including the brain, spinal
material and intestines, from even entering the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission would like Austria, Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Greece, Sweden, Italy and Spain to do the same. (Italy and
Spain currently ban only the most infective parts of the beef from
countries with known cases of the disease.) The union is also
planning a monitoring program starting in 2001 that would test up
to 65,000 cows a year throughout the European Union to build a
realistic picture of a disease that many fear is underreported.
</P>
<P>
   Britain with its 178,000 cases has been hit hardest by the
disease. Ireland with 466 cases and Portugal with 371 have the next
highest number of cases. Then comes France with 92 cases detected
since 1991. Most of France's cases have been in the north, where
there is more likelihood of exchanges of feed and cattle with
Britain. But nowadays cases have begun to be detected in other
regions of France.
</P>
<P>
   French officials had predicted that because of their precautions
cases of the disease would be declining by now. Experts note that
it no doubt took a while for the 1996 regulations banning animal
parts from animal feed to take hold. And there may also be
instances in which regulations were ignored and the effects are now
being seen. A recent European Union report still noted incidents of
French feed with traces of meat and bone meal despite the ban. But
some experts say they are not sure such incidents can account for
the rise in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Britain's Conservative Party has called for a
European ban on French beef. But the appeal has largely been
dismissed as a political tit-for-tat, as the numbers of infected
cattle are still very small. In addition to France, the United
States continues to ban British beef. But it does not have similar
restrictions on beef from elsewhere in Europe, Gminder said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, French farm unions and the government have stepped in
quickly to help the farmers who have had cattle with mad cow
disease. Within a week of losing his cows, Jambon had 30 calves
back on his farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at least something to keep him busy,'' said Gilbert
Limandas, the president of the local farming union. ``There is no
question that this is a real trauma for the farmers. A herd like
Jambon's was built up over generations. Then, like that it is all
gone. ''
</P>
<P>
   Farm unions here have petitioned the government to spend more on
studying the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Eight weeks after his cows were carted away, Jambon had 520 new
cows, most donated by farms in the area near Lyon. He is pleased
with the quality of the animals. He has changed nothing about his
work, he says. ``There are no precautions to take because I had
already taken all the precautions I knew about. So, I'm back doing
the same thing and hoping it doesn't happen again. We are all
wondering: Who will it hit next?''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For most of a year now, the United States has been
proclaiming its intention to get more involved in the fate of
Africa _ in calming its wars, in building its economies.
</P>
<P>
   The 11,000 men of the U.N. peacekeeping force sent into Sierra
Leone, and the helicopter gunships reinforcing them, were the first
tangible sign that this intention would amount to more than words.
The soldiers were from third-world countries but their assignment
was being paid for in part with $70 million from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And another peacekeeping force has been waiting in the wings to
try to pacify the even more embattled Congo. The Clinton
administration has been hoping that these two forces together would
forever refute the notion that the international community has been
eager to right wrongs in Europe and Asia, but has another set of
rules for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But now the Sierra Leone mission is in trouble. By Friday night,
more than 300 of the force's troops were hostage, four were missing
and presumed dead and rebels were riding in captured U.N. armored
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   That debacle and the hesitant response to it in Washington _
several days of teleconferences among officials of the CIA, the
Pentagon and the National Security Council but no action, no
decisions _ demonstrate yet again that doing good in Africa takes
more than good intentions. Now the likelihood of deployment of even
the modest force for Congo _ 500 monitors protected by 5,000
soldiers _ looks more distant, despite a formal agreement last week
from the Congo leader, Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   The second track of the administration's Africa policy _
economic partnership _ was also delivering less than had been
promised. Even as the House of Representatives approved a trade
bill granting some new trading privileges to Africa, there were
doubts whether many countries on the continent have the economic
capacity to take advantage of it. And on the much-discussed subject
of AIDS, the bill sent a singular snub: In the final version,
bowing to American pharmaceutical companies, Congress dropped a
provision intended to make AIDS drugs more affordable by lowering
the licensing fees for African drug manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has experienced two defining moments
in Africa, barely six months apart. The first was the slaughter of
17 U.S. soldiers in Mogadishu, Somalia, in October 1993 and the
dragging of one of the bodies through the streets. The following
spring, the administration remained largely silent as a genocide
unfolded in Rwanda after the United States agreed to the removal of
a U.N. military force there.
</P>
<P>
   After Mogadishu, President Clinton chose to shy away from
risking such casualties or humiliation again; after Rwanda, he said
genocide could not be tolerated again.
</P>
<P>
   But those are incompatible goals, and in its twilight months,
the Clinton administration is strangled by its own constraints as
it contemplates the options in places like Sierra Leone, Congo,
Angola, Ethiopia, Eritrea and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   A collapse of the peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone could
portend far more than just the loss of a military effort in a
small, desperate West African country. At stake, some officials
argue, is the prestige of the United States within the United
Nations. The U.S. representative there, Richard C. Holbrooke, has
worked hard to fix the frayed U.N.-U.S. relationship, lobbying
Congress to restore funding and urging foreign diplomats to
understand the American political mood. Last week he was in Congo
with U.N. colleagues trying to assess whether it is peaceful enough
to send in the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Holbrooke needs the 54 votes of African
nations, many of whom have been willing to suspend their
disillusionment with Washington if the Sierra Leone and Congo
peacekeeping missions can be made to work.
</P>
<P>
   But many also still resent the evident Western view that Africa
deserves to be marginalized because its problems run so deep. They
argue that some hope should be gleaned from democratic elections
here and there, from economic turn-arounds. They point to
Mozambique, strengthened by investment from neighboring South
Africa; to Kenya, where President Daniel arap Moi has taken steps
that could reduce corruption; to Nigeria, whose new president,
Olusegun Obasanjo, has assumed the mantle of a regional leader
(although his troops, which Western countries wouldn't finance,
pulled out of Sierra Leone after being roughed up by rebel thugs).
</P>
<P>
   Most important to hopes for peacekeeping, some African countries
now have armies that are willing to take part in international
forces on the continent. But it is also clear that African states
are not capable of dealing with big crises like Congo or Sierra
Leone. For these, they look to the United Nations, and thus the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in Sierra Leone is that the big powers on the
Security Council won't use their own forces, and this has left the
United Nations relying on frightened soldiers from less capable
armies _ the kind who sometimes give up their armored personnel
carriers when confronted by teen-agers with rifles at a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   The minister of state for foreign affairs of Uganda, Amama
Mbabazi, put it this way earlier this year: ``When it is Kosovo you
are there in one minute and spend billions. When it's East Timor
you are there. When it is Africa, there are all sorts of excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   So the basic problem of what to do about Africa remains, despite
the administration's determination to get more involved. ``There
are huge stakes'' if the Sierra Leone operation fails, said one
official. ``We have to play pretty tough. Otherwise we are going to
walk away yet again.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was Tuesday evening on the 6:26 in a Long
Island-bound train crowded with weary commuters lurching in the
aisles, elbow to elbow, briefcase to briefcase. Unfolding a
newspaper was unthinkable. Flipping through a hardcover might form
an instant but awkward book club of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   So I rummaged in my purse in search of something for just such a
literary emergency. Even in a rush-hour commute there was ample
reading room for a novel stored in a Palm Pilot, which is smaller
than a paperback yet mighty enough to carry 12 digital titles.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to the beginning of Stephen King's novel ``The Girl Who
Loved Tom Gordon,'' which glowed from a screen a littler smaller
than a poker card and contained 1,409 miniature pages. The train
rumbling through its stops drowned out the faint cicada-like
clicking _ the digital equivalent of a page-turner.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, I've been experimenting with electronic
books in a personal quest to judge a book by its lack of a cover. I
embarked with baggage that would sag a bookshelf: words were made
to be inked. And the ultimate test of pleasure reading was the
plump couch test. Could you curl up with a pillow and good byte?
</P>
<P>
   The various e-book devices felt like solid hardcovers in hand,
but the first generation seemed stiff to me, somehow nerdy and
bulky. The cold gray screens of text didn't offer the hypnotic calm
of vanilla rag paper.
</P>
<P>
   Reading books on a PC felt too much like I was working, chained
upright to a desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback
revolution. I was drawn to the devices that offered one of the
basic elements of pocketbook design: portability.
</P>
<P>
   My first attempt was a mystery about a rakish serial killer,
which Penguin Putnam had offered as a teaser in an early version of
the Rocket eBook. The monochromatic text and page of the reading
device already seems a little primitive given the plans to
transform it by Gemstar. Since Penguin sent out only one chapter, I
still don't know whether the book was a click-turner.
</P>
<P>
   I have ordered titles from Zero Heure in Paris, a new electronic
publisher that delivers books in e-mail attachments, which can be
read on a computer or printed out. The books are the latest from
France and discounted as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I've charged brief works of electronica from the bookseller
Fatbrain.com _ which has now transformed into MightyWords. One was
an illustrated children's book in the Chocolate-Covered Banana
series featuring a monkey named Tyco, which I submitted to a tough
critic, my 3-year-old daughter. There was something gloriously
democratic about ordering a title simply written and posted by
three children from the San Diego area. Anyone can publish on
MightyWorks _ for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Stephen King who forced me to squeeze a book into my
Palm Pilot. His e-novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' was unavailable
from Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and the other booksellers that
were overwhelmed by demand on the first day that the title was
offered free.
</P>
<P>
   To my great surprise, it was not uncomfortable to read a book by
clicking through page after page on the Palm Pilot's tiny screen,
which displays about one paragraph in large type. It takes a while
to grow accustomed to devouring a novel on a device more commonly
used to scan telephone numbers and calendars. The contrast of the
text and page on the screen seemed too dark for hours of reading.
It was also a laborious effort to peck out notes on its tiny
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, I could enlarge the text, making it much
easier on my eyes. By thinking of the small screen of text as
something akin to a newspaper column, I could adjust to the notion
of reading this way. Still, my mind wandered, and at night on the
couch I reached gratefully for a hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Microsoft has splashily released its own
version of an electronic reader, which illustrates the relentless
if not rapid progress taking place in this market. The text is in
color with much clearer resolution than the less expensive Palm
Pilot, but the price is daunting for a charter member of the
paperback generation: $500.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come are Gemstar's new prototypes of the eRocket book
and the SoftBook, which it is manufacturing for the fall in
partnership with the French electronics maker Thomson Multimedia.
Henry Yuen, Gemstar's chief executive, is visiting New York
publishing suites with the second-generation prototype of the
SoftBook, a slim 22-ounce version featuring a paperback-sized
screen, color text, a 50-book capacity and a stylus that can jot
down and erase notes. The price hasn't been set yet.
</P>
<P>
   Till then I content myself with Microsoft's offering. Standing
on the train, I set aside my Palm Pilot and check through the
Microsoft bookshelf, clicking through the Hans Christian Andersen's
classics ``The Emperor's New Clothes'' and ``The Match Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The naked emperor failed to maintain my attention, but perhaps
that story seemed all too familiar. The true test of e-book devices
is whether a reader can plunge into another world with abandon. And
for a few pages that retreat came with the scenes of the little
match girl, who gave me a chill as I imagined her dying on a street
corner, her frozen hands gripping spent matches.
</P>
<P>
   I had forgotten the device in my hand and no longer heard the
burr of strange clicks.

reading room for a novel stored in a Palm Pilot, which is smaller
than a paperback yet mighty enough to carry 12 digital titles.
</P>
<P>
   I turned to the beginning of Stephen King's novel ``The Girl Who
Loved Tom Gordon,'' which glowed from a screen a littler smaller
than a poker card and contained 1,409 miniature pages. The train
rumbling through its stops drowned out the faint cicada-like
clicking _ the digital equivalent of a page-turner.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, I've been experimenting with electronic
books in a personal quest to judge a book by its lack of a cover. I
embarked with baggage that would sag a bookshelf: words were made
to be inked. And the ultimate test of pleasure reading was the
plump couch test. Could you curl up with a pillow and good byte?
</P>
<P>
   The various e-book devices felt like solid hardcovers in hand,
but the first generation seemed stiff to me, somehow nerdy and
bulky. The cold gray screens of text didn't offer the hypnotic calm
of vanilla rag paper.
</P>
<P>
   Reading books on a PC felt too much like I was working, chained
upright to a desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback
revolution. I was drawn to the devices that offered one of the
basic elements of pocketbook design: portability.
</P>
<P>
   My first attempt was a mystery about a rakish serial killer,
which Penguin Putnam had offered as a teaser in an early version of
the Rocket eBook. The monochromatic text and page of the reading
device already seems a little primitive given the plans to
transform it by Gemstar. Since Penguin sent out only one chapter, I
still don't know whether the book was a click-turner.
</P>
<P>
   I have ordered titles from Zero Heure in Paris, a new electronic
publisher that delivers books in e-mail attachments, which can be
read on a computer or printed out. The books are the latest from
France and discounted as much as 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I've charged brief works of electronica from the bookseller
Fatbrain.com _ which has now transformed into MightyWords. One was
an illustrated children's book in the Chocolate-Covered Banana
series featuring a monkey named Tyco, which I submitted to a tough
critic, my 3-year-old daughter. There was something gloriously
democratic about ordering a title simply written and posted by
three children from the San Diego area. Anyone can publish on
MightyWorks _ for better or worse.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Stephen King who forced me to squeeze a book into my
Palm Pilot. His e-novella, ``Riding the Bullet,'' was unavailable
from Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and the other booksellers that
were overwhelmed by demand on the first day that the title was
offered free.
</P>
<P>
   To my great surprise, it was not uncomfortable to read a book by
clicking through page after page on the Palm Pilot's tiny screen,
which displays about one paragraph in large type. It takes a while
to grow accustomed to devouring a novel on a device more commonly
used to scan telephone numbers and calendars. The contrast of the
text and page on the screen seemed too dark for hours of reading.
It was also a laborious effort to peck out notes on its tiny
keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   But on the other hand, I could enlarge the text, making it much
easier on my eyes. By thinking of the small screen of text as
something akin to a newspaper column, I could adjust to the notion
of reading this way. Still, my mind wandered, and at night on the
couch I reached gratefully for a hardcover.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Microsoft has splashily released its own
version of an electronic reader, which illustrates the relentless
if not rapid progress taking place in this market. The text is in
color with much clearer resolution than the less expensive Palm
Pilot, but the price is daunting for a charter member of the
paperback generation: $500.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come are Gemstar's new prototypes of the eRocket book
and the SoftBook, which it is manufacturing for the fall in
partnership with the French electronics maker Thomson Multimedia.
Henry Yuen, Gemstar's chief executive, is visiting New York
publishing suites with the second-generation prototype of the
SoftBook, a slim 22-ounce version featuring a paperback-sized
screen, color text, a 50-book capacity and a stylus that can jot
down and erase notes. The price hasn't been set yet.
</P>
<P>
   Till then I content myself with Microsoft's offering. Standing
on the train, I set aside my Palm Pilot and check through the
Microsoft bookshelf, clicking through the Hans Christian Andersen's
classics ``The Emperor's New Clothes'' and ``The Match Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   The naked emperor failed to maintain my attention, but perhaps
that story seemed all too familiar. The true test of e-book devices
is whether a reader can plunge into another world with abandon. And
for a few pages that retreat came with the scenes of the little
match girl, who gave me a chill as I imagined her dying on a street
corner, her frozen hands gripping spent matches.
</P>
<P>
   I had forgotten the device in my hand and no longer heard the
burr of strange clicks.

   &UR; FOR SUNDAY AMs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, May 7:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   NIRELAND-DISARM (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ The Irish
Republican Army announced Saturday that it will soon begin
disarming. (Summary from wires.) By Warren Hoge.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-CHECHNYA (Moscow) _ Vladimir Kalamanov may have the
hardest job in Russia. As the Kremlin's special envoy for human
rights, his task is to persuade a skeptical West that Russia is
serious about ending human rights abuses in Chechnya. It is not
hard to see why it has been a hard sell. Despite numerous accounts
of pillaging, beatings and killings by Russian troops in Chechnya,
only a handful of cases have been investigated by military
prosecutors. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-ROMAN-RUINS (Belkis, Turkey) _ Here, as in several parts
of southern Turkey, water is rising inexorably around a doomed
village as an artificial lake builds up behind a new dam, part of
the government's ambitious plans to generate electric power and
irrigate vast areas of dry land. But in Belkis, the swelling waters
are not just disrupting lives. In the last few months,
archaeologists have found that an ancient city that once stood here
holds what many experts are calling one of the world's richest
collections of Roman mosaics. Much of it is about to disappear
before anyone has a chance to see it. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   With map.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-MADCOW (Buellas, France) _ The number of cases of mad cow
disease discovered in France has been climbing steadily. The totals
are still minuscule compared with those in Britain, which has
reported 178,000 cases of the deadly degenerative brain disease
since 1986. But what is alarming in France is that the numbers are
going up, even though preventive measures were introduced in 1991
and even stricter ones were ordered in 1996. By Suzanne Daley.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-PUBLISHER (Washington) _ For all the problems of Kosovo
today, Veton Surroi, the publisher of the province's largest
newspaper, reminds himself that things could be much worse. ``We
could have well ended up like the Kurds and made good posters for
Amnesty International,'' he said. Instead, Surroi, who is viewed by
many diplomats as a voice of reason in a traumatized corner of
Europe, is trying to shape what he hopes will one day be a civil
society. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-SERBS (Pristina, Yugoslavia) _ Ten months after they fled
the province in the face of revenge attacks from Kosovo Albanians,
the Serbs of Kosovo and other minorities are seeing international
political will swing in their favor. Preparations to help hundreds,
even thousands, of Serbs and Gypsies to return this summer are
gaining momentum and have sparked vigorous competition between
local Serbian leaders to reap the political rewards of bringing
people home. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   PEACEKEEPING-ZAMBIA (Lusaka, Zambia) _ The president of Zambia
said Saturday that the 200 Zambian peacekeepers taken hostage in
Sierra Leone had been deployed too quickly into unknown territory
with out of date maps and a shortage of other vital equipment. By
Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   SAFRICA-AIDS (Pretoria, South Africa) _ In a strikingly personal
speech, President Thabo Mbeki offered his first detailed
explanation of how he came to consult with two Americans who argue
that HIV does not cause AIDS. The decision, which became public two
months ago, quickly touched off a firestorm of criticism at home
and abroad. By Rachel L. Swarns.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA-LEONE (Dateline TK) _ Developments in the U.N. hostage
crisis. By Norimitsu Onishi.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO-U.N. (Kinshasa, Congo) _ Richard Holbrooke leads efforts
to set up a U.N. operation in Congo, a far huger nation than Sierra
Leone, which is to be patrolled by far fewer peacekeepers. By
Norimitsu Onishi and Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POLITICS (Tokyo) _ In the shadowy world of Japanese
politics true turning points can be difficult to spot. But in the
last few weeks, after the incapacitating stroke suffered by a
sitting prime minister, and the retirement from politics of a
former prime minister who was his mentor, Japanese politicians and
commentators have begun to speak of the end of a style of factional
politics that has been in force for 45 years. By Howard W. French.
</P>
<P>
   PUTIN-ST.PETERSBURG (St. Petersburg, Russia) _ The first time
Vladimir Putin deserted Moscow and staged a meeting with a visiting
head of state here, Russians hardly noticed. That was in March,
when Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain came to the city that
Peter the Great built. But the second time it happened, when Putin
flew here to meet Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori of Japan, tongues
started wagging that Putin was raising the status of his hometown
in a manner that touched the historical chord of rivalry between
Moscow and St. Petersburg. By Patrick E. Tyler.

<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-SAVINGS (Undated) _ Americans took home some 2.8 billion
prescriptions last year. They bought many of those medications as
members of managed care drug plans run by pharmacy benefit
managers, companies that arrange discounts from retail drugstores
and often operate mail-order pharmacies on behalf of employer
health plans. Now the pharmacy benefit management companies, or
PBMs, which handle drug benefits for 200 million Americans, are
being assigned an important role in widely discussed proposals to
add a drug benefit to Medicare. By Milt Freudenheim.
</P>
<P>
   TEAMSTERS-OVERNITE (Atlanta) _ The grueling Overnite
Transportation Co. strike has become James P. Hoffa's biggest labor
battle in his first year as Teamsters' president. It has become not
only one of the nation's most closely watched labor showdowns, but
also a brawl between a union renowned for its toughness and a
scrappy company that is showing just as much grit. Neither Hoffa
nor Overnite's parent company, Union Pacific, has offered the
slightest hint of blinking. By Steven Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   MILLION-MOM-MARCH (WESTMINSTER, Md.) _ After dealing with
exaggerated crowd estimates and warnings of disruption at the
recent World Bank protest in Washington, officials there are saying
the Million Mom March could prove the real sleeper protest of the
spring marching season. The multicity crowds from all manner of
family, kith and kin are determined to force the gun control issue
higher up the political agenda, led by mothers wheeling offspring
toward Capitol Hill in phalanxes of strollers. By Francis X.
Clines.
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GENOME-FRACAS (Undated) _ The 10-year project to decode the
human genome is entering its end game, but the high goal of
unlocking the secrets of human heredity is ending in a fractious
exchange of claims and countercharges. Within a few weeks, both
contestants in the genome race plan to declare victory, but on
different terms, each already judged imperfect by the rival team.
By Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-POLITICS (Washington) _ President Clinton has become a
crucial behind-the-scenes player in the 2000 campaign, serving as a
tactical adviser for House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates
around the country. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL-BRIEFS (Undated) _ Abortion politics,
Pennsylvania-style; Assessing the field, West Virginia-style; A
money-back offer from an incumbent; The god of money and the god of
Ohio; A prayer of thanks, a prayer of humility. By B. Drummond
Ayres Jr.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   EDUC-LEGISLATION (Washington) _ This week, the Senate delved
into the year's most important education bill. Democrats fashioned
a ``war room,'' where senators conducted on-line chats about
education. Republicans countered with snazzy charts and a steady
flow of news conferences. But behind all the razzle-dazzle lies one
startling possibility: This could be the first time in 35 years
that an education bill so bogs down over partisan differences that
it is vetoed by a president, if it does not get yanked from the
Senate floor altogether. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   JUDGE-DEFENSE (Washington) _ Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, the
chief federal trial judge in Washington, has hired a lawyer to
represent her before judicial and congressional inquiries into why
she assigned several criminal cases involving President Clinton's
associates to judges Clinton had appointed. The first act of the
lawyer, Michael Madigan, was to tell a Republican-led congressional
investigation that his client would decline to testify at any
congressional committee hearing into her behavior. By Neil A.
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON-HUMOR (Washington) _ Being funny at the annual
dinners of the Alfalfa Club, the Gridiron Club, and the
associations of White House and broadcast correspondents, has
become serious business in Washington. By John Files.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Think of cellular telephones, and you perhaps conjure up
thoughts of the man at the movie whose pocket starts ringing at a
gripping moment of drama, teen-agers chatting in front of their
school or the woman at the video store reading movie titles to her
jaded friend.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials in New York City had a different idea.
Responding to the killings of nine livery cabbies this year, they
announced that a program originally designed to distribute cell
phones to potential crime victims would be expanded to include the
drivers. The program, which was first devised for victims of
domestic violence, gave away 500 phones, all programmed to dial
911.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly viewed as a luxury item, these phones have become
commonplace in the last 15 years, and since the early 1990s they
have increasingly been regarded as an all-purpose cure-all for
individual safety. Today the notion of being wired in the
electronic age is shared not only by parent and child, but also by
salesman and client, cop and felon. Less certain is whether people
are really connected, really secure, or merely think they are.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the Arizona Foundation for Women is sponsoring a
local drive to give cellular phones to victims of domestic abuse.
In Winthrop, Maine, police have programmed cell phones to dial 911
and the friends and relatives of women who have been attacked by
their spouses and companions. In 1994, the New York Police
Department gave phones to crime-watch volunteers in two dangerous
parks. ``We don't need knives and guns and Mace,'' Michael Julian,
the department's chief of personnel, said at the time. ``We need a
way to call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maryland at College Park offers discounts to
students wanting to buy such phones. In part, the program was
established for the safety of the students, university officials
say. Parents also often give phones to children heading off to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the district attorney's office in
Brooklyn, where a recent rise in murders has been linked to
domestic violence, said such phones were not the answer to every
problem. But, Davitt added, ``For a victim, it removes the
isolation and the terror that often assists the perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these crimes happen one on one,'' he added, ``but this
puts a kind of electronic third person in the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, more than 80 million Americans have purchased cell
phones. A recent federal report noted that the sense of security
offered by cell phones is a major factor in the accelerated growth
of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 calls are placed to 911 and other emergency
numbers through cell phones each month in the United States,
according to industry reports. And nearly half the callers say they
have used the phones to report crime, car trouble, drunk drivers or
medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But to Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York state
Federation of Taxi Drivers, New York City's effort to get the
devices to each livery cab driver is an example of a good idea gone
too far and a waste of energy and resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have someone in the car with a gun to your head,''
Mateo said last week, ``for you to dial 911 and be able to speak
will be pretty tough. By the time the drivers finish answering all
the questions, they will be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, argue that the presence of cell phones in the
cabs might discourage criminals from singling out drivers, who are
being required to install bulletproof partitions that separate the
front seat of the car from the back.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal sociologist at San Diego State University, William C.
Kennedy, said perception in crime fighting is often as important as
reality, noting that cell phones make people feel safer _ whether
on highways and in alleys _ and may make criminals more hesitant to
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that once a crime is under way, the phones often do
little more than create ``a false impression of safety.'' Some
people ``say they would never walk down a certain street without
their cell phone,'' he said. ``Unless you are going to use it has a
hammer, it is probably not going to do you much good.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most criminals act quickly, preventing people from using their
phones to call for help, he said. The phones are most effectively
used to report crimes being committed against another person,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   To many young people, a cellular phone is the latest high-tech
toy offering entree into the cool club, much like the beeper craze
of the last decade. But others see it is as essential for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Jaimie Kent, a 21-year-old Duke University junior from River
Vale, N.J., bought her cell phone about four years ago, around the
same time she received her driver's license. ``It was mainly a
safety thing _ just when I was driving on the highways by myself,''
Kent said in an interview last week. ``I could call if my car broke
down.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, 1999, while home on winter break, Kent was driving on
a rural road when, she said, she ``literally got a stomach flu that
came over me as I was driving home and I started to pull over to
stop, and I blacked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The next thing she remembered was the sound of tapping.
``Someone was knocking on my window, I woke up, and she was able to
use my cell phone to call my mom,'' Kent said. It took all the
strength she could muster, Kent added, to give her Good Samaritan
the telephone number to reach Kent's mother, who came to get her.
</P>
<P>
   Kent understands the limitations of her phone, she said. But
regardless of whether it will protect her from a criminal, she says
she sees it, in many ways, as her digital security blanket.

gripping moment of drama, teen-agers chatting in front of their
school or the woman at the video store reading movie titles to her
jaded friend.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, officials in New York City had a different idea.
Responding to the killings of nine livery cabbies this year, they
announced that a program originally designed to distribute cell
phones to potential crime victims would be expanded to include the
drivers. The program, which was first devised for victims of
domestic violence, gave away 500 phones, all programmed to dial
911.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly viewed as a luxury item, these phones have become
commonplace in the last 15 years, and since the early 1990s they
have increasingly been regarded as an all-purpose cure-all for
individual safety. Today the notion of being wired in the
electronic age is shared not only by parent and child, but also by
salesman and client, cop and felon. Less certain is whether people
are really connected, really secure, or merely think they are.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, the Arizona Foundation for Women is sponsoring a
local drive to give cellular phones to victims of domestic abuse.
In Winthrop, Maine, police have programmed cell phones to dial 911
and the friends and relatives of women who have been attacked by
their spouses and companions. In 1994, the New York Police
Department gave phones to crime-watch volunteers in two dangerous
parks. ``We don't need knives and guns and Mace,'' Michael Julian,
the department's chief of personnel, said at the time. ``We need a
way to call for help.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Maryland at College Park offers discounts to
students wanting to buy such phones. In part, the program was
established for the safety of the students, university officials
say. Parents also often give phones to children heading off to
college.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the district attorney's office in
Brooklyn, where a recent rise in murders has been linked to
domestic violence, said such phones were not the answer to every
problem. But, Davitt added, ``For a victim, it removes the
isolation and the terror that often assists the perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these crimes happen one on one,'' he added, ``but this
puts a kind of electronic third person in the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1983, more than 80 million Americans have purchased cell
phones. A recent federal report noted that the sense of security
offered by cell phones is a major factor in the accelerated growth
of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500,000 calls are placed to 911 and other emergency
numbers through cell phones each month in the United States,
according to industry reports. And nearly half the callers say they
have used the phones to report crime, car trouble, drunk drivers or
medical emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But to Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York state
Federation of Taxi Drivers, New York City's effort to get the
devices to each livery cab driver is an example of a good idea gone
too far and a waste of energy and resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have someone in the car with a gun to your head,''
Mateo said last week, ``for you to dial 911 and be able to speak
will be pretty tough. By the time the drivers finish answering all
the questions, they will be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Others, however, argue that the presence of cell phones in the
cabs might discourage criminals from singling out drivers, who are
being required to install bulletproof partitions that separate the
front seat of the car from the back.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal sociologist at San Diego State University, William C.
Kennedy, said perception in crime fighting is often as important as
reality, noting that cell phones make people feel safer _ whether
on highways and in alleys _ and may make criminals more hesitant to
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy said that once a crime is under way, the phones often do
little more than create ``a false impression of safety.'' Some
people ``say they would never walk down a certain street without
their cell phone,'' he said. ``Unless you are going to use it has a
hammer, it is probably not going to do you much good.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most criminals act quickly, preventing people from using their
phones to call for help, he said. The phones are most effectively
used to report crimes being committed against another person,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   To many young people, a cellular phone is the latest high-tech
toy offering entree into the cool club, much like the beeper craze
of the last decade. But others see it is as essential for safety.
</P>
<P>
   Jaimie Kent, a 21-year-old Duke University junior from River
Vale, N.J., bought her cell phone about four years ago, around the
same time she received her driver's license. ``It was mainly a
safety thing _ just when I was driving on the highways by myself,''
Kent said in an interview last week. ``I could call if my car broke
down.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 3, 1999, while home on winter break, Kent was driving on
a rural road when, she said, she ``literally got a stomach flu that
came over me as I was driving home and I started to pull over to
stop, and I blacked out.''
</P>
<P>
   The next thing she remembered was the sound of tapping.
``Someone was knocking on my window, I woke up, and she was able to
use my cell phone to call my mom,'' Kent said. It took all the
strength she could muster, Kent added, to give her Good Samaritan
the telephone number to reach Kent's mother, who came to get her.
</P>
<P>
   Kent understands the limitations of her phone, she said. But
regardless of whether it will protect her from a criminal, she says
she sees it, in many ways, as her digital security blanket.

   There is nothing like a blank screen to spark one's imagination.
It is the Rorschach test of the information age. And never more so
than last week, when the ABC channel on Time Warner cable systems
in seven markets went blank.
</P>
<P>
   ABC devotees in 3.5 million homes, confronted with a blue screen
and scrolling Time Warner propaganda, may have thought about the
celebrities they would not see. Marketers of satellite dishes
probably contemplated fatter sales figures. And federal lawmakers
and regulators could ponder how to prevent the gatekeepers of the
information castle from pulling up the drawbridge and leaving the
public outside.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, for those who have believed in
technology's implied promise of an information utopia, in which
people can see or hear or read whatever they want (and show or tell
or write whatever they want), it was an uncomfortable reminder: the
more information available, the more places in which it is
available, the more the logic of economics and egos will come into
play to restrict it.
</P>
<P>
   As Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said in a
speech to the Mercer Law School in Georgia in March,
``paradoxically, the effect of more information becoming more
available more quickly may be less information being made public at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider the evidence for Abrams' paradox. Last week, to gain
leverage in its contract dispute over the terms under which it
could carry ABC, which is owned by Walt Disney Co., Time Warner
pulled the plug on ABC's signal.
</P>
<P>
   During the negotiations _ Disney was seeking to make its Disney
Channel part of Time Warner's basic service and to get the cable
systems to carry its Toon Disney and Soap channels _ Disney
sometimes engaged in brinkmanship. In the Houston market, Disney
came within minutes of letting Time Warner's right to carry its
programming lapse. If it had done so, it would have pulled the plug
on itself.
</P>
<P>
   Disney was offering more programming (which in turn would bring
it more advertisements and more revenue). Time Warner's cable
system is capable of carrying scores of channels. But both media
giants, under the terms of the laws, regulations and contracts
governing their business, could serve as gatekeepers and black out
the signal. More information, or less? Or more information and more
choke points where it can be shut off?
</P>
<P>
   In other situations, the promise of open access to free
information has also produced a backlash:
</P>
<P>
   _ APBNews.com, a Web site specializing in covering crime stories
and the legal system, filed a Freedom of Information Act request
for all the financial disclosure statements filed by federal
judges. At first, the financial disclosure committee of the
Judicial Conference of the United States rejected the request,
citing judges' concerns that unstable or unsavory people could
obtain their addresses or the names of family members. In March,
the Judicial Conference ruled that the reports could not be
withheld ``simply because they are going to be placed on the
Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Associated Press, Reuters and three other international
news agencies preparing to cover the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney
were asked in January if they would wait an hour before making
results available to commercial Web sites, including their own, and
if they would credit IBM and Swatch when reporting the results. The
AP argued that the results are raw data, not subject to copyright
protections.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the director of communications and
new media for the International Olympic Committee, withdrew the
requests for the time being. He maintains that copyright
protections extend to ``the tabulation'' of results, if not the
results themselves. ``The agencies want to take the real-time
results and resend it, with no value added, to other Web sites _
and give us no compensation,'' he said. ``And those Web sites would
be competitive with our Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Association of Research Libraries and various teachers'
organizations are fighting legislation that would provide
electronic databases with copyright-like protections. Leslie
Harris, a lawyer who represents some teacher groups, said, ``You
want protections to encourage creation of intellectual property,
but you also want to encourage dissemination of information in a
free society.'' She added, ``As we migrate online, the traditional
ability of my clients to say, `Great article on Martin Luther King
Day; I'll make 15 copies for my class' may not be possible.''
</P>
<P>
   In such cases, laws governing intellectual property and freedom
of information overlap with the laws governing information
distribution systems and the antitrust laws. Which is not
surprising, since a basic premise of the information age is that
information itself has economic value.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably, it is a matter of civic interest if television viewers
are barred from receiving ABC News programming. The issue for the
Federal Communications Commission, though, was not the free flow of
information, but the fact that the plug was pulled during sweeps
month, when stations measure their audiences to determine what to
charge advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   If a city council wants to force a cable carrier to carry any
Internet service provider, it is a matter of business regulation.
(Federal judges in Oregon and Virginia have come to opposite
conclusions on the propriety of such actions.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is a matter of copyright law if the
National Football League objects when a reporter from The St. Paul
Pioneer Press gives real-time coverage on a Vikings game via the
newspaper's Web site. And a matter of competition, since the NFL
also has its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in Release 1.0, Esther Dyson's technology
newsletter, the Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig said: ``The
original architecture of the Net gave great freedom to perfect
competition. But we're seeing an erosion of that freedom now.''

LIBERTIES: HILLARY, MORE OR LESS?  
 BY MAUREEN DOWD  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``West Wing'' company was in Washington last week, filming
around the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin, the show's producer and writer, dropped by the New
York Times bureau for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The political reporters, who love the ``West Wing,'' offered one
suggestion. Why not make the peripheral first lady, played by
Stockard Channing, more central?
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin replied that he wanted the focus to be on the staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly, said a reporter. In most modern White Houses, who has
been the catalyst for the worst staff psychoses?
</P>
<P>
   Who is the one staffers tiptoe around, run from, kowtow to, have
nightmares about, get their jobs from, get fired by, see shrinks
about, turn henchmen for and secretively try to win to their side
of an argument, hoping to get a pillow-talk advantage?
</P>
<P>
   It's Herself.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in Washington knows the first lady is The Man.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, except Hillary Clinton, who belittles her
current job in her quest for a new one.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than a first lady,'' is the mantra of her first Senate
ad.
</P>
<P>
   If she is more, doesn't that make all the others, including her
idol Eleanor, mere?
</P>
<P>
   The ad is a little astounding because it finally blurts out what
we suspected Hillary felt all along: that she was entitled to more,
that being the most powerful woman in American politics for eight
years was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   The East Wing was too small _ and too frilly. She had her eyes
on other wings.
</P>
<P>
   She underestimates her job's unique aura. Ed Rollins, the Reagan
White House official who took many orders from Nancy Reagan, wryly
notes: ``I've never been afraid of a U.S. senator, but I've been
extremely fearful of first ladies.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary's new slogan has an unfortunate ring. It underscores the
image of the Clintons as inexorable.
</P>
<P>
   And the slogan was just another weird moment in a
transcendentally weird race. The week escalated the contest of
estranged marriages.
</P>
<P>
   First the Democratic candidate erased her married name on
posters and now she's trying to erase her tenure as first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The wife of the Republican candidate had also dropped her
married name and distanced herself from her first ladydom.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't anybody except Bob Dole want to be a first lady anymore?
</P>
<P>
   The Hillary ad, which does not show or mention anyone named
Bill, is meant to convey that Mrs. Clinton is more than a Mrs.:
``First she became a lawyer, named one of the top 100 in America,''
the narrator says. ``Her first cause was children, fighting abuse,
and chairing the board of the Children's Defense Fund. ... More
than a first lady. ... Hillary. ...''
</P>
<P>
   A picture of Hillary during her Rose Law Firm days flashes on
the screen. As if the glow of the Rose Law Firm were rosier than
the glow of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary's resume, pre-first lady, may not be as impressive as
she thinks it is. This self-described activist for a better world
was more of a Reagan-era yuppie lawyer with an eye for the main
chance. Sitting at the right hand of Marian Wright Edelman does not
entitle someone to a seat in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   There is another quintessentially Clintonian quality to
Hillary's slogan: She's triangulating against herself. Even as she
dismisses the importance of first ladyhood, she reminds voters of
the special prominence of the position.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the message is: vote for her because she's more than
the first lady, or vote for her because she is the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Democrats in New York enticed her into this race
because they believed that her celebrity as first lady would mean a
win. But here she is, suddenly venting her hate-hate relationship
with her retro job title.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was anything but a prisoner in the white satin jail, as
it's been called. She had a shot at being more than a first lady
while she was first lady. In 1993, she could have transformed
health care in America and the first ladyship at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   But her plan was so big, unwieldy, bureaucratic and secretive
that it flopped.
</P>
<P>
   If only she had known that sometimes less can be more. Now she
might be running on her title instead of running from it.
</P>
<P>
   Just think, her slogan might be ``The Lady Is The Man.''

FEEDING AMERICA'S CRAVING FOR VALUE

<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been a season of dizzying highs, record lows and amateurs
rushing in.
</P>
<P>
   The public cannot help but be mesmerized by twin roller coaster
rides: the dazzling parallel arcs of the Nasdaq world and the world
of antiques. Both offer the irresistible possibility that, despite
the fact that America has always loved ``The Price Is Right,'' the
price is actually wrong. It's higher.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market gives amateur investors the impression that the
thing to own is the new, new thing. ``Antiques Roadshow'' gives
amateur appraisers the impression that the thing to own is the old,
old thing.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical moment from ``Antiques Roadshow,'' the most popular
program on public television, a woman brought in a glass lamp
purchased for $125. An expert told her the lamp was worth $125,000.
Just like the little companies on the Nasdaq, the little lamp was
suddenly, for no apparent reason, worth 1,000 times what it was
supposed to be. And like the little companies, little lamps could
be traded online: eBay soon let Web surfers go antiquing, and even
Sotheby's and Christie's brought their gavels to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, everyone and his grandmother were buying on margin
and ransacking virtual yard sales. The declining American ability
to focus was colliding with the ascending national economy,
resulting in a new model for success, a little like Horatio Alger
without the attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the nosedives and scandals. The stock market fell. The
auction house giants Christie's and Sotheby's, like the Nasdaq
giant Microsoft, became the subjects of antitrust inquiries by the
Justice Department, which accused them of price-fixing and
collusion. Heart-rending scenes from ``Antiques Roadshow'' were
revealed to be staged. The man who couldn't believe that his Civil
War-era sword was worth $35,000 and said he once carved a
watermelon with it was not the owner of the sword, but a friend of
the appraiser.
</P>
<P>
   The program's producers removed the appraiser from all reruns.
They also spliced out a woman who brought in a $250,000 helmet and
then mysteriously disappeared amid rumors that the helmet was not
hers. And eBay, the spiritual home of a nation of appraisers, is
now the subject of three local and federal investigations.

   But the bidding continues. Aspiring analysts can play stock
games on Web sites, winning prizes for speculator of the month.
Aspiring appraisers can read trade secrets in Carol Prisant's
``Antiques Roadshow Primer'' and make estimates interactively on
the PBS Internet site. On the cable channel HGTV, they can watch
``Appraise It!'' or ``The Great Antiques Hunt,'' a program that
combines elements of roadshow and game show. Contestants choose
antiques at a fair and win points based on the value of their
selections. They also estimate the cost of estate jewelry, identify
furniture and guess the ages of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to ``The Price Is Right,'' where contestants pride
themselves on knowing what things actually cost, contestants on
``The Great Antiques Hunt'' revel in imagining what things might
bring.
</P>
<P>
   At first the fascination with old-world beauty seemed a reaction
to the high-technology revolution. Technophobes and neo-Victorians
alarmed by life in a cold electronic age grew nostalgic for the
comfort of physical design. Traditionalists perturbed by the mass
of paper wealth and new money yearned for the nobility of good
taste.
</P>
<P>
   The British, who originally gave America Christie's and
Sotheby's, also exported ``Antiques Roadshow,'' ``The Great
Antiques Hunt'' and (after making the questions easier) ``Who Wants
to Be a Millionaire,'' spreading the reassuring notion that riches
can flow from collecting or knowing arcana.
</P>
<P>
   But strangely enough this obsession with the old has also been
fueled by new technology: the Internet has given collectors novel
and ideal ways of interacting. By reaching mass audiences, the Net
has driven up the prices of some collectibles even as it has driven
down the prices of everyday items.
</P>
<P>
   On eBay, as contemporary alchemists turn Pez dispensers into
gold, those obsessed with the old and those obsessed with the new
exchange bric-a-brac. A Sumerian fertility amulet dating from 3000
B.C. can find new buyers in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   In a larger sense, the fascination with old and new are part of
the same mania. Both roller coasters promise accessibility,
immediacy and the wonder of hidden value. With the democratization
of investing, anyone can order shares of Qualcomm while sitting
home in a bathrobe. And the formerly insular antiques world has
come to the public, intimating that those with an eye for talent
can spot the value not only of the next Intel but of the tarnished
teapot in the attic.
</P>
<P>
   Professional appraisers on television sometimes take up to
several hours off camera checking a research library. But the
viewers don't see the work involved, only the result, as a moldy
footstool morphs into a small fortune in a matter of seconds. This
is better than reality television: it's television edited to
celebrate reality. In a flash, the pompous owner of a fake Faberge
egg is humiliated; the unassuming bearer of a genuine Regency box
is exalted.
</P>
<P>
   The forces at work here are more poignant than mere greed. The
fantasy of ``Antiques Roadshow'' is that the chair you loved
because your Aunt Tillie gave it to you might also bring in six
figures. It is the fantasy that sentimental value can translate
into market value, that feelings and family bonds can matter in a
material world. It's the fantasy that our old stuff is worth
something and that, by extension, we are, too. Going on ``Antiques
Roadshow'' is like holding an emotional IPO for your garage _ an
expert can tell you that you're worth more than you previously
suspected.
</P>
<P>
   Such fantasies reveal how yet another British import, Harry
Potter, has become the best-selling fairy tale of the moment.
Readers cherish the idea that a boy neglected in the everyday world
has magical powers and fancy lineage in a parallel, enchanted
realm. There, eccentricities can turn out to be talents, weird
relatives can turn out to be brilliant wizards and the worthless
can become powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The public wants to be transported to that place, where the
money-losing start-up venture becomes a dot-com to watch and the
rickety armchair in the corner is transformed into a priceless
heirloom. Losers can become winners, not only of net worth but of
self-worth: by all accounts, a happy ending.

<P>
   It has been a season of dizzying highs, record lows and amateurs
rushing in.
</P>
<P>
   The public cannot help but be mesmerized by twin roller coaster
rides: the dazzling parallel arcs of the Nasdaq world and the world
of antiques. Both offer the irresistible possibility that, despite
the fact that America has always loved ``The Price Is Right,'' the
price is actually wrong. It's higher.
</P>
<P>
   The bull market gives amateur investors the impression that the
thing to own is the new, new thing. ``Antiques Roadshow'' gives
amateur appraisers the impression that the thing to own is the old,
old thing.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical moment from ``Antiques Roadshow,'' the most popular
program on public television, a woman brought in a glass lamp
purchased for $125. An expert told her the lamp was worth $125,000.
Just like the little companies on the Nasdaq, the little lamp was
suddenly, for no apparent reason, worth 1,000 times what it was
supposed to be. And like the little companies, little lamps could
be traded online: eBay soon let Web surfers go antiquing, and even
Sotheby's and Christie's brought their gavels to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, everyone and his grandmother were buying on margin
and ransacking virtual yard sales. The declining American ability
to focus was colliding with the ascending national economy,
resulting in a new model for success, a little like Horatio Alger
without the attention span.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the nosedives and scandals. The stock market fell. The
auction house giants Christie's and Sotheby's, like the Nasdaq
giant Microsoft, became the subjects of antitrust inquiries by the
Justice Department, which accused them of price-fixing and
collusion. Heart-rending scenes from ``Antiques Roadshow'' were
revealed to be staged. The man who couldn't believe that his Civil
War-era sword was worth $35,000 and said he once carved a
watermelon with it was not the owner of the sword, but a friend of
the appraiser.
</P>
<P>
   The program's producers removed the appraiser from all reruns.
They also spliced out a woman who brought in a $250,000 helmet and
then mysteriously disappeared amid rumors that the helmet was not
hers. And eBay, the spiritual home of a nation of appraisers, is
now the subject of three local and federal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   But the bidding continues. Aspiring analysts can play stock
games on Web sites, winning prizes for speculator of the month.
Aspiring appraisers can read trade secrets in Carol Prisant's
``Antiques Roadshow Primer'' and make estimates interactively on

   WASHINGTON _ Ten years after recapturing Europe, Dwight D.
Eisenhower calculated that the lessons of D-Day could be usefully
applied in persuading Congress to lace the land with highways. His
administration dreamed up the National System of Interstate and
Defense Highways and argued that these roads were not only about
economic development, they were about national security.
</P>
<P>
   ``In case of atomic attack on our key cities,'' he wrote in
1955, ``the road net must permit quick evacuation of target areas,
mobilization of defense forces and maintenance of every essential
economic function.''
</P>
<P>
   Half a century later, the highways he built can barely handle a
5 p.m. crush of commuters in their SUVs, much less a panicky
evacuation of the capital. But if he were alive today, the old
five-star might smile to hear the latest Clinton White House
strategy. The president and his national security adviser, Samuel
R. Berger, have taken up a mantra that granting permanent
``normal'' trading status to China isn't just about profit
opportunities, it's also about national security. At the same time,
the administration has labeled the AIDS crisis in Africa a threat
to national security, and Vice President Al Gore has raised similar
fears with his ``new security agenda,'' which includes global
warming.
</P>
<P>
   Without question there is a case to be made that economic chaos,
disease and climatic upheaval can all trigger political nastiness.
So all of this new labeling raises a question: Just when does a big
problem turn into a national security threat?
</P>
<P>
   On trade with China, the Clinton administration argument is that
granting normal trade status would reassure the Chinese that
America isn't trying to hem them in.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a national security point of view, it would in my view be
a very, very unwise and precarious move to say that the United
States doesn't care whether they're part of the world community or
not,'' President Clinton told an insurance group last week, a theme
he repeated nightly as he tried to win over 40 or so legislators
who were still undecided about the China bill.
</P>
<P>
   Only days before, the White House was arguing that the spread of
AIDS in Africa would lead to economic collapse, political
instability and civil wars that might eventually require American
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying that we have a short list of national security
threats and East Timor is now off and AIDS is on it,'' Berger said
in an interview. But strife has many origins, he said: ``If it
creates instability, chaos, conflict and war, that has national
security implications.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, used a foreign policy speech last weekend to
argue for the need for ``forward engagement'' (presumably a
Gore-ism for trying to think ahead). He ticked off _ in no
particular order of priority _ pandemics, economic inequality,
global warming and the digital divide as potential security
problems that had to be nipped in the bud.
</P>
<P>
   In Gore's case, the political calculation is obvious: he is
trying to portray his opponent, George W. Bush, as a man caught in
what he termed a cold-war mindset that sees national security only
in the most conventional terms.
</P>
<P>
   But it is still unclear whether the new Democratic relabeling of
issues is just shrewd political marketing _ to Democrats who don't
like trade deals, and to Republicans who don't care for foreign
aid, particularly when it involves AIDS _ or a truly new agenda for
an age of new global threats.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell. As the Clinton presidency winds down, the
definition of national security threats has gotten ever fuzzier.
Even some senior members of the administration worry privately that
the White House regularly overplays its hand and should reserve the
national security argument for events tightly linked to the
prospect of the United States becoming involved in conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a significant risk of crying wolf,'' one of the
president's top security advisers concedes. ``This isn't Sputnik,''
he added, in another allusion to the Eisenhower years, when appeals
for education funds could be based on fears that the Russians were
well ahead in the race to build the first ICBMs.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly there is a strong moral argument for helping the
destitute ravaged by AIDS, in Africa or elsewhere. And no doubt the
disease could lead to political instability. But so can poverty,
and the 1.3 billion people who live on less than a dollar a day
trigger meetings at the World Bank these days, not in the Situation
Room.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Bush, eager to portray the current occupants of the
White House as long on butter and short on guns, carry the argument
one step further: by making the list of security threats too long,
they argue, the Clinton administration risks taking its eye off
more imminent threats.
</P>
<P>
   Or as Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the school of Advanced
International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and one of those
advisers, wrote recently, AIDS in Africa and the environment are
serious problems, but calling them national security threats
carries ``the implication that conventional security is no longer
something we need to worry much about.''

   But this is also an administration repeatedly stung by the
criticism that its foreign policy has been a series of belated
reactions, rather than the product of any global strategy. So
Americans may be ready to welcome anything resembling preparation
for new crises, as long as it differentiates between real security
threats, potential threats and social work. And it is possible _
though hardly certain _ that after a decade of unchallenged power
and prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national
security in broader terms.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, any serious official who argued that admitting
Communist China into a Western trade regime might change China's
political culture would have been laughed out of the National
Security Council. Today, even some Republicans sound a lot like
Clinton when it comes to talking about the benefits of exposing
China to a Western-designed legal system or fueling the spread of
the Internet. ``China's emergence as a world power is a classic
security issue,'' said Richard Armitage, who has served several
Republican presidents, ``and if getting them into the world trading
system makes them more restrained, a better actor, then I'm for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most potent argument may be the one he hasn't made in
public, chiefly to avoid offending two of America's closest allies
. In the first half of the 20th century, Germany and Japan lashed
out in large part because they felt the world was constraining not
only their military might, but their ability to manufacture and
export. Any global system that reduces trade barriers, the theory
goes, also deflates some of those pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But noneconomic forces also cause wars, and it is a mistake,
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers acknowledges, to
``overemphasize the link between economic forces and future
conflict.'' Perhaps that is why Clinton and Berger last week opened
a new front in the China argument.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than argue the economic and political benefits of getting
China into the tent, they made the case that keeping it out would
court disaster _ that insulting China would strengthen the hand of
the People's Liberation Army in its battle over China's direction
with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, the leader of China's move to a
market economy. But if the Chinese economy opens too quickly _
forcing tens or hundreds of millions of workers in inefficient
state-owned enterprises out of work _ Zhu could be blamed for that,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks of the logic, Clinton's national security
case for letting China into the World Trade Organization seems to
be winning some converts. ``The AFL-CIO has an answer to the
economic arguments about this deal,'' one undecided congressman _
who asked not to be named _ said last week. ``But they don't have
any answers on the security side.'' On the other hand, the effort
to reclassify AIDS seems to have fallen flat. No one in either
party is talking about reallocating the trillions saved by the
Soviet Union's fall on international AIDS programs, or any other
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   But China trade may be different. Eisenhower's highway system is
now crumbling, and members of Congress want it fixed. A few who are
on the fence about China have suggested that the place to fix the
Interstate System is in their districts before Election Day. That
might make them more amenable to the Clinton view of national
security.

system makes them more restrained, a better actor, then I'm for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's most potent argument may be the one he hasn't made in
public, chiefly to avoid offending two of America's closest allies
. In the first half of the 20th century, Germany and Japan lashed
out in large part because they felt the world was constraining not
only their military might, but their ability to manufacture and
export. Any global system that reduces trade barriers, the theory
goes, also deflates some of those pressures.
</P>
<P>
   But noneconomic forces also cause wars, and it is a mistake,
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers acknowledges, to
``overemphasize the link between economic forces and future
conflict.'' Perhaps that is why Clinton and Berger last week opened
a new front in the China argument.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than argue the economic and political benefits of getting
China into the tent, they made the case that keeping it out would
court disaster _ that insulting China would strengthen the hand of
the People's Liberation Army in its battle over China's direction
with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, the leader of China's move to a
market economy. But if the Chinese economy opens too quickly _
forcing tens or hundreds of millions of workers in inefficient
state-owned enterprises out of work _ Zhu could be blamed for that,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever one thinks of the logic, Clinton's national security
case for letting China into the World Trade Organization seems to
be winning some converts. ``The AFL-CIO has an answer to the
economic arguments about this deal,'' one undecided congressman _
who asked not to be named _ said last week. ``But they don't have
any answers on the security side.'' On the other hand, the effort
to reclassify AIDS seems to have fallen flat. No one in either
party is talking about reallocating the trillions saved by the
Soviet Union's fall on international AIDS programs, or any other
foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
   But China trade may be different. Eisenhower's highway system is
now crumbling, and members of Congress want it fixed. A few who are
on the fence about China have suggested that the place to fix the
Interstate System is in their districts before Election Day. That
might make them more amenable to the Clinton view of national
security.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here is the problem in theory: A good job on the
night shift opens up. A mother with several children is not offered
the job, which would be a promotion, because her supervisor assumes
_ wrongly _ that her family responsibilities prevent her from
working nights.
</P>
<P>
   Did the supervisor act properly?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anyone would say so. Certainly the mother is the only one
who knows whether she is able to work nights.
</P>
<P>
   Should the supervisor's action be against the law?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely, in President Clinton's view.
</P>
<P>
   Is the problem pervasive?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows for sure.
</P>
<P>
   It is the kind of problem Clinton loves to address _ the way he
has promoted school uniforms to improve classroom discipline and
V-chips to block violent programs on television.
</P>
<P>
   His solutions cost little. They endear him to his admirers. And
his political foes often seem to have been outsmarted.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, with a stroke of his pen, Clinton ordered an end
to discrimination against federal workers because they are parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, there are still some employers who are
reluctant to hire or to promote employees who have children at
home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His order, he said, sent this message: ``No glass ceiling for
parents. The job they are doing at home is more important anyway,
and if they can do your job, you ought not to stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   The key phrase is ``if they can do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   No one would argue seriously, for example, that because an
employee cannot work nights, the government should be required by
law to create a day-side promotion.
</P>
<P>
   A more difficult question is what happens when two people are in
competition for employment or a promotion _ a single person who can
work long hours and a parent who cannot afford to. Is it
discrimination if the long hours are rewarded? Or is it
discrimination if they are not?
</P>
<P>
   The practical effect of the executive order on those kinds of
common situations is far from clear. The White House could not
offer a single case of discrimination in the past that the
president's executive order would now prohibit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither could the federal workers' union, the American
Federation of Government Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Russ Binion, the president of Local 12, to which Labor
Department employees belong, said, ``I know people don't get
assignments because they have kids, but I can't give you a specific
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The staff member who developed the policy, Bruce Reed, the
president's chief domestic policy adviser, conceded that he did not
know whether this kind of bias was a problem in the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that this is not a widespread practice,'' Reed said,
``but we'd like to be on the safe side.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive order was welcomed in some circles as a symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good thing the president did, because it's a
marker,'' said Judith L. Lichtman, president of the National
Partnership for Women and Families, a liberal advocacy group.
``This is how you get the conversation to change about what is
acceptable and unacceptable behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   But as so often happens here, the president's political
opponents were infuriated. It would be hard to overestimate the
rage Bill Clinton ignites in some quarters nowadays, even over an
executive order that may have no effect whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   The response from Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., R-Okla., chairman of the
House Republican Conference, was typical:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the latest meaningless proposal from an administration
desperately searching for a legacy that will endure after the
evening news ends. Having already claimed credit for solving every
problem under the sun, the Clinton-Gore team has apparently taken
to espousing solutions in search of new problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton first broached the issue in his State of the Union
Message last year. As part of a long list of proposals involving
children and families, he declared:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to
hire or promote workers simply because they have children. That is
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   On the president's behalf, Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., and
Christopher J. Dodd, D-Conn., introduced legislation last year that
would have prohibited discrimination against parents by all
employers. The bill went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   So, unable to win support for a national policy, the president
issued the executive order, which applies only to federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Its range is narrow.
</P>
<P>
   Parents would not be guaranteed any jobs. Someone who could not
work long hours because of family obligations would not have to be
offered a position that required overtime. A worker who was not
always free to travel could not expect a position that often
required last-minute trips. A supervisor would be free to
discipline an employee who was often late because child-care
arrangements fell through.
</P>
<P>
   It is harder to ascertain what the order would do than what it
would not do. White House officials made clear that the order sets
a goal and does not give anyone the right to sue the government.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would certainly not alleviate the stress many
parents face balancing the responsibilities of work and family.
</P>
<P>
   It would not seem to help, for instance, a clerk at the Labor
Department, a single mother who asked when she was interviewed last
week that her name not be used, who said she was sure she had been
denied a promotion recently because of her family obligations. When
pressed, she acknowledged that she had fallen behind in her work
because she had taken so much unpaid leave to deal with a
daughter's illness.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't interfere in any way,'' said Joe Lockhart, the
president's press secretary, ``with an employer's ability to reject
workers who aren't able to perform a job in question. It would
simply ensure that workers aren't discriminated against on the
basis of being a parent.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem may be that this kind of discrimination is simply
too subtle to prove.

   The camera TILTS DOWN to reveal seven people, castaways perhaps,
sitting on the beach of an uncharted desert island. They seem
stranded. They also look familiar. Gentle trade winds fan the palm
trees behind them.
</P>
<P>
   THEME MUSIC UP AND OUT.
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Now let me get this straight. CBS says we can vote each
other off the island?
</P>
<P>
   THE PROFESSOR: Yes, Skipper, that's right.
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: So we can vote against people we don't like? But why?
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Well, it's part of the new trend toward what you
might call ``reality-based game programming,'' Skipper. They maroon
a group of real people, contestants, on an island like this. They
keep hundreds of cameras and microphones pointed at them 24 hours a
day to record everything they say and do. People are voted out of
the group one by one. After a few weeks their small society, a
microcosm of the world at large if you will, devolves into
something out of ``Lord of the Flies.'' CBS awards the final
contestant a million dollars or something.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Gee, Skipper, a million dollars!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER (Hits Gilligan hard with his hat): Pipe down!
</P>
<P>
   GINGER: I don't think that's entertaining at all!
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: Neither do I! It's just mean. And discourteous.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON HOWELL III: A million dollars? Hah! I carry more than
that folded in my cummerbund.
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY HOWELL: It does seem, well, rather uncharitable.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: It was originally produced in Europe. ...
</P>
<P>
   ALL: Ohhhhhhhhhh.
</P>
<P>
   They sit quietly for a few moments, the only SOUND the WAVES
LAPPING AT THE SAND.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: And television in general is becoming more Darwinian,
I venture, ``survival of the fittest'' now defining both content
qua content and the larger issues of vertically integrated
corporate performance vis-a-vis media gigantism and economies of
relative scale _
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER (interrupting): I vote the professor off the island!
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: But I was just ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Do you have any idea how sick to death we are of your
endless lectures? Of your crypto-intellectual condescension?
</P>
<P>
   ALL: Yeah!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: You're useless to us! You can make a linear particle
accelerator out of two mangos and a clam shell, but in 35 years you
couldn't patch the hole in a wooden boat?
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Yes, well, I tried several times. ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: It's some boards and a hammer, Brainiac.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: And don't think we don't know about you and Ginger
down at the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Oh my. (Takes coconut cell phone and EXITS.)
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: You too, Suzie Floozy, hit the bricks. And leave me
that blue gown with the bugle beads.
</P>
<P>
   GINGER: But, but ... Oh Gillie, help me!
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Pound sand, baby. It's over. (GINGER EXITS.)
</P>
<P>
   As twilight comes to the little island, SKIPPER lights the Tiki
torches.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON: I never liked them. Common, really.
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY: I don't know how to say this, dear, but I think you
should go, too.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON (sputtering): Me? Lovey! Why?
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY: You've been bringing a teddy bear to bed with us for
nearly half a century, dear, and you need to ask why? You packed a
cummerbund for a three-hour tour? You're clinically insane.
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: And he's miserly, don't forget miserly!
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: He treats us all like servants! Capitalist oppressor!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Wall Street lickspittles! They should both go! Eat the
rich!
</P>
<P>
   ALL (chanting now): Eat the rich! Eat the rich! (They advance on
the HOWELLS with sharpened sticks. LOVEY and THURSTON scurry into
the jungle.)
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: Good riddance to Lord and Lady Pinchpenny, I say.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN (Smearing his face with blood red berries in the primal
firelight): Now we are three. Two men and a woman alone. Night
comes to the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: Yikes! (She flees.)
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Heh, heh. You're laying it on a little thick there,
Little Buddy, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Don't ``Little Buddy'' me, you abusive blubbersack.
You touch me with that hat again and I'll kill you. Just how long
did you think I was going to be your scapegoat, your dimwitted
sidekick? Who put you in charge, anyway? It's your fault we're
still here! Good god, man, we've been visited by four cosmonauts,
two super-intelligent chimps and the Harlem Globetrotters! We could
have built 20 space shuttles out of what washed up on this very
beach! You couldn't find a way to get us home?
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: But, Little Buddy, I __
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Shut your snackhole, Fatty, I'm not done yet. To think
of the years I've wasted putting up with your bullying, your
insults, your impotent, passive-aggressive rage. ... Don't blame me
for your low self-esteem, Roundboy, it's not my fault you've been
living on nothing but fruit and fish since 1964 but haven't lost an
ounce! And don't think I don't feel your eyes on me at night in the
hut. ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Aw, Gilligan. (A stone the size of a fist whizzes past
his head.) Yikes! (He flees.)
</P>
<P>
   As the camera CRANES UP we see GILLIGAN, naked now in the dying
light of the fire, grotesque and mud-covered, roasting the bones of
a small animal and talking to himself.
</P>

<P>
   GILLIGAN: Gee, Skipper, a million dollars!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER (Hits Gilligan hard with his hat): Pipe down!
</P>
<P>
   GINGER: I don't think that's entertaining at all!
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: Neither do I! It's just mean. And discourteous.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON HOWELL III: A million dollars? Hah! I carry more than
that folded in my cummerbund.
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY HOWELL: It does seem, well, rather uncharitable.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: It was originally produced in Europe. ...
</P>
<P>
   ALL: Ohhhhhhhhhh.
</P>
<P>
   They sit quietly for a few moments, the only SOUND the WAVES
LAPPING AT THE SAND.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: And television in general is becoming more Darwinian,
I venture, ``survival of the fittest'' now defining both content
qua content and the larger issues of vertically integrated
corporate performance vis-a-vis media gigantism and economies of
relative scale _
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER (interrupting): I vote the professor off the island!
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: But I was just ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Do you have any idea how sick to death we are of your
endless lectures? Of your crypto-intellectual condescension?
</P>
<P>
   ALL: Yeah!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: You're useless to us! You can make a linear particle
accelerator out of two mangos and a clam shell, but in 35 years you
couldn't patch the hole in a wooden boat?
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Yes, well, I tried several times. ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: It's some boards and a hammer, Brainiac.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: And don't think we don't know about you and Ginger
down at the lagoon.
</P>
<P>
   PROFESSOR: Oh my. (Takes coconut cell phone and EXITS.)
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: You too, Suzie Floozy, hit the bricks. And leave me
that blue gown with the bugle beads.
</P>
<P>
   GINGER: But, but ... Oh Gillie, help me!
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Pound sand, baby. It's over. (GINGER EXITS.)
</P>
<P>
   As twilight comes to the little island, SKIPPER lights the Tiki
torches.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON: I never liked them. Common, really.
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY: I don't know how to say this, dear, but I think you
should go, too.
</P>
<P>
   THURSTON (sputtering): Me? Lovey! Why?
</P>
<P>
   LOVEY: You've been bringing a teddy bear to bed with us for
nearly half a century, dear, and you need to ask why? You packed a
cummerbund for a three-hour tour? You're clinically insane.
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: And he's miserly, don't forget miserly!
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: He treats us all like servants! Capitalist oppressor!
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Wall Street lickspittles! They should both go! Eat the
rich!
</P>
<P>
   ALL (chanting now): Eat the rich! Eat the rich! (They advance on
the HOWELLS with sharpened sticks. LOVEY and THURSTON scurry into
the jungle.)
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: Good riddance to Lord and Lady Pinchpenny, I say.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN (Smearing his face with blood red berries in the primal
firelight): Now we are three. Two men and a woman alone. Night
comes to the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   MARY ANN: Yikes! (She flees.)
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Heh, heh. You're laying it on a little thick there,
Little Buddy, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Don't ``Little Buddy'' me, you abusive blubbersack.
You touch me with that hat again and I'll kill you. Just how long
did you think I was going to be your scapegoat, your dimwitted
sidekick? Who put you in charge, anyway? It's your fault we're
still here! Good god, man, we've been visited by four cosmonauts,
two super-intelligent chimps and the Harlem Globetrotters! We could
have built 20 space shuttles out of what washed up on this very
beach! You couldn't find a way to get us home?
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: But, Little Buddy, I __
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN: Shut your snackhole, Fatty, I'm not done yet. To think
of the years I've wasted putting up with your bullying, your
insults, your impotent, passive-aggressive rage. ... Don't blame me
for your low self-esteem, Roundboy, it's not my fault you've been
living on nothing but fruit and fish since 1964 but haven't lost an
ounce! And don't think I don't feel your eyes on me at night in the
hut. ...
</P>
<P>
   SKIPPER: Aw, Gilligan. (A stone the size of a fist whizzes past
his head.) Yikes! (He flees.)
</P>
<P>
   As the camera CRANES UP we see GILLIGAN, naked now in the dying
light of the fire, grotesque and mud-covered, roasting the bones of
a small animal and talking to himself.

   WASHINGTON _ Political strategies come and go, but this one
endures: never underestimate the political potency of motherhood.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Million Mom March for ``common sense gun
control'' next Sunday, Mother's Day, have a warm and fuzzy Web site
(www.millionmommarch.com), a shrewd media effort and an aggressive
grassroots organizing campaign. But above all, they are invoking a
very old tradition in politics: trying to break through ideology
and partisanship and make an appeal based on the moral authority of
women as mothers.
</P>
<P>
   It worked for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, widely credited
with helping to create a fundamental shift in society's attitudes
toward drinking and driving. It worked for many of the women's
clubs in the early part of this century, which historians say
played a key role in passing much of the early social welfare
legislation, like mothers' pensions and child and maternal health
programs. It has been used in peace movements, here and in such
places as Northern Ireland, in pro- and anti-abortion marches, in
environmental struggles large and small.
</P>
<P>
   But in the current climate, in an election year when the gun
control issue is the subject of fierce and intensely partisan
maneuvering _ and when mothers are considered swing voters _ such a
campaign is not without risks. Without more conventional political
follow-up, some analysts say, the march could turn out to be a a
day of powerful television images that will ultimately fade, and
can thus be safely ignored by the legislators and candidates who
are its target. And it casts women in a political role that some
may find dated and limiting: as selfless nonpartisan defenders of
hearth and home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mothers' march, which is open to men and is to be
held in the nation's capital and some 60 other cities, could also
have real power, several historians and analysts say. ``It's a
really good way to bridge differences of ideology,'' said Annelise
Orleck, an associate professor of history at Dartmouth and a
scholar of mothers' movements. ``It makes possible at least a
temporary coalition of a wider range of people than might have been
drawn out by a march that was billed strictly as a gun control
march.''
</P>
<P>
   And, she added: ``It becomes harder to attack. It will be very
hard for the National Rifle Association or others to attack mothers
speaking on behalf of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Kate O'Beirne, a conservative commentator and Washington editor
of National Review, agreed, predicting that the march will be
``lovingly'' covered by the news media. ``They'll get no skeptical
coverage _  &UR; moms? &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the march, which supports an array of gun control
measures like mandatory safety locks and the licensing of all
handgun owners, was in fact deeply political. But it will define
the argument, she said, so that ``anybody who demurs is clearly
perfectly comfortable with 8-year-olds' risking gun violence in
school cafeterias.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Bill Powers, spokesman for the National Rifle
Association, offered a downright decorous response when asked about
the mothers' march. ``We seem to be a lot of people's favorite
target to beat up, but the men and women who are part of the NRA
want their children to be safe just as much as anyone else wants
their children to be safe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Dees-Thomases, a New Jersey mother who is the main
organizer of the march, said she was galvanized by the image of
children, hand in hand, being led from a Jewish community center in
Granada Hills, Calif., last August, after a gunman's shooting
rampage. She said she took MADD as her inspiration, and found it
easy to mobilize mothers in the wake of a succession of school
shootings, several of them in middle-class suburbia. ``The first
five or 10 women I spoke to about this, we all had the same
reaction to what was going on in the country around guns,'' she
said. ``Our maternal instincts were just kicking in.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some pollsters say that after the shooting last year at
Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., which left 15 dead,
support for stronger gun laws initially soared, especially among
women. Moreover, there is what Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster,
calls a ``huge gender gap'' on the issue. A poll by CBS News in
March found that 56 percent of the men responding said laws
governing the sale of handguns should be made stricter; 73 percent
of the women did.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say the Democratic Party's support for stricter
gun laws could help deliver the middle-of-the-road suburban mothers
both parties are courting. But polls indicate that any such
advantage has yet to materialize. Many Republican leaders have been
arguing that the problem is not the strength of existing gun laws,
but the lack of vigorous enforcement. And that message has appeal,
DiVall said.
</P>
<P>
   Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said, ``The issue's been
confused,'' but argued that the mothers' march could sway voters.
</P>
<P>
   The march's organizers, of course, say they hope to transcend
any struggle for partisan advantage. ``Everyone truly believes that
until we get the politics out of this, nothing much will get
done,'' said Dees-Thomases, currently on leave from her job as a
part-time publicist for CBS. ``This is a public health issue.''

   The march's Web site drives home the beyond-politics message
again and again: ``This is personal, not political. We are in this
for one reason alone: to keep our kids safe.'' In a ``Tapestry''
section, typical postings about the march run like this: ``I lose
sleep at night thinking about the future of my 3-year-old child and
my one expected in June.'' ``After watching the Oprah show on
Tuesday, I decided to turn in the only gun I have, a handgun.''
</P>
<P>
   March organizers say elected officials will not be prominently
featured in the day's program in Washington, although two will
speak, both of them women with experience in gun violence in their
own families: Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., whose husband was
killed and son was severely wounded in the Long Island Rail Road
shooting in 1993, and Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend,
the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at
Harvard, said the march organizers had clearly ``rediscovered a
very traditional formula'' that still had power even though the
status of women has been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Skocpol, the author of ``Protecting Soldiers and Mothers: The
Political Origins of Social Policy in the United States'' (Harvard
University Press, 1992), noted that mothers' movements were very
strong in the early years of the 20th century, before women had the
vote, when many women defined the political process ``not as
voting, but as shaping public opinion, creating some kind of moral
consensus, appealing to the reason and the values of public
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, she quotes Imogen B. Oakley, a leader in the
General Federation of Women's Clubs, who declared in 1912: ``In
this country, owing to partisan politics, the authorities are prone
to spend so much time wrangling over the spoils of office that they
have little left for civic improvement.'' As a result, she said,
``the initiative in civic matters has devolved largely upon
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Rheta Childe Dorr, the author of a book about clubwomen in
politics, wrote in 1910 that a woman's place was in the home. But
she added: ``Home is not contained within the four walls of an
individual home. Home is the community. The city full of people is
the family. The public school is the real nursery. And badly do the
home and the family and the nursery need their mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The framing of an issue as a mothers' movement still works ``not
because they see women separately, as part of a separate sphere,
but because women are still especially concerned about children,''
Skocpol said. Still, she and many analysts say there are obvious
limitations to these movements. Efforts to recast poverty as a
children's issue _ including a Stand for Children rally in
Washington in 1996 _ did not stop the passage of a welfare reform
law that its organizers deplored. Powerful images are no substitute
for political muscle and continued organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said her movement is keenly aware of that, and
will announce plans for follow-up on the day of the march. In the
meantime, the Million Mom March has competition in the imagery war:
the Second Amendment Sisters, a group of women who plan a
counterdemonstration that day on behalf of gun rights, to
underscore how important guns are to protect hearth and home.

   Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at
Harvard, said the march organizers had clearly ``rediscovered a
very traditional formula'' that still had power even though the
status of women has been transformed.
</P>
<P>
   Skocpol, the author of ``Protecting Soldiers and Mothers: The
Political Origins of Social Policy in the United States'' (Harvard
University Press, 1992), noted that mothers' movements were very
strong in the early years of the 20th century, before women had the
vote, when many women defined the political process ``not as
voting, but as shaping public opinion, creating some kind of moral
consensus, appealing to the reason and the values of public
officials.''
</P>
<P>
   In her book, she quotes Imogen B. Oakley, a leader in the
General Federation of Women's Clubs, who declared in 1912: ``In
this country, owing to partisan politics, the authorities are prone
to spend so much time wrangling over the spoils of office that they
have little left for civic improvement.'' As a result, she said,
``the initiative in civic matters has devolved largely upon
women.''
</P>
<P>
   Rheta Childe Dorr, the author of a book about clubwomen in
politics, wrote in 1910 that a woman's place was in the home. But
she added: ``Home is not contained within the four walls of an
individual home. Home is the community. The city full of people is
the family. The public school is the real nursery. And badly do the
home and the family and the nursery need their mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The framing of an issue as a mothers' movement still works ``not
because they see women separately, as part of a separate sphere,
but because women are still especially concerned about children,''
Skocpol said. Still, she and many analysts say there are obvious
limitations to these movements. Efforts to recast poverty as a
children's issue _ including a Stand for Children rally in
Washington in 1996 _ did not stop the passage of a welfare reform
law that its organizers deplored. Powerful images are no substitute
for political muscle and continued organizing.
</P>
<P>
   Dees-Thomases said her movement is keenly aware of that, and
will announce plans for follow-up on the day of the march. In the
meantime, the Million Mom March has competition in the imagery war:
the Second Amendment Sisters, a group of women who plan a
counterdemonstration that day on behalf of gun rights, to
underscore how important guns are to protect hearth and home.

   MOTHERHOOD-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Political strategies come
and go, but a few endure: Never underestimate the political potency
of motherhood. The leaders of the Million Mom March for ``sensible
gun control'' next Sunday, Mother's Day, have an appealing web
site, a shrewd media effort and an aggressive grass-roots
organizing campaign. But above all, they are invoking a very old
tradition in politics: Trying to break through ideology and
partisanship and make an appeal based on the moral authority of
women as mothers. By Robin Toner.
</P>
<P>
   ANTIQUES-STOCKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Nasdaq gave amateur investors
the impression that the thing to own is the new, new thing.
Meanwhile, the antiques world gave amateur appraisers the
impression that the thing to own is the old, old thing _ eBay
allowed Web surfers to go antiquing over high-speed access lines,
Sotheby's and Christie's arrived on the Internet, and ``Antiques
Roadshow'' became the most popular program on public TV. By Jenny
Lyn Bader.

   NATIONAL-SECURITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Defining national security:
Just when does a big problem turn into a national security threat?
If Eisenhower were alive today, he might be amused or puzzled by
the Clinton administration's linkage of national security to issues
like trade privileges for China, AIDS in Africa and global warming.
But it is possible that after a decade of unchallenged power and
prosperity, Americans are ready to think about their national
security in broader terms. BY David E. Sanger.
</P>
<P>
   PARENTS-JOB-BIAS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A good job on the night
shift opens up. A mother with young children is not offered the
job, which would be a promotion, because her supervisor assumes _
wrongly _ that her family responsibilities prevent her from working
nights. Did the supervisor act properly? Hardly anyone would say
so. Should the supervisor's action be against the law? Absolutely,
in President Clinton's view. Is the problem pervasive? No one
knows. By David E. Rosenbaum.
</P>
<P>
   CELLPHONES-CRIME-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at the use of
cellular phones as crime-fighting devices. Since the early 1990s,
cell phones have increasingly become the all-purpose, cure-all
solution for individual safety. The notion of being wired in the
electronic age is shared shared by both parent and child, salesman
and client, cop and felon. The issue, however, is whether people
are really safe, or merely think they are. By Jason Blair.
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-TECH-REVIEW (Undated) _ For believers in technology's
implied promise of an information utopia, in which people can see
or hear or read whatever they want (and show or tell or write
whatever they want), the Disney-Time Warner battle over ABC
transmission was an uncomfortable lesson that the more information
available, the more places in which it is available, the more the
logic of economics and egos will come into play to restrict it. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   GILLIGAN'S-REALITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ A screenplay featuring the
characters of ``Gilligan's Island'' and the new trend toward
``reality-based game programming.'' CBS maroons a group of real
people, contestants, on an island and keeps hundreds of cameras and
microphones pointed at them 24 hours a day to record everything
they say and do. People are voted out of the group one by one.
After a few weeks their small society, a microcosm of the world at
large if you will, devolves into something out of ``Lord of the
Flies.'' CBS awards the final contestant a million dollars or
something. The ``Gilligan' cast enacts the drama. By Jeff
MacGregor.
</P>
<P>
   E-BOOKS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For more than a year, I've been
experimenting with electronic books. The various e-book devices
felt like solid hardcovers in hand, but the first generation seemed
stiff to me, somehow nerdy and bulky. The cold gray screens of text
didn't offer the hypnotic calm of vanilla rag paper. Reading books
on a PC felt too much as if I was working, chained upright to a
desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback revolution. I
was drawn to the devices that offered one of the basic elements of
pocketbook design: portability. By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   AFRICA-OBSTACLES-REVIEW (Washington) _ The debacle of the Sierra
Leone peacekeeping mission and the awkward U.S. response
demonstrate again that Africa takes more than good intentions. Now,
the likelihood of deployment of even the modest force for Congo
looks very distant. And even as the House approved a trade bill
granting new trading privileges to Africa, there are some doubts
whether many African countries have the economic capacity to take
advantage of it. The fact remains that sub-Saharan Africa is so
poor, that McDonald's cannot find enough of a customer base to open
one outlet in even one nation. By Jane Perlez. (Moving in the `i'
category)
</P>
<P>
   TOYS-POLITICS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A tempest is brewing in
Washington, all because of an 11-inch blond bombshell. Mattel, in
association with two nonprofit women's groups, recently announced
plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll. Almost immediately the
protests sounded. But why shouldn't American children learn about
civics and the virtues of public service via their favorite
playthings? By Bruce Kluger.
</P>
<P>
   SWORD&AMP;SANDAL-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ To mark the opening of
``Gladiator'' and the passing of Hercules actor Steve Reeves,
earlier sword-and-sandal epics are recalled for their memorable
utterances. It didn't matter whether the plots were derived from
the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of ancient Rome _ or, more
typically, some unholy mixture of the three. The dialogue
frequently managed to range from the ponderous to the purple, and
sometimes to the preposterous.

 By RICHARD L. BERKE c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton has become a crucial
behind-the-scenes player in the 2000 campaign, serving as a
tactical adviser for House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Although the spotlight has shifted to Vice President Al Gore and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, prominent Democrats portray the president's
role as that of an enormously valuable Strategist in Chief. They
describe him as a sponge for absorbing political statistics _ a
skill that is all the more enhanced because he has run twice in all
435 congressional districts. And he willingly brings his well-honed
political instincts to bear while exerting the power of the
presidency to elect Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been seeking election or re-election since 1974,
when he was defeated in a race for Congress. And the president's
closest advisers say that although he is no longer running himself,
his passion for electoral politics has never receded. They also
cite another, more personal, reason for Clinton's deep involvement:
He wants to burnish his own legacy with the election of Gore to
succeed him, the installation of Mrs. Clinton as senator from New
York and the return of the House to Democratic control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy can't live without a campaign in his life,'' said Sen.
John B. Breaux, D-La. ``Life is a campaign for him. He needs a
campaign to keep him going. This guy is not going to go into an
igloo and freeze away. He can't help but advise.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and historians say they have never known of a
president so deeply immersed in politics _ or a White House that,
even during a lame-duck period, was so focused on polls and
electoral considerations.
</P>
<P>
   The president is particularly engrossed in the first lady's
race, and to a lesser degree in Gore's. But his involvement in
campaigns from coast to coast is extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is much more than a fund-raiser in these campaigns, even
as he has collected millions of dollars for House and Senate
candidates. He offers candidates pointers on television and radio
advertising scripts. He played a significant role in urging some
prospects to run in the first place, and he often schedules trips
and policy announcements with an eye to helping specific
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   This portrait of Clinton has been gleaned from interviews with
more than two dozen candidates and strategists, as well as
lawmakers on Capitol Hill and officials at the White House and at
the Democratic National Committee. Joe Lockhart, Clinton's press
secretary, turned down a request to interview the president; some
of Clinton's advisers said they were worried that it would seem
unpresidential for him to discuss his activities openly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the ultimate junkie,'' said Sen. Robert Torricelli of New
Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
``He has the best walking knowledge of anybody in American
politics.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Rep. Ron Klink's drive to oust Sen. Rick Santorum,
R-Pa., Torricelli said: ``Last night he called me about the Klink
race. He said he was convinced Klink could beat Santorum. He said,
`I want to do something in Philadelphia to bring our base in for
Klink. I know he can carry western Pennsylvania, but he may have
trouble consolidating the base in the east.'''
</P>
<P>
   Klink said that he telephoned the White House after he won the
Democratic primary in April and Clinton ``took my call
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just lip service,'' Klink said. ``He's really focused
on this race. He can open doors with other individuals by telling
them that this race is very meaningful to him.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The president's network of contacts is vast because he has
stumped in more than half the congressional districts, his advisers
say.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Clinton calls candidates on the telephone. More often,
he grabs them to talk politics during his travels or at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Smith, a former Clinton political director, said he was at
the White House recently to watch an Arkansas Razorbacks basketball
game. At halftime, Smith said, the president cornered a group of
his guests and held forth about the Democrats' presidential
prospects in several states.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that Gore not write off North Carolina in November,
even though Clinton lost the state twice. If the Gore campaign
takes that advice, it may cause the Bush campaign to rethink its
own electoral tactics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He came over and said, `How do you think the math is
working?''' Smith said. ``He said, `I think North Carolina looks
good.''' But Smith said he cautioned Clinton that the Democrats
should think twice about pumping resources into the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that state broke my heart _ twice,'' Smith said.
``But he said, `I think we've got a shot.'''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Others who have talked politics with Clinton said he was
preoccupied with the need for Democrats to win the loyalty of
Hispanic voters. They said he had even spoken in detail about the
importance of married Protestants. And, they said, he was
particularly intrigued by contests in Michigan, New Jersey and
Florida, where Gore has been pressing his campaign amid the tumult
over the administration's handling of the Elian Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is obsessed with Florida,'' the case of the Cuban boy
``and how it impacts,'' Torricelli said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton still convenes political meetings twice a month or so in
the ornate Yellow Oval Room in the White House family quarters. The
sessions are not as pressing as they were when they were held
weekly before the 1996 campaign, and the group of participants,
which often numbers close to two dozen, is usually larger than the
more exclusive club of the past. Gore does not attend anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clinton assembles his top aides, some Cabinet
secretaries and others to hash over how Democrats are performing
and to look for ways to use his presidency to help candidates.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the sessions, Mark Penn, a presidential
pollster, reviews the latest surveys on an overhead projector. The
discussion that follows is freewheeling, with Clinton _ who often
chews on an unlighted cigar _ sounding at times like a political
operative.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a full-time campaign manager at these meetings,'' one
participant said. ``The entire meetings are discussions of how this
would be good for Al or for the first lady and how he can help the
legacy. Clinton is constantly saying, `This would help Al.'''
</P>
<P>
   Participants at the group's most recent meeting, in April,
recalled that Clinton said he wanted to accept invitations to speak
at college graduations in areas with high concentrations of
minorities, like Shiprock, N.M., where he thought his appearance
would help spur interest in Gore's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite pastime of the group is mocking Republicans in
Congress, particularly when they do something that hurts them in
the polls. ``A common refrain is, `They must not read the polls,'''
a participant said.
</P>
<P>
   James Carville, an architect of Clinton's victory in 1992, said
of the president: ``If he calls me it would be to chat about Gore
and Hillary. But I've had him tell me ideas for brochures in Senate
races. He's a rare combination of somebody who's got the brains and
the gut.''

   Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic National
Committee, said he was dazzled by the president's knowledge of one
congressional district in Indiana, Andrew's home state. ``He said
the 8th Congressional District is one that goes back and forth _
the bloody 8th,'' Andrew said. ``He knew that the southern part of
the district was more conservative than the northern part. But he
knew that in the southern part there had been tremendous growth
because of a Toyota plant that opened there. And he knew of the
Whirlpool plant in the northern part that had closed.''

   Michael J. Lapolla, the manager of Union County, N.J., who is
seeking a House seat, said he ran into the president at a White
House Christmas party last year. ``As soon as he found what I was
running for, he said he liked our chances and he knew just about
everything about the district,'' Lapolla said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Honda, a state assemblyman from San Jose, Calif., said
Clinton helped persuade him to run for an open congressional seat
this year. ``He added the weight of his office to our race,'' Honda
said.

<P>
   Clinton has taken a particular interest in the campaign of Rep.
Rush D. Holt of New Jersey, a freshman in a tight race. ``His
knowledge of New Jersey politics, and about my race in particular,
is astounding,'' Holt said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Nelson, the state insurance commissioner in Florida, who is
running for the Senate, said Clinton went out of his way to praise
him at a dinner of Floridians in Washington last November _ a move
that he said helped considerably in persuading Democrats to take a
serious look at his prospects. ``The President stands up in front
of all these distinguished Floridians and proceeded to say very
kind things about me,'' he said.

   Clinton is particularly involved in Mrs. Clinton's Senate
campaign. One participant at a meeting with Mrs. Clinton's advisers
said it was the president's idea that he not utter a word at his
wife's official announcement of her candidacy in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the issue came up of whether he would speak at Hillary's
announcement, he weighed in and said, `No,''' the participant said.
``He said, `I don't think that's right. This is her day.' There
were plenty of people arguing the other way because it seemed
unnatural for him not to speak. But it was a good judgment.''

   Despite Clinton's interest in his wife's race, Torricelli said
the president does not fully grasp the unusual assortment of
parties on the ballot in New York. ``He knows New York politically
less than a lot of the other states,'' Torricelli said. ``He
doesn't quite understand the mix of all those lines.'' Referring to
Sen. Charles E. Schumer of New York, he said, ``He calls Schumer
and gets his opinion and calls me and plays off where we might
differ.''

   While in past years some candidates have urged Clinton to stay
clear of their districts, most of those interviewed said they were
grateful for the president's wisdom and did not view him as an
unwelcome meddler. ``He's not a Mr. Buttinski,'' Carville said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some candidates were not so willing to bow before Clinton's
expertise, perhaps out of fear that they might appear too close to
the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in elective office over 20 years in Michigan,'' said
Rep. Debbie Stabenow, who is running for Senate and campaigned with
the president last week. ``I know my state very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how often he takes advice from Clinton, Tony Coelho,
Gore's campaign chairman, said: ``I'm not going to go there.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's ``show me the money'' time in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon, R-Santa Clarita, wants to show
his constituents $4.3 million for a Boys &AMP; Girls Club in Santa
Clarita, $5.5 million for a National Guard Armory in Lancaster and
$4 million to rid the Santa Clara River of ``demon weeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Berman, D-Mission Hills, hopes to show an $8 million
contract to upgrade Navy sonar at L-3 Communications in Sylmar and
a $5 million outlay for a new Air National Guard communications
center in Van Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Woodland Hills, has requested $1.5 million
to help unsnarl the 101-405 freeway interchange and $500,000 to
fund an ongoing study of possible San Fernando Valley secession
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Those and thousands of other local spending requests from House
members, known as earmarks, have gone into the hopper as Congress
divvies up $600.3 billion in federal budget outlays for 2000-01.
</P>
<P>
   The winners and losers will be revealed in early October when,
after months of wheeling and dealing, 435 House members and 100
senators approve a final budget and most head home to seek
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the earmark process say they are fulfilling their
duty to constituents by giving them a fair return on their tax
dollars and funding needed programs and improvements.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the earmarks amount to pork barrel spending and are
a waste of taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   Congress' $600.3 billion kitty, known as discretionary spending,
accounts for one-third of the basic $1.83 trillion spending plan
that was approved April 13 by House and Senate negotiators. Half of
the proposed budget is tied up in mandatory spending for programs
like Social Security, Medicare and welfare. Another 20 percent is
allocated to pay interest on the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under the budget plan, $310.8 billion of the discretionary
spending is to be allocated for defense programs. Non-defense
outlays are to total $289.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The earmark process begins with a ``Dear Chairman'' letter from
a member of Congress to the head of the House subcommittee that
will first consider the spending request.
</P>
<P>
   Requests are also passed on to Southern California members of
the House Appropriations Committee, which shapes the size and scope
of all spending measures. Those key players include Rep. Jerry
Lewis, R-Redlands, who also chairs the Defense Appropriations
subcommittee; and Reps. Julian Dixon, D-Los Angeles, and Lucille
Roybal-Allard, D-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Earmark requests are also coordinated with Democratic Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, California's representative on the Senate
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go into the process with very few expectations,'' said
Sherman, who has made seven local funding requests. ``My colleagues
know I'd be thrilled to get any of my requests approved.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman and other local House members stressed that earmarks are
not figments of their imaginations, but requests for help that
originate from cities, school districts and other concerned parties
in their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Strength in numbers can improve the prospects for a budget
request. For example, McKeon, Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-Montebello,
and Rep. Steven Kuykendall, R-Torrance, are jointly seeking $2
million to build three new county-run child care centers. A center
would be set up in each of their districts.
</P>
<P>
   A notable no-show in the scramble for earmarked money is Rep.
Edward Royce, R-Fullerton. A vocal opponent of what he calls pork
barrel spending, Royce makes no such requests and regularly votes
against outlays which he deems as wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   He has also teamed with Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., to co-chair a
bipartisan group called the Porkbusters Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Royce is also an active supporter of Citizens Against Government
Waste, a watchdog group that annually publishes a ``Pig Book''
which spotlights allegedly wasteful spenders in the House and
Senate. The most recent edition, released April 5, targeted funding
requests that were approved last year for Lewis, Dixon and
Roybal-Allard.
</P>
<P>
   The three ``Pig Book'' targets have all defended their earmarks
as justifiable and beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman criticized the critics' premise that all earmarks are
pork and therefore inherently wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country is not so much a democracy as a democracy and
bureaucracy,'' said Sherman. ``There is a perception that we
elected officials in the democracy are either corrupt or not smart
enough to be corrupt. There's also a tendency to see the
bureaucrats as impartial, nonpolitical experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are not involved in the budget process, the bureaucrats
will make all of the spending decisions based on formulas and data
like the census,'' added Sherman. ``But the bureaucracy can also be
just as politically motivated as Congress and its decisions are
subject to the same flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherman cited the example of transportation funding, mostly
amassed from the federal gasoline taxes paid by consumers.
Ninety-six percent of that money is returned by the bureaucrats to
state agencies like Caltrans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll put up the 4 percent of transportation money we deal with
against that 96 percent any time,'' said Sherman. ``That 4 percent
is being spent just as well, if not more effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   Native intelligence is a key issue for Napolitano.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the bureaucrats just don't understand California and
its needs,'' she said. ``It's our duty to stand up for the people
we represent and return a fair share of their tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting a fair share is a growing issue for Californians, who
have been sending more money to Washington than they have received
for 12 straight years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998-99, for example, Californians received a return of 89
cents for every tax dollar, a shortfall that averaged $595 for
every man, woman and child in the state. Californians, who make up
12.3 percent of the nation's populations, sent $212 billion in
federal taxes to Washington that year, amounting to 12.5 percent of
the government's total take.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that California will pencil out as a donor
state for the 13th year in a row when final tax and spending
receipts for 1999-2000 are released this fall.

RODENTS MAKE SPRING APPEARANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MONROE 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kelly Rice loves living next to nature amid lush
Agoura Hills, but this mild spring has brought her a little too
close to mice. Now is the season for rodents to give birth, and the
hills and trees are alive with them.
</P>
<P>
   Rice has spotted mice under a wet bar inside her house and a
barbecue outside - and suspects they have relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way this house is built, if you're a rodent you can get
around just about anywhere,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   County health officials who handle reports from the public said
they are bracing for the calls to start once the newborn vermin
begin their public forays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will increase as we get into summer,'' said Art Tilzer of
the county Department of Health Service's consumer protection
bureau. He estimated that rat calls to the Vector Management
Program number between 6,000 and 7,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the county Health Department issued its annual warning
about rats and mice, which can carry bacteria and viruses that make
them four-legged vessels for illnesses ranging from plague to
hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned for that potential, and the way to control
these diseases is to control the rodents first,'' said David
Leaduff, an environmental health specialist in the agency's Vector
Management Program.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no human case of plague in the county since 1984,
according to county epidemiologists. There has been no local human
case of hantavirus yet, and in 1999, there were fewer than a dozen
cases of murine typhus, a rodent-borne disease that is not usually
fatal.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Roshan Reporter, a county health epidemiologist, attributed
the lack of human sickness to aggressive monitoring of county
rodents. Nonetheless, she warned that the early spring deluges
raise the likelihood of encounters between vermin and humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had pretty good rains and this time of year, I suspect
there's a lot more potential for exposure,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the last two years have been relatively dry, Leaduff
could not say whether that translates to a smaller food supply and
fewer rats. Some exterminators claim the opposite, that their
businesses and the vermin population are booming because of mild
weather.
</P>
<P>
   Hydrex Pest Control of Van Nuys is receiving twice as many calls
this spring as it did during the same period two years ago,
inspector Peter Rosza said. In a repeat of last spring, roof rats
have besieged homes in Brentwood and Sylmar this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the areas that are more lush with foliage and that's
the primary food source,'' Rosza said. ``It's been mild so these
animals will multiply more.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Dusatko, owner of Protector Pest Control, doesn't call this
rat and mouse season, but said that the presence of newborn rats
means that for every one seen, there could be several waiting back
at the nest.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not foraging yet so it could take a few weeks to catch
them,'' Dusatko said during a recent inspection of Rice's home.
</P>
<P>
   Roof rats, also known as tree or black rats, are acrobatic
rodents, sometimes nesting in the crowns of palm trees and using
power lines as pathways. They are more common in the Valley than
the Norway rat, their larger urban counterpart that tends to burrow
rather than climb.
</P>
<P>
   Neither species is native to California. House mice,
exterminators said, are more ubiquitous and can be found nearly
anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Rodent control information is available from the DHS Vector
Management Program by calling (323) 881-4046.

</P>
<P>
   Tips from the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services
to keep your home vermin-free:
</P>
<P>
   --Trim back plants. Ivy, climbing plants and other ground cover
as well as unwanted weeds and brush encourage rats and mice to find
a way into your house. A general rule is to trim thoroughly enough
to be able to see through foliage to ensure rats can't make a home
there.
</P>
<P>
   --Seal all food. That includes pet as well as human food and
garbage. Rats aren't finicky eaters.
</P>
<P>
   --Plug up potential entry points into your home. The most
common, said vector control officials, are crawl space vents. Place
wire mesh over holes larger than a half-inch to deter rats or a
quarter-inch to stop the smaller house mouse.
</P>
<P>
   --Set out poison if infestation is detected. But use traps if
you have children or are unsure about the safety of poison.
</P>
<P>
   --Get a cat. They are, after all, the natural way to get rid of
rodents. But make sure you aren't using poison at the same time.

COMMENTARY: REALITY BITES AGAIN  
 BY PAUL KRUGMAN  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is that a police car, lights flashing, that we see in our
rear-view mirror?
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years the U.S. economy has cheerfully broken
all the old limits. And yet there have been no speeding tickets:
unlike runaway booms in the past, this incredible expansion has not
led to accelerating inflation. Instead, almost every fresh economic
statistic has been a cause for celebration. Month after month
productivity has risen more, unemployment has fallen further, and
inflation has stayed more subdued than most reasonable people would
have imagined possible only a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's already hard to remember a time when the U.S. business news
wasn't good. Yet as recently as 1996 the economic headlines were
mainly negative _ downsizing, not technology, ruled the front
pages. And though it now seems hard to believe, Bob Dole's economic
advisers insisted during the 1996 campaign that Bill Clinton's
policies had produced only an anemic, disappointing recovery, and
that only with the spur of big supply-side tax cuts could the
economy recover its Reaganesque dynamism. (To be fair, critics of
Dole's platform ridiculed his claim that he could achieve 3.5
percent annual economic growth _ a growth rate that the United
States has consistently exceeded ever since he lost that election.)
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why the old speed limits on the economy were so suddenly
repealed remains something of a mystery. Productivity growth
suddenly accelerated, probably because businesses started to make
effective use of information technology, though we can only guess
why infotech paid off so much in the late 1990s after producing
such disappointing results in the previous 15 years. At the same
time _ and therefore presumably for the same reason, though the
connection is far from clear _ the economy developed a new immunity
to inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Before around 1995, the risks of inflation seemed clear in the
data: Inflation fell only when unemployment was high, as it had
been in the early 1980s or early 1990s; inflation rose when
unemployment was low, as it was in the late 1970s or late 1980s.
And the break-even point, at which inflation neither accelerated
nor decelerated, was an unemployment rate of around 6 percent. Who
would have thought that unemployment could fall to 4 percent before
even the first faint stirrings of inflation would be felt?
</P>
<P>
   Alas, those stirrings are now being felt. Consumer prices are
starting to rise noticeably, and competition for scarce labor is
finally starting to push up wages. And the productivity number
announced on Thursday fell somewhat short of our now exalted
expectations. It's not that we're actually getting bad numbers. In
fact, only a decade ago we would have been delighted to get results
this good. But the numbers nonetheless are a warning that the
economy's speed limit has been raised but not abolished, and that
we have lately been going at least a bit too fast.
</P>
<P>
   How high is the new, improved speed limit? The truth is that
nobody can be sure because America's ``new economy'' is a very
recent creation _ you have to base your guesstimates on only three
full years of data. But it's starting to look as if the
unemployment rate will have to rise a bit _ from 4 percent to say
4.5 if we're lucky, to 5 if we aren't. And growth will have to
slow, from the 4-plus percent of the last two years to 3.5, maybe
even 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Will we be tempted to exceed these speed limits, even though
they are much more expansive than the ones that confined us only a
few years ago?
</P>
<P>
   The would-be scofflaws are already complaining. Not a day goes
by without some self-proclaimed economic expert indignantly denying
that fast growth leads to inflation _ after all, how can producing
more raise prices? The answer to this sophistry (I've never figured
out whether these people are being deliberately dense, or just
doing what comes naturally) is that it depends what causes the
growth. If the economy grows rapidly because of an increase in
supply _ say because workers have suddenly become more productive _
that lowers inflation. But if it grows because of an increase in
demand _ say because of an exuberant stock market _ then the growth
is indeed inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   And that kind of growth _ which, it seems, is what we are now
experiencing _ has to slow down.

RUSSIAN OFFICIAL TRYING TO ENSURE RIGHTS IN CHECHNYA 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Vladimir Kalamanov may have the toughest job in Russia.
As the Kremlin's special envoy for human rights, his task is to
convince a skeptical West that Russia is serious about ending human
rights abuses in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   It is a hard sell. Despite numerous accounts of pillaging,
beatings and killings by Russian troops in Chechnya, only a handful
of cases have been investigated by military prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   And while Kalamanov insists he is making progress, he is the
first to acknowledge that the Russian military routinely withholds
critical details about its investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say that I am entirely satisfied,'' he said in an
interview. ``I have not received all of the information I have
asked for.''
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton and President-elect Vladimir Putin prepare
for their June meeting in Moscow, human rights is again emerging as
a politically charged issue _ and not just for Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has made it clear that the brutal war
in Chechnya will not prevent it from doing business with Putin,
particularly on arms control. But the United States has also sought
to assure human rights activists that it is not neglecting the
issue and is pressing for an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   That has put the spotlight squarely on Kalamanov.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russian officials reject Western human rights complaints as
a plot to blacken the nation's image. Kalamanov, by contrast, has
the disarming manner of agreeing with many of the critics and then
imploring them to accept that Russia is involved in a long and
complex struggle to build a democratic society and hold the
once-sacrosanct military to account.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should not see this as a game the president is playing to
influence international opinion,'' he said. ``The role of the army
and civil authority is being rethought, but we are only at the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, portray Kalamanov as an earnest official who
tells the West what it wants to hear, but who has been granted
neither the resources nor the authority by Putin to bring the
culprits to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kalamanov is a formidable figure,'' said Kenneth Roth, the
executive director of Human Rights Watch, the international rights
organization. ``He is aware of the atrocities, but he must work
through the chief military prosecutor, who is determined not to do
anything. The best way to inspire confidence is to deliver results,
and so far there have not been significant results.''
</P>
<P>
   A 47-year-old official of Syrian descent, it seems that
Kalamanov should be in a strong position. Eager to strengthen ties
with the West and avoid international sanctions, Putin has vowed to
end human rights abuses. And in February, Putin, who will be
inaugurated on Sunday, named Kalamanov as an ombudsman on human
rights and gave him the lofty mandate of protecting civil rights in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the official backing from the new Russian leader,
however, Kalamanov seems to be playing David to the Russian
military Goliath. His modest staff includes just 10 unpaid,
Chechnya-based investigators. (Russian authorities say the
investigators' salaries are on the way, and Kalamanov's goal is to
expand his Chechnya staff to 20.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kalamanov claims some successes. He has arranged for two
European officials to work with his team in Chechnya, a move
intended to assure the West that his efforts are not a whitewash.
And he has worked to assemble a list of prisoners in Russian
detention centers in Chechnya and helped them obtain legal
representation. Soon, he boasts, Chechnya will have a functioning
court system.
</P>
<P>
   And with an eye on the diplomatic calendar, he is pressing his
government to take several headline-making steps before Clinton
meets Putin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to open the northern part of Chechnya to Human
Rights Watch and to international and Russian organizations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But what Kalamanov has not yet been able to do is to bring
Russian soldiers to justice. Human Rights Watch has documented a
series of assaults and killings in the Chechen town of Alkhan-Yurt
and in the Staropromyslovsky and Aldi areas of the Chechen capital
of Grozny. Kalamanov says he takes the reports seriously and that
his investigators have received corroborating testimony about some
of the abuses.
</P>
<P>
   But it is up to military and civilian prosecutors to bring
criminal charges, and they have been very reluctant. Military
prosecutors say they are investigating more than 300 crimes by
Russian soldiers in Chechnya, but only 10 involve allegations of
crimes against civilians.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only two of these cases have been referred to the
military court for possible trial, and they concern the relatively
modest offenses of ``hooliganism'' and mishandling weapons.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>

   The reluctance of the military prosecutors to act has diminished
Kalamanov's authority. To monitor the effectiveness of the
prosecutor's investigations, for example, Kalamanov, has tried to
obtain crucial details of the cases. Instead, he has been given
only the most general statistics about the number of
investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the military announced that Col. Yuri Budanov, the
commander of a tank regiment, had been arrested for the rape and
murder of a young Chechen woman. In general, however, the generals
have not been eager to publicize their investigations into human
rights abuses, a step that might deter the troops from committing
other crimes and win the confidence of civilians.

<P>
   The result is evident at Kalamanov's office in the Chechen town
of Znamenskoye. Housed in a defunct winery, the office has received
more than 500 complaints, but they mostly concern delayed pensions,
appeals by refugees for tents and medicine, labor disputes,
problems in obtaining new documents and, to a lesser extent,
charges of illegal detentions and reports of missing persons. It
has not fielded any complaints about assaults or thefts by Russian
soldiers.

<P>
   ``I think they doubt our ability to help,'' Alvi Ayubov, the
deputy head of the office and an ethnic Chechen, said, referring to
Chechnya's residents.

DAM THREATENS ANCIENT TURKISH SITE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELKIS, Turkey _ Here, as in several parts of southern Turkey,
water is rising inexorably around a doomed village as an artificial
lake builds up behind a new dam, part of the government's ambitious
plans to generate electric power and irrigate vast areas of dry
land.
</P>
<P>
   But in Belkis, the swelling waters are not just disrupting lives
or forever submerging long-cherished homes.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, archaeologists have found that an
ancient city that once stood here holds what many experts are
calling one of the world's richest collections of Roman mosaics.
Much of it is about to disappear before anyone even has a chance to
see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a real tragedy,'' said Mehmet Onal, the archaeologist
who is supervising a frantic effort to rescue what can be saved
before the site is inundated. ``We've only excavated two villas,
and we found 12 beautiful mosaics. There are hundreds of villas
under the earth, so you can imagine what remains to be found. The
scale of what we have here is really unbelievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can have four months, we can pass the Antakya Museum,
and if we have two years we can pass the one in Tunis,'' Onal said.
The museum in the Turkish city of Antakya, which was known in
antiquity as Antioch, has this region's finest collection of
ancient mosaics, and the one in Tunis is considered the finest in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The director of the government's energy and irrigation project
in southern Turkey said he could not assess the cultural value of
the site. The provincial governor said he was powerless to stop the
inundation of what he called ``a second Pompeii.''
</P>
<P>
   If all proceeds according to plan, that leaves Onal and the
handful of archaeologists working here with him only about a month
before much of this site disappears. Every day they are excavating
and removing artifacts, not just mosaics but others ranging from a
5-foot-high bronze statue of Mars to 65,000 ceramic impressions of
family and official seals, more than have ever been found at a
single site.
</P>
<P>
   The mosaics, many of which depict scenes of Greek mythology, are
being lifted and taken to a museum in the nearby provincial capital
of Gaziantep. Two that have been uncovered in recent days are still
in place. Both are magnificently preserved and compare in quality
with those in great museums. One depicts Poseidon on his chariot
along with the water deities Thetis and Oceanus. The other shows
Perseus saving Andromeda from a sea monster. Each is the size of a
mid-sized room.
</P>
<P>
   A few steps away from these two mosaics is an atrium covered
with dirt and fragments of Roman columns. Archaeologists believe
they will uncover another mosaic when they clear the debris in the
next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The city that stood here 2,000 years ago, Zeugma, was at the
eastern edge of the Roman Empire. It had an estimated 70,000
residents and was the base for a Roman legion. Its position on the
banks of the Euphrates River, and its role as a thriving center of
Silk Road trade, made it immensely wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Rich traders competed with one another to decorate the floors of
their villas with the most exquisite mosaics.
</P>
<P>
   In the third century, Zeugma is believed to have suffered an
invasion, a devastating fire and an earthquake in quick succession.
It has lain undisturbed since then, covered by thick layers of dirt
and rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeologists have worked sporadically here for several years,
but only began concentrated excavation last winter, after it became
clear that the site was about to be lost. They say they are amazed
at what they have found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we were looking at some fine work, but suddenly in
these last couple of months we've realized that this is a major
world-class site,'' said Christine Kondoloen, curator of Greek and
Roman Art at the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, who is
visiting ancient ruins in Turkey this month.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``Photos that have been coming out of there show that the
mosaics are very rich, very elaborate and truly extraordinary,''
Kondoleon said. ``It would be a huge shame if we lose this site,
especially if we never even see what's there. The whole thing is
really upsetting because this is a great, great treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Just down the dirt road from the archaeologists' work, a farmer
named Abdulrahma Kizilirmak, who had lived all of his 63 years in
Belikis, sat stoically on a brick wall and watched as the village
slowly disappeared. He has heard promises that he will get a fair
price for the house he is losing, but doesn't believe them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so mad I'm about ready to pick up a gun,'' Kizilirmak said
as he gazed out at a herd of cows grazing in a hillside cemetery
that would soon be gone. ``We were comfortable and prosperous until
the government came. Now even old stones are considered more
important than we are. People are working to save the stones, but
no one's doing anything for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The dam that stands just half a mile from the site is part of
the multi-billion-dollar Southeast Anatolia Project, which is a
centerpiece of Turkey's development plans. Some of the dams
envisioned by the project's planners, especially one that would
lead to the flooding of the Kurdish town of Hasankeyf, 200 miles
east of here on the Tigris River, have become the focus of
international protest.
</P>
<P>
   Dams in places like Hasankeyf, however, are not yet built. The
one here is complete. Most of its gates were shut on April 29 to
begin the process of creating the artificial lake whose water will
be used for power generation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The director of the vast project, Olcay Unver, an
American-trained engineer, said in a telephone interview from his
office in the capital Ankara that he was not familiar with details
of the archaeological discoveries here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, all infrastructure projects are interventions
with the physical system, and in some cases that does affect
cultural or historic sites,'' Unver said. ``The bottom line is to
put in a sincere effort to minimize loss. When that's not possible,
you have to take precautions either to move what's there, or at
least to establish a complete documentation of what is being
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The local governor, Muammar Guler, said he was powerless to stop
the inundation, but added that less than half of the site would be
flooded, and that he hoped the rest would be excavated and
ultimately become an open-air museum. ``Besides, the dam only has a
life span of 50 years,'' he said. ``So our grandchildren will be
able to see the part that is being flooded this month.''

   Several of the mosaics that have recently been removed from
Belkis are lying under tarpaulins in the front yard of the
archaeological museum in Gaziantep. The museum's director, Hakki
Alkan, said there were plans to build a new wing to house them, but
he conceded that the government's apparently limited interest in
classical art made the project uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did everything we could to preserve the site, but no one
was listening,'' Alkan said. ``The state has made its decision.
Energy policy is more important than cultural and historical
projects.''

OLD DEBATE, NEW FOCUS ON CONTROLLING DRUG COSTS

<P>
   Americans took home some 2.8 billion prescriptions last year,
obtaining some of the newest, most heavily advertised and most
expensive drugs. They bought many of those medications as members
of managed care drug plans run by pharmacy benefit managers,
companies that arrange discounts from retail drugstores and often
operate mail-order pharmacies on behalf of employer health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pharmacy benefit management companies, or PBM's, which
handle drug benefits for 200 million Americans, are being assigned
an important role in widely discussed proposals to add a drug
benefit to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a Medicare drug benefit, including President
Clinton, believe that the pharmacy benefit managers could obtain
discounts from pharmacists and rebates from drug makers for all
Medicare beneficiaries, just as they are expected to do for
employer health plans and Medicare health maintenance
organizations. The managers, sponsors suggest, would help rein in
the costs of the new Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   But pharmacy benefit managers are coming under increasing
scrutiny. Justice Department officials are investigating possible
illegal kickbacks. Pending lawsuits contend that some pharmacy
benefit managers have violated their duty to act in the best
interest of patients. State regulators are weighing concerns about
the absence of oversight of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   At Senate Finance Committee hearings in March on the Medicare
proposals, the General Accounting Office questioned whether
pharmacy benefit managers would be able to control costs under
government disclosure requirements. And health care experts say
that even for private companies, drug benefit managers have not
been able to put a lid on surging costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``PBMs or no PBMs, it does not have much effect on the growth
trend in pharmaceutical expenses,'' said Henry Aaron, a health care
economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The drug benefit managers do perform valuable services. They
handle billions of automated transactions, checking plan members'
eligibility online and eliminating mountains of paperwork. They
also monitor the drug-buying behavior of individuals, helping
people avoid dangerous drug combinations. And for an extra fee from
the health plan, they will remind people with serious health
problems to follow their doctors' orders.
</P>
<P>
   But though nearly three in four Americans are in drug plans, by
the industry's count, national spending on drugs is growing three
times as fast as overall health care spending, which itself rose
about 6 percent in 1999. Employers' health care expenses were a big
factor in the 4.3 percent rise in labor costs in the year ended in
March, the biggest increase since the early 1990s. Drug
expenditures will double in five years to $200 billion and rise to
$300 billion by 2010 if the current pace continues, said C. Daniel
Mullins, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefit managers say they can slow the pace for health
plans that are willing to place tight limits on members' drug
choices. Drug costs, they add, would rise even faster without their
industry's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third of the increases is from increased utilization,'' or
more people using more drugs, said Judith Cahill, executive
director of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, an
industry-supported professional group of pharmacists. ``A third is
from new, improved products, and a third is from plain old vanilla
inflation in the cost of products.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers are feeling the cost pressures. ``The largest
component in employers' health costs is not in-patient care, not
out-patient care or doctors' office visits or X-rays; it is
prescription drugs,'' said Raymond Brusca, vice president for
benefits at the Black &AMP; Decker Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Many health plans have raised premiums and shifted a larger
portion of the price of a prescription to employees and their
families. Others, mindful of union concerns and competition for
employees in a tight labor market, have swallowed hard and absorbed
the increases.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors was one of the first big employers to hire a
pharmacy benefit management company, in the 1980s. GM spent $762
million on drugs in its self-insured plans last year, up nearly 13
percent from 1998. The company recently hired a doctor of pharmacy
to work with the PBM to try to tame these costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Moroni, the company's assistant director of health plans,
said GM expected a cost increase of about 20 percent this year,
fueled by large numbers of older retirees covered by the company's
plan. Elderly people typically take three times as many drugs as
people under 65.
</P>
<P>
   After several mergers last year, the pharmacy benefit management
market is largely controlled by the three largest concerns.
Merck-Medco, PCS Health Systems and Express Scripts say they have
three-quarters of the country's PBM business.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by those companies and by the other pharmacy benefit
managers to control costs have largely been stymied. The savings
from discounts that pharmacy benefit managers get from drugstores
are reduced by manufacturers' price increases and swept away by
intense customer demand for advertised drugs, which are typically
more expensive than alternative products. Drug makers spent $1.9
billion on consumer advertising last year, according to
Scott-Levin, a research firm in Newtown, Pa. And sales of
prescription drugs rose 18 percent, compared with 1998 sales,
according to IMS Health Inc., a market research firm in Westport,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say the pharmacy benefit managers, which
typically charge employers up to 50 cents for each transaction as
well as other fees, have strong incentives to increase the use of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an increase in utilization, the PBMs get more money,''
said Debbie Stern, vice president of Rxperts Managed Care
Consulting, a drug consulting firm in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, drug makers promote new and highly competitive _
often more expensive _ products by giving the pharmacy benefit
managers rebates based on sales. (The rebates may or may not be
shared with employers.) That system, critics say, encourages PBMs
to choose higher priced drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anybody giving rebates on generics,'' the
lowest-priced drugs, said Patricia Wilson, a pharmaceuticals
consultant based in Rosemont, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction fees that employers pay for the billions of
prescriptions filled each year mount up. But Barrett Toan, chief
executive of Express Scripts, said these fees merely ``cover
expenses to process those claims.'' He said his customers were
reluctant to authorize harsh limits on drug benefits that might
antagonize their employees at a time of low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the pharmacy benefit management business is a
list, or formulary, of preferred drugs. The employee or health plan
member has a lower co-payment on these products, an incentive to
choose them. In theory, the preferred drugs _ which include many
generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection _ are as
good as or better than any in their class as well as the most
cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   But lawsuits filed on behalf of drug plan members over the last
three years in federal courts in several states argue that sponsors
of managed care drug plans are violating their fiduciary duty to
act in the best interest of patients rather than for company
profits, as required by the federal Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, or ERISA. Several of the suits have been filed
against Merck-Medco, a unit of Merck &AMP; Co., and at least one is
against PCS, which is owned by the Rite-Aid Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for PCS and Merck-Medco said the lawsuits were without
merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have a long history of developing plans and
programs that are designed to benefit plan sponsors and plan
members, with the ultimate goal of saving money for those plan
sponsors and plan members,'' said John Bloomfield, a spokesman for
Merck-Medco.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have raised questions about how much pharmacy
benefit managers really save employer health plans. These companies
typically offer large employers discounts of 12 percent to 15
percent, which come out of the retail pharmacy's pocket. The
discounts are subtracted from manufacturers' posted average
wholesale prices. But those prices may be inflated. ``They are not
an average, not wholesale and not a price, other than what
employers pay,'' Wilson, the pharmaceuticals consultant, said.
</P>
<P>
   While a customer waits at the drug counter, a computer screen
displays the terms of her insurance: the discount from list price,
a dispensing fee of $2.50 or so for the pharmacist, the customer's
other prescriptions and recent purchases, and the co-payment. The
health plan typically gets an electronic bill for most of the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The drug makers' prices are flexible, depending on the buyer.
``They set a price that they think they can get away with,'' said
Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs are frequently introduced, and some are priced 20 or
30 times as much as older treatments for the same illnesses. Drug
prices increased 5.2 percent in the 12 months ended in March, while
the cost of medical care including drugs rose only 3.9 percent and
overall consumer prices were up 3.7 percent, according to the Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Richard T. Clark, president of Merck-Medco, said health plans _
employers and their workers _ pay prices that are ``15 percent
lower on average'' than people without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because the pharmacy benefit managers and the drug makers
can keep their price decisions well out of public view, questions
continue to arise. The National Association of State Insurance
Commissioners is considering whether to recommend legislation to
regulate the industry. Kathleen Sibelius, the Kansas insurance
commissioner, said there was ``a growing concern about the monopoly
of control by pharmacy benefit managers who currently are not under
a regulatory umbrella, are not licensed or reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't screened in any way, but they may have a
significant impact on access to prescription drugs and costs
associated with that access,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Scanlon, director of health financing issues at the
General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
advised the Senate Finance Committee in March that if the drug
benefit managers' role in Medicare was expanded, the pharmacy
managers would have to give up the secrecy that now cloaks their
pricing deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has subpoenaed records of PCS and
Merck-Medco, the two biggest pharmacy benefit management companies,
in an inquiry over the fiduciary duty to drug plan members and
whether certain types of payments to the industry involve
kickbacks. No charges have been filed. Both companies said they
complied with the laws and were cooperating with the investigation.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jim Sheehan, chief of the civil division in the U.S. Attorney's
office in Philadelphia, who is heading the Justice Department
inquiry, said there was ``a tension'' between the benefits that
pharmacy benefit managers provide and ``where they make their
money.'' He added, ``The efficiencies in the business are in the
claims processing and the mail order services; the money is in the
rebates.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, a White House adviser on health policy, said the
administration's Medicare proposal would include requirements to
enhance the quality of service to Medicare enrollees. The plan, he
said, was built on ``taking the best private practices and avoiding
the worst.''

JAPAN FACES FREE-FOR-ALL IF TOP FACTION LOSES CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In the shadowy world of Japanese politics true turning
points can be difficult to spot.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few weeks, after the incapacitating stroke
suffered by a sitting prime minister, and the retirement from
politics of a former prime minister who was his mentor, Japanese
politicians and commentators have begun to speak of the end of a
style of factional politics that has been in force for 45 years.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden illness of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi last month,
and the retirement of Noboru Takeshita last week _ both men
belonged to the dominant faction of the long-ruling Liberal
Democratic Party _ has been likened to a corporation's abrupt loss
of both its chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's stroke forced the party's historically dominant faction
to surrender the prime minister's office to a rival group in the
party, led by the country's new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori. But
many analysts are treating Takeshita's retirement, officially
attributed to a severe back ailment, as the more significant event.
</P>
<P>
   In Japanese politics since World War II, Takeshita, 76, has had
few rivals in terms of sheer power or endurance. Although he was
prime minister for less than 18 months, he remained his party's
ultimate broker up to the nomination of his protege, Obuchi, in
1998.

</P>
<P>
   His style was a sharp contrast to that of his predecessor,
Kakuei Tanaka, the sharp-tongued political don who preceded
Takeshita as the Liberal Democratic Party's undisputed kingmaker.
Tanaka was brought down by a bribery scandal in 1974 after serving
as prime minister for just two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tanaka was very gruff, very forceful and very opinionated,''
said Gerald L. Curtis, a professor of political science at Columbia
University. ``Then came Takeshita, the master consensus builder,
the master of the art of mediating between people who want
something from the government and the people who have the power to
give it.''
</P>
<P>
   By getting things done while allowing others to take the credit,
Takeshita perfected a model of money-centered, ideology-free
machine politics whose opacity and indirection perfectly suited a
modern Japan in full expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``To understand Takeshita is to understand what power means in
Japan,'' said Toru Hayano, a senior columnist at the Asahi Shimbun,
a major newspaper. ``He is not eloquent. He is not a big
philosopher. He has no special program of reforms. The essence of
his style was to adjust a little bit every day based on what you
have gathered up until then. If there is opposition, you consult
with others. When a decision is reached, you distribute the
rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the rewards were distributed first to rural Japan,
whose wealth the government cultivated by protecting its
agricultural products from competition, and subsidizing
transportation and construction.
</P>
<P>
   Like his predecessor, Takeshita, in 1989, was forced to resign
as prime minister because of a scandal. However, he played the
pivotal role in determining the choice of seven of the next eight
prime ministers.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that Takeshita and his faction became a virtual
politburo that used its control over the pork barrel to dominate
the country's overwhelmingly dominant party, suppressing debate in
the process.
</P>
<P>
   With Obuchi in a coma, the faction was caught with no obvious
candidate for the prime minister's office, and no one with the
power and prestige to serve as kingmaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Takeshita's retirement should be seen as a symbolic event
indicating that this peculiar style of political control _ peculiar
even in the history of Japanese politics _ is beginning to
change,'' the Asahi Shimbun said in a recent editorial.
</P>
<P>
   What comes next, many feel, will be a period of unusual
competition, both within the Liberal Democratic Party and without.
The new prime minister, Mori, is widely expected to call
parliamentary elections on June 25. But hobbled by an unpopular
coalition with a Buddhist-affiliated party, and a weak economy, his
prospects are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   A poor result could cause the party to jettison Mori, sparking a
free-for-all in which no faction of the governing party can
dominate by sheer numbers. Under these circumstances,
long-submerged policy differences over questions like heavy deficit
spending, subsidies for the farming and construction lobbies and
economic liberalization would likely come to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently there is no order-giving power in the LDP and the
factions are disintegrating,'' said a wistful Shigezo Hayasaka,
Takeshita's longtime political secretary. ``Of course the LDP has
plenty of young people, but they are so conscious of their own
rights that they are no good at working within the system.''

<P>
   EAST HAMPTON, N.Y. _ They sit at the end of the rutted dirt
road, with fenced-in back yards that go too close to the marshes:
six house trailers, all showing their age, all occupied, all
scheduled for the wrecker's ball in a town that more and more
prizes wetlands and open space.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to move, but where can we go?'' said Andreas
Garcia, 49, a groundskeeper who owns one of the condemned trailers
in the Three Mile Island Trailer Park on Soak Hides Road, about
five minutes from the expensive cashmere and leather goods shops on
Main Street. ``Now it's too hard to find a place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   The angry owner-occupants represent merely the most visible
evidence of what is happening in the Hamptons, and in the United
States' wealthiest enclaves and resort towns: Many of those who
were born here, along with others who arrived more recently, are
being forced out.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamptons has always been a place of contrasts: of workers
and wealth, of masons and millionaires, of carpenters and kings of
dot-com. But within the last year the gap has grown. ``It's a
disaster,'' said Nina Stewart, who directs the department of
housing and community development here.
</P>
<P>
   In East Hampton, where the average house price is $573,725 _
more than triple the national average _ even salaries as high as
$110,000 no longer guarantee a two-bedroom, two-bath bungalow with
Montauk daisies and a picket fence.
</P>
<P>
   People with incomes in the $50,000 to $70,000 range find they
are competing for year-round rentals with Manhattanites willing to
pay anywhere from $25,000 up _ just for July and August. And for
those earning less than $50,000, a job in the Hamptons increasingly
means a long trip home on congested roads.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart herself has settled in Bellport, Long Island, unable to
find affordable housing in East Hampton and joining what locals
call the ``trade parade'' along the Montauk Highway, the major road
into the Hamptons, which snakes its way through quaint towns every
morning starting at 6:30 and every afternoon starting as early as
3. Pickup trucks and vans back up for miles between Bridgehampton
and Water Mill, moving as slowly as corn syrup on a frosty morning.
Stewart spends an hour and a half in traffic, twice a day.
</P>
<P>
   Taking care of those roads has itself become a challenge. Just
two weeks before the annual beach migration, nearly half the jobs
on East Hampton's 36-member road crew were unfilled. Workers cannot
afford to take jobs that pay, on average, $25,000, said Jay H.
Schneiderman, the town supervisor, because the cost of housing is
so high.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the people clogging the Montauk Highway are construction
workers, the backbone of a building frenzy that has created the
lowest unemployment rate in Suffolk County, 3 percent, since the
state started keeping track in 1974. These skilled laborers,
earning $25 to $35 an hour, up from $20 last year, say they too
have been shut out of affordable rentals.
</P>
<P>
   Along Further Lane, Georgica Road and Lily Pond Lane, where
Martha Stewart lives a bouillon cube's throw from Steven Spielberg
and Harry Macklowe, nothing much is left to rent. Shingled stately
homes and Palm Beach-style palazzi are rising from the sandy soil;
scaffolding crisscrosses plywood boxes at breakneck speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're building an average of a house a day out here,''
Schneiderman said. ``but none of them will house the people who are
going to service these new houses: first the carpenters, then the
lawn guys, the house cleaners, the whole infrastructure to maintain
the estates.'' And despite the recent stock-market gyrations, the
permit-a-day pace continued throughout April.
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, Jan Furman, East Hampton's superintendent of
schools, worries about finding candidates who can afford to take
the job of high school principal, which pays $110,000. ``It sounds
like a lot of money,'' Furman said, ``but they can buy a lot less
house here than they could in upstate New York, making less
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric N. Brown, Schneiderman's chief of staff, had his
$600-a-month rental snatched out from under him by summer tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just moved into the second-floor bedroom of my in-laws,''
said Brown, a lawyer. His wife, Laura, is a behaviorial
psychologist. ``We make $75,000 between us, which anywhere else
would be a lot,'' he said. ``We looked at a house, a cute little
house in Sag Harbor, that overlooked a rubbish dump,'' he said.
``It was $399,000; there was no way we could have afforded it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who keep the town functioning are moving farther
and farther away. They land in towns like Riverhead and Hampton
Bays, Shirley and Mastic, trying to keep their jobs along the
Hamptons Gold Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In the inevitable real-estate ripple, those at the bottom face
the toughest housing problems. In the past, hotels and restaurants
sometimes housed seasonal workers _ many from places like Ecuador
and Ireland _ in nearby barracks, but even these are being
converted to cooperative apartments and sold to weekenders.
</P>
<P>
   As head of housing in East Hampton, Nina Stewart hands out
federal Section 8 subsidies to landlords who offer low- to
moderate-income rentals. But the pool of interested landlords is
dwindling. The town itself has built about 300 units of subsidized
low- to moderate-income housing since 1984, but only five in the
last two years, blaming a shortage of available land.
</P>
<P>
   Schneiderman said there were now ``only two small parcels in the
whole town where we could build affordable housing _ politically.
They're both near the railroad tracks.'' But even that proposition,
he confessed, would likely encounter political opposition from
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Land preservation is the clear winner. Two years ago, county
voters levied a 2 percent tax on real-estate transfers, but the
money can be used only for open space. With rising property prices,
the tax has brought in a windfall, twice as much as was projected
only two years ago, and in 1999 alone it raised $6 million for East
Hampton. Over 500 acres has been set aside for open-space
preservation just since January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're doing well on preservation,'' Schneiderman said,
``and we're doing miserably building houses for our working
people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 families who have applied for federally subsidized
housing cannot move up the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   At the Three Mile Island Trailer Park, which was bought by the
town in March, residents meet in angry klatches on the bumpy road
near a handwritten ``Eggs for Sale'' sign. They worry that they
will not be able to save the six condemned trailers closest to the
tall marsh grasses _ trailers that both sides say are probably too
old to move.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Schneiderman said he would not evict the
residents until he could find them a new place to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six doesn't sound like much,'' said Richard Whalen, the town
lawyer who handles land acquisitions. ``But it's six more units of
affordable housing we need.''
</P>
<P>
   The town has offered $12,000 to $13,000 to buy the trailers,
amounts their owners have deemed ridiculous. But even if the town
increases the amount _ officials acknowledge privately that they
would have to raise it substantially to be fair _ the owners say
they want to stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We own our own homes,'' said Garcia, the groundskeeper, who
lives in a condemned trailer. ``Even if we wanted to rent, we
couldn't find anything under $2,200 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the last year, fewer and fewer landlords have been
willing to rent out their houses year round, said Diane Saatchi,
president of Dayton Halstead Real Estate, who ``disappoints people
looking for year-round rentals on a daily basis.''
</P>
<P>
   It all boils down to money.
</P>
<P>
   Between December 1998 and December 1999, Cook Pony Farm, a large
Hamptons realty company, found that the average sale price in the
combined Hamptons was $464,000; in East Hampton Village the average
price rose to $1.16 million, a 43 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, some of those who thought they would live in East
Hampton for the rest of their lives now find they cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't find a house there,'' Lee DeGraaf, a marina
worker, said. Like many other year-round residents, he and his wife
have spent their married life moving from one rental to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my daughter was born, back in '88, we were paying $700 a
month for a real nice house,'' he said. ``But we kept being forced
out _ the landlords were going to sell the house or were just
getting more rent every time. Now most of the houses, the landlords
have decided to sell them.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long search, the DeGraafs thought they had found
something: a $1,400-a-month place on a dirt road. But there was an
attic fire the night they moved in. The DeGraafs looked in vain for
another affordable rental in East Hampton. They had to widen their
search.
</P>
<P>
   Now the family feels it has ``lucked out,'' DeGraaf said, with a
three-bedroom house in Flanders, about a 45-minute drive away,
which they snagged a year ago for $900 a month. DeGraaf quit his
Hamptons painting jobs and found work as a dockmaster at a marina
in Hampton Bays. His wife still commutes to her old job in an East
Hampton pharmacy. ``This house would go for $2,000 a month in East
Hampton,'' DeGraaf said proudly.
</P>
<P>
   But a year later, the market value of such houses has climbed to
$1,200 a month. ``People are being priced out of Riverhead as
well,'' said Edwin Fishel Tuccio, who owns a brokerage of the same
name in Riverhead, a family business since the turn of the century.
``Where are they going?'' he said. ``Further west, I guess, into
Brookhaven.''
</P>
<P>
   Others interviewed said a significant number of working-class
and middle-class families had left for the Southern states or
northern New England, where the wages are low but so are the
housing costs.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Cooper took over as director of land protection for the
Nature Conservancy in East Hampton about a year and a half ago,
moving there with her husband, Richard, a landscaper, and their
infant daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Last month they moved again _ to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had found a place in Amagansett for $1,500 a month,'' she
said of her winter rental. When the summer rolled around, Richard
Cooper landed a house-sitting job in Southampton, ``but we were
merely surviving,'' said his wife, who was earning nearly $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has a lower-paying job as a planner with the state of
Maine, and the family lives in a three-bedroom cottage on a lake
near Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pay $600 a month rent,'' she said. ``In the Hamptons, we
ate warehouse food. We could never go out to eat. Now we can afford
a $12, $15, $18 bottle of wine at home. And now we can go out to
dinner!
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very difficult to make the decision to leave,'' Judith
Cooper explained. ``We still have some wonderful friends there,
friends who got their piece of the pie 20 years ago. They have a
great life. But for us, it just wasn't possible.''

PARTISAN DIFFERENCES IN SENATE THREATEN EDUCATION BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Nothing enraptures lawmakers in an election year
like a prolonged discussion about the needs of school children, an
issue that ranks sky high in importance for voters.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate delved into the year's most important
education bill, a piece of legislation that would provide nearly
$15 billion in education money, most of it for impoverished
students. Democrats fashioned a ``war room'' with a chalkboard,
school desks and computers, where senators conducted on-line chats
about education. Republicans countered with snazzy charts and a
steady flow of news conferences inside and outside the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   But behind all the razzle-dazzle lies one startling possibility:
This could be the first time in 35 years that an education bill so
bogs down over partisan differences that it is vetoed by a
president, if it does not get yanked from the Senate floor
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen things so contentious,'' said Christopher
Cross, a former senior Republican aide in the House who is now
president of the nonprofit Council for Basic Education. ``And I've
never seen them take so long to enact a piece of education
legislation. We are now well into the second year, and it looks as
if they won't get anything enacted.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of trying to write bipartisan legislation, Republicans
and Democrats have seized the debate to showcase their opposing
remedies for ailing schools. The fact that Vice President Al Gore
and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have turned education into a
signature issue has only served to infuse this year's Senate debate
with partisan rancor.
</P>
<P>
   Fuming Democrats say that when they were in charge, they never
bungled the education bill, a measure revising and extending
federal school programs that comes up every six years. They accuse
Republicans of trying to jam through proposals that would devastate
low-income schools. ``The Democrats never made this a partisan
issue,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who is the Senate
dean on education issues. ``It's inexcusable.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans reply that Democrats purposely want to thwart the
bill so they can turn around and label Republicans anti-education
on the campaign stump and hold their advantage with voters on the
issue. They say Democrats are beholden to the teachers' unions and
so entrenched in the status quo they do not want to try anything
new.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have functioned for 35 years under a system developed by
Democrats in Congress,'' said Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. ``And we've
had 35 years of kids who haven't been able to read or write.''
</P>
<P>
   If the bill founders this year, the consequences would not be
catastrophic, which is one reason the Senate does not feel
compelled to compromise. The Department of Education, and the local
schools, would still receive their $14 billion under the current
regulations without a change in policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the wrangling over the bill illustrates just how far apart
the two parties stand in addressing the frustrations of parents,
and demonstrates how deeply politicized the question of education
has become on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, you have both playing to the extremes of their
parties,'' said Amy Wilkins, the principle partner for the
Education Trust, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that focuses
on poor children. ``Are these guys going to grow up or are they
going to continue to posture?''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, President Clinton is likely to veto the bill
if Republicans stay wedded to several of their proposals. One would
send billions of dollars directly to the states through block
grants, giving governors leeway over how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say the states need to be held responsible for how
they spend their money. Republicans maintain that their bill would
tie the money to improved academic performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is virtually no accountability on the Republican side
with the blank-check approach they use in their block grants,''
said Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   A second component would permit some disadvantaged students to
switch public schools and take their federal dollars with them, a
move Republicans said would prompt underachieving schools to shape
up. Democrats argue that the measure would drain money away from
the schools that need it most.
</P>
<P>
   What's needed, Democrats argue, is more money to spend on more
teachers, to fix decrepit school buildings and to help poor
children. This remedy, which originated with Clinton, is widely
supported by the teachers' unions.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation and the debate crystallizes the fundamental
differences between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
   Despite deep philosophical divisions, each side has made
concessions. Republicans, who vowed a few years ago to dismantle
the Department of Education, have increased federal spending on
education several years in a row. And Democrats are more willing to
demand accountability for education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated with the lack of consensus, a small group of moderate
Senate Democrats, led by Sens. Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut
and Evan Bayh of Indiana, is pushing alternative legislation that
poaches ideas from both parties. The two senators agree that local
school districts need more money and more flexibility to spend the
money they get, but they also need oversight.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, R-Conn., and Rep. Charles
B. Rangel, D-N.Y., have also banded together to pass a bipartisan
bill on school construction.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts at compromise could well be thwarted by the forces
of election year politics. ``People want to be concerned about
having an issue,'' Lieberman said last month.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the endless debate on education policy in Washington and
on the campaign trail, education experts and lobbyists say both
parties end up distorting the influence the federal government has
on a child's education. The $15 billion being talked about is only
about 7 percent of the budget for all education spending, and the
bulk is directed at disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public is going to be led to believe that problems will be
solved at the national level, and they won't be,'' said Cross of
the Council for Basic Education. ``They are solved school by
school.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The 10-year project to decode the human genome is entering its
end game, but the high goal of unlocking the secrets of human
heredity is ending in a fractious exchange of claims and
countercharges.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks, both contestants in the genome race plan to
declare victory, but in different terms, each already judged
imperfect by the rival team.
</P>
<P>
   The genome is an instruction manual containing the 100,000 or so
genes that govern human development, operation and maintenance.
Defects in various of these genes cause or contribute to almost all
human disease.
</P>
<P>
   At stake is academic glory for the genome researchers, an
eventual gold mine for the companies that are first to develop
useful drugs from the genomic information, and a landmark in
scientific history as the foundation for human self-knowledge is
put in place.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant is a consortium of largely U.S. and British
academic centers supported by the National Institutes of Health and
the Wellcome Trust of London. The other is Celera Corp., an upstart
whose formation just two years ago turned the centers' unchallenged
pursuit of the genome into a furious race.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, each side has made remarkable progress. The
consortium, despite its unwieldy organization, responded to the
Celera challenge, scrapped its target date of 2005 and focused on
providing a rough but usable human genome sequence as early as
possible. Its rough draft _ some 90 percent to 95 percent of the
genome including most of the genes _ may be ready as early as June.
</P>
<P>
   Washington expects to have invested more than $3 billion by the
time the project is complete and Celera about half a billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Celera, whose name is the female form of the Latin word meaning
``quick,'' has indeed been strikingly nimble. In just two years it
has built a plant with 300 DNA sequencing machines, decoded the
genome of the fruit fly _ a widely studied laboratory organism _ as
a pilot project and, according to its president, Dr. J. Craig
Venter, is within a few weeks of decoding almost the entire human
genome.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two sides have discussed collaborating on a joint
publication, talks broke down in December amid charges of
``antagonism and excessive competition'' made by Dr. Francis
Collins, head of the National Institutes of Health unit of the
Human Genome Project, in a letter to Venter and other Celera
officials.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In any agreement, Collins wrote, referring to what he evidently
considered past lapses by the Celera side, there would have to be
``honest and straightforward responses to scientific inquiries, but
avoiding disparaging the other party, sowing discord or undermining
the collaborative spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The intense pace of competition has been heightened by personal
and institutional factors. Venter's ideas for decoding genomes have
several times been dismissed as unworkable by the consortium's
leading experts, and he has not hidden his satisfaction in proving
he was right. His overall strategy for decoding the human genome,
called a whole genome shotgun, was considered and rejected by the
consortium, but in Celera's hands it has worked, at least with the
fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   Consortium scientists say Venter has unfair advantages, notably
in that Celera can use all the genome data that the consortium
makes publicly available through GenBank, the government's computer
data base for genome information.
</P>
<P>
   In its public statements, the consortium, which seems to have
chosen a workable but less efficient decoding strategy than
Venter's, has aimed to seize the high ground on the issue of data
release. Though scientists usually harvest the first fruits of
their findings themselves, the consortium's centers publish their
genome data immediately on the GenBank data base, where it is free
for any use.
</P>
<P>
   On March 14, President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair
were persuaded to issue a statement saying the genome ``should be
made freely available to scientists everywhere.'' The two leaders
praised the consortium's data release policy and, at least in
Venter's view, indirectly criticized Celera. The statement
inadvertently devastated biotechnology stocks, including Celera's,
when it was misinterpreted by the markets as meaning the two
governments would oppose patenting human genomic data.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has said it will make its human genome sequence available
on a DVD disk, with no control over any discoveries that other
scientists may derive from the information. But the company has
refused to deposit its data in GenBank without safeguards to
prevent its commercial rivals, such as Incyte and Human Genome
Sciences, from downloading the data and selling it as their own.
</P>
<P>
   Although the consortium wants everyone to use its data, that
resolve is less intense when the user is Celera. Collins has said
it would be ``a breach of scientific ethics'' for Celera to include
the consortium's data in its article describing the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   This charge has not resonated well. ``I strongly disagree with
that,'' said Dr. David Lipman, director of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information, which runs GenBank. ``These groups
understood when they deposited their data that the whole goal was
to make it available without restrictions immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lipman supports another position being taken by the
consortium, that journal editors should refuse to accept Celera's
article on its human genome sequence until the company has first
deposited its data in GenBank. Genome sequences are mind-numbing
rows of A's, T's, C's and G's that would take hundreds of pages if
printed in full. Many journal editors require authors of genome
articles to deposit the sequence in GenBank's computers as a
condition of publication.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lipman said GenBank did not have the resources to accommodate
Celera's request that its data, if deposited in GenBank, should
receive legal protection from copying by its commercial rivals.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two teams are negotiating with rival journals to publish
their descriptions of the genome _ the consortium with Nature of
London, Celera with Science of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the customary scientific practice of waiting for
publication until announcing a new discovery, the two sides are
likely to issue claims of success well before their articles appear
in print. To pre-empt Celera's article in Science, the consortium
may hope to enlist Clinton and Blair again in an announcement,
perhaps early next month, that it has achieved its rough draft of
the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   To pre-empt the consortium's declaration of victory, Venter may
make it known, perhaps this week, that he has successfully
assembled the human genome, the final stage in decoding and in
principle a large step ahead of the rough draft stage reached by
the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have already found fault with the other's victory
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's data is in a mixture of states. Though some
regions of the 3 billion-unit human genome, like the short
chromosome 22, are essentially complete, much of the rest is in the
form of millions of short pieces of DNA, most of them about 10,000
units of DNA in length. Although the consortium knows roughly where
each piece should go on its parent chromosome, it does not know
exactly enough to place all the pieces in correct order.
</P>
<P>
   Venter has said that anything worthy of being called a human
genome sequence needs to be arranged in correct order, which the
consortium's rough draft is not.
</P>
<P>
   If Venter's whole genome shotgun approach works as well with the
human genome as it did with the fruit fly, Celera's version of the
genome will all be in correct order.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's genome is likely, however, to have lots of gaps. The
gaps in its fruit fly genome sequence were mostly small holes of
known length and position that could be filled in later and were of
minor significance. But Dr. Robert Waterston, head of the
sequencing center at Washington University, St. Louis, a leading
component of the consortium, has calculated that there could be
100,000 gaps in Celera's human genome sequence, with an especially
large number in regions where Celera has no consortium data to rely
on.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even though the consortium's rough draft will not be completely
ordered and will contain many gaps, it will nonetheless be of great
value to researchers. Most of the genes are contained within the
decoded regions and can be fished out by computer search programs,
Lipman said.
</P>
<P>
   With Celera's fully assembled genome, it will be possible both
to search for genes and to compare the human genome with other
genomes, an important step in understanding how the human genome
works.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the battle of rival claims, one certain winner will be the
public. Because of the competition, the human genome sequence and
all the benefits expected to flow from it will be available to
researchers and pharmaceutical companies more than four years ahead
of the original target date of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they both represent remarkable achievements,'' said
Dr. William Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences.

PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA DETAILS QUEST TO GRASP AIDS DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL L. SWARNS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ For months, President Thabo Mbeki says,
he pored through medical journals, consulted with scientists and
struggled to understand the epidemiology of the AIDS epidemic that
is ravaging his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reading all these complicated things, language I don't
understand,'' Mbeki said Saturday as he addressed an advisory panel
of international AIDS researchers here. ``I've got dictionaries all
around me in case there are words that are difficult to understand.
I phone the minister of health and ask her what does this word mean
and she explains.''
</P>
<P>
   In this strikingly personal speech, Mbeki offered his first
detailed explanation of how he came to consult with two Americans
who argue that HIV does not cause AIDS. The decision, which became
public two months ago, quickly touched off a firestorm of
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Leading scientists have criticized him for wasting time on
discredited theories while South Africa is suffering one of the
highest HIV infection rates in the world. Some researchers have
called for a boycott of an international AIDS conference that is
scheduled to be held here in July.
</P>
<P>
   And as prominent American newspapers published editorials last
month condemning his stance, some government officials here began
to fear that the issue would overshadow Mbeki's first state visit
to the United States, set for May 20, a visit that some had hoped
would focus on South Africa's blossoming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Mbeki said that he and his ministers knew that the
human immunodeficiency virus caused AIDS. He said he reached out to
the Americans when he discovered how differently the disease
appeared in sub-Saharan Africa as compared with the United States
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.N. AIDS program, two types of HIV are
currently recognized, and the most common, HIV-1, has 10
genetically distinct subtypes.
</P>
<P>
   Subtype B, which is most commonly transmitted through homosexual
contact and intravenous drug use, is primarily found in the
Americas, Europe, Australia, Japan and the Caribbean. Subtype C,
most often found in South Africa and India, seems to be more
infectious with a higher potential for heterosexual transmission,
the United Nations says.
</P>
<P>
   When he could not find satisfying explanations for such
differences, Mbeki said, he began exploring the work of researchers
who believe that poverty and malnutrition are more likely causes of
the disease in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for an answer because all of the information
that has been communicated says in reality that we are faced with a
catastrophe,'' Mbeki explained in his speech at the Sheraton Hotel
here. ``And you can't respond to a catastrophe merely by saying, `I
will do what is routine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki refused to dismiss the work of the American researchers
David Rasnick, a biochemist, and Peter Duesberg, a professor of
biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of California
at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are included in the government's 33-member advisory
panel, which met Saturday for the first time and will advise Mbeki
on the cause and best treatments for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is evenly split between those who believe that HIV
causes AIDS, including Professor Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur
Institute in Paris, whose research team discovered the virus _ and
those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   But the uncharacteristically personal speech did offer some rare
insight into Mbeki. As he described his efforts to understand HIV,
which has infected more than 3 million people in this country of 44
million, he portrayed an intensely driven, hands-on leader who is
reluctant to leave critical decision-making to others.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lodge, a professor of political science at the University of
the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said: ``In one way, of course,
it's an admirable indication of an extremely conscientious and
intelligent chief executive. But I think he's also a compulsive
interferer. There is a medical establishment. You leave, as it
were, to the experts certain things that require expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar criticisms come from doctors in the medical community
here, on this and other aspects of the government's handling of
AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
   In March, government officials scrambled to explain how $6.2
million of the country's $17 million AIDS budget went unspent last
year. And last year, Mbeki stunned health experts by questioning
the safety of the standard anti-AIDS drug AZT. The government has
decided not to distributed the drug in public hospitals here, even
though the National Institutes of Health in the United States has
determined that the benefits of the drug far outweigh the potential
side effects.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The first time President-elect Vladimir
Putin deserted Moscow and staged a meeting with a visiting head of
state here, Russians hardly noticed.
</P>
<P>
   That was in March, when Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain
came to the city that Peter the Great built and that served as
Russia's capital for two centuries. The Russian and British leaders
strolled with their wives into the Mariinsky Theater, and from the
imperial vantage point of the czar's former box they watched the
gala opening of the opera ``War and Peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But the second time it happened, when Putin abandoned the
capital last month and flew here to meet Prime Minister Yoshiro
Mori of Japan in the splendor of the Winter Palace, tongues started
wagging that Putin was raising the status of his hometown in a
manner that touched the historical chord of rivalry between Moscow
and St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big conflict, not only a conflict of cities but
a conflict of psychologies,'' said Anastasia Kuryokhina, one of the
city's cultural promoters and the widow of Sergei Kuryokhin, a
well-known poet and musician here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people in Moscow do not like St. Petersburgers,'' she
added. ``There are strong feelings. There are cultural differences.
Muscovites are practical and pragmatic. St. Petersburg tends to be
more romantic, more philosophical.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Muscovites have their own views. St. Petersburgers
have been disparaged for putting on airs, or regarded as dandies
who hold their inland countrymen in low esteem while living in
their own micro-culture of excessive intellectualism or, in
imperial times, just excess.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one took Putin's image-making very seriously. After
all, it was natural that this river city of canals and splendid
baroque architecture that is home to the Kirov Ballet, a lively
theater district and some of the world's great art collections
would receive some favor from Russia's new leader, the first to
come from here since the end of the Romanov dynasty. As long as
Putin was just engaged in gestures such as hanging a portrait of
Peter the Great in his Kremlin office no one seemed threatened.
Until now.
</P>
<P>
   While Putin was meeting here with the Japanese prime minister,
the speaker of Russia's parliament, Gennadi Seleznyov, a moderate
Communist who was also visiting the city, surprised an audience of
politicians and reporters by saying he favored moving Russia's
parliament out of Moscow and relocating it here on the banks of the
Neva River.
</P>
<P>
   That move would effectively reverse the shift made by Vladimir
Lenin, who put a symbolic stamp on the Communist triumph over
czarism by shifting the capital back to Moscow and renaming St.
Petersburg Petrograd. After he died in 1924, this city was called
Leningrad in his honor _ another move to extirpate memories of the
czarist past.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov said that Russia's members of parliament currently
suffer ``considerable inconvenience,'' working in ``ill-adapted
rooms'' across from the Kremlin in the nondescript former
headquarters of the Soviet state planning agency Gosplan since
troops loyal to former President Boris Yeltsin destroyed the former
parliament building while quashing an attempted coup in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov sketched a proposal for a new parliament building,
pledged to bring the issue to debate this month and concluded that
``the next Duma,'' the lower house of parliament, to be elected in
2003, ``could be meeting in St. Petersburg.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The man standing beside Seleznyov _ and beaming _ was St.
Petersburg's governor Vladimir Yakovlev, who has advocated moving
all or part of the Russian government here to enhance both the
restoration of the city and its long-term economic development.
Yakovlev told Seleznyov that a large tract of land was reserved for
a new parliament building near Smolny Cathedral in the center of
the city, and plans could be drawn up for modern offices and
elegant chambers for the upper and lower houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Putin said it was an ``interesting'' idea, but
from Moscow, there was only scoffing.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Yuri Luzhkov attacked the idea as ``mostly politicking''
and insisted that all major government institutions be located in
Moscow, the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov predicted that while Seleznyov might succeed in
scheduling a parliamentary debate in the lower house, it would be
dead on arrival in the upper chamber whose members include Luzhkov
and Russia's governors and regional leaders, who are unlikely to
have any interest in spending huge sums of scarce national
resources to relocate the parliament.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The leader of Seleznyov's own Communist Party, Gennadi Zyuganov,
and other influential voices said Russia's economic woes would only
deepen if the three branches of government were split up.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Seleznyov certainly succeeded in gaining extensive coverage and
reawakening a rivalry dating back to the founding of St. Petersburg
at the outset of the 18th century, when Peter sought a toehold on
the Baltic Sea and a window to Europe, sending thousands to their
death through his insistence on building a grand new capital on a
swamp and forcing the xenophobic nobles of Moscow to haul building
stones in their carriages and move their households here.
Resentment against the city has simmered ever since.

NEW SUPPORT TO HELP SERBS FROM KOSOVO TO GO HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Ten months after they fled the province
in the face of revenge attacks from Kosovar Albanians, the Serbs of
Kosovo and other minorities are seeing international political will
swing in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations to help hundreds, even thousands of Serbs and
Gypsies to return this summer are gaining momentum and have sparked
vigorous competition between local Serbian leaders to reap the
political rewards of bringing people home.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Albanian leaders have not opposed the planned returns,
although they have set some conditions and excluded the return of
any suspected war criminals. As the plans materialize,
international aid officials warn that opposition will grow.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments, peacekeepers and the U.N. administration
here are showing a sudden determination to bring Serbs home. The
head of the U.N. mission in Kosovo, Dr. Bernard Kouchner, made the
new drift clear when he endorsed the idea in front of a visiting
Security Council delegation late last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all in favor of Serbs returning,'' he said, announcing
the creation of a new committee to coordinate the returns. ``We
need them back, we want them back, but please without any
adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other Western nations have lent impetus to
the idea, apparently seeking to win the political cooperation of
the Serbs and to counter persistent criticism that while they
helped nearly 1 million Albanian refugees return to Kosovo last
year, they have presided over a violent exodus of more than 200,000
Serbs, Gypsies and other minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The showcase project favored by the Americans is for some 500
Serbs to return to the village of Osojane in northwestern Kosovo.
The $5 million plan will involve building a road to provide Serbs
with safe access and complete reconstruction of the village, which
was razed after the villagers fled last June. Spanish peacekeeping
troops will provide security.
</P>
<P>
   British troops are undertaking a more discreet effort in central
Kosovo, repairing road and rail links and houses in a ring of
Serbian villages around the capital, Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees plans to return
thousands of Gypsies to several towns around Kosovo. Widely accused
of collaborating with the Serbs in the expulsion and killing of
Albanians last year, 30,000 Gypsies fled and now live in guarded
camps in Kosovo or neighboring territories.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian leaders accepted the plan for the Gypsies' return after
Gypsy leaders acknowledged that some Gypsies had been involved in
crimes against humanity, said the chief of the U.N. refugee mission
in Kosovo, Dennis McNamara. He says thousands of Gypsies could
return this year.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Serbs is, however, far more explosive, and
McNamara and others have strong reservations. ``It is too early to
bring back refugees at this stage,'' said the chief of one
international aid organization in Pristina. ``The level of ethnic
hatred between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo is far greater than
anything I have seen elsewhere in the Balkans,'' added a colleague.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The newspapers are full of memorial notices for Albanians killed
last year, over 1,000 are still imprisoned elsewhere in Serbia, and
the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, Netherlands, has recently
resumed excavating suspected mass graves, noted another refugee
official, Paula Ghedini.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would not normally return refugees to an ongoing conflict
situation,'' said McNamara. ``If it is done early, without
cooperation, it could trigger off a violent reaction,'' he added,
while acknowledging the political momentum for return.
</P>
<P>
   McNamara's agency has been on the receiving end of significant
violence, most recently last weekend in the Serbian part of the
northern town of Kosovska Mitrovica when six peacekeepers and one
policeman were injured, 39 vehicles of international groups damaged
and four houses and one warehouse burned in protests of the
escorted return of Albanian refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Local Serbs have different reasons for pushing the returns.
Bishop Artemije, the leader of the Serbian National Council, has
made better treatment of Serbs a condition for joining Albanian
leaders in the administration set up by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian leaders in north Mitrovica broke with the bishop over
his willingness to do that, but still seek the political prestige
that will attach to any successful return.
</P>
<P>
   Marko Jaksic, who until recently worked with the bishop on
returns, said the Serbs cannot afford to wait. ``If we wait, these
people will never come back, and that will play in favor of the
Albanians, allowing them to establish their own independent
country,'' he said. ``They have one rule here _ with fewer Serbs it
is much easier to go for independence.''

A VOICE OF HOPE ON KOSOVO TELLS WASHINGTON OF GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the problems of Kosovo today, Veton Surroi,
the publisher of the province's largest newspaper, reminds himself
that things could be much worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have well ended up like the Kurds and made good
posters for Amnesty International,'' he said. ``Or Kosovars could
have ended up somewhere else, singing their own songs, getting
drunk in cafes and remembering 1999 as a lousy year.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Surroi, who is viewed by many diplomats as a voice of
reason in a traumatized corner of Europe, is trying to shape what
he hopes will one day be a civil society.
</P>
<P>
   Many officials in the international organizations that now run
Kosovo _ which has few courts and a primitive economy _ wonder
whether Surroi's goal can be achieved. Surroi, in an interview
during a visit to Washington, insisted that it can, and that Kosovo
must start now to shed its dependence on the United Nations, which
runs the province's administration.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi, who spent the duration of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia
last year in hiding from the Serbs in Kosovo's capital of Pristina,
is critical of the U.N. management of the province but says it is
not going to get any better.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the long promised U.N. police force of 6,500 is
still only 2,500 strong _ in part, Surroi said, because some of the
recruits had to be sent home because they failed shooting tests,
did not know how to drive, or, in the case of several Americans,
were so overweight that they could not walk more than 100 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi dismisses as bureaucratic folly the importing of
high-tech German garbage trucks to pick up trash, when it takes
weeks to find fuel for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've reached the peak of United Nations might, Kouchner has
spent all his magic,'' Surroi said of Bernard Kouchner, the chief
representative of the United Nations in Kosovo. ``There's not much
more the United Nations can do; now is the time for transition.''
</P>
<P>
   So Surroi, who was in Washington to collect an award from the
National Endowment for Democracy, did the rounds of Clinton
administration officials and Washington research groups with a
fairly simple message: Kosovo needs a constitution of its own to
provide a legal framework for building democratic institutions in a
society that has never known them.
</P>
<P>
   At the State Department, specialists in constitutions are
beginning to write one, although the thorniest question of all _
whether Kosovo, which remains formally a province of Serbia, should
or can move to independence _ is still open.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Kosovo continues to count on outside forces for much of
its existence _ on NATO for its security, on German banks for its
currency, on the United Nations for its international relations _
its inhabitants, overwhelmingly ethnic Albanian, need to assume
responsibility internally, Surroi said. A constitution is needed to
help define what Surroi calls ``self-rule'' but not necessarily
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   For many Kosovo Albanians, the war last year was the culmination
of many years of debate about how to separate from Serbia, from its
dominant leader, Slobodan Milosevic, and from the federation of
Yugoslavia, including Serbia and Montenegro, of which Milosevic is
president.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi argues that Kosovo can have its own constitution and
define its borders as within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
``This is a kind of virtual reality, because I can't find anyone
who considers the Federal Republic as a functioning state,'' he
said, alluding to the fact that Montenegro has largely broken with
Serbia politically, although the two remain together in the
federation.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi suggested that it is too soon to push for an independent
state _ a goal of almost all Kosovar Albanians not shared by all
Western nations, and opposed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the NATO bombing, when returning Albanians killed
Kosovo Serbs and burned their homes, Surroi spoke out against the
killings, appealing to his fellow Albanians not to force the
remaining Serbs to leave. He was publicly denounced for his stand.
</P>
<P>
   During several public talks this week, Surroi said that Kosovo
still had far to go in moving toward tolerance. He argued that this
was another reason for a constitution _ to establish individual
rights. ``You can't build tolerance on good will,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Kosovo to stand on its own feet _ and remove itself from its
dependence on the overwhelming number of aid organizations that are
tripping over themselves as they try to help schools and medical
centers _ the economy needs to be legally defined, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Serbia, Kosovo was run as a socialist area. Now, there is a
mixture of the old socialism, wild capitalism and strong-arm
tactics by Kosovo Liberation Army fighters who believe that having
been in the army gives them the right to expropriate property.
``The result is not very encouraging; we have to settle the
property issue,'' Surroi said.
</P>
<P>
   Surroi is the first to recognize that criminality abounds in
Kosovo, although he rejects the argument that criminal bosses have
taken control. The Kosovo Protection Corps, which is composed of
former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army _ the guerrilla
fighters that battled Serb control of Kosovo until NATO won the war
_ is not a band of ``angels,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he disputes the notion that Kosovo has become an enclave for
heavy drug trafficking. ``Kosovars are involved in drug trafficking
but not in Kosovo itself,'' he said. ``Kosovo is not a good
route.''
</P>
<P>
   There is hope in one small fact, he added. ``Things are lousy in
Kosovo. I know 100 places where I'd have a much better life. But
this is a society that has been without courts, police, laws for 10
months, yet people still stop at the red light.''

ZAMBIAN LEADER CRITICIZES SIERRA LEONE PEACEKEEPING STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ The president of Zambia said Saturday that the
200 Zambian peacekeepers taken hostage in Sierra Leone had been
deployed too quickly into unknown territory with out-of-date maps
and a shortage of other vital equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Zambian troops form the majority of the approximately 300
soldiers taken hostage last week in the West African country, where
the United Nations has sent an 8,300-member force to keep peace
after eight years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
   President Frederick Chiluba, speaking to reporters after meeting
with members of the U.N. Security Council on a peace mission in
Africa, criticized obliquely the commander of the peacekeeping
force in Sierra Leone, Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley of India.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the first time our forces have been in
peacekeeping,'' Chiluba said. ``This is the third or fourth time.
We have done very well because whenever we have gone, we have been
under some good leadership. That depends on who is in command, who
is giving orders to people to do what.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a little bit of an unfortunate situation,'' the
president said, adding that his troops had only recently arrived
and were prepared to go to another region.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were taken to that area a little prematurely,'' he said.
``They were prepared to go to somewhere else, but circumstances
made the officials divert them to that area. They didn't settle
properly. They were not provided with the necessary requisites to
carry out their job, but circumstances or the exigencies of the
mission prompted them to get into that area.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiluba, asked to describe the lack of preparation, answered:
``All sorts of factors. The maps, they were old, etc., etc.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not making judgment on a commander,'' he said. ``I'm not a
military person. But all I know is that I think they were deployed
rather prematurely. We hope and pray that everything will come out
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiluba said that he did not expect the Sierra Leone experience
to drive Zambians or other Africans away from peacekeeping
assignments. ``For peace, we'll do everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has not only happened in Africa,'' he said. ``When you
say there is peace in the Middle East, the fighting never stops.
When you hear there is peace in Kosovo, suddenly you hear they are
fighting and they're killing. So it's not peculiar to Africa.
Everywhere where there is war, tempers and tensions rise from time
to time, and this is what we have to manage.''
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in Sierra Leone has dogged the seven-member Security
Council delegation traveling around Africa to give impetus to a
wobbly peace effort in Congo. The seven ambassadors to the United
Nations _ from Britain, France, Mali, Namibia, the Netherlands,
Tunisia and the United States _ have spent hours on the phone
talking to their governments and to colleagues in New York. The
diplomats say they are acutely aware of how important the
resolution of the Sierra Leone problem is to the hopes for any
operation in Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important issue now before the Security
Council in the short term,'' said Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's
representative. ``It's a big blow for peacekeeping in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the Security Council would have to look ultimately
at how to deal with Foday Sankoh, whose troops from the
Revolutionary United Front rebel movement have created havoc in
Sierra Leone a year after signing an peace agreement in return for
significant concessions that other nations were reluctant to
approve _ but finally had no alternative but to accept. One of
those conditions gave Sankoh a ministry in the government of Sierra
Leone's embattled, elected president, Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a court, as in Yugoslavia or Rwanda,'' said
Greenstock, who has taken the lead in the Security Council on
Sierra Leone, a former British colony. ``The international criminal
court is not yet up and running. But he will pay for this in due
course. Sankoh's made his political position, his international
position, untenable for the future. He's burning his boats this
way, and we are not going to be faced down by him.''

   PUTIN-CABINET _ MOSCOW _ On the eve of Vladimir Putin's
inauguration as Russia's president, the former KGB officer whose
hawkish, secretive demeanor has characterized his election has said
that economics, not military affairs, would characterize his term
in office. On Sunday, Putin will take the reins of the world's
largest country for a four-year term at a time of rising economic
fortunes and growth barely seen since the break-up of the Soviet
Union in 1991. Analysts credit the upturn to high world oil prices,
rather than structural changes made by government before or after
Putin became prime minister last August. However, the
president-elect told the nation this week that he has the political
might and will to keep the boom going. (Coker, Cox News Service).

   ELIAN-MAIN _ ATLANTA _ Does Elian Gonzalez, as a six-year-old,
have a right to assert his desire for an asylum hearing over the
contrary wishes of his father? In what some legal scholars call a
complex dispute typically involving state court family law, the
appeals court in Atlanta will have to see how federal immigration
law applies in such a dispute. Story will explore motions by three
parties (Justice Department, Miami relatives and Elian's father) as
well as any similar cases from the past, including the 1980 dispute
involving a 12-year-old boy who wanted to stay in the United States
against the wishes of his parents, who wanted to return home to
Russia. (Rankin, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 40.

   JEFFERSON _ As relatives of Thomas Jefferson and alleged slave
mistress Sally Hemings gathered Saturday at Monticello, a newly
formed group vowed to discredit evidence that the nation's third
president fathered children by Hemings. One of the Thomas Jefferson
Truth Foundation's first orders of business will occur today, when
its members try to exclude Hemings' kin from the Jefferson family's
annual business meeting. Will get reaction from Hemings'
descendents and officials of the Thomas Jefferson Memorial
Foundation, which in January endorsed the genetic and historical
evidence of Jefferson-Hemings children. (Burritt, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution).

   VIDALIA _ Nowhere in Georgia is an industry's reliance on
illegal immigrants more obvious than in the 20 south Georgia
counties where the Vidalia onion harvest is in full swing. Two
years ago, after the INS raided a farm during harvest time,
complaints from congressmen gave illegals a temporary amnesty. That
underscores a historic trend: we tend not to enforce laws against
illegal immigrants in economic boom times when business needs
immigrant labor, but INS deports workers en masse in recessions and
depressions. In the last 2 years, with unemployment at its lowest
in 30 years, INS has all but stopped arresting illegals except at
the borders. (Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS

</P>
<P>
   VIDALIA-SIDE _ The US is loathe to arrest illegal immigrants
working in hard-to-fill jobs in booming economies. But when a
recession or depression makes jobs scarce, the government rounds up
illegal immigrants by the thousands. Nowhere was this trend more
obvious than in May 1998, when the government let illegal workers
harvest the $90 million Vidalia onion crop in SE Georgia. This
13-inch sidebar accompanies a larger story about the importance of
illegal labor to the onion crop. The sidebar traces the link
between economic conditions and enforcement of immigration law this
century. In today's roaring economy - Surprise! - arrests of
illegals are way down and workplace raids hardly ever happen.

   MUSTER _ WASHINGTON _ A group of veterans is pressing ahead with
plans to ``muster on the Mall'' in Washington on May 11 to press
Congress to fund the lifetime health care they say they were
promised when they made military service a career. They are relying
on the Internet to drum up support for the rally. In hopes of
drawing a larger crowd, the veterans want to hire country music
singer Jerry Reed to perform during the event and have started
taking pledges among themselves for the money. (Nesmith, Cox News
Service).

   CLINTON-TWILIGHT _ WASHINGTON _ He takes Air Force One around
the globe, jetting into foreign capitals to be feted as the senior
statesman of world politics and power. He draws rock-star welcomes
around his own country, where he can generate $1 million for a
fellow Democrat with a ten-minute speech at a political fundraising
event. He taunts his congressional foes _ those still left standing
_ with charges that their bid to impeach him threatened the
Constitution. Clinton is openly relishing the Indian Summer of his
political life, those final golden months before the August
political conventions usher him into the autumn of irrelevance.

   GLASS-COLUMN _ At a minute past midnight on May 1, when Time
Warner yanked ABC stations from its cable systems in seven cities,
stories about the dispute opened the TV evening news in tens of
millions of U.S. homes. If not for a timely truce, the blanket
coverage all but ensured that President Clinton would have soon
stepped into that corporate cat fight. (Andy Glass is a columnist

   BORDERS-COLUMN _ NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I started following editor
Sam Malone's way of handling snake scenarios. He told readers he
was the ``Live Snake Editor,'' and if you wanted your picture made
with a snake, it had to be brought in alive. This drastically cut
the number of photo requests. There aren't many people besides
zookeepers and the occasional member of one of those
serpent-handling churches who are willing to hold a live snake long
enough for a photographer to get the camera focused and the picture
made. (Borders, Nacogdoches Daily Sentinel) MOVED

   LOVEBUG _ Do repeated virus problems slow the march to the
Internet? What are the long-term marketing consequences for
Internet companies and others of what amounts to a cyberspace
Tylenol scare? The answers to those questions are no and not much.
The Internet has made itself as vital as the air we breathe; if the
air is dirty, we still breathe it, just as we'll still use the
Internet despite the threat of viruses. And Internet companies see
the cleanup from such viruses as just another cost of doing
business, much like shoplifting is to brick-and-mortar outfits. The
proof: the NASDAQ was up 60 points in morning trading Friday,
apparently paying no mind to the Love Bug. (Tamman and Kanell,

helping of history and within a few hours, you've got a good old
Southern stew. From Brunswick to Burgoo, a new exhibit of artifacts
and videos featuring Southern stewmaking is featured at the
University of South Carolina's McKissick Museum. (Walker, Atlanta

   TOTES _ You'll never hear Jean Silverstein or the members of her
family complain about bad weather. ``We love rainy weather,
Mommy!'' her 2-year-old daughter Ella dutifully reports. That's
because lousy weather helps pays the bills at the Silversteins.
Ella's mom is responsible for creating the rainwear that keeps
thousands of Americans and Canadians cozy and dry. (Moss, Dayton

   ARTS-HITECH _ ATLANTA _ Atlanta's arts community is wooing the
area's hi-tech industry like never before. And John Bacon, CEO of
Iterated Systems, says local tech companies need the Arts in
Atlanta to have a greater presence and support, in order to help
attract and retain tech workers. A look at how the two communities
relate and how they are working on helping each other. (Sabulis,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 75. WITH PHOTOS and LAYOUTS. MOVED

   TV-SEASON _ There have been better TV seasons than the one about
to conclude, but rarely has there been a funner one, and most of
the credit goes to ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' It was as if
once a gameshow was unloosed in primetime to became the most
successful program on TV, everything was up for grabs. (Jubera,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution). WITH ILLUSTRATION and LAYOUTS.

<P>
   TV-POST _ A review of the TV show Cupid &AMP; Cate. Sometimes, TV
critics are wrong. It doesn't happen often. OK, you can stop
laughing now. But it does occur. Case in point: when I received the
tape of the CBS movie Cupid &AMP; Cate, I thought I had the film
pegged. Before watching it, I skimmed the press notes. I thought
they told me everything I needed to know. Cate De Angelo
(Mary-Louis Parker) is a woman in a tiresome relationship with her
boring fiance (David Lansbury). Cate's life, however, gets a
much-needed jump-start after her sister introduces her to Harry
(Peter Gallagher), a funny guy who makes Cate laugh and tingle.

   CULTURE-CLASH _ Somebody was pounding at the door. The teen-age
boy got up from the couch. Outside stood four large men in black
uniforms, helmeted and armed with big, scary-looking nightsticks.
``Can I help you?'' ``Police. Open up, kid.'' ``Um, nobody here
called the police.'' ``We're special police.'' ``Say what?''
``We're the Metallica Police. Don't make us get rough with you.''

   BBC-NCAA-BATS _ That ringing metallic sound you hear in the
corner of the dugout is coming from college baseball players trying
to find out which bat in the rack is ``hot.'' The NCAA-aluminum bat
controversy in college baseball won't go away. Last year, the NCAA
set guidelines to bat manufacturers on how ``lively'' bats could
be. The rule, which went into effect this year, sparked lawsuits
from Easton and others. Now, bat makers are complaining that some
companies found a ``loophole'' and that at least one of the bats on
the market remains ``hot.'' That has power hitters searching for
the ultimate Hotbat as college baseball heads into its title
season. (Towers, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

two of the most hated rivals in the NBA. In addition to playing in
the same division, the teams have met in the playoffs the last
three years and the games have been highlighted by fights between
players (P.J. Brown and Charlie Ward, Larry Johnson and Alonzo
Mourning) and verbal wars between coaches Pat Riley and Jeff Van
Gundy. The series have always been hard-fought, with the Knicks
winning last season on Allan Houston's last-second shot in the
deciding game of the first round. The team met in the Eastern
Conference semifinals beginning Sunday in Miami and it figures to
be another classic matchup between rivals. (Bunn, Atlanta

<P>
   WESTMINSTER, Md. _ When her son was shot to death by another
child showing off his father's 9-mm pistol at playtime, Carole
Price decided to seek some rustic peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved here to get away from everything,'' said Price,
wearing a lapel-pin photo of her beaming 13-year-old son, John. He
was shot in the head two years ago in a Baltimore suburb by a
9-year-old neighbor who thought the gun was empty when he found it
resting alluringly in his father's night stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we did not realize what we were moving into out here,''
Price said. She now clearly knows, she said, as sure as her son was
one of 12 children killed daily by gunshot in the United States,
that there is no way to escape the harrowing aberrations of the gun
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Dotting the byways of the rolling green countryside here in
Carroll County, near the Pennsylvania border, Price, 37, soon began
to notice postings by gun clubs and enthusiasts for frequent
weekend shooting contests. ``Then I saw that the Republican county
committee was raffling off a 9-mm handgun for a political
fund-raiser,'' she said. ``I went through the roof.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, with two remaining children to protect, Price soon
became one of the state organizers of the Million Mom March,
scheduled for May 14 in Washington. A promised throng of hundreds
of thousands there and in 59 other cities will issue a unified
demand in the name of Mother's Day that politicians find the will
to regulate guns and their users as thoroughly as automobiles and
drivers are regulated.
</P>
<P>
   After dealing with exaggerated crowd estimates and warnings of
disruption at the recent World Bank protest in Washington,
officials there are saying that the Mother's Day march could prove
to be the real sleeper protest of the spring marching season. The
multicity crowds from all backgrounds are determined to force the
gun-control issue higher up the political agenda, led by mothers
wheeling offspring toward Capitol Hill in phalanxes of strollers.
</P>
<P>
   A counterdemonstration, the Armed Informed Mothers March, is
being promised in several cities by Second Amendment Sisters, a
pro-gun women's group newly formed in Dallas. Million Mom
organizers say they welcome the challenge as a chance to let
politicians measure where the sympathies of most women lie.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington organizers are emphasizing that Mother's Day
originated after the Civil War not as some nosegay commemorative
day but as a practical calling from the heart for mothers in the
sundered nation to take care of one another's wounded sons. Price
reflects some battlefield grit of her own.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 9-mm they raffled off was the same kind of gun my child
died from, and here were my representatives fund-raising with
one,'' she said, explaining how her organizational fury came to be
stoked by the sight of elected county officials making an American
political gala of a handgun raffle.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the organizers claimed a far larger booty than
expected, happily telling Price that it was because she organized a
protest of a half-dozen friends and relatives and attracted extra
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were coming out and calling us communists and saying,
`You made us a lot of money,''' Price said. ``One guy screamed in
my face to get out of town.''
</P>
<P>
   The flinty mother smiled tightly at this idea as the very last
thing she would ever do. ``I don't understand what they're scared
of about me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing is I've got three buses going from Carroll
County,'' she said of 150 local people signed up for the Washington
march. ``Not many men; it's the women, and a lot of them are
saying, `I hope my husband doesn't find out.'''
</P>
<P>
   Price hopes they do, for the goal of the organizers is nothing
less than to drive gun control as the decisive issue in the
presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nine months ago, the idea of the march was broached by Donna
Dees-Thomases, a New Jersey mother, in Internet chats among women
appalled by the relentless pace of child shootings. The organizers
rallied round the searing image of terrified youngsters holding
hands and running for their lives in a day-camp shooting in the
Granada Hills section of Los Angeles on Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It steals your heart and your soul when you lose your child,''
said Price, who is hoping for something far more compelling from
women voters this year than the usual ``soccer mom'' bromides.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure 10,000 alone from Maryland,'' said Price, noting that
Washington is the recommended destination for anyone within a
10-hour journey. More distant protesters are advised by the march
headquarters to join parallel protests in scores of regional
capitals across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're telling the politicians we're serious; we don't want to
bury any more of our kids,'' Price said.

 &HT;    Exhibit explores cultural side of stew
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Take 200 pounds of meat, 100 pounds of onions, several
gallons of tomatoes and a heaping helping of tradition and throw it
all in a big iron kettle over an open flame. In a few hours, a good
old-fashioned Southern stew will bubble up _ enough to feed several
hundred at a fair or family reunion.
</P>
<P>
   In Owensboro, Ky., the meat will be mutton and there will be
some lima beans and maybe some okra in the pot. It's called burgoo.
</P>
<P>
   Near the Roanoke River in Virginia, it's known as rockfish
muddle, because striped bass is used. And throughout South
Carolina, it's called hash _ a mixture of onions, potatoes, beef,
pork, chicken and, perhaps, organ meats, all ground and cooked
together and served with rice.
</P>
<P>
   The ingredients vary by location, but the tradition of slowly
simmering large batches of stew for community gatherings is a
shared one captured in a new exhibit at the University of South
Carolina's McKissick Museum in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibit really deals with the history of these stews, the
interaction of the cultures,'' said Jay Williams, McKissick's chief
curator of exhibits. ``So many people have eaten these stews and
don't even question where they came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Stew making is rooted in Colonial times. Europeans brought over
hunter stews or camp stews, which included the wild game of the
day; African slaves accustomed to black pot cooking had their
favorite stews; and Native Americans made vegetable stews. Soon
these traditions were blended and through the centuries have
evolved. Each stew has a story, and the origins of some are a
matter of hot debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like unscrambling an egg,'' Williams said. ``It's
difficult to pin down exact origins because the stews are a product
of very complex cultural interchange.''
</P>
<P>
   Brunswick County, Va., and Brunswick, Ga., have a longstanding
feud over who made the first Brunswick stew. Stewmasters from each
place frequently face off in cooking contests. (The Virginians won
the last one, yet the trophy mysteriously ended up in Georgia.) The
McKissick exhibit weighs in for the Virginians, citing early 1800s
diary entries of plantation owner Creed Haskins.
</P>
<P>
   Williams researched the exhibit with Stan Woodward, who has been
documenting the making of stews for nearly 10 years. Woodward's
videos are the central focus of the exhibit, which has three
viewing stations _ one for Brunswick stew footage (from both
Virginia and Georgia,) one for mutton-based stews (like burgoo in
Kentucky and sheep stew in Virginia), and one for Carolina
traditions of hash and Lowcountry boils. In addition, there are
photographs and artifacts, like heirloom stew paddles, cook pots
and recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said as urbanization takes over many towns and
mom-and-pop restaurants are closing, the stews aren't as available
as they once were. But they are still being made in home kitchens
and at large public events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southerners tenaciously hold onto their food ways as a part of
their identity,'' Williams said. ``It's one of the taproots of
Southern culture.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Summerlike heat and humidity will cover a large area from the
southern Plains to most of the Eastern states on Sunday. Areas east
of the Appalachians from Virginia to southern New England will be
several degrees warmer than Saturday as increasing winds from the
west are warmed as they descend from the mountains. Clouds, showers
and cool air will linger near a front in extreme eastern New
England. It will be mainly dry elsewhere in the East, although a
few thunderstorms will erupt near the Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   A weakening disturbance will produce a cluster of thundershowers
from Illinois to southern Michigan. Farther west, a front will be
the focus for clouds and showers from the northern Plains to the
northern Rockies. Meanwhile, low pressure will move inland over
Oregon, promoting variable clouds and showers in the cool air from
northern California to Idaho.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: COLD-AIR FUNNELS
</P>
<P>
   Several weak tornadoes were noted in Arkansas on Thursday,
although witnesses said no thunder could be heard. The twisters
resulted from clouds called cold-air funnels. Unlike typical
tornadoes, which rely on steamy surface air to initiate
thunderstorms that spawn twisters, cold-air funnels form despite a
lack of warm, moist air near the ground. Instead, they rely on
pools of cold air a few thousand feet aloft to promote rising,
rotating columns of air. As pressure lowers in the column,
condensation occurs just below cloud base, revealing a funnel
cloud. &QL;

 &HT;    Hoping for a rainy day
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ You'll never hear Jean Silverstein or the members
of her family complain about bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love rainy weather, Mommy!'' her 2-year-old daughter Ella
dutifully reports.
</P>
<P>
   That's because lousy weather helps pays the bills at the
Silversteins. Ella's mom is responsible for creating the rainwear
that keeps thousands of Americans and Canadians cozy and dry.
</P>
<P>
   As product development director for the Totes-Isotoner Corp.,
based in Cincinnati, Silverstein:
</P>
<P>
   _ Designs and supervises all of the company's rainwear.
</P>
<P>
   _ Oversees the graphic designs of everything from umbrella hang
tags to catalogs, Web sites and gift packaging.
</P>
<P>
   _ Supervises the new children's division, designing all the
kids' raincoats and slippers herself, and coordinating umbrellas
and cold-weather products.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein _ clad on a casual Friday in jeans, black T-shirt
and a 10-year-old jacket of her own design _ sits in her office
surrounded by bins of colorful umbrellas and rain jackets on
hangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a neat new fabric called Watersilk,'' she says,
holding up a swatch. ``We're looking at a PVC fabric for kids that
changes color in water.''
</P>
<P>
   Her schedule frequently takes her to her favorite city, New
York, where she makes major-account sales calls, works with
industry-forecasting services, shops hot new areas for inspiration
and works with vendors to develop products.
</P>
<P>
   She goes to Hong Kong once a year to tweak production specifics
and look for new techniques and materials.
</P>
<P>
   John Catt, the company's marketing director for rain products,
credits Silverstein with being the first to spot and fill consumer
needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jean has a creative vision that is truly unprecedented,'' says
Catt. ``Our apparel business didn't exist four years ago and is
becoming an increasingly large part of our business.''
</P>
<P>
   That's thanks to Silverstein, who came up with the concept for a
``first-floor rainwear'' category.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, if you wanted to buy a raincoat you'd go to
the apparel department and spend $150 on a nice piece of outerwear
and expect to get a couple of seasons wear out of it,'' Catt
explains.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein proposed taking an accessories approach to rainwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research suggests the average female customer buys a new
umbrella every seven months,'' Catt says. ``Jean wanted to take
that spontaneous approach to other rainwear, so she came up with a
line of raincoats that looked terrific but could retail for $30 or
$35 or $40. She made sure the outer shell matched the hot umbrella
covers of the season and the linings matched our umbrella prints,
and we evolved from being an umbrella department into being a
full-fledged coordinated rain shop. It's a business that didn't
exist five years ago. Jean literally created this category and has
designed by hand every coat we've done since then.''
</P>
<P>
   Men's rain fashions were added in 1999; the kids' category will
debut this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have the raincoats done well, Catt adds, but the
company is also selling more umbrellas because customers can now
assemble _ for about $60 _ coordinated ensembles of hats and coats,
umbrellas and ponchos.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein, who grew up in Cincinnati, began sewing at a young
age. When her parents insisted she go to college, she balked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the (high school) counselor the only things I loved
were fashion, travel and sewing,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   The savvy adviser came up with the perfect solution: the
University of Cincinnati's well-known fashion design program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only place I applied and it was perfect,'' says
Silverstein, 39, who today serves as a judge for the fashion
department's critique sessions and hires its graduates _ and some
of her former teachers _ as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to students is to make the most of their time in
school,'' she says. ``We're so lucky to have the design school
here. Cincinnati has a better reputation than any other fashion
design program in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   As a student, she learned the business through co-op jobs at
Neiman Marcus in Bal Harbour, Maine, and at I. Magnin in Los
Angeles. Later she designed sweaters for The Eagle's Eye and
sportswear for MAG. She began traveling to Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea
and the Philippines to perfect samples and ready lines for
production.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein's first job at Totes came in 1985 when she became an
assistant designer working on folding bags and luggage designs.
Later she designed umbrella patterns as a free lancer, and returned
to Cincinnati in 1990 when she was offered the job of director of
product development.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite projects dates to her student days at UC,
when she created a children's knitwear collection as a senior
thesis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always loved children's wear,'' says Silverstein, who
still dreams of someday creating a kids' knitwear line.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, she's getting her feet wet by designing kids'
rainwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great color outlet because you can do almost anything
and get away with it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new items are licensed products from Fisher Price for
this fall and a line of Harry Potter items that will be introduced
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstein's designs must specify every detail of each garment,
from outer shell material to zippers and buttons. She doesn't use a
drafting table, but sketches on a pad at her desk at work or
wherever she happens to be _ on airplanes, in restaurants. She's
always got a stack of European fashion magazines around to keep up
with trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the Burberry classic plaid thing is huge, so are
tech features such as elastic and mesh,'' she says, showing off a
sport utility jacket with built-in backpack straps.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Silverstein says she enjoys her job ``because it comes
naturally.''

CHIEF JUDGE HIRES LAWYER IN INQUIRY INTO ASSIGNMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
the chief federal trial judge in Washington, has hired a lawyer to
represent her before judicial and congressional inquiries into why
she assigned several criminal cases involving President Clinton's
associates to judges Clinton had appointed.
</P>
<P>
   The first act of the lawyer, Michael Madigan, in representing
Johnson was to tell a Republican-led congressional investigation
that his client would decline to testify at any congressional
committee hearing into her behavior. Madigan, an experienced
Washington lawyer, was last in the spotlight as chief counsel to
the investigation by Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., of possible
fund-raising irregularities in the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., the chairman of the
House Committee on Government Reform, Madigan said Johnson would
decline the invitation to testify before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Madigan said it would be unprecedented for a
sitting judge to be questioned by Congress about such an issue.
``We have the greatest respect for Congress but the constitutional
issues of separation of powers are just too great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue stems from complaints by Republican members of
Congress that Johnson bypassed the usual computer-operated system
that randomly assigns cases to trial judges under her for a handful
of cases. Those cases involved Webster L. Hubbell, an Arkansas
friend of the Clintons and former senior Justice Department
official and Charlie Yah Lin Trie, a fund-raiser for the president.
Johnson assigned those and some other criminal cases involving
associates of Clinton to four judges Clinton named to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the governing body of the local federal judicial
circuit named a panel of five judges to look into the charges. The
panel, in turn, recently hired Joe D. Whitley, an Atlanta lawyer
and former official in the Justice Department under Republican
presidents, to conduct its investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his letter to Burton, Madigan gave some indication of what
his approach would be in defending Johnson before the special
judicial panel. He said that the practice of going off the random
assignment system and handpicking judges in ``certain kinds of
cases'' had been in effect for many years. He cited a policy
adopted in 1971 by then-Chief Justice Warren Burger allowing for
complex cases to be assigned outside the random system. That method
was used, he noted, in cases involving the Watergate and
Iran-contra scandals.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Wayne Smith, a loading-dock worker who has been on
strike since October, was unmistakably glum as he picked through
the union's food bank for tomato sauce, pasta and breakfast cereal
to feed his five young daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his family's hard times, Smith, a large, barrel-chested
man, vowed to hold out as long as it takes in the grueling strike
that has become James P. Hoffa's biggest labor battle in his first
year as Teamsters president.
</P>
<P>
   So far the six-month war looks like a draw, a very painful draw,
that has many Teamsters struggling to pay their bills, while the
union's adversary, Overnite Transportation Co., has had its bottom
line hammered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of tough getting by, but the company, they're still
not treating people right,'' Smith said as he and his wife, Tamyko,
stuffed 20 pounds of free groceries into a large box at Teamsters
Local 728. ``The food bank helps a lot, but it's hard when you have
five kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Overnite fight has become not only one of the most closely
watched labor showdowns in the country, but also a brawl between a
union renowned for its toughness and a scrappy company that is
showing just as much grit. Neither Hoffa nor Overnite's parent
company, Union Pacific, has offered the slightest hint of blinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually Union Pacific is going to get the message that they
have to come to terms with the workers at Overnite,'' Hoffa said.
</P>
<P>
   To raise the stakes, Hoffa said the union was planning a federal
racketeering lawsuit that would charge Overnite with breaking the
law hundreds of times, by, for example, firing many union
supporters, as part of a strategy to do anything to avoid a union
contract. The company denies using illegal tactics.
</P>
<P>
   That would follow a racketeering lawsuit that Overnite has
brought against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters,
accusing its members of firing shots at drivers who have crossed
the picket line. In the most serious incident, an Overnite trucker
was shot in the stomach while driving outside Memphis, Tenn.
Teamsters officials deny advocating violence and say Overnite is
exaggerating the incidents to win sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Goodwin, a senior vice president at Overnite, said: ``It's
true no one has proven yet that they are responsible for the
shootings, but we never had any shootings before. For them to deny
the violence is ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has much at stake. He wants to show that the Teamsters can
increase membership in its core freight division. That division was
his father's base, and his father, James R. Hoffa, boasted that his
crowning achievement while running the union was securing a
nationwide freight agreement that greatly improved drivers' wages
and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of the Teamsters say that the younger Hoffa, with
an eye to next year's re-election campaign, hopes to be able to
boast by then that he has signed a contract with Overnite and
unionized most of its 166 terminals. With 8,200 drivers and dock
workers, Overnite is the nation's largest nonunion company that
specializes in carrying less than full truckloads.
</P>
<P>
   The broader labor movement sees major stakes in the Overnite
dispute. Many labor leaders say it is the most flagrant example of
how unions, after surmounting numerous obstacles to get workers to
vote in a union, then have a hard time getting companies to sign a
first contract.
</P>
<P>
   At several Overnite terminals the drivers and dock workers voted
to unionize over five years ago, but they still do not have a
contract. The union says it represents 3,600 workers at 37
terminals, but the company says that because of legal challenges
the union represents only 1,800 at 22 sites. The company estimates
that 700 workers are on strike, while the union puts the number at
1,700.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For one of those strikers, Eddie Dunn, at Overnite for 24 years,
the stakes are highly personal and boil down to regaining dignity
at work.
</P>
<P>
   While walking the picket line in front of Overnite's large
terminal in Atlanta, Dunn talked about how managers there sought
five years ago to force the most senior workers to take early
retirement or to work part time without benefits. He also
complained that no matter how hard he worked unloading trucks, a
manager always questioned why he could not work faster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated you like you weren't a human being,'' he said.
``They want to intimidate you. They always want you to do more and
more and more. Sometimes after the way they treat you, you feel
like crying. They want to rile you, and if you say something,
you're fired, you're gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of the 200 workers at the terminal here are on
strike, walking the picket line since October. Some clergy have
walked with them and other unions have donated $50,000 to help with
their food bills and mortgage payments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's out
here, and they thought once the first snowfall came, we would
fold,'' Dunn said. ``We're serious here. We're fighting for a
better future. If we don't win, our kids will face a future with
jobs paying $5 or $6 an hour, subcontracting, no benefits, no
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the picket line, some 30 strikers poured out tales about how
they felt mistreated by Overnite. One truck driver said he felt
insulted when a manager called his doctor to ask whether a note
saying he was sick was forged. Another driver said that after going
for 10 years without a critical write-up, he got a notice putting
him at the brink of dismissal, just days after he signed a petition
favoring a union.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Williams, a driver for 27 years, said: ``The main reason
we're striking now, it's not for benefits or money. It's about
Overnite not being fair to the workers.'' Overnite drivers earn
nearly $18 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, a wiry man wearing an Atlanta Falcons shirt, said
something was profoundly amiss when a majority of the 200 workers
at the Atlanta terminal voted to unionize in 1995, and Overnite has
still not signed a contract with the union.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said: ``The fact is they're not negotiating in good faith.
We have had 163 negotiating sessions with little or no progress.
That tells you the story of whether or not they really want a
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   But Overnite officials insisted that they were bargaining in
good faith and blamed the union for often postponing negotiating
sessions. Goodwin held out little hope for a settlement, saying the
company would never accept the union's demand to place Overnite
workers in the Teamsters pension fund. He said Overnite's pension
fund was in excellent shape, while the Teamsters pension fund was
underfinanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've worked diligently at trying to reach an agreement with
them,'' Goodwin said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa sees a more fundamental reason behind the failure to reach
a settlement: a visceral anti-union animus. He said the dispute had
cost the company far more than a settlement would have. Overnite
has spent tens of millions of dollars fighting the walkout. Its
financial performance over the last half-year has been considerably
worse than that of its major competitors, and many analysts say the
dispute has hurt Union Pacific's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodwin asserted that Overnite's revenues were growing and
that it returned to the black in the first quarter. He said that
the cost of a union contract would make the company less
competitive and would far outweigh whatever costs the company had
suffered because of the walkout.

 &HT;    Looking for roadside attractions on life's journey
 &HT;    By Laura Dempsey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Tom Robbins is curious about us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only judge areas of interest by the mail that I get, and
I get a lot from Ohio,'' he said. ``So I thought I'd better check
it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been here before, sort of, having been pulled from a
military transport plane on its way from Washington, D.C., to
Omaha, where Robbins _ then in the midst of a three-year Air Force
stint _ was stationed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the night in the stockade at Wright-Patterson Air
Force Base,'' he said. ``We stopped for refueling or whatever in
Dayton and they found out I was technically AWOL, so they escorted
me to the local brig hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in the late '50s, before Robbins, now 63, ``found his
voice'' while writing a review of a Doors concert, way before the
1971 publication of his first novel, ``Another Roadside
Attraction,'' but well into a life defined by its search for
nonexistent answers to all the very big questions.
</P>
<P>
   His newest book, ``Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates''
(Bantam, $27.50), takes on, in his words, ``the contradictory
nature of reality, the interplay of opposites that is the engine
that runs our universe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about having your cake and eating it too, which always
seemed to me to be an arrangement that is only fair. It's about the
possibility in today's world of combining a life of freewheeling
sensuality and high adventure with serenity and deep wisdom and
full consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, of course, it's personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born a romantic, and I've been a romantic all my life,''
he said. ``For the past 30-plus years I've been on a winding and
twisting spiritual path, and the two don't always interface very
smoothly. The whole essence of romanticism is the notion of an
elsewhere _ the romantic is always dreaming of other places and
other times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole essence of the mission of the spiritual disciple is
to be here now, to live in the the present and be fully present.
There's a real dichotomy.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins has said he considers ``Another Roadside Attraction''
the quintessential book of the 1960s. A plot summary _ Jesus' mummy
is stolen from the Vatican and displayed at a roadside zoo _ is
misleading and somewhat pointless; Robbins' books never lend
themselves to a nutshell treatment. Its reception by critics
confounded the author.
</P>
<P>
   ``I raised what I thought was a compelling issue _ what if it
were to be learned indisputably that Jesus Christ was not divine?
What would that say about the future of Western civilization? What
impact would that have on ethics and moral behavior?
</P>
<P>
   ``To my dismay, not one reviewer ever discussed that. I haven't
read a review voluntarily since, though I've had a few shoved in my
face.''
</P>
<P>
   A list of titles (''Even Cowgirls Get the Blues,'' ``Half Asleep
in Frog Pajamas,'' ``Jitterbug Perfume,'' ``Skinny Legs and All,''
``Still Life with Woodpecker'') would understandably give the
impression of weirdness within; a reading of first lines would
cement that notion. And Robbins, while offbeat, is a dead serious
writer, disciplined and meticulous in his work and work habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am in pursuit of what I have sometimes called the perfect
sentence,'' he said. ``There's not a word in one of my books that
hasn't been gone over 40 times ... I almost read the ink right off
the page.''
</P>
<P>
   He still writes in longhand, with a goal of two pages a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say I only write on draft, it's a little misleading. I
write very slowly, and try never to leave each sentence until it's
as perfect as I can make it. There's no need for a lot of
revision.''
</P>
<P>
   His stories are often called wacky, zany, whimsical, and they
are, but that's one narrow way of looking at Tom Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   ``My plots are very tight,'' he said. ``They're full of cross
references _ as I'm writing I'm juggling many balls simultaneously
in order to keep them all in the air. I have to keep a lot of
things in mind. It's exhausting.''
</P>
<P>
   He's reluctant to describe his writing process any further,
comparing it to ``those cooking shows on Japanese television where
they give the celebrity chef one or two mystery ingredients, then
ring the bell and he has 16 minutes to concoct a world-class meal.
If he fails, he commits culinary hari-kari, I guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I start with two or three themes that are completely
unconnected at the time, introduce a character _ frequently a
female _ and very gently shove this character into a scene that may
or may not be overtly connected to one of the themes. Then I follow
their process. It's literally a trip, and the trick is in order to
achieve any kind of artistry with this method or working, it
requires an enormous concentration, a real intense focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a working method I would recommend to other
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been 5 1/2 years since his last release _ about right for
Robbins, who won't even begin a new book until his work promoting
``Fierce Invalids'' is behind him. He takes a year off between
novels and makes up for lost play time: On a two-day trip to New
York, he said he slept ``about two hours,'' and has a well-earned
reputation as a party boy, especially during the days of LSD and
Timothy Leary, both good acquaintances of his.
</P>
<P>
   Even his work, he says, is really like play: ``But it's hard
play.... Play is not necessarily frivolous. It's not a synonym for
the trivial.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins takes great care, and has fun with the language _
``Fierce Invalids Home From Hot Climates'' opens with this
sentence: ``The naked parrot looked like a human fetus spliced onto
a kosher chicken,'' and his descriptions can be breathtakingly
beautiful. But like he said, play can be very hard work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a certain amount of playfulness in my work, in my
world view, and when you read that on the page some people jump to
the conclusion that I just sit down and rattle these things off at
the top of my head for an hour or two, go out and carouse and come
back a few days later,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. He writes every day: ``To sit around and wait for
inspiration is for amateurs,'' he said, ``and at the end of a
writing day I feel like I've been scraped off the track at the
Indianapolis oval.''

SPORTS COLUMN: `WEL-COME TO BOB SHEPP-ARD DAY' 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the New York Yankees' pinstriped voice, Bob
Sheppard usually arrives at the Stadium at least two hours before
game time. In his public-address announcer's cubicle on the
mezzanine level, he goes over the lineups, the proper pronunciation
of the names of any new players and whatever special announcements
he has to make.
</P>
<P>
   But not Sunday. Because Sunday is Bob Sheppard Day at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   About half an hour before Sunday's game, the now retired
professor of speech at St. John's University, tall and erect at an
age he won't discuss, will be honored at a home-plate ceremony in
his 50th year of elegant elocution at the big ballpark in the
Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted,'' he was saying now, ``but I don't know why.
All I have is longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   And all the Yankees have is history. Anybody who has ever been
to Yankee Stadium knows that it's more than longevity. It's how he
intoned, ``Joe Di-Magg-i-o'' and ``Mick-ey Man-tle.'' It's what
prompted Reggie Jackson, upon joining the Yankees in 1977, to go
out of his way to meet him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got class,'' Mr. October said.
</P>
<P>
   That class is in the timbre of a voice that his, wife, Mary, has
described as ``caressing,'' especially in his precise
pronunciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take great pride,'' he said, ``in how the names are to be
pronounced.'' Of the thousands of players' names he has pronounced,
he remembered three of his favorites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shig-e-tosh-i Ha-se-ga-wa,'' he said, slowly and surely.
``Jo-se Val-di-viel-so. Sal-o-me Bar-o-jas. They're so euphonic.''
</P>
<P>
   Some names concerned him, notably that of Wayne Terwilliger, an
infielder who came through the Stadium with the old Washington
Senators and the Kansas City Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worried that I would say, `Ter-wigg-ler,''' Sheppard said,
``but I never did.''
</P>
<P>
   His style has provoked mimics. Whenever Reggie Jackson is at the
Stadium, he visits the public-address booth and, in his best
imitation, greets the announcer with, ``Good eve-ning, Mis-ter
Shepp-ard, wel-come to Yank-ee Sta-dium.'' Joe Garagiola also
echoed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Derek Jeter is doing it now,'' Sheppard said.
</P>
<P>
   In other sports, especially pro basketball, some public-address
announcers sound as if they're emceeing a wrestling show, shouting
loudly and dragging out a name as if it were a drum roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to be clear, concise and correct,'' Sheppard said.
``I don't change my pattern. I speak at Yankee Stadium the same way
I do in a classroom, a saloon, or reading the Gospel at Mass at St.
Christopher's.''
</P>
<P>
   When he announces the lineups now, he sounds the same as he did
that April day in 1951 when he worked his first Yankee game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny Mize was the first baseman,'' he remembered, ``Jerry
Coleman was at second, Phil Rizzuto at shortstop, Billy Johnson at
third, Jackie Jensen in left field, Joe DiMaggio in center field,
Mickey Mantle in right field, Yogi Berra catching, Vic Raschi
pitching. We beat the Red Sox, and I got through it without any
gliches.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has had an occasional glitch.
</P>
<P>
   After working a Yankee game one afternoon, Sheppard hurried over
to Giants Stadium (he's done New York Giants games since 1956) and
said, ``Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Yankee
Stadium.'' At halftime of an Army-Navy game in Philadelphia during
John F. Kennedy's administration, he informed the crowd that the
president was about to go from the Army side to the Navy side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was cold,'' he recalled, ``but the president was only
wearing a business suit. I told one of my spotters, `He doesn't
even have a topcoat on.' I didn't realize my microphone was on.
Everybody in the stadium heard it.''
</P>
<P>
   His microphone should always be on. At St. John's coming
commencement, he will receive an honorary degree as a doctor of
pedagogy. In his translation, that means master teacher, as any
Yankee fan will attest.
</P>
<P>
   Once a St. John's quarterback, he was playing semipro football
on Long Island, N.Y., when he offered to be the PA announcer for a
pro football exhibition game at Freeport Stadium. That led to his
announcing the pro football Brooklyn Dodgers' games, then those of
the pro football Yankees in the old All-America Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later on, I did the New York Titans at the Polo Grounds,'' he
said of that early American Football League franchise known for its
lack of cash flow. ``I never got paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in his 50th season on the Yankees' payroll, he has never
missed a game because of illness. ``Weddings, births, family
parties,'' he said, ``I've missed a few games for those reasons.''
And he'll miss Sunday's game. After the ceremony, his longtime
backup, Jim Hall, will be the PA announcer.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Shepp-ard has the rest of the af-ter-noon off.

 &HT;    Open up, it's the MP3 MPs
 &HT;    By Ron Rollins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Somebody was pounding at the door. The teen-age
boy got up from the couch. Outside stood four large men in black
uniforms, helmeted and armed with big, scary-looking nightsticks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I help you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Police. Open up, kid.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um, nobody here called the police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're special police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Say what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the Metallica Police. Don't make us get rough with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy stood aside as the four men stormed into the living
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's your computer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstairs. Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been named in court documents as having unlawfully
downloaded Metallica music off Napster,'' the first cop said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without paying for it,'' the second cop said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Metallica's angry,'' the third cop said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're here to collect,'' said the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Collect how?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You downloaded 10 songs. You owe Metallica $1.50 per song.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't have that much money on me, and my parents aren't
home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you should've thought about that when you were illegally
ripping off your favorite heavy-metal artists, then, shouldn't you?
You didn't think about poor Metallica when you were stealing them
blind at your keyboard, did you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought your nasty little MP3 player was above this fine
nation's copyright laws, didn't you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You thought you'd never have to suffer for taking food out of
Metallica's mouth, did you?''
</P>
<P>
   The Metallica Police all sneered. The kid dug into his wallet
and came up with $6. ``That's all I have right now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, then. We'll take your computer.'' Three of the Metallica
Police fanned off through the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take my computer?!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, and back at the station we'll check your nasty little
hard drive to see which other poor musicians you've been filching
from. You thoughtless little swine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, but, but _ I'm a big Metallica fan! I have all their
albums!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, indeed you do, don't you?'' said one of the Metallica
Police, emerging from the boy's room. ``This copy of ``Load ``looks
like it came from a secondhand store.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah. So what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think the artist sees a penny from that sale, you
wretch? We'll have to confiscate this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, but, but....''
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing _ he also has this tape from a live radio
broadcast in the early '90s. It's clearly unauthorized.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good work. Bring it along.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of the Metallica Police emerged with an armful of books,
posters and CDs. ``Do you have receipts for any of this?'' he
demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course not,'' the boy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can reclaim it at the station when you produce them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey! All I did was download a few songs! Metallica's got
plenty of money! That's not fair! It's just music!''
</P>
<P>
   The Metallica police all laughed. ``You pathetic little moron.
It isn't music. It's business. By the way, did you buy that concert
shirt in the arena at an officially authorized Metallicawear
outlet?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I bought it in the parking lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hand it over.''
</P>
<P>
   As the cackling Metallica Police left the house, four more
uniformed men appeared on the front step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who are you guys?'' the boy asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dr. Dre Police. Is your little brother home?''

OUTDOORS: SHAD FRENZY IN EDDIES OF THE DELAWARE RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN C. SAUTNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Each year, along a particular stretch of the lower Delaware
River, the same swirling eddy no bigger than a table top yields my
first shad of the season. Like clockwork, after a good April
rainstorm raises the river, schools arrive from tidewater on the
first leg of their spawning run.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they have stopped feeding, the shad still seem full
of aggression, ready to pounce on the red-and-white darts that I
cast. Considering that perhaps two months earlier these very fish
may have been fattening up in the Bay of Fundy hundreds of miles to
the northeast makes such an encounter appear that much more
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   But it happened again a few weeks ago, when I met Jim Leedom in
the early-morning darkness below Lambertville, N.J. Ten years
earlier, he and I fished here side by side as strangers. We took
turns drifting darts through the eddy and netted each other's fish.
Since then we have become good friends, and, like the shad, return
to the same spot each spring.
</P>
<P>
   On perhaps my 20th cast, just when I began to think the season
might not have started yet, my rod suddenly lurched down river as a
shad grabbed the dart and took off. After a few more short runs and
a single clean jump, Jim scooped up the fish and handed it off for
me to admire. It was a small male _ maybe 2{ pounds, glistening
purple and silver against the dark backdrop of the Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Two more came from the eddy that day, including a fat roe that I
had every intention of keeping. The shad, however, had other plans.
It took line slowly at first, then accelerated, and finally hurled
itself from the river. My dart landed a good 10 feet away. Jim and
I agreed that if there was ever a good way to lose a big shad, we
had just seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the bulk of the run will move through the lower
river, and the anglers will follow. In early May, most fishers will
probably wind up near the Delaware Water Gap, where the river
gouged a deep path through ancient bedrock eons ago. Just above the
Gap, along the New Jersey side of the river, the channel runs close
to the bank, making it a fine spot for shorecasters. On a Saturday
morning during the height of the run, particularly if it's rainy or
overcast (perfect conditions for good shad fishing), perhaps two
dozen anglers may line the river here.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, at a pool called Wallpack Bend, Jim will launch
his cartop boat and we will drop anchor at the foot of a steep hill
lined with hemlocks. Then, we will set out our darts on flatlines
and listen for the warblers that by now are flitting through much
of the forest canopy.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago from this very spot, Jim took a 5-pound walleye
that must have mistaken his flutter spoon for a small shiner. We
still talk about it when the fishing is slow. Other times, heavy
shad have kept us busy all day, grabbing our lures and nearly
pulling our rods out of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of May, if water levels remain normal, anglers begin
looking for shad in the upper Delaware, even as far north as the
East Branch. This is fly-fishing water, and those willing to strip
a fly at breakneck speeds through the right pool can hook dozens in
an evening.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, most of the fish are spotted first. Place a fly
among the right group, and they will chase it down in groups of two
or three. The winning fish overtakes the fly, sometimes only a foot
or two off the rod tip, gulping it into its maw and turning away in
an underwater flash of silver. After dark, schools can be heard
chasing each other, boiling on the surface of the river, as the
males compete for females.
</P>
<P>
   Then, suddenly, it's over. By early summer, the shad have
finished spawning. Most have died from the act; the few that have
not drop back to the ocean. Come August, I will have as much chance
of catching a shad in the river as I would a lobster. Like a
perfect mayfly hatch, the run lasts long enough to hook a few, but
never so long that it ever becomes easy.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why shad are among my favorite fish.

AT REHEARING, IRAQI DOCTOR WINS ROUND IN DEPORTATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Neb., Calif.)  By TIM WEINER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An Iraqi doctor who worked with the CIA against
Saddam Hussein, only to be jailed for nearly four years on the
basis of secret CIA evidence, may soon be free, his lawyer said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ali Yasin Mohammed Karim was evacuated from Iraq to the
United States in 1996 after the collapse of a CIA plot against
Saddam, the Iraqi leader. He was summarily jailed in California on
the basis of reports compiled by the intelligence agency and
presented by the FBI to an immigration judge.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge, D.D. Sitgraves, ruled last week that lawyers for
the jailed Iraqi now have presented ``more than sufficient
evidence'' to rebut the government's claim that he should be
deported as a threat to national security.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, who was rehearing the case, essentially reversed her
original 1998 decision, a 92-page ruling based almost entirely on
secret government evidence. That ruling was withheld from Karim's
lawyers on national-security grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The use of secret evidence, once exceedingly rare, has become
increasingly common in cases involving government claims of
national security. In November, a federal district judge in New
York freed an Egyptian man jailed for 3{ years on the basis of
secret evidence.
</P>
<P>
   But in October, in a case involving a Palestinian immigrant
jailed for nearly four years, a federal district judge in New
Jersey ruled, for the first time in the United States, that it was
unconstitutional to detain an immigrant on the basis of secret
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The immigration judge in the Palestinian's case called some of
the government's secret evidence ``double or triple hearsay.''
Karim's lawyers say much the same in his case.
</P>
<P>
   Karim, a 37-year-old radiologist who worked with CIA-backed
Iraqi opposition groups, remains in jail, pending the judge's final
decision, said one of his lawyers, Neils Frenzen.
</P>
<P>
   His wife divorced him after he was imprisoned and he does not
know where his children are, or if he will see them again, Frenzen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has lost the things most dear to him _ his freedom, his
liberty, his family, his sons,'' Frenzen said.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge's ruling, handed down on Monday, means that Karim
may be granted political asylum this month, Frenzen said.
</P>
<P>
   The secret evidence against Karim was withheld from his lawyers,
until a former CIA director, R. James Woolsey, entered the case for
the defense in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Woolsey held security clearances sufficient to review the
evidence, most of which the government finally declassified. Much
of it was a series of suppositions by CIA officers, based in part
on hearsay, that Karim might have connections with Iranian
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Upon reviewing the evidence, Woolsey called it ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren J. Marik, a retired CIA case officer who was assigned to
Iraq and worked with Karim, testified last month that ``there was
nothing to bring any suspicion'' on him.
</P>
<P>
   Karim, an Iraqi Kurd, worked with the Iraqi National Congress,
which played a central role in a $20-million-a-year set of CIA
operations that sought to undermine Saddam. The clandestine plots
began shortly after the 1991 Persian Gulf War and went on for five
years, without success.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, the plots finally collapsed when the Iraqi
military seized towns in northern Iraq that had served as bases for
the plots. Karim and his family were among 600 men, women and
children who fled for their lives, along with a small group of CIA
officers who had worked with them. They were flown to Guam, and
then to California, where Karim was detained and jailed.
</P>
<P>
   The government's ``primary evidence was a CIA conclusion,''
Frenzen said. ``The FBI was told by one or more CIA employees in
Guam that Karim's cousin was an Iranian intelligence agent.''
</P>
<P>
   One FBI agent, John Peterson, testified that he could not say
whether the assertion, if true, had any significance for Karim.
``It may have nothing to do with him, it may have a great deal to
do with him,'' he testified.
</P>
<P>
   After the government agreed to declassify its evidence, it
offered to resettle Karim and five other Iraqis jailed as potential
national-security risks in a third country, not the United States
or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting a resolution, the five have chosen to live with
their families in Lincoln, Neb., rather than spend years in prison
fighting the case. Karim chose to fight the government's case to
clear his name.

FOR POLITICIANS, BEING FUNNY IS A SERIOUS BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN FILES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Mark Katz, presidential comedy writer, was pacing
in the wings of the Washington Hilton like a nervous father-to-be
while President Clinton delivered his lines at the White House
correspondents' dinner last Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was the high point of Washington's silly season, a kind of
political sweeps, and Bill Clinton was lampooning himself as the
quintessential Lonely Guy in the twilight of his presidency. His
performance at the dinner won accolades as his funniest ever.
Clinton showed home movies of himself running after his wife with a
lunch bag, watching his laundry dry and bicycling through the Old
Executive Office Building; the video has been replaying in the
capital's offices all week.
</P>
<P>
   Being funny at the annual dinners of the Alfalfa Club, the
Gridiron Club, and the associations of White House and broadcast
correspondents has become serious business in Washington, and Katz
is a regular writer on the circuit. ``A good joke will last a
week,'' said Katz, who also helped write Vice President Al Gore's
speech for this year's Gridiron dinner. ``And a bad joke will
appear in their obituary.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules are strict. No sexually explicit humor. The radio talk
show host Don Imus shocked Washington with his raunchy jokes about
the president at the radio-television correspondents' dinner in
1996. Stay away from ethnic jokes. Former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato
learned that lesson the hard way when he tastelessly imitated an
Asian accent in a radio talk show about Judge Lance Ito of
California. Nothing too mean. The Gridiron Club's motto applies
broadly to most Washington humor: singe but do not burn.
</P>
<P>
   Because the dinner speakers are mostly powerful politicians with
large egos, leading Washington humorists agree that the key to
success is self-deprecation. ``Self-deprecation allows you to get
away with more,'' says Landon Parvin, who often writes jokes for
prominent Republicans, including former Secretary of State James
Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take aim at yourself and then pick your spots after that,''
Katz agrees. ``You must earn the right to make fun of others by
making fun of yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House correspondents' dinner, Clinton made sure to
singe himself first and brought down the house when he said: ``A
year from now, I'll have to watch someone else give this speech.
And I will feel an onset of that rare affliction, unique to former
presidents: AGDD _ Attention-Getting Deficit Disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Self-deprecation was also the centerpiece of Gore's several
successful monologues at Gridiron dinners in 1994, 1997 and in
March. At the 1994 dinner, Gore made fun of his reputation for
stiffness by being wheeled into the dais on a handcart. This year,
he told the assembled journalists that ``there are some things I
won't do to become president. I won't hold a press conference.'' He
also drew roars by asking plaintively: ``This isn't a fund-raiser,
is it?''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not miss a chance to lampoon his presumed Republican
rival for the presidency, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who he said
``thinks fettuccine Alfredo is the Italian prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Writing Washington humor can be tricky, not only because the
jokes must be topical but also because ``You never know exactly
what might go over the line,'' says Parvin. The 51-year-old scribe,
who dreams up jokes at his home in Fredericksburg, Va., has mostly
written for Republicans but also helped write some lines for Robert
S. Strauss, the prominent lawyer and former Democratic National
Committee chairman, at this year's Gridiron dinner. Much of his
time is spent writing serious speeches for politicians and
corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I write for people I like,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Parvin helped President Ronald Reagan use humor as a shield
against his age, his glamorous background and even his relaxed work
habits. But his big break came at the Gridiron dinner in 1982. He
wrote the lyrics for a song, ``Secondhand Clothes,'' sung by Nancy
Reagan, which parodied her taste for designer clothes.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Katz, 36, formed the Soundbite Institute, a humor-writing
consulting business, seven years ago in his apartment on
Manhattan's Upper West Side, after losing his job at an advertising
agency. He is the institute's ``resident scholar.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Katz wrote a speech for Madeleine Albright, who was
then the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, that sparked
laughter from President Clinton. He has since written for Clinton,
Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Katz says he likes to test ``the line'' in his humor writing.
``I try to figure out where the line is, walk directly up to it and
say hi,'' he said. ``The challenge is writing right on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   One problem, both Katz and Parvin say, is that being funny has
become a test for politicians. ``These are big pressure events,''
Parvin says.
</P>
<P>
   Humor has become another proving ground, especially for anyone
who wants to be president. Besides handling stand-up at the annual
Washington dinners of powerful media barons, politicians and
lobbyists, politicians are expected to appear on the late-night
Leno and Letterman shows as well as on ``Saturday Night Live.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has improved his timing and delivery in recent years but
can still be a bit rigid. Bush has yet to make a major Washington
appearance as a humorist (he did a short speech at the Alfalfa Club
in 1998), but his remarks did draw a few laughs at a recent
Republican fund-raising dinner. His appearance on the Letterman
show in March, however, drew chilly reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents rarely bomb. ``A president gets laughs easier,''
Parvin says.
</P>

<P>
   In his last year in office, Clinton seems to have mastered humor
and is having a great time using jokes to get in some last digs. At
the radio and television correspondents' dinner, he won over the
crowd with a gibe at ABC News' handling of Leonardo DiCaprio's
interview with the president for the network's Earth Day special.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you news people ever learn?'' the president asked. ``It
isn't the mistake that kills you, it's the cover-up.'' (Credit for
this line apparently belongs to the White House deputy press
secretary, Richard L. Siewert, not Katz.)
</P>
<P>
   The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, says it is Clinton, not
his writers, who has become funnier. ``The president's delivery and
ability to understand the timing of a joke is 95 percent of this,''
he said.

 &HT;    ``Cate &AMP; Cupid'' goes beyond fun and romance
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH Fla. _ Sometimes, TV critics are wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't happen often. OK, you can stop laughing now. But it
does occur. Case in point: when I received the tape of the CBS
movie ``Cupid &AMP; Cate,'' I thought I had the film pegged. Before
watching it, I skimmed the press notes. I thought they told me
everything I needed to know. Cate De Angelo (Mary-Louis Parker) is
a woman in a tiresome relationship with her boring fiance (David
Lansbury). Cate's life, however, gets a much-needed jump-start
after her sister introduces her to Harry (Peter Gallagher), a funny
guy who makes Cate laugh and tingle.
</P>
<P>
   These storyline dots will be mighty easy to connect, I thought.
My assumption was ``Cate &AMP; Cupid'' would be a mostly fun,
lighthearted romantic romp. A sugary two hours with all the depth
of a kiddie pool.
</P>
<P>
   As I mentioned before, I was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I get paid to actually watch the movies I write
about. Sure, ``Cate &AMP; Cupid'' is fun and romantic in spots. After
all, Cate and Harry do fall in love. They have coffee together. Go
to Alfred Hitchcock film festivals and eat Chinese food on Cate's
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is about much more than just Cate's and Harry's
love affair, which develops too quickly. It's about fractured
family relationships, old wounds that still hurt and finding one's
place in life. Issues all families can relate to on various levels.
Ironically, I found Cate and Harry's relationship the least
interesting component of the movie. Maybe that's because Gallagher,
and his bush-thick eyebrows, has always given me the creeps. He
should only play serial killer or stalker roles. His jarring looks
are better suited for those parts.
</P>
<P>
   Much more fascinating was Cate's rocky relationship with her
widowed dad (a scene-chewing Philip Bosco). Cate sells vintage
clothes for a living. But her dad playfully calls her a ``rag
seller.'' When he sees Cate for the first time in a long while, he
barks she looks pale and thin, and is in need of a good meal. The
comments, of course, sting. Verbal abuse is often more damaging
than physical abuse. Cate shows the hurt by simply lowering her
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   According to her father, Cate pales in comparison to her three
sisters. Francesca (Bebe Neuwirth) is a successful doctor. Cynthia
(Joanna Going) is a top fashion model. Annette (Rebecca Luker) is
the perfect mom with a banker hubby.
</P>
<P>
   But Cate does something her sisters don't _ she stands up to her
intimidating father. That's why there's a lot of stilted
conversation and awkward silence during the film's many dinner
scenes. Those scenes are also the movie's most powerful. Parker is
brilliant as the strong-on-the-outside, but fragile-on-the-inside
Cate. Bosco is also utterly convincing as the overbearing dad.
</P>
<P>
   And Gallagher?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he should get his eyebrows plucked.

ON HOCKEY: GAUGING THE RISE AND FALL OF THE RED WINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The decline of the Detroit Red Wings was verified Friday night
when they were eliminated again from the Stanley Cup playoffs by
the Colorado Avalanche, this time in five games, in a 4-2 finale.
After consecutive championships in 1997 and 1998, the Wings have
twice exited in the second round of the four-round tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche, which also bounced the Wings last spring, will
meet either Dallas or San Jose in the Western Conference finals.
With Ray Bourque healing on defense, Peter Forsberg robust at
forward and Patrick Roy both quick and cocky in goal, the Avalanche
might make the finals for the first time since it won the cup in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shame for the Wings, despite several tacky displays
of frustration on Friday. They are still a good regular-season club
but no longer of the top echelon in the postseason. Captain Steve
Yzerman, with no goals in the tournament, is near that career stage
where age _ he turns 35 on Tuesday _ and injuries begin to blend,
much as they did for Wayne Gretzky in his New York era.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, no matter how many Chris Chelioses and Steve
Duchesnes they collect, the Red Wings cannot fill the void left by
the tragic loss of Vladimir Konstantinov, paralyzed in a limo crash
while celebrating the first title. And what about behind the bench,
where Coach Scotty Bowman still seeks his record-breaking ninth
ring?
</P>
<P>
   In his experienced way, Bowman has let it be known through
others that it would be interesting for the Rangers to consider him
for the general manager's and coach's vacancies. Bowman held the
two jobs, in various combinations, in Buffalo, in the 1980s,
without great success. Even at age 66, he still has something to
prove. This is not to say the Rangers would offer Bowman all this
power or that he would accept it, or that the Wings would make it
easy to leave.
</P>
<P>
   It is just an intriguing thought, better than the possibilities
planted in the rumors involving Glen Sather and Colin Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   In the other Western bracket, Dallas took a 3-1 lead over San
Jose with a ragged 5-4 victory on Friday. The San Jose team is a
sports rarity: a scrappy underdog difficult to like. Maybe it's the
belligerence of Owen Nolan, the menace of Bryan Marchment or the
constant tripping, spearing, slashing and shoving of a dozen other
Sharks. Marchment left with an injury Friday and Nolan played in
evident discomfort. So the Sharks should fall out in Game 5 Sunday,
just as they should have fallen to the Blues in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche will probably hope that San Jose can extend the
Stars for another game or two, wearing down the Dallas veterans,
maybe injuring one or two of them, while Colorado rests. Rarely
elegant or charismatic _ despite stylists like Mike Modano, Brett
Hull and Sergei Zubov _ the Stars, like Detroit in 1998, know what
it takes to repeat. But, can they do it?
</P>
<P>
   In the East, the Devils had reason to fret before Game 5 with
the Maple Leafs in Toronto on Saturday night. New Jersey was the
best team for most of the previous four games and got only a 2-2
split to show for it. If Toronto's Mats Sundin, Steve Thomas and
Jonas Hoglund can find the form they showed in the first-round
elimination of Ottawa, the injury-depleted Leafs might be back in
the conference finals for the second successive season.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins must meet the winner of the wacky
Philadelphia-Pittsburgh series, which resumes Sunday, tied at two
victories each, on the ABC network at noon. The Flyers' 2-1 victory
in five overtimes Thursday night should give them momentum. But no
home team has won yet in this matchup. In this year's round of
eight, these two teams bring the best narrative and cast of
characters.
</P>
<P>
   If it isn't Roger Neilson's cancer recovery and Eric Lindros'
concussion problems, it is the emergence of the undrafted rookie
Andy Delmore and the bullish determination of John LeClair and the
brilliance of Jaromir Jagr and the re-emergence of Herb Brooks.
This series in particular reminds even hockey knockers of why the
Stanley Cup playoffs usually make for the best tournament of the
sports year. These playoffs will be half complete this week, and
they are starting to get really good.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of good: Critics who constantly whine about poor hockey
telecasts (see name at top of column) should be fair enough to
notice when games are presented with flair and a knowing touch.
Such was the case in the Detroit-Colorado series on ESPN. The
camera work was an impressive blend of aggressiveness and
restraint, the whole product as good as anything Hockey Night in
Canada or MSG ever present.
</P>
<P>
   For those of the cult who make playoff viewing a nightly
obsession, telecasts like these are a joy to behold.

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS-HEAT BATTLE LINES DRAWN, BUT FIRST, A GROUP
HUG 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Welcome to another installment of the National
Basketball Association's premier rivalry, our main playoff event.
New York vs. Miami, brunchtime basketball served with your bagels,
rated PG (for Please, Guys, we need the ratings).
</P>
<P>
   Herewith, our historical primer on the Knicks-Heat series, now
into its fourth hit season, based on interviews over the previous
week with players and coaches from both teams, edited by NBA
Entertainment and narrated by Ahmad Rashad.
</P>
<P>
   YEAR I, 1996-97
</P>
<P>
   Seldom did any opposing coach in the history of professional
team sports ever receive the unadulterated love that Madison Square
Garden showered Pat Riley with before a second-round series between
his former team, the Knicks, and his new Eastern Conference power,
the Miami Heat.
</P>
<P>
   During the thunderous pregame ovation, Riley blew kisses to the
Garden faithful and thanked them again for attending the fan
appreciation gala he threw at his Connecticut estate upon his
amicable departure from the Knicks two years before.
</P>
<P>
   ``May the best man win,'' Riley said, smiling, while meeting the
handshake of his former boss, the Garden president, Dave Checketts,
who proceeded to pull Riley from the back of the neck and say,
``Come on over, Riles, and let's have a hug.''
</P>
<P>
   In Game 5 of a stirring series that was already being hailed by
critics for its high level of aesthetic, sportsmanlike play, a
strange incident occurred late in Game 5 with the Knicks leading,
3-1. Lined up for a free throw, Knicks point guard Charlie Ward had
an untimely fainting spell and staggered into the knees of Miami
forward P.J. Brown. Brown wrapped his arms around Ward, flipped him
over as he would a baby and laid him gently behind the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody, help!'' Brown cried as Ward lay still.
</P>
<P>
   Closest to the scene, several Knicks responded to Brown's
frantic plea, forgetting that they were in violation of the
league's rule against leaving the bench during a game. Although
Riley pleaded with the league to consider the extenuating
circumstances, Commissioner David Stern insisted the rules must be
abided by. Several Knicks were suspended, and the Heat rallied to
win the series in seven.
</P>
<P>
   YEAR II, 1997-98
</P>
<P>
   In a shooting slump for much of the season, John Starks caught
fire in the second half of Game 2 in Miami, as the Knicks evened
the first-round series, heading back to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, Starks and his teammate Chris Childs were
both the unfortunate victims of media fiction. Childs, in fact, was
scratching a rash on his neck, not making the slash gesture, as it
appeared to several misguided newsmen. Meanwhile, Starks, a
longtime road arena favorite, was so excited by his clutch
shooting, he wanted to remain on the floor and sign autographs for
the South Florida fans. Holding up a pencil that would later be
mistaken for his middle finger, Starks began advancing toward the
admiring fans, but Larry Johnson grabbed him around the neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``John, we have a plane to catch and interview obligations to
meet,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, fellas,'' Starks said. ``Rain check.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, Heat guard Eric Murdock caught Childs' rash,
and couldn't stop himself from scratching after making a big basket
in Miami's Game 3 victory. Game 4 was a Knicks-Heat classic, except
for another bizarre development in the final seconds of a
series-tying Knicks victory.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to cleanly establish inside position on Alonzo
Mourning along the baseline near the Knicks bench, Johnson lost his
balance and accidentally pushed Mourning into Jeff Van Gundy. The
diminutive Knicks coach was knocked horizontal and tried to keep
himself from falling by grabbing Mourning's leg. It took several
players and both team doctors to detach Van Gundy from Mourning,
who had such cramps in his legs from Van Gundy's grip that he
couldn't play in the Knicks' series clincher two days later.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lucky one for us, and one for you,'' Riley told his
protege, Van Gundy, after fighting through crowds of reporters and
fans to shake the winning coach's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am disgraced with myself for injuring your player,'' Van
Gundy said. ``I owe you. Big Macs on me, after the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   YEAR III, 1998-99
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had made a key addition to their roster for another
first-round battle with Miami, Latrell Sprewell, the fearless guard
well known for heroically pulling several dangerous ticks from the
neck of his former coach, P.J. Carlesimo, at Golden State.
</P>
<P>
   After more critically acclaimed displays of offensive skill, the
Knicks won the decisive Game 5 in Miami again, on Allan Houston's
runner just before time expired. Charlie Ward called it a divine
act of preordainment, and Riley said he couldn't possibly argue
with him. Riley invited both teams to his home for a barbecue and
swim party, and they all sat around reminiscing about the happy
times they had shared _ Riley with Van Gundy, Mourning with Johnson
and Patrick Ewing, Hardaway with Sprewell, Brown with Childs, and
so on and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   Then Riley stood up, raised his glass and said, ``A toast to the
winners!''
</P>
<P>
   ``To good sportsmen,'' Van Gundy said, ``and to getting together
again next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year is now. Come on over, everyone, and let's have a hug. &QL;

PENNSYLVANIA ABORTION POLITICS; WEST VIRGINIA'S GOP CHALLENGE; A
VIRGINIA PLEDGE; OHIO'S MOTTO; A FLORIDA PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., W.Va., Ohio., Fla., Va.)   By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Speculation has been especially intense since Gov. George W.
Bush of Texas raised the possibility that he may choose Gov. Tom
Ridge of Pennsylvania as a running mate. Not only does Ridge hail
from an important battleground state with 23 electoral votes, but
he also happens to be a close friend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whenever Ridge's name comes up, the point is almost
always made that unlike Bush, Ridge favors abortion rights, hardly
something that will endear him to the powerful Republican right. No
matter, Bush has said time and again, his friend merits
consideration as a top prospect.
</P>
<P>
   Ridge's critics think otherwise, and they seem bent on driving
their point home.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when Ridge surely would prefer to be viewed as a
governor who has cut taxes, improved schools, reformed welfare and
cleaned up the environment, the Pro-Life Caucus in the Pennsylvania
Legislature is pushing hard to strip $4.3 million for family
planning from the state budget, arguing that the money is
``contributing to the abortion process.'' Ridge wants to keep the
money in and, if the past is prologue, he will fight.
</P>
<P>
   When the issue came up in 1995, he managed to outmaneuver the
caucus, even though a majority of the Legislature is anti-abortion.
And in 1996, he worked a compromise, retaining state money for use
for family planning in general but agreeing that none would be used
for abortions or abortion counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Pro-Life Caucus, state Rep. Jerry Birmelin, a
Republican from Pike County in the northeast corner of the state,
says that while the governor may prefer that the funds issue not be
on the legislative agenda at this point in the presidential
campaign, the timing had nothing to do with him. ``Not my goal,''
Birmelin said the other day. ``It's not centered on him or anything
he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   WEST VIRGINIA: ASSESSING THE UNLIKELY
</P>
<P>
   There may be members of the U.S. Senate more entrenched than
Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va. But surely not many. Byrd, an exceptionally
adroit procurer of political bacon, has won seven six-year terms,
most by 2-to-1 or better, and the expectation is that he will win
an eighth term this fall by at least that much.
</P>
<P>
   So this is what David Tyson, the chairman of the West Virginia
Republican Party, had to say last week when asked whether the
party's primary on Tuesday might produce a viable Byrd challenger:
</P>
<P>
   ``Running against Byrd is like running against an icon. Sen.
Byrd is an institution, and there's no denying that he could be
impossible to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   That, to use an old George Wallace political aphorism, was
putting the hay down where the goat could get it.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two primary contenders, Garry Adkins, an accountant,
took umbrage. He accused Tyson of ``assisting a Democrat'' and
demanded that the party remove him.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's reply:
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not endorse Democrats. I support the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   No action, thus far, by the party and no complaint, thus far,
from the other primary contender, David Gallaher, a businessman.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA: INCUMBENT'S MONEY-BACK OFFER
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in Virginia's 5th Congressional District were not
especially surprised this year when Rep. Virgil H. Goode, a
lifelong member of their party, announced he would seek re-election
this fall as an independent and caucus with Republicans should he
win. His votes on Capitol Hill had been trending Republican for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   How hard will it be to win re-election as an independent?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not all that difficult. Both Democrats and Republicans
in the district, in the south-central part of the state, tend to be
strongly conservative, and in earlier elections Goode not only got
the Democratic vote but also a lot of the Republican vote. What is
more, the district, like Goode, has been trending Republican for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   So with no strong Democratic challenger in the offing _ and no
Republican even running _ he seems well positioned to win again.
But just to be safe, he tried last week to soften what Democratic
opposition there is.
</P>
<P>
   Any Democrat who gave him campaign money before he became an
independent, he said, could mail in a request for a refund _ he has
almost $400,000 in his war chest _ and it would be considered.
</P>
<P>
   As of the weekend, only one request had come in, for $50, and
the check was in the mail, with a note of thanks for past support.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO: TRUSTING IN GOD
</P>
<P>
   For 41 years, Ohio's official state motto was ``With God, all
things are possible.'' Then, two weeks ago, a three-judge federal
appeals panel ruled that the motto violated the religious freedom
clause of the Constitution because it was drawn from a statement by
Jesus in Matthew 19:26.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general plans an appeal, all the way to the
U.S. Supreme Court if necessary, a step endorsed last week by the
Ohio Senate. But two senators, Ben E. Espy of Columbus and Leigh E.
Herington of Revenna, both Democrats, are urging their colleagues
and the attorney general to reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   They say they have a better, far less costly and time-consuming
idea: Adopt the phrase now found on U.S. money, ``In God We
Trust.''

   That one, they contend, is already the official U.S. motto and

   FLORIDA: A PRAYER OF THANKS
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of religion and politics, here is the take of the Rev.
Donald L. Roberts of Sarasota, Fla., as expressed in his prayer
that opened the session of the Florida Senate on Thursday:
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be great to be God, to get what you want, when you
want it, how you want it. We mere mortals are not that lucky. We
are always having to compromise to get what we want. We call the
process politics. Thank you, Lord. The session is almost over, the
budget deal is cut, education got some more money, we cut a few
taxes and, in the end, most everyone in this chamber didn't get
everything they wanted. And that is good news. That's politics,
Lord, and unless you want to move over and give up the job of being
God, which some of think is our birthright, we will have to muddle
along being satisfied with being the politicians you can create.
It's the fun part of being human. In the name of the God of all
things, even politics and politicians and, in rare instances, a
lobbyist or two, amen.''

 &HT;    Complex issues surrounding Elian's fate
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When an Atlanta appeals court granted an injunction
last month in the case of Elian Gonzalez, its ruling jolted many
scholars familiar with immigration and family law.
</P>
<P>
   In its April 19 decision, the court seemed to suggest that
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials should have asked
6-year-old Elian about his political asylum claim and whether he
wishes to live in Cuba, or in the United States against the wishes
of his father.
</P>
<P>
   The issue will be addressed again Thursday when the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals considers the contentious immigration
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of three judges also must decide who speaks for Elian:
his great-uncle Lazoro Gonzalez, the Miami relative who had
temporary custody and continues to fight for Elian's political
asylum claim; or the boy's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has
been allowed to intervene in the case and now has custody of Elian
at the Wye Plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   If Elian's case was to be decided solely on state court family
law, it would be a no-brainer, family law experts said. This is
because most state courts give little, if any, weight to
life-altering requests made by minors, particularly if the child
has a surviving biological parent who has been found legally fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the issue of asylum seems to me an enormously
complicated question that I don't believe a 6-year-old has any
business deciding,'' said Paul Kurtz, a University of Georgia
professor on family law.
</P>
<P>
   The courts typically pay little attention to what a child has to
say, Kurtz added. ``That derives from common sense. Six-year-olds
don't know very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathaniel Gozansky, a family law professor at Emory University,
said that once Immigration and Naturalization Service officials
determined Juan Miguel Gonzalez was a fit parent, there should have
been little left to argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There shouldn't even be a dialogue now as to whether the child
would be better off growing up in the United States or Cuba,'' he
said. ``His father should have the right to return with his son to
his native land, the politics of that country notwithstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   But complicating the issue is that Elian's case is not
influenced solely by family law. It must also be decided in the
context of complex immigration statutes that require specific
procedures to be taken and findings to be made when federal
authorities consider political asylum claims.
</P>
<P>
   The INS has failed miserably in this regard, Kendall Coffey, the
lead lawyer for Elian's Miami relatives, said in briefs filed
before the court. Coffey is asking the court to appoint a guardian
with loyalties ``only to Elian.''
</P>
<P>
   And Coffey, the former U.S. Attorney in Miami, contended that
Elian's fear of persecution if he returns to Cuba is well-founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The harm that would befall Elian if he is returned to Cuba is
clear: no freedom of expression, thought or speech,'' Coffey said.
``Elian will be forced into a program of desensitization and
reindoctrination, and to renounce his own mother and stepfather in
order to swear allegiance to the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, lawyers for Juan Miguel Gonzalez also minced few
words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel thinks that a 6-year-old boy found adrift in the
Atlantic Ocean and now caught up in the American legal system
craves the familiarity of his own bedroom in Cardenas,'' Gregory
Craig, the father's lawyer, told the court. ``Juan Miguel intends
to raise his child as he sees fit and where he sees fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig asserted that Elian's Miami relatives pressured the boy to
file his asylum claim and use the U.S. legal system in an attempt
to ``destroy'' Juan Miguel's family.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lazoro Gonzalez) now threatens to rob Elian of a childhood at
his home with his father, his family and his friends,'' added
Craig, who served as President Clinton's special counsel during the
impeachment trial. ``Nothing in law or humanity should compel such
a result.''
</P>
<P>
   The case of Walter Polovchak appears to be one of the few that
provides precedent to the three judges who will hear the case _
J.L. Edmondson of Atlanta, Joel Dubina of Montgomery and Charles
Wilson of Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Polovchak's parents, Michael and Anna, left Russia with
their three children and immigrated to the United States. They
settled in Chicago but after several months, they decided to return
to the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   But 12-year-old Walter protested, preferring to stay in the
United States against his parents' wishes. He left home and went to
live with a cousin, who also lived in Chicago. Within days, the INS
granted Walter political asylum, separating him from his parents
and ruling he could stay in the United States if he wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Michael Polovchak, a 42-year-old factory janitor,
strongly protested. ``Am I a drunkard?'' he asked members of the
news media. ``I am not. Do I starve my children? I do not. Have I
broken laws? I have not. So who is the government to take my
child?''
</P>
<P>
   A protracted litigation ensued, with Walter's parents trying to
regain custody and reunited the family in the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   They won one ruling when a federal court judge decided that
Walter should be returned to their custody. But in July 1985 the
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals overruled that decision. The
ruling came just a few months before Walter was about to turn 18
and become eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship, which he
eventually did.
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the Chicago appeals court touched on the issue
of whether Walter, at age 12, was old enough to decide whether to
seek political asylum. ``Walter was presumably near the lower end
of an age range in which a minor may be mature enough to assert
certain individual rights that equal or override those of his
parents,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The ability of a minor to decide which political system he wants
to live under increases with age, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter, who still lives in the United States, was pleased with
the court's ruling. He said at the time he missed his parents and
wanted to see them. But returning to the Soviet Union would
probably land him in jail. ``Freedom is something you can't buy for
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his brief on behalf of Elian's Miami relatives, Coffey
addressed the precedent set by the Polovchak case.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the 7th Circuit expressed skepticism that a
12-year-old boy was mature enough to seek asylum, Elian is an
``extremely bright child whose mental age is near the age of Walter
Polovchak when he filed his asylum application,'' Coffey wrote.
</P>
<P>
   He also contended that the INS did not follow proper procedure
when it failed to interview Elian, an omission the three 11th
Circuit judges criticized in their April 19 order.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing its stay keeping Elian in the country until the
appeals process is exhausted, the court seized on the language of
the 1980 immigration law that says ``any alien ... irrespective of
such alien's status, may apply for asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Even at age 6, Elian fits the description of ``any alien,'' the
court said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges did, however, note that the idea of a 6-year-old
filing for asylum, contrary to the wishes of his parents, ``may
seem a strange or even foolish policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Courts do not make immigration policy; Congress does, the judges
said. And if Congress intended school-age children to be able to
file personally for asylum, ``this court and the INS are bound to
honor the policy-decision.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Martin, a former INS general counsel and now a
University of Virginia law professor, said that was not Congress'
intent. And he predicted the 11th Circuit will not take the plain
language of the law that far.

SPORTS COLUMN: HOW KNICKS BEAT HEAT IN LANDING SPREWELL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In mid-January 1999, Coach Pat Riley and Randy Pfund,
the Miami Heat general manager, were holed up at the Ritz-Carlton
hotel in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta. Working the phones
furiously, they had one goal in mind:
</P>
<P>
   They wanted to meet with Latrell Sprewell. ``Bob, what's going
on?'' Riley asked Robert Gist, Sprewell's agent, after many
conversations the weekend of Jan. 16-17. ``Is he coming or not?
Let's try to work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get a hold of him,'' Gist told Riley from his Atlanta
office. ``Just give me a little more time. I want you to talk to
him. We'll set something up.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley and Pfund were seriously considering a blockbuster trade.
They believed Sprewell was on his way from Milwaukee to meet with
them. He had yet to be dealt from the Golden State Warriors and was
still regarded as America's most demonized athlete, the player who
choked his coach and got away with it.
</P>
<P>
   He was not the consummate teammate, the counterculture hero who
will lead the Knicks into the second-round playoff series against
the Heat Sunday in Game 1 at American Airlines Arena, the player
who changed the balance of power in the Eastern Conference the day
the Knicks acquired him.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, the pendulum swung toward New York that weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the Knicks management boarded a Cablevision jet
on Sunday, Jan. 17, and swooped into Milwaukee: Madison Square
Garden's president, Dave Checketts; coach Jeff Van Gundy; Ernie
Grunfeld, then the general manager; and Ed Tapscott, then the
assistant general manager. They impressed upon Sprewell that
Madison Square Garden was the place for him.
</P>
<P>
   A flummoxed Riley found out about the Knicks-Sprewell meeting
after the fact. He called Sprewell the next day to gauge his
interest, but realized New York's pitch had influenced his
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps in retrospect, if Pat had got to Latrell's home and
met with him, things would have been different,'' Gist said this
past Friday. ``I wanted to put them together. Pat had me so pumped
up after talking to him, I wanted to play for him. I thought
Latrell should hear what he had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley would not comment on circumstances that happened 16 months
ago, other than acknowledging that he had spoken to Sprewell and
Gist. ``There were a lot of teams interested in Latrell at that
point,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   But according to an Eastern Conference team official who spoke
on condition of anonymity, Riley was prepared to fly to Milwaukee
to meet with Sprewell. After hearing from Gist that the Knicks were
already there, Riley's interest waned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of liken it to the guy who has a big crush on the prom
queen, but he doesn't act on it,'' Gist said. ``So, finally, you
get the nerve to go to her home and ol' Billy Bob is already there.
I would have gotten on a plane and made my own presentation, made
her forget about the other guy. But once Pat heard they were there,
he figured it was too late.''
</P>
<P>
   The events of Jan. 16-17, 1999, have produced more far-reaching
conspiracy theories than genuine facts, with several team officials
accusing Commissioner David Stern of steering Sprewell toward the
Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Stern was trying to quickly free the Warriors of a
growing burden: heading into training camp with Sprewell on the
roster. The league argued that any team could have asked for and
received permission to visit Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, more than a year later, the events leading up to the deal
make for intrigue and gossip.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell cannot remember all the details, other than recalling
that he was talking to the Knicks at the same time Gist was
speaking to Riley about scheduling a meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to Riles one time on the phone and I think it was
after the Knicks were at my house,'' Sprewell said recently.
``Yeah, a day or two after.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Riles just wanted to see if I had any interest in
coming down there. We really just talked about working and what it
would take to be a Riley player. Because, as you know, he works
guys pretty hard. I think I would have been fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was surprised Miami did not pull the trigger first,
he said: ``I was very surprised. I thought if anyone wanted to do
it, it would have been Riles. I thought he would have been the one
to make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Conference team official said Riley tried, offering
the Heat starters P.J. Brown and Dan Majerle at the last possible
moment. A Warriors team official contends that Miami never offered
anything better than a package including Duane Causwell and Voshon
Lenard.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, many in the Heat camp believe that Grunfeld's
friendly relationship with Golden State's general manager, Garry
St. Jean, contributed to the Heat's being left out of the Sprewell
loop. The Knicks were offering Chris Childs, Chris Mills and Terry
Cummings. At the last moment, they included John Starks in the
three-for-one deal instead of Childs.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld met St. Jean during the 1977-78 season while playing
for the Bucks. St. Jean was a Milwaukee scout. St. Jean has known
Riley for more than 20 years, too. But as Riley's stature, power
and bank account grew over the years, the distance between himself
and his colleagues widened considerably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew whatever he told me, I could believe,'' Grunfeld said
of St. Jean regarding the Sprewell talks. ``We weren't going to
play the little games that are usually played in this league.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had another advantage. Grunfeld's in-laws lived in
Sprewell's suburban Milwaukee neighborhood, and he had often driven
by Sprewell's house. The Knicks' party never asked for directions
and Sprewell had not even known they were coming that afternoon.
Before Riley or anyone could react, they were in the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``After we left,'' Grunfeld said of Riley's pursuit, ``I knew
from his agent that he stiffed them. He didn't show up, that's what
I heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley was not the only person who felt bamboozled. ``I was
mad,'' Gist said. ``I didn't know the Knicks were there until
Latrell called me after Checketts had left. I told him: `Pat Riley
is on the phone and you have already met with these guys? Come on,
Latrell.' He said he wanted to play for New York. I said: `I don't
want to tell Pat that. You have to talk to him.'''
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, Sprewell said, ``I really think New York initially
was just doing it to keep him from getting me there. I think once
they thought it was getting really serious, they got serious about
preventing him from getting me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gist laughed when asked if he thought that chaotic January
weekend dramatically shaped the future of both franchises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot, I would've given Pat his address,'' he said. ``All he
had to do was ask. The Knicks didn't even put Latrell on notice.
They were there in a heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh well. The girl enjoyed the prom and they both lived happily
thereafter.''

CHARLES BOXER, 96, A LEGEND IN LOVE AND WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Va., Mich., Mo., Conn.)   By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles R. Boxer, who was Britain's chief spy in Hong Kong in
the tumultuous years leading up to World War II; a prominent
historian of colonial empires although he never earned a college
degree; and a lead player in one of the most flamboyantly public
love stories of the 1940s, died April 27 in a nursing home near his
country residence northwest of London. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   His achievements ranged from writing 330 books and articles
about the origins and growth of the Dutch and Portuguese empires to
holding professorial chairs at five universities on both sides of
the Atlantic to collecting a celebrated library of rare books.
</P>
<P>
   Always, he came at things his own way: As a boy, he taught
himself Portuguese and Dutch in order to satisfy his curiosity
about how Japan, his initial and principal fascination, was first
affected by Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Boxer's breathtakingly public romance with Emily
Hahn, the author of 52 books and a longtime contributor to The New
Yorker magazine, that accounts for most of the yellowing clips in
newspaper morgues. He was married to Ursula Norah Anstice Tulloch,
a woman commonly called the most beautiful in Hong Kong, when he
met and had an affair with Hahn, The New Yorker's China
correspondent, who herself was involved with one of China's leading
intellectuals, Sinmay Zau.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn made the new romance _ not to mention her avid opium
addiction _ a topic of discussion in her 1944 best seller, ``China
to Me.'' She told how she fell for Boxer immediately, even though
she was on friendly terms with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote that he suggested having a child and offered to be
legally responsible for the baby. A few weeks before the Japanese
bombed Pearl Harbor and World War II began, a daughter named Carola
was born to the couple. After the Japanese took over Hong Kong, a
British colony, Hahn convinced Japanese authorities she was
Eurasian and stayed on to carry food parcels to starving prisoners
of war. Fearing for her daughter's safety, though, she fled in
1943.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1945, unconfirmed reports carried in American
newspapers said the Japanese had executed Boxer. Hahn told
reporters she refused to believe the rumor. In truth, another
British officer was executed, and Boxer was sentenced to a long
term of hard labor as a result of being implicated in a secret
radio-listening operation.
</P>
<P>
   Upon his release at war's end, Boxer, by then divorced, told
United Press that he intended to marry Hahn as soon as possible.
``I'm going to make an honest woman of Mickey,'' he said, using her
nickname. ``It's high time, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Each step of his journey home was reported in the newspapers,
from a flight delay in San Francisco, to Carola's excitement at
spotting her father, to the couple's marriage by a justice of the
peace in New Haven, Conn., after a judge granted a waiver of the
standard five-day waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   Hahn died in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Carola Vecchio of Jackson Heights, Queens, Boxer
is survived by another daughter, Amanda Boxer of London, two
granddaughters and two great grandsons.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ralph Boxer was born on the Isle of Wight into a long
line of admirals and generals, as well as affluent stockmen, who
raised sheep in Tasmania and Australia. After being rejected by the
navy because of poor eyesight, he joined the army in 1923 and rose
to the rank of major by the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   From 1930 to 1933 he served as a language officer in Japan and
became fluent in Japanese, Dutch, French, German and Portuguese. In
1936, he joined the British intelligence service and was assigned
to Hong Kong. A 1993 article in the Canadian Journal of History
cited his perspicacity in estimating the strong military threat
posed by Japan at a time when many British analysts downplayed its
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He was severely wounded in December 1941 and after a long
convalescence was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp for the war's
duration.
</P>
<P>
   His rare book collection, which centered on the Dutch and
Portuguese empires, was sufficiently celebrated in East Asia to be
seized by the Japanese for the Imperial Library in Tokyo. He was
able to recover most of it after the war. That library became the
nucleus of a much larger collection that he sold to the Lilly
Library of Indiana University in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, just as Boxer was realizing that he had little chance
of advancement in the military, he was offered the position of
Camoens Professor of Portuguese Studies at King's College, London.
While he had no academic degree, his expertise was well known.
Except for two years he spent at the London School of Oriental and
African Studies in the early 1950s, he held the chair for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 until 1979, he taught at Indiana University, the
University of Virginia, the University of Michigan and the
University of Missouri at St. Louis. He also taught at Yale for
three years beginning in 1969, serving as professor of the history
of the expansion of Europe overseas.
</P>
<P>
   His best known works included, ``The Christian Century in
Japan,'' published in 1951; ``South China in the Sixteenth
Century,'' 1953; ``The Dutch in Brazil,'' 1957, and ``Race
Relations in the Portuguese Empire,'' 1963. The race relations
book, as well as some of his lectures, challenged the conventional
wisdom that there was little racial prejudice in the Portuguese
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring, Boxer continued writing and lecturing on Dutch
and Portuguese colonial and naval history. He also pursued his
interest in ceramics, coins and shipwreck relics, while continuing
to add to his collection of rare books and manuscripts, which
include the collection now at Indiana University.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer favored natty attire and was given to a salty wit and firm
opinions. Despite his imprisonment, he harbored no resentment
toward the Japanese, whom he continued to admire. According to The
Times of London, his personal philosophy was one of stoicism. The
Times said he tried to believe that ``nothing matters much; most
things don't matter at all.''
</P>
<P>
   He had an extraordinary memory for bawdy limericks and
barracks-room ballads and a taste for poetry ranging from Pope to
Kipling. Both, the Times said, ``were best displayed when, in
congenial company, the glasses were raised shoulder-high.''

 &HT;    Migrant workers transform rural communities
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIDALIA, Ohio _ The first migrant workers who arrive in
southeast Georgia each spring go shopping.
</P>
<P>
   They are Mexican crew chiefs getting ready for the 5,000 workers
who will harvest the $70 million crop of Vidalia onions. They buy
pots, pans, blankets, sheets and household cleaners like Clorox and
Pinesol.
</P>
<P>
   Then come the rest of the workers, mostly young Hispanic men who
leave behind families in their homelands to come pick onions in
flat, hot fields. They transform the rural communities of southeast
Georgia during the harvest months of April, May and June.
</P>
<P>
   Drive through Toombs County and you'll see Hispanic men shooting
baskets at a plywood goal at the Santa Claus Motor Inn. Turn the
radio dial past the sounds of salvation and steel guitars and
you'll hear mariachi music and the rhythms of spoken Spanish.
Stroll into the Piggly Wiggly in Lyons and notice the shelves full
of corn tortillas, sweet bread and guava nectar.
</P>
<P>
   In 20 counties, Hispanic migrants are as visible as they are
essential to the onion crop. The government said in 1998 that 70
percent were illegal immigrants, but few people in onion country
want the Immigration and Naturalization Service nosing around with
too many questions. Local law enforcement officers are also
deferential about the migrants. Chief James Reid of the Lyons
Police Department said his 14 officers _ one speaks Spanish _
sometimes arrest illegal immigrants for disorderly conduct, public
drunkenness and fighting. But he does not alert the INS because he
knows the role migrant workers play in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an essential element to our farmers,'' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   For many migrants, Georgia is just one stop on a nationwide
circuit. After the onion harvest, they spend July and August in
tobacco and pepper fields in North Carolina. They move in the fall
to Ohio and Indiana to pick cucumbers and tomatoes. They return to
Georgia to plant the onions in November and December before going
to Florida for three months to pick oranges and grapefruit.
</P>
<P>
   Angel Coimenares, a slender 26-year-old illegal immigrant, is a
new arrival on the circuit. He has come to the United States with
his brother and a friend to earn wages that can be 10 times higher
than those in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, he sends $300 of his $400 paycheck to Mexico to
support his wife, 6-year-old son and infant daughter. His brother
and friend do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the old, white mobile home they share near Lyons, piles
of orange cord cover the living room floor. When they're not
picking onions, they use the cord to bale pine straw for farmers
who also rely on Hispanic migrant workers _ legal and illegal.
Elsewhere in the trailer, dirty clothes are strewn about. Taped to
walls of wood-grain paneling are two glossy magazine photographs of
scantily clad women.
</P>
<P>
   There are other pictures. Angel Coimenares keeps snapshots of
his wife and son in frames on the edge of his bed. Brother Pedro,
32, keeps his pictures in an album. Down the hall, friend Lorenzo
Rodriguez, 25, has four photos of his mother, wife and son in
gold-colored frames.
</P>
<P>
   Also in Georgia to help his family is Eliud Islas, 36, who left
his wife and three children in Veracruz, Mexico, after a storm
destroyed his house last autumn. He was one of dozens of migrants
working recently on a 60-acre field bounded by tall trees and a
country road near a crossroads called Johnson Corner.
</P>
<P>
   The snip-snip sound of a hundred clippers drifted through the
field. Men and women grabbed three or four onions at once and cut
brown roots from the bottom and green stems from the top. They
dropped the onions into into 6-gallon buckets. When the bucket
filled up, the workers poured them into bags.
</P>
<P>
   Two buckets fill a bag. The workers earn 70 cents a bag.
</P>
<P>
   Workers like Maribel Mendez, an 18-year-old illegal immigrant
from southern Mexico, can make $80 on a good day clipping and
bagging onions. Others lift and heave bag after bag _ 40 pounds
each _ onto slowly moving trucks. They can bring home more than
$100 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Even though illegal immigrants sustain the onion business and
enrich merchants every time they buy a ham-and-cheese sandwich,
trash bags or bed sheets, their presence causes tension. In the
tiny town of Santa Claus, Hal Leverty has a front-row seat for the
culture clash that plays out each spring. He lives across from the
Santa Claus Motor Inn, where migrants live in hotel rooms and seven
mobile homes behind it.
</P>
<P>
   He complained about music from the trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't nothing an American would listen to,'' he said. ``On
weekends you can't hardly live here.''
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a mobile home with gray siding. ``Last fall I
counted 14 that came out of that trailer right there to go to work
one morning.'' While some locals gripe, migrants like Islas keep
working in the dirt and onions near Johnson Corner. The workers
have come to a field in a 1987 school bus with 22 green seats and
small sticker up front of the Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron saint
of Mexico. After the sun sets, they board the bus to go home to
aging mobile homes or hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The luckiest will go to a development onion grower R.T. Stanley
built for some of his workers. It has concrete picnic tables, a
soccer field with white goals and orange nets and a lake next to a
dozen duplexes of grey cinderblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a model in this community,'' said Elmira R. Reynolds,
regional manager of the nonprofit Telamon Corp., which provides job
training and emergency food and transportation help to migrants.
</P>
<P>
   She sees that development as a sign of changing attitudes. Not
long ago, some farmers housed migrants in converted chicken coops.
Now more of them view migrants as an essential ingredient to a
healthy economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the community has come to accept them,'' she said.

 &HT;    Illegal immigrants low priority in strong economy
 &HT;    By Mark Bixler
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIDALIA , Ga. _ Rarely in Georgia has an industry's reliance on
illegal labor been so plainly revealed as it was here in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of that year's $70 million Vidalia onion harvest,
Immigration and Naturalization Service agents raided an onion field
and arrested 21 illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Fear of more raids sent hundreds of migrant workers packing.
Farmers worried the crop would rot. Their hasty complaints to
Georgia congressmen led to a deal: The INS would let illegals pick
onions if growers promised to hire legal workers in the future.
</P>
<P>
   As this year's harvest of the sweet onions heads toward its
peak, labor is plentiful. Although the INS arrested 27 illegal
immigrants near Vidalia last year, the 1998 deal has been a clear
sign that attitudes toward illegal immigration _ and the
government's enthusiasm for enforcing immigration laws _ depend
very much on economics.
</P>
<P>
   When the economy is strong, the government usually makes it a
low priority to enforce illegal-immigration laws, but weaker
economies lead to crackdowns, said George Borjas, professor of
public policy at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   The white-hot economy of the last decade has shaved unemployment
rates to their lowest levels in a generation. The number of illegal
immigrants the INS has arrested nationally in the last two years,
not counting criminals, fell from 22,000 to 8,600. That has been
good news to industries kept humming by their labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way we can get the job done is with Mexicans. They'll
start before the sun comes up and stay until after the sun goes
down,'' said R.T. Stanley, a prominent onion grower and chairman of
the Vidalia Onion Business Council, a group of 129 growers. Even
though the unemployment rate in the Vidalia onion region is 6
percent _ higher than the 3.4 percent state rate and the 4.1
percent national rate _ locals ``will not do this work'' because it
is low-paying and strenuous, Stanley said.
</P>
<P>
   Most migrants make about $200-$300 a week in counties where
locals working other jobs average about $475.
</P>
<P>
   About 5 percent of year-round population in Montgomery, Tattnall
and Toombs counties, where the bulk of Vidalia onions are grown, is
Hispanic, but their numbers soar with the harvest.
</P>
<P>
   The industry leans so heavily on migrants, including illegal
immigrants, that farmers complained to Congress after the INS
arrested 21 illegal immigrants in 1998. Several Georgia
legislators, including Sen. Paul Coverdell and Rep. Jack Kingston,
both Republicans, signed a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno
saying the INS used ``bullying tactics'' and had shown ``a lack of
regard for farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Their intervention led the INS to suspend raids after farmers
pledged to hire legal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell and Kingston are unlikely supporters of illegal
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Kingston said in 1993 that ``hard-working, tax-paying American
citizens are footing the bills for illegal aliens while their own
families are doing without.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Immigration Lawyers Association, which generally
advocates for immigrants, said Kingston did not side with the
association in seven major votes on immigration legislation from
1992-98. Coverdell has voted with the association on five of 12
chances, said Matt Tallmer, association spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Robyn Ridgley, a spokeswoman for Kingsley, said Kingsley acted
in 1998 after ``jack-booted agents'' harassed migrant workers who
were in the country legally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never condoned illegal aliens, but there is a big
difference between an illegal alien and a migrant worker who is a
legal guest in our country,'' she said. ``We are not going
wink-wink to any illegal aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell also has defended his role in helping the onion
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I recognize that enforcement of immigration policy is
vital to maintaining our national security, INS...carried out its
campaign without ample regard for Georgia's farmers,'' he said last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell has introduced a bill to simplify a government program
that lets farmers import legal immigrants to work on farms _
Stanley and other farmers said the program costs too much and ties
them in red tape. Coverdell also pressured the Labor Department to
appoint an ombudsman to meet with farmers and relay their concerns
to top officials.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the INS has shifted its focus from rounding up
illegal immigrants to targeting the smugglers who bring them into
the country, said Bart Szafnicki, assistant INS director for
investigations in Georgia and three nearby states. Agents arrested
two smugglers in south Georgia last year and are examining records
in onion-company offices and discreetly asking questions as they
look for other smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Fischer, who until last year was the INS' top official in
four Southeastern states, including Georgia, said Congress has sent
mixed messages. On one hand, it passes laws against illegal
immigration and expects the INS to enforce them. But then
congressmen intervene on behalf of farmers and ask the INS to back
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have it both ways,'' he said.

IN BREAKTHROUGH, IRA WILL ALLOW ARMS INSPECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By WARREN HOGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The Irish Republican Army offered Saturday to open its
secret arsenal of weapons to international inspection as a way of
meeting peace negotiators' demands that it ``completely and
verifiably'' put its arms beyond use.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the underground organization was issued just
12 hours after Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, made a public call to the group for such
reassurance, and it lifted hopes of an end to the deadlock over
disarmament that has frozen progress on the Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It represented the first time the IRA had ever explicitly
addressed the crucial and emotive subject of disarmament, and the
proposals went further than what even its main political
representative, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, had said in recent
days anyone should expect.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA also said it would reappoint representatives to the
independent disarmament commission that it broke contact with in
February, after Britain put the power-sharing government in Belfast
on hold after only eight weeks. Britain said at the time that it
based that action on the failure of the IRA to make expected moves
on weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern said early Saturday that they hoped to restore
the home rule government by May 22, the original deadline for IRA
disarmament.They also set out a new timetable pushing back until
June 2001 the deadline for a number of measures intended to secure
peace for Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Among those steps are the disposal of paramilitary weapons, a
greater reduction in British troops in the province, a new police
force with more balanced membership among Roman Catholic and
Protestant officers and new human rights provisions.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of the province's largest Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, greeted Saturday's statement with
customary wariness, but he said that it was welcome and promised
that his party would devote serious attention to it. If he decides
to go forward, Trimble will have to overcome the deep reluctance of
a significant minority in his party to re-entering government with
their Sinn Fein rivals without an actual handover of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said: ``It does appear to break new ground. There are
some quite positive elements in it.'' He added, however, that
``there are points that we want to tease out the meaning of.''
</P>
<P>
   David McClartey, an Ulster Unionist legislator from the
suspended assembly, said he and colleagues had emerged from a quick
meeting feeling encouraged by the IRA statement. ``I think there
was a degree of positivity about this statement which hasn't been
there before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, the head of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic
and Labor Party, was asked by the BBC Saturday what he would say to
Trimble, with whom he shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize. He
replied, ``I would say to David that I think this is what they have
been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume added, ``I think it is making very clear that the gun has
been taken out of Irish politics forever.'' He said the most
significant part of the statement was ``that they are going to put
their guns beyond use, and they are going to have that verified.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The quick sequence of events followed a familiar pattern in the
last years of the Northern Ireland peace talks where months of
stalemates, exchanges of accusations and gloomy predictions are
broken by spurts of activity that raise hopes of an end to three
decades of sectarian conflict that has cost more than 3,600 lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there have been some who have been skeptical about
whether republicans, the Irish Republican Army in particular, were
really interested in this process,'' said Adams, the president of
Sinn Fein, the political ally of the IRA. ``I think today's
statement shows that they are.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Up until Friday, Adams had been warning against expectations
that the IRA could respond to the demands for a statement on arms.
Saturday he said: ``This is not an abstract, historical kind of
thing, a dry turning over of the page. This is a life and death,
blood and sinew, emotional and painful step for the IRA to make
because it wants this to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish, who are sponsors of the talks that
resulted in the April 1998 peace accord, announced that the
promised inspections of the arms dumps would be led by two
outsiders. They are Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president
who served as a special U.N. peacemaker during NATO's war with
Yugoslavia over Kosovo last year, and Cyril Ramaphosa, former
secretary-general of the African National Congress in South Africa,
who played a major role in ending apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The two men will report their findings to the independent
international commission that has been charged with supervising the
disarming of the paramilitary groups. ``The dumps will be
re-inspected regularly to insure that the weapons have remained
secure,'' the IRA statement said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The naming of the two foreigners as third parties continued a
tradition in the ongoing effort to end the conflict in Northern
Ireland where outsiders are called in to mediate the major disputes
between the province's two deeply distrustful communities. The head
of the disarmament panel is a Canadian, Gen. John de Chastelain,
and the broker of the original agreement was former Sen. George J.
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for de Chastelain said after Saturday's statement,
``The commission welcomes the recent development and looks forward
to re-engaging actively with the paramilitary groups to further the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland peace settlement is an attempt to balance
the desires of republicans, most of whom are Catholics, to draw
closer to and one day merge with the Irish Republic, with those of
the largely Protestant unionists, who want Ulster to remain part of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The original agreement and the various referendums and votes
that have followed have brought a large measure of political
stability to Northern Ireland and have drastically reduced levels
of violence. The IRA and the Protestant paramilitary groups have
maintained cease-fires for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the IRA said it would make sure that there was
no ``misappropriation by others'' of its weapons, a reference to
public concern over renegade guerrilla groups that object to the
cease-fires and seek to bring the whole peace settlement down with
acts of violence. One of them, the Real IRA, set off a car bomb
four months after the signing of the accord, in the town of Omagh,
killing 29 people and wounding more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Progress has continually come to a halt over the issue of
disarmament, with unionists arguing that they cannot serve in
government with Sinn Fein as long as it has its ``private army,''
and republicans countering with the claim that the cease-fire
itself, which they call the ``silence of the guns,'' is sufficient
proof of their commitment to peace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Sinn Fein leadership has tried to persuade the IRA to begin
disarming, and, according to British security sources, almost
succeeded in January but failed to get unanimous backing from
members of the ruling army council. Adams is known to fear
provoking any divisions in the ranks because of the republican
movement's history of violent fallouts.
</P>
<P>
   The republican reluctance to disarm stems from a feeling that
the IRA is an undefeated army and from a resistance to taking part
in any action that could be construed as surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure in recent months to get the settlement process up
and running again has been on Sinn Fein, but Saturday's statement
shifts the focus to the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   At the last meeting of the party's ruling council, Trimble kept
his leadership with only 57 percent of the delegates' votes after
being challenged by an uninspiring former grand master of the
militant Orange Order, who played on widespread resentment in the
party over what critics view as Trimble's excessive willingness to
make concessions to republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Donaldson, the most prominent hardline dissident, made
it clear Saturday night that he would challenge any attempt by
Trimble to take the party back into government based on Saturday's
statement. ``It would appear that the proposals on arms fall well
short of what unionists have been looking for throughout this
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ahern called on unionists to view Saturday's development
positively, saying that the statement ``had all the clarity that
people have looked for in the last 12 months or so. We've put a lot
of effort in to try to get this issue addressed,'' he said.
``People were skeptical that there would be an IRA statement; now
they can see it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that unionists who might be uncertain about whether to
accept the deal should remember how far Northern Ireland has come
since the peace talks began. ``There is now very little violence,
tourism is beginning to flourish and economic activity is moving
up,'' he argued. ``People want to move away from the past. Things
are changing dramatically and rapidly and we should build on
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA statement made a rare positive reference to unionists,
saying, ``The full implementation, on a progressive and
irreversible basis by the two governments, especially the British
government, of what they have agreed will provide a political
context, in an enduring political process, with the potential to
remove the causes of conflict, and in which Irish republicans, and
unionists can, as equals, pursue our respective political
objectives peacefully.''

 &HT;    Never trust anything that doesn't have shoulders
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ Snakes alive. That's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   One of my long-gone predecessors at the newspaper often referred
to himself in his column as the ``Dead Snake Editor,'' because so
many readers would bring by snakes they had killed and ask to have
their photo made holding the dead snake. I have occasionally been
asked to do the same, especially while working at small weekly
newspapers. Some good ol' boy would bring a 7-foot rattlesnake to
the office and request his photo be made holding up the dead
creature as if he had bagged a trophy deer. Being as how most of
these men were built like brick outhouses, I would dutifully take
the photo and stick it in the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Then I started following editor Sam Malone's way of handling
this whole snake scenario. He told readers he was the ``Live Snake
Editor,'' and if you wanted your picture made with a snake, it had
to be brought in alive. This drastically cut the number of photo
requests. There aren't many people besides zookeepers and the
occasional member of one of those serpent-handling churches who are
willing to hold a live snake long enough for a photographer to get
the camera focused and the picture made.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not really scared of snakes, but I don't like them. I don't
trust any creature that doesn't have shoulders. I have had close
encounters with poisonous snakes: nearly stepping on a rattlesnake
once, having a water moccasin fall in a boat from a branch above as
we floated down a river, and finding a coral snake curled up on the
back porch. In all three cases, the snake lived and so did I.
</P>
<P>
   The rattlesnake slipped away, the water moccasin was pitched
into the water with the barrel of a shotgun, and the coral snake
was captured and set loose far in the woods.
</P>
<P>
   I don't like killing stuff. It's messy. That's why I don't hunt.
It's not a moral issue. I just like my meat pre-wrapped in
cellophane, and I am willing to pay someone else to do the dirty
work.
</P>
<P>
   But I will commit violence if I have to, and the other day a
snake left me no choice. My step-daughter and I were returning from
softball practice about dark. I pulled into the garage. As she
walked ahead, I grabbed her shoulder about two steps before she
would have stepped on a 6-foot-long snake curled up at the door
into the house.
</P>
<P>
   Next thing I know, the stepdaughter is perched on the roof of
the car, and I'm trying to herd the snake out of the garage and
head it in the direction of the woods.The snake did not appreciate
my prodding it with the handle of garden hoe and kept striking at
it and returning to the doormat. The kid had escaped out the garage
and through the front door, and now the entire family was gathered
on the safe side of the door into the house, listening to my
progress.
</P>
<P>
   I'm fairly certain this wasn't a poisonous snake, though the
light was bad and I couldn't remember the rhyme: Was it ``black and
yellow, kill a fellow?'' Or ``flat head, you're dead?'' The snake's
head seemed flat to me, and its coloring was brown and black, near
as I could tell in the dim light of the garage.
</P>
<P>
   Every time I tried to scoot the snake out the garage door, it
would hiss, strike at the hoe handle and get back in the corner. I
realized a hard truth. This snake was claiming the garage as its
new home, and even if he finally slithered out, he'd be back. (All
snakes are male, at least in print.) If I didn't kill him, I would
have to worry about stepping on a snake every time I walked out in
the garage. Worse, I would have to put up with paranoid children
and womenfolk worried about the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   So I dispatched the snake quickly with a machete. I'll spare the
gory details. Suffice it to say there was clean-up involved, which
further confirmed for me why I have no desire to kill things as a
pastime. Everyone is treading a bit cautiously outside, including
me.This snake may have a buddy who could return to the scene of the
crime. I'm wearing shoes outside all the time, just in case.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of mourners from across the New York region
and the nation, including many children and disabled people,
converged Saturday on funereal-draped St. Patrick's Cathedral to
pay their last respects to Cardinal John O'Connor with prayers,
hymns and the ancient rites of Roman Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   On a sun-washed spring day with temperatures that climbed into
the high 80s, crowds stood for hours in long, slow-moving lines on
Fifth Avenue and 50th Street to enter the great cathedral double
doors draped with black-and-purple bunting for a last glimpse of
the cardinal, lying in state at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming under the arched gothic pillars almost all day, a
double line of somber-faced mourners filed past the cardinal's
bier, which was flanked by white-gloved police officers standing at
attention. Many people wept softly, and murmured prayers for the
cardinal, who died Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds also filled the 2,300-seat pews to overflowing for a
morning Mass in Spanish, for an afternoon Mass in English that was
organized for children and disabled people, and later for vesper
and rosary services. For many it was a day of reflection as well as
sorrow for the loss of the 80-year-old cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a wonderful man, a model for Catholicism,'' Frank
Rusch, an airline pilot from the West Coast, said after viewing the
body cloaked in scarlet and white vestments in a a red-velvet lined
mahogany coffin. ``He is very well thought of. I speak of him in
the present because he is still with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Marie Kaatz, who drove 77 miles into town from upstate Wingdale,
N.Y., with her two children, said: ``It was important to see him.
It was very important for the children.'' Alluding to the
cardinal's eight-month struggle with brain cancer, she added: ``I
feel happy for him because he is at peace, and is where he always
wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Vasquez, who brought his wife and child from the Bronx,
said sadly: ``He meant a lot to us as Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   As preparations for the cardinal's funeral on Monday went
forward, there was no word from the Vatican on the selection of his
successor as the archbishop of New York, although speculation
continued to focus on Bishop Edward M. Egan, of the Archdiocese of
Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will lead a host of dignitaries at the funeral
_ 3,500 invitations are going out _ and the Vatican Secretary of
State, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, will represent Pope John Paul II and
officiate at the 2 p.m. funeral Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's events _ the second of three days of Masses and other
services leading to the funeral and burial in the crypt under the
altar at St. Patrick's _ gave striking testimony once more to the
admiration and respect that millions accorded the cardinal,
America's most influential Catholic leader.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., when the cathedral doors opened, the crowds waiting
to get in were already enormous. The lines snaked around into 50th
Street, then back to Madison Avenue, where they doubled back again
to Fifth Avenue. And they kept getting larger.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For some, the day's heat was a torment. About 11:30 a.m., a man
in his 70s fainted on the sidewalk. People nearby quickly went to
his aid, giving him sips of water and slices of orange. He revived
a bit and said he had been standing in line for about 90 minutes
and had walked about a mile to the cathedral from the Port
Authority Bus Terminal at 40th Street and Eighth Avenue. Firemen
took him away on a makeshift stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some people had flown in from Puerto Rico and other Caribbean
islands. Some had come by bus from other states. Many were
residents of the metropolitan area who had come by bus or subway to
pay tribute to a man they said had been a friend of the poor and
the sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the cardinal so much, I just had to come,'' said
Minnie Stinson of the Bronx.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his homily in Spanish, the Rev. Josu Iriondo, director of the
office of Hispanic affairs for the archdiocese, recalled the
cardinal's involvement with the Hispanic population, including his
two visits to Cuba and his efforts to sent food and money to
hurricane victims.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, dozens of buses drew up around the cathedral
carrying hundreds of elderly and disabled men and women, many of
them in wheelchairs or moving with the aid of walkers, canes or
crutches. Also on board were hundreds of children, many of them
mentally or physically disabled. They were helped into the
cathedral by counselors and aides from hospitals and nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1 p.m. Mass, pew after pew was filled with the children
and the disabled who were the special guests. Those in wheelchairs
sat in the aisles. It was relatively cool inside, out of the sun
and under the subdued light from chandeliers and high, arched
stained glass windows on either side of the nave. Organ music
swelled and a choir sang. Many in the crowd held rosaries, and some
cried softly as the Mass unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   The Mass began with a processional hymn, ``Sing With All the
Saints in Glory,'' followed by a psalm, ``We Shall Go Up With Joy
to the House of Our God.'' The Most Rev. Robert A. Brucato,
apostolic administrator of the archdiocese, read from the Gospel of
St. John, then gave the homily.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the Mass was sponsored by the archdiocesan Offices
of Education and Persons with Disabilities, and he spoke of the
cardinal's contributions to disabled youths.
</P>
<P>
   And as the faint sweet aroma of incense drifted through the
cathedral, the lines to view the cardinal in his bier formed again
and moved slowly and solemnly forward.  &QL;

FOR O'CONNOR'S SUCCESSOR, INFLUENCE ISN'T AUTOMATIC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Calif., Ind., Pa., Ill.)   (With: O'CONNOR-MOURNERS) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The leadership advice that Cardinal Terence Cooke often gave to
the voluble bishop who would succeed him in 1984 as archbishop of
New York was this:
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to swing at every pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   During most of the 16 years that Cardinal John O'Connor reigned
as the most combative and charismatic voice of Roman Catholicism in
the United States, he exuberantly ignored his predecessor's
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think I have swung at almost every pitch,'' the
prelate recalled in a 1994 appearance on the Charlie Rose show.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor rarely stepped back from the plate on matters of
abortion, contraception, gay rights and the ordination of women _
emotionally explosive issues that have divided American Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   He was almost always game for a doctrinally emphatic comment,
often with a pithy quote that appeared in the tabloids and the
evening news.
</P>
<P>
   His death last week is a reminder of the degree to which a
confrontational style helped make him the best-known and perhaps
the most influential voice in the American Catholic Church. But it
also underlines the difficulties facing whoever tries to put on his
leadership mantle.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's outsized personality and his in-your-face skills with
the New York media camouflaged what Catholic historians and church
observers agree is a significant diminution in the influence of
bishops in the daily lives of American Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church is very distant from the lives of people on a daily
basis,'' said Frank Macchiarola, president of St. Francis College
in Brooklyn and a former schools chancellor in New York. ``The
challenge for the bishops is not that the people won't follow the
rules, but that they will not think the rules are significant.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of church historians said O'Connor was perhaps the last
cardinal archbishop in American history who could take for granted
the prominence of the Catholic Church in the public eye, as a
leading institution, a shaper of public opinion and an overwhelming
influence on the culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key here is that O'Connor could take it for granted,''
said R. Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study
of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame. ``His
great accomplishment was to extend the life of that influential
presence by his personal style.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's successor as the ad hoc leader of American Catholics,
whether he comes from the archdiocese of New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago or another major American city, will not be so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The priesthood in America is in decline, as is the community of
religious women working in Catholic schools and hospitals. The
Archdiocese of New York, in large measure because of O'Connor's
energy, is an exception to the dismal trend of institutional
downsizing in schools and parishes in major cities like Detroit,
Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco. Polls have shown for years
that many Catholics do not accept church teachings on
contraception, homosexuality and the ordination of women. Finally,
there is a deep demographic divide within the American church, with
new immigrants from Latin America and Asia on one side and
assimilated middle-class Catholic culture on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that you have authority because you occupy an office
is not very functional in the history of the American church,''
said David O'Brien, a professor of Roman Catholic studies at the
College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. ``You have to wonder
how long authority can be maintained without a real strong pastoral
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the views of several scholars who study the church,
O'Brien said the pastoral connection of bishops to believers was at
risk of being severed by demographic trends and by the insistence
of Pope John Paul II on strict doctrinal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't quite know where this is going to go,'' O'Brien said.
``There has been such a strong emphasis on the teachings of the
pope. It is a very papal church now. There isn't much consultation
with the clergy or the laity. It looks like the pope feels he can
appoint anyone he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is widespread agreement among Catholic intellectuals
about the eroding influence of bishops in the lives of American
Catholics, there is considerable disagreement about how to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives argue that Catholics are thirsting for a strong,
doctrinally clear leader in the mold of O'Connor, a man with a
forceful personality who can cut a high profile as a preacher,
teacher and figure in the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of his highly visible defense of Catholic teachings on
life, Cardinal O'Connor made it possible for a lot of Catholics who
wanted to believe in that teaching to get behind him,'' said Deal
Hudson, publisher and editor of Crisis magazine, a conservative
Catholic monthly published in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson argued that papal orthodoxy on issues like abortion and
gay rights did not alienate Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a bishop communicates in a pastorally sensitive way, it
will have an impact, and people's minds and hearts will come
around,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals in the church disagree, arguing that no archbishop in
the United States is likely to attain real national influence
unless he can somehow close the gap between papal doctrine and the
spiritual demands of the laity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Catholics can't help but see that institutionally the church
is still very clergy-oriented,'' said Paul Baumann, executive
editor of Commonweal, a liberal Catholic magazine published in New
York. ``It is impossible for bishops to get the kind of loyalty
they had unless there is some sign of change on contraception,
mandatory celibacy for priests and the role of women in the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of archbishop most likely to win a national following,
several Catholic historians said, is one who plays down divisive
issues like abortion and eloquently articulates a Catholic position
on larger social questions. What are the spiritual costs of
pursuing material wealth? What is the role of the state toward the
vulnerable and dispossessed? How do Americans square their rising
affluence with poverty elsewhere in the world?
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental question that the leader of Catholics in
America has to address is why do Americans need a permanent
community of faith to fulfill their spiritual lives,'' said
Appleby, at Notre Dame. ``The answer cannot just be a sound bite
that says no to abortion or premarital sex. It has to be a whole
story that puts the noes in context and in which Americans
recognize their own lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the weaknesses of the Catholic Church in the United
States, O'Brien said, ``authority is a real tough thing to
maintain'' for any archbishop in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to come from personal charisma or from pastoral care,''
he said. ``Much of Cardinal O'Connor's authority came from
charisma. But there are not a lot of charismatic successors out
there. They are not in large supply in the American clergy.''
</P>
<P>
   The alternative, then, is pastoral care, which church
intellectuals define as listening to the deepest yearnings of
believers and challenging them with the teachings of the Gospel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our time calls for dialogue, not confrontation,'' said the
Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit who is editor in chief of America, the
Catholic magazine. ``That is what people are used to.''

   This week's stories:
</P>
<P>
   CNS-CANDYBAR-LOYALTIES (New York) _ Some things never change,
and that includes Americans' taste in chocolate bars. Frequent
introductions and tinkering with time-honored formulas produce
flops more often than they produce new favorites for the shelf. In
fact, one spokeswoman says, most of the top 10 chocolate products
have been around for the better part of a century. By Rebecca
Webber. (850 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-DEATH-CLEANUP (New York) _ Death is not pretty, and often
someone has to clean up after it. Enter Bio-Recovery Corp., whose
medically trained employees will remove all traces of murder,
suicide or accidental death. By Trenton Daniel. (750 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-WOMEN'S-COLLEGES (New York) _ In the 1970's, with the
feminist movement at its peak, many women's colleges opened their
doors to men, and others folded rather than go coed. The remaining
women's colleges are enjoying a resurgence, perhaps surprisingly,
because they offer better academics and opportunities for women to
make their own marks. By Jocelyn Anderson. (930 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-TORTURED-SUITS (New York) _ A Ghanian diplomat who says he
was tortured by another diplomat in Ghana had his day in court
against the man he says was responsible, but the court was in the
United States. Under various rulings on federal law, foreigners who
claim torture at the hands of other foreigners can sometimes bring
lawsuits in the United States. By Sameer Yerawadekar. (1,050
words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-DANCE-THERAPISTS (New York) _ Behind the scenes of Broadway,
in addition to the props people, dressers and costume designers,
are a group of people who are literally responsible for the health
of a show. Dance therapists, working to heal or prevent injuries
that commonly occur with eight energetic performances a week, can
often save not just the individual dancers, but also the financial
health of a show. By Will Morton. (975 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-BOSNIAN-MUSICIAN (Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzogovina) _ Darko
Jelisic interrupted his career as a rising musician when the war in
Bosnia broke out. A cluster bomb seemed to end that dream, but
after Jelisic came to the United States to recuperate, he found not
only that he could still play, but that he and his music could
become popular symbols in his homeland. By Nathan Hegedus. (850
words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-NY-BUSES (New York) _ The city with the largest bus fleet
and some of the worst air pollution in the nation is caught in the
debate over whether the buses powered by alternative means are
really better for the environment than the diesel-powered buses
many want to replace. By Natalie Leston. (1,050 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-HYPNOTISTS (New York) _ Hypnotherapists, once put in the
same category as snake-oil salesmen and other medical quacks, are
gaining popularity. In fact, many doctors and more traditional
health-care professionals are taking hypnosis classes in attempts
to treat patients more completely. And they've even got a union. By
Stephen Parker. (1,075 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-KOREA-FAMILIES (Undated) _ The division of North and South
Korea also meant the division of many families, many of whom have
since been unable to contact, visit or otherwise find out anything
about their relatives. Now, a summit meeting between the leaders of
the north and south scheduled for June is giving hope that people
who have not seen each other for more than 50 years might be
reunified. By Michael Goldman. (850 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-E-RETURNS (New York) _ With the boom in online retailing,
what's a poor startup company to do when people start returning
merchandise before it's fully figured out how to sell it to them?
Why, turn to other startup companies, of course. There's no
shortage of dot-coms willing to help other dot-coms with their
e-returns. By Gus G. Sentementes. (1,050 words.)
</P>
<P>
   CNS-SNICKERS-CRIME (Undated) - A man in Texas has been sentenced
to 16 years in prison for stealing a Snickers bar. He was but the
latest person to be sentenced under one of the strictest repeat
offender laws in the country. By Kate Dawson. (850 words.)

SOME CHOCOLATE CHOICES NEVER CHANGE

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whether it's a Hershey's bar, plain M&AMP;Ms, or Reese's
peanut butter cups, the sweet offerings of the convenience store
and the office vending machine haven't changed much over the years.
Though American consumers often want everything that's new, when it
comes to chocolate, they'll take the tried and true.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the top 10 chocolate products, most of them
have been around for the better part of last century,'' said Susan
Fussel, spokeswoman for the National Confectioners Association,
``Those are definitely our favorites.''
</P>
<P>
   The top sellers are a litany of familiar names such as M&AMP;Ms,
Hershey, Reese, and KitKat that have stood the test of time. The
classic Hershey's bar has been around since 1900 _ when it sold for
a nickel _ and the beloved Snickers since 1930. Overall, 65 percent
of American candy brands have been around for more than 50 years,
according to the NCA. It's one area of consumerism that Americans
refuse to update.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candy is an impulse buy,'' said Michael Kinney, a Hershey
Foods Corp. spokesman, ``and most people have a short list of 10 to
12 candy products that they're going to look for.'' It's difficult,
he said, for people to add to or delete from that select list.
</P>
<P>
   And taste buds never forget a candy bar they once loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get e-mails all the time from people who are trying to
track down a particular candy they loved as a kid because it gives
a sense of youthfulness and nostalgia,'' said Fussel. ``They crave
what they craved as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-six year old Lucille Perleman of Manhattan still visits
her local candy paradise, Sweets From Heaven, to satisfy her sweet
tooth. She says she likes Hershey's chocolate. ``As a child, of
course, we ate Hershey candy bars,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruwayn Murad grew up in Europe eating Lion Bars and they are
still his favorite after 18 years in America. He buys the caramel
and chocolate bar at specialty stores like Sweets From Heaven.
``It's a nostalgia thing,'' he said. ``It reminds me of a lot of
good things in one little package.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers' attachment to traditional candy bars means that new
chocolate products don't stand much of a chance in the marketplace,
even though manufacturers are constantly trying out new products.
The chocolate bar history book is littered with the corpses of
``new!'' candy bars past.
</P>
<P>
   Hershey loyalists might remember the Mild and Mellow bar, the
Rally bar, and the Butter Chip bar. These products, and more than a
dozen others from Hershey, were introduced over the past century
but failed to hook consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Innovations by Nestle-USA and M&AMP;M/Mars have run into similar
troubles. Remember Nestle's Choco-lite? Or Mars' peanut butter
Snickers? Neither lasted long on the 7-Eleven shelf.
</P>
<P>
   With this in mind, candy makers today tend to offer only gentle
alterations on the old favorites. The new Milky Way Midnight alters
the 1923 innovation with a dark chocolate overcoat, and the
original 1928 Reese's peanut butter cup ingredients were rearranged
in 1998 to form ReeseSticks.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the combination, chocolate is American's favorite
flavor and annual consumption has risen to its current high of 12.2
pounds per person, according to the Department of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chocolate is, for most people _ when their sweet tooth comes
calling _ that's what they want,'' said Michael Yamaner, the
government's statistical analyst for the confectionery industry.
</P>
<P>
   Americans won't automatically disdain a new product. The Twix
bar, a chocolate enrobed cookie-caramel combination, received a
happy welcome when it arrived in the U.S. from Britain in 1979. But
later variations that substituted the caramel layer with peanut
butter, chocolate fudge, and cookies-and-cream didn't catch on.
</P>
<P>
   While Twix was a successful import, few chocolate confections
are embraced outside their country of origin. American candy
consumers prefer peanut flavors, while European chocolate shops
brim with hazelnut and praline. Regional tastes even figure into
variations in ingredients of the exact same candy. The Hershey's
bar sold abroad is creamier than the American favorite because, the
company says, countries outside of North America prefer different
flavor profiles.
</P>
<P>
   And not everyone is stuck on the conventional hometown
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I visited confectioner's shops in Europe, there were so
many different types of chocolate and they were all good and none
of them are available here.'' said a confessed candy addict,
Candice Brasell, a New Yorker who filled her suitcase with European
varieties before returning home.
</P>
<P>
   And kids just developing their chocolate habits are welcoming
some recent innovations. Twelve-year-olds Jensen Lowe and David
Himmel of Manhattan adore old-time favorites like Nestle Crunch and
Charleston Chew, but they also have welcomed the new crispy M&AMP;M
into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Crispy M&AMP;Ms,'' nodded Lowe, ``Those are good.''  &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The apartment where the woman died was littered with
notes she had taped to the walls, letters and boxes of journals
scattered around her baby grand piano. The bathroom revealed a more
disturbing sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that?'' asked Ron Gospodarski, pointing to the edge of the
bathtub. ``That's skin. The blood, feces, and interstitial fluid
won't take much time to clean up. But the skin will probably take
about 45 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman died of heart disease at least eight days before
Gospodarski arrived on the scene. Perhaps she had collapsed onto
the tub, he speculated.
</P>
<P>
   It fell to Gospodarski, president of Bio-Recovery Corp., to
clean up the gory remains. ``Imagine if that was your relative,''
he said. ``You don't want to see that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   This kind of scrubbing isn't pleasant, but somebody has to do
it. For Gospodarski and his staff of 10, it's all part of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Bio-Recovery Corp. has restored homes and businesses
_ any place where homicides, suicides and accidents have occurred _
to cleanliness. The cleanup not only prevents the spread of
disease, but also helps to calm residents and neighbors, said
Gospodarski.
</P>
<P>
   The uniforms of Bio-Recovery's medically trained ``crime scene
cleaning, abatement and restoration specialists'' resemble
astronaut suits, white and baggy, with oxygen masks and rubber
gloves. Once encapsulated in this garb, the experts sweep the
surrounding area. Then they sanitize the infected area of all
pathological waste and associated debris and dispose it at a
medical waste-handling facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of weeks ago a man killed himself with a shotgun,''
said the 37-year-old Gospodarski. ``Stuff was everywhere.'' . It
took several hours to clean the site.
</P>
<P>
   Although some 200 similar cleanup companies operate nationwide,
Bio-Recovery corners the market in the New York City region.
Gospodarski has had his work cut out this year. Along with local
law enforcement officers, his Queens-based company has watched the
city's murder rate rise after several years of decline. There were
190 homicides in the first three months of this year, up from 169
during the same period last year, according to police statistics.
Although Bio-Recovery isn't needed at every murder scene, a jump in
crime invariably means more business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been working crazy hours, seven days a week,'' said
Gospodarski.
</P>
<P>
   Gospodarski's on-call staff consists of current and former cops
and public safety officers. They earn $25 an hour for as many as 20
calls a week, with a slow-down during the spring and summer months.
Outdoor deaths don't typically require the services of
Bio-Recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's warmer, more people will hang themselves in a
tree in the park, hurl themselves in front of a train, or throw
themselves in the East River,'' said Gospodarski matter-of-factly.
``They don't feel they have to stay indoors to kill themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, animals prompt the call. After rushing to a site,
it isn't uncommon to find dozens of living and dead cats in an
apartment, said Gospodarski, adding, ``It happens more than people
think.''
</P>
<P>
   The crime-scene cleanup industry is about 10 years old, said
Gospodarski, who is also president of the American Bio-Recovery
Association, a national group with about 200 members. He started
this nonprofit organization four years ago to set standards in the
profession. ``We want to make sure that when people go out there,
they know what they're doing,'' he said. Standards from the federal
Occupational, Safety and Health Administration and the Centers for
Disease Control govern the industry.
</P>
<P>
   One reason this niche of the clean-up business came about was to
make sure health standards are met, said John Heath, president of
Crime Scene Cleanup in Tampa Bay, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are all these rules now because of diseases contracted
by blood, and there are regulations about where you can haul it,''
he said. ``Unless the mess is properly cleaned up, people open
themselves to a lot of fines.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Gospodarski and his colleagues are sometimes glib
when discussing their work, they profess to have a serious
philosophy about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are already traumatized by the event, and they can be
retraumatized if the mess isn't cleaned up properly,'' Gospodarski
said, viewing his company as a public service. ``We need to be
there for the people.''

COLLEGE WOMEN VALUE EQUALITY IN SEPARATENESS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deb Roselli Kelly fondly remembers many late night
conversations with girlfriends in college. In the dorms, in class,
and around the campus, they spent all their time together. They had
to.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly graduated from Wheaton College in 1986, the last year it
was still a women's college. Although she had to escape to nearby
Brown University to enjoy the company of men, Kelly says that today
she would still encourage her daughter to attend a single-sex
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed,'' she said. ``And I hope that doesn't mean
women's colleges are obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's colleges, originally founded because women could not
attend other schools, are not yet obsolete. In fact, they have
changed with the times and are attracting substantial numbers of
students even as critics question the need for single-sex
education. In many instances, women's institutions are enjoying
renewed popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's colleges are enjoying a very positive place,'' said
Jadwiga Sebrechts, president of the Women's College Coalition,
based in Washington, D.C. ``They are seen as models of how you can
give priority to certain populations.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of women attending single-sex schools has increased
15 percent in the last 10 years. This year, Mount Holyoke received
2,600 applications for its fall class of 525 _ the most ever. At
Agnes Scott College in Georgia, administrators expect a fall
enrollment of 1,000 in the fall, double the population of five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these strong enrollment increases, many single-sex
colleges have folded or become co-ed over the years, so that the
percentage of women nationwide attending single-sex schools has
stayed static at 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Today 77 women's colleges exist in 23 states and Washington,
D.C. A decade ago there were 84. In 1960, there were 300.
Predominately private, liberal arts institutions, more than half
are located in the Northeast. Most are affiliated with a religion,
and have student bodies of fewer than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   But why do people choose single-sex schools? Like small schools
in general, the women's colleges get high marks for faculty-student
ratios and the leadership opportunities they offer students. In
addition to having high graduation rates, women's colleges have
produced 30 percent of Business Week's list of 50 rising corporate
stars. Hillary Rodham Clinton, Geraldine Ferraro, Gloria Steinem
and Alice Walker all attended women's colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunities for leadership are greater for women at
women's colleges,'' said Cheryl Walker, who graduated from
Wellesley College with Clinton and now teaches at Scripps College
in California. ``I was asked to edit the literary magazine and to
read my poetry at Boston's Winterfest. You are chosen to stand
out.''
</P>
<P>
   That same atmosphere of opportunity resonates with today's
undergraduates. They also emphasize the homey environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first year I was having professors call me in my dorm room
to chat about papers,'' said Erica Lutes, student body president at
Mount Holyoke. ``At the end of each semester, we have barbecues at
their houses. It's so much more intimate than other schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior Lia Shimada said she had lacked confidence to speak out
in high school, but Wellesley College changed that.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big thing has been that I learned how to talk in class,''
she said. ``Wellesley encourages you to find your voice both inside
and outside of class.''
</P>
<P>
   But the single-sex environment isn't for everyone. Women's
colleges have higher attrition rates than co-ed schools, with many
students transferring out after one year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a time in late adolescence, when girls are still
trying to figure out who they are,'' said Sebrechts. ``They may
worry about what their sexual orientation might be perceived to
be,'' and fear being labeled a lesbian. ``Going with the flow of
the American idea of college is not going to a women's college.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, about 90 percent of today's women's colleges offer
cross-registration programs with nearby co-ed schools, allowing
women to mingle with the opposite sex but also raising the question
of whether these are really still women's institutions. School
administrators and faculty emphasize the women-centered
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gender-related, there are men in the classrooms, but there are
probably more women in the science and math courses,'' compared to
what students find at a co-ed school, said Sarah Smedley, media
relations manager at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Single-sex loyalists are many. When Mills College trustees tried
to admit men to the California campus 10 years ago, students
boycotted classes and blocked campus buildings, shutting down the
school for two weeks. So far, they have managed to hold off the
testosterone influx.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Jakobsen, director of the Barnard Center for Research on
Women, said the Mills standoff was a turning point for women's
education, one that demonstrated there is a contemporary place for
single-sex colleges. Jakobsen recalled her own experience at
Dartmouth College five years after it began accepting women in
1972. There were three men for every woman in classes then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very unpleasant experience,'' said Jakobsen. ``It
taught me that co-education would never be enough. Bringing women
into the classroom does not make them equal.''

VICTIMS SUE FOREIGN TORTURERS IN AMERICAN COURTS

(Sameer Yerawadekar is a master's degree candidate at the Graduate
School of Journalism at Columbia University.) 
  By SAMEER YERAWADEKAR  
 c.2000 Columbia News Service   NEW YORK _ Bawol Cabiri, 41,
collected his thoughts, breathed deeply, and quietly told a
Manhattan jury about 11 months of agony he said he underwent in
Ghana, his homeland.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cabiri said his life in New York as Ghana's Trade Counsel to the
United States came to a crashing halt on July 31, 1986. On that
day, said Cabiri, while he was in Ghana, officers of a new
government arrested him without charge. He said they forced him
into a cell three feet long and four feet wide, where he stayed for
almost a year.
</P>
<P>
   Periodically, sometimes three times a night, Cabiri said, guards
tortured him. One held a shotgun to his head while another struck
him repeatedly. Other guards tied him up and kicked him in the neck
until blood erupted from his mouth. And Cabiri said the guards
administered electric shocks to his body, usually to his genitals.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who ordered the guards to do these things, Cabiri did
not hesitate. ``Ambassador Assasie-Gyimah,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Baffour Assasie-Gyimah, dressed in a jet-black suit, cringed as
the jury turned to look at him. The jury had to decide whether
Assasie-Gyimah, the Ghanian ambassador to Niger, Mali and Burkina
Faso, formerly the Deputy Chief of National Security, ordered the
torture of Cabiri in a Ghanan prison locals knew as ``Hanoi.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabiri's allegations, dramatic though they were, could not have
found their way into American courts until 1980, when a federal
appeals court ruled that an obscure 1789 statute empowered federal
judges to hear cases brought by foreigners against other foreigners
who tortured them in foreign countries. Until then, the Alien Tort
Claims Act had been understood to allow foreigners to sue pirates.
But the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit read the statute,
which allows suits alleging a violation of the ``law of nations,''
to allow foreigners to sue torturers.
</P>
<P>
   Cabiri's $5 million lawsuit, filed in 1994, was one of the few
that went to trial under the Alien Tort Claims Act. When the trial
began in February, it was only the second case to go to trial under
the Torture Victim Protection Act, passed by Congress in 1992 to
allow anyone, not just foreigners, to sue their persecuters in
federal court. The first was a suit brought in Hawaii against the
estate of former President Ferdinand Marcos of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   Under this law, relatives of four nuns found raped, beaten and
murdered in El Salvador 20 years ago filed a multimillion-dollar
suit last year against two retired Salvadoran generals found living
in Florida. ``This was a crime that shocked America,'' said Rob
Varenik, a lawyer for the nuns' relatives. ``These are people with
blood on their hands. The U.S. should not be a haven for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Torture cases were first brought in American courts after the
appeals court decision in 1980. Human rights lawyers eagerly filed
suits against torturers who visited the United States, but quickly
ran into problems. ``In most cases, the defendant just goes home,
and the plaintiff wins a default judgment that isn't paid,'' said
Jennifer Green, an attorney at the Center for Constitutional Rights
and an expert on international torture law.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in the 20 years since the appeals court decision,
only a few dozen cases went to trial under the Alien Tort Claims
Act.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal academics wondered whether the United States should
be deciding cases involving people and events from abroad.
International lawyers said they worry that having American courts
hear these cases might prevent the growth of international legal
institutions. Nevertheless, for practicing human rights lawyers,
these cases provide the only chance of holding many torturers
responsible for their crimes. ``The problem isn't too few
lawyers,'' said Varenik. ``It's too few clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients are hard to find because victims often avoid talking
about their experiences. ``Torture leaves a stigma of guilt and
humiliation,'' said Doug Johnson, who heads the Center for the
Victims of Torture in Minneapolis. Though between 5 and 35 percent
of all refugees have been physically and mentally abused, according
to Amnesty International, few survivors come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that few refugees know that they can sue
their victimizers at all. ``People who have been tortured come from
poor, isolated communities, and they often don't know the
language,'' explained Tenzin Tethong, executive director of
Survivors International, a human rights group in San Francisco.
``They need to be found and told that they can get treatment, that
they can tell people about their torture, and that they can sue.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even among the minuscule number of cases that are filed, few
go to trial because defendants fail to appear. Ross Hanig, a
spokesman for the Center for Justice and Accountability, a
two-year-old victims' advocacy group, said that lawyers should look
for defendants who won't leave. ``It isn't that difficult,'' he
said. ``One of our clients walked into a park and saw the man who
tortured him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States does a terrible job keeping torturers out of
the country,'' said Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights
Watch. Brody supports the passage of the Anti-Atrocity Alien
Deportation Act, which would empower the Justice Department's
Office of Special Investigations, currently charged with
identifying Nazi war criminals, to find and deport torturers. The
Act is currently before a Senate committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assasie-Gyimah did not have to stay,'' said S. Reid Kahn, his
lawyer. ``He could have gone home and never had to worry about it.
But he chose to stay and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   And he won. On February 9, 2000, the 12 New Yorkers on the jury
found Baffour Assasie-Gyimah not liable for torturing Bawol Cabiri,
now a United Nations administrator in Kosovo. ``We're appealing the
case,'' said Scott Kamber, Cabiri's attorney. ``The jury had a very
high standard for torture, especially because the case involved
high government officials. It's been a long time, and scars heal.''

   NEW YORK _ Lana Gordon put on her 20-pound cheetah costume and
prepared to go onstage in ``The Lion King,'' but she had not
attached the puppet-like apparatus tightly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midst of catching the puppet and realizing what
happened, my body jerked and was out of place,'' Gordon said. ``It
wasn't a natural movement.'' She had to get her hip ``pulled out,''
or unjammed, for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   As dancers strut their way across imaginary African plains,
stomp rhythmically in ``Riverdance'' and send partners skyward in
``Saturday Night Fever,'' a fleet of physical therapists helps keep
bodies ready for more. Part masseuse and part athletic trainer,
they teach performers to prevent injury and reduce the time needed
to heal. Unseen by the audience, physical therapists hope to keep
production costs down and healthier dancers on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of what we teach is how to undo what the show has done
to them,'' said Sean P. Gallagher, who started as a Broadway
physical therapist in 1989. Today, his company, Performing Arts
Physical Therapy, works with shows including ``Cats,'' ``Swing,''
``Fosse'' and ``Footloose.'' With lots of partner work and lifting,
``Saturday Night Fever'' dancers suffer a lot of upper neck and
extremity problems, Gallagher said. Dancers in ``Cats'' suffer back
and hip problems from crawling around on the floor, he said,
``trying to be cats, when their bodies aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Broadway stages, which slant down toward the audience, also
pose risks to dancers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like working on a hillside,'' said Brandi Doyle, one of
Performing Arts' eight therapists. ``Your body makes corrections.''
</P>
<P>
   Lana Gordon, now performing in ``Jesus Christ Superstar,'' said
physical therapists taught her how reduce back strain while dancing
on stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're on heels and you're on a raked stage, your initial
response is to lean back,'' she said, slouching like someone would
while hiking down a steep hill. The proper way to keep pressure of
her back, she learned, is to tilt the pelvis forward and stick the
chest out. She walks as if the stage continues out into the
audience, not like someone who is trying not to fall into the
orchestra pit.
</P>
<P>
   ``At eight shows a week, your body breaks down,'' said Gordon,
30. ``Muscles contract when they're not supposed to.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Riverdance,'' one of the most physically demanding shows on
Broadway, has a combination chiropractor and bone specialist on
staff, said Merle Frimark, the show's North American publicist. Two
full-time massage therapists also help lead warmups for the 36
Irish dancers, eight Russian dancers, three American tap dancers
and one flamenco dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dancers receive two massages per week, physiotherapist Ruth
Magee said. To add arch support, they line their shoes with
shock-absorbent insoles imported from London. Dancers practice a
range of exercises, including standing on one leg and on their
tiptoes, lying on their backs and pointing one leg at the sky or
putting one leg on a hip-high bar and leaning forward _ all ways to
stretch the hamstring muscle on the back of the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one show, a performer could stamp their foot about 3,000
times,'' Magee said in a buoyant Irish brogue. ``If you think of
the repetition and the trauma that you could give to your foot and
your shin, it's quite a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Physical therapists started getting involved with Broadway shows
more than a decade ago, around the time the Harkness Center for
Dance Injuries was founded as part of the Hospital for Joint
Diseases on East 17th Street. The center works to reduce the
frequency and severity of injuries, spokeswoman Marijeanne
Liderbach said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, isn't this medical problem a pain for all of us,'' she
said. ``It's a pain for the dancer, and it hurts the company
financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Dancers normally earn $1,200 to $1,800 a week, according to
Actors' Equity Association, the labor union that represents
Broadway dancers. Injured dancers receive up to $650 a week in
worker's compensation pay and a supplement from Actors' Equity,
said Valerie LaVarco, who handles injury claims. Meanwhile,
production companies must pay replacement dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Plesa, a 22-year-old sprite of a dancer in ``Saturday
Night Fever,'' increased her regular physical therapy back in
October after a bad lift and landing in her first show on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``On day two of rehearsal, I broke my foot,'' she said ``I ended
up sitting in a chair for a month and a half.'' Her salary went
from $1,300 a week to $200 a week.
</P>
<P>
   Some Broadway shows resist hiring physical therapists because it
brings added expense to already pricey productions, said
Liederbach, of the Harkness Center. A 1993 study in The American
Journal of Sports Medicine found that in three seasons at a San
Francisco ballet company, 104 dancers suffered 309 injuries
resulting in medical insurance payments of nearly $400,000. Adding
physical therapy services, the company saved a half-million dollars
a year, Liederbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Like football and basketball players, dancers always face the
prospect of a career-ending injury at a young age. Spectators don't
think of the repercussions of injury when watching dancers,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see football players with their helmets on and crashing
into other and they think they're automatically going to get
hurt,'' LaVarco said. Because dancers appear more dressed up and
glamorous, ``I don't think that people get the impression that
injuries occur that can be career ending, such as a knee injury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For a dancer to even hurt their knee, it's very scary,''
Frimark said.

 &HT;    The (inter)face of arts and technology
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's a meeting of palette and pixel.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing they need each other to grow, Atlanta's arts
community and its high-tech industry are linking in creative ways,
forming connections that will place fresh troops on nonprofit
boards and reboot the arts' presence among e-world workers and
online.
</P>
<P>
   And if the arts happen to find a little extra cash along the way
_ well, no one's complaining.
</P>
<P>
   This convergence is also helping change the way the arts are
perceived by the business establishment. No longer can the city
powers afford to regard theater, opera, music, dance and the visual
arts merely as tasteful highbrow diversions, an extra for the
elite, something for the wives to do.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by recent criticism of Atlanta's arts commitment, leaders
around town, from both the arts and business spheres, agree that
building a national arts profile is a quality-of-life necessity for
a city competing for wired-world talent against such cultural
capitals as San Francisco, Seattle and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Some steps have been taken to reach that goal.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural technology task force for the Woodruff Arts
Center's annual corporate campaign recently raised $250,000 from
the high-tech sector. The campaign hopes to attain its overall goal
of $6.6 million next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two goals,'' says Bert Rayle, regional manager at
Goldman Sachs, who chaired the 19-member task force. ``We wanted to
get active participation, and we wanted to raise a little money.
We've done better on both fronts than we would have anticipated.''
</P>
<P>
   The quarter-million dollars donated by the city's
``up-and-coming wealth'' represents ``virtually all new money'' for
the arts, Rayle says, coming from entrepreneurs such as Alan
Daniels of realestate.com, Jeff Levy of eHatchery and Bob Cramer of
adam.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competing for talent means putting the best face on the
city,'' says co-chairman Steven J. Heyer, president and chief
operating officer of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. ``A critical
component of that is the quality of schools and other institutions
that enrich folks. I put the Woodruff high on that list.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arts &AMP; Business Council of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of
Commerce has, for the first time, recruited its chairman from the
technology sector.
</P>
<P>
   John Bacon is president and CEO of Iterated Systems, a software
company that helps businesses retain control of their brands on the
Web _ ``imagewear for e-commerce,'' he calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon has a much wider target than the Woodruff task force: the
development _ and preservation _ of the culturescape that exists
beyond the mighty arts center.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, who serves on the board of the Atlanta Singers, a premier
a cappella vocal group, is engaging high-tech firms around the
area, such as iXl and Macquarium, to help explore ways to sustain
the area's niche theaters, pocket-size dance companies and eclectic
music ensembles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see another Jomandi story,'' he says,
referring to the city's flagship African-American theater, which
cut short its current season due to financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a natural creative affinity between technology workers
and arts enthusiasts, Bacon emphasizes a ground-up approach that
builds audiences, primarily by better communicating what groups
exist and what they're doing.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon, 54, wants to build an ``arts portal,'' which he
alternately describes as a ``really good Web site'' and ``on ramp''
for engaging audiences. Ideally, online visitors will use it to
find event listings, participate in chats, read reviews and learn
about volunteer opportunities with, say, the Metropolitan Atlanta
Arts Fund or the metro chamber's Business Volunteers for the Arts,
a program that trains professionals to be efficient nonprofit
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to have the community-oriented site up and running by
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The portal is a natural way to ``speak'' to the local tech work
force, which, Bacon says, numbers between 160,000 and 190,000
people under age 35.
</P>
<P>
   ``These young folks we're talking about have plenty of money,
and they're happily willing to spend that money on meaningful arts
participation,'' says Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money is not an issue. It's just getting them there and
helping them be aware of it. Then their employers will see these
people going to Jomandi or Dad's Garage or wherever, and they'll
see them coming back to work re-energized and happy. They'll see
them staying with the company, which is the biggest issue that
technology folks face today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bacon frequently cites Dad's Garage Theatre Company, a
shoestring troupe specializing in off-the-wall improvisation, as an
example of the cutting-edge creativity that appeals to the dot-com
generation.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Dad's Garage has one of the more active
arts group Web sites in town. The company gets 20,000 hits per
month at www.dadsgarage.com, according to artistic director Sean
Daniels. He says half the theater's 30,000 tickets sold this season
were purchased online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Web site is our main marketing tool,'' says Daniels, whose
company operates on a $250,000 budget.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being updated daily, the Web site features an online
improv soap opera, ``Scandal,'' which visitors can participate in
by typing in a message. (A recent entry: ``I think Dr. Weeds is
even more handsome with his gruesome open wound, it draws attention
away from his face.'')
</P>
<P>
   The theater's Web site is sponsored by MindSpring, and Daniels
says the contribution amounts to ``about $2,500 worth of free Web
space and free accounts for our staff.''
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, MindSpring gets free tickets for employees to Dad's
Garage improv shows. ``We let them come here and blow off steam and
shout and yell,'' Daniels says. ``And they go back to work as
happier MindSpring employees.''
</P>
<P>
   In a burst of e-theater ambition, Dad's Garage is planning to
mount Web cams in its steel-roofed theater to broadcast next year's
annual fund-raiser in its entirety _ 25 1/2 hours of nonstop
improvisation _ over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Considering all this interactivity, it's no surprise that
Daniels, 27, has joined Bacon on the Arts &AMP; Business Council.
Daniels loves Bacon's portal idea. ``We (Dad's Garage) have our
own, but as far as everyone else goes, it's really hard to figure
out what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   A sophisticated portal unifying the arts community might also
spark fund-raising. It's important to connect with these tech-world
fans before they're ``zillionaires,'' Bacon says, by inventing new
ways for them to contribute financially, and electronically, to
arts groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these young people have stock options'' _ Iterated
employees do _ ``and some will be worth a lot of money,'' Bacon
says. ``Why shouldn't we invent simple processes that let them
allocate even a tiny portion of their options to some fund that
goes to support the arts?''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone can certify the arts' new clout in the business world,
it's Ellen Meyer, president of the Atlanta College of Art.
</P>
<P>
   With Internet firms looking for designers, ACA students are more
employable than ever. More than half the students major in fields _
video, digital art, computer animation _ relating to technology. If
they're not being hired by local dot-coms, they're moving to
Silicon Alley and Silicon Valley. The animation chief and senior
art director from George Lucas' Industrial Light &AMP; Magic spent a
day on campus last month reviewing student portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyberspace is a visual world,'' Meyer says, ``and that's
wonderful for our students, because it creates a creative ground
for them. These two worlds are really coming together _ art and
design and business and technology. As they do, art becomes a full
player at the table alongside other business concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Often in the shadow of other Woodruff Arts Center divisions _
the Alliance Theatre, the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, the High
Museum of Art _ the art college has new celebrity thanks, in part,
to the new technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden we're kind of hot,'' says Sallie Adams Daniel,
chairwoman of the college board and senior vice president at Bank
of America. ``I see us as the way that the Woodruff Arts Center is
going to relate to the high-tech community.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the growth of Atlanta business depends on the
quality of the arts scene?
</P>
<P>
   More than one local high-tech executive says that to attract and
retain creative, highly skilled technology workers, Atlanta needs
to be known as more than a major-league locker room for
professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent interview at his office, Bacon points out to a
cluster of employees. ``The people you'll find here are not the
stereotypical, bare-torsoed, painted-up sports fan,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we love to go to baseball games and whatever. But
these people are looking for more than just sports. Of that, we're
certain. We've got musicians. We've got performers. We have
artists. When they leave work, they're going to go find a great
jazz group or go to the symphony. They'll do all kinds of things
before they choose to go to a hockey fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey Burgoom, 31, a program manager at Iterated Systems who has
sung with the Atlanta Symphony Chorus, among other vocal groups,
puts the tech community's interests in a simple light. ``People
like being part of an exciting, international, eclectic
community,'' he says. ``A lot want to do different things, use
other parts of their brains.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta doesn't yet have the reputation of a major arts haven.
Struggling institutions such as Jomandi and the Marietta/Cobb
Museum of Art face uncertain futures. Earlier this year, three
outgoing arts leaders _ Ned Rifkin of the High Museum, Chris
Coleman of Actor's Express and Harriet Sanford of the Fulton County
Arts Council _ publicly questioned the business community's
interest in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   Sour grapes or wake-up call?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, some business people in the technology sector
suggest Atlanta's low profile in the arts dampens their prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I've heard (from recruits) is, there's nothing to do
here; it's just a big void,'' says Beverly McDonald, a partner at
Socket PR, a high-tech public relations firm in Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   At an economic forum in March at the metro chamber, McDonald
talked about interviewing people around the country who balked at
coming here due to the perceived arts climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hit home hard,'' she says. ``I feel their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Socket has formed an in-house group to examine how
company employees might assist arts organizations of their choice.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Levine Hartz, community relations director of iXl
Enterprises, says the Internet service and consulting company has
had no problem luring out-of-town workers, citing the area's usual
strong points _ nice weather, good place to raise a family.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if the arts community erodes further,'' she says, ``that's
one more strike against us. Just as traffic is a strike against
us.''
</P>
<P>
   At the economic forum, Iterated Systems' Bacon described
technology's track record for arts support as ``abysmal.''
</P>
<P>
   The nascent collaboration between arts and technology bodes
well, but tech gurus and art lovers such as Adler and Bacon say the
city has not yet arrived as a cultural destination.
</P>
<P>
   Says Bacon: ``Clearly, the money's here. We just need to get
hooked up better. You parachute into San Francisco, Boston, even
Cleveland, and you can't miss the arts. We don't have that quite
yet. We have to help make the arts more physically, tangibly
present, so that when you parachute in, you say, `Wow, this is a
cool place; I want to be here.' We need to work on that.''

BOSNIAN IN NEW YORK ROCKS SARAJEVO WITH ONE HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

(Nathan Hegedus is a master's degree candidate at the Graduate
School of Journalism at Columbia University.) 
 By NATHAN HEGEDUS   
 c.2000 Columbia News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina _ The young radio executive and the
disk jockey stared wistfully at the folk dancers on the club's dark
stage. As the dancers rehearsed to a familiar accordion tune, the
two observers thought about another time in this same club, a time
that seems a world away _ the time when Darko Jelisic lit up this
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darko always had too much energy,'' said Zoran Catic, 29, the
general manager of eFM, a popular student radio station. ``The
girls were crazy for him. His band, Major, was the best `demo' band
in Sarajevo. Everyone knew them.'' A sadness crept into his voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war stopped everything,'' shrugged his companion, Lejla
Omeragic.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 miles away, in a cramped Manhattan rehearsal
studio, Darko Jelisic grabs a roll of duct tape and a drumstick.
With one hand, he deftly wraps the tape around the drumstick, then
attaches it to the stub that is his other hand _ tattooed one at
that. He slowly builds the layers of silvery tape until the
drumstick is an extension of his limb. Then he swings his arms in a
controlled frenzy, pounding out the beat with his three band
members.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Jelisic, 30, will be in his home recording studio,
wailing on his guitar, this time with his stump taped firmly to a
pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do regular rock and roll, straight,'' the shaggy-haired
musician says emphatically. ``I'm born with that. That's my
style.''
</P>
<P>
   But although he lives and performs in New York, Jelisic's real
music scene is still in his homeland. He had been a rising star in
Bosnia in the early 1990's, but put his music career on hold to
help the Bosnian Army fight Serbian forces in 1992. On patrol on
Christmas Day 1992, he spied an object on the ground and
unthinkingly picked it up. It was a piece of a cluster bomb.
Jelisic's right hand was blown off. He was 22.
</P>
<P>
   In search of a prosthesis to replace his lost limb, Jelisic
arrived in the United States in 1993. Life in America, however, was
hardly easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``My English was like zero,'' he says. I couldn't even wash
dishes. Nobody gave me a chance. I worked sissy jobs like in a
flower shop.'' Only when Jelisic finally connected with local
Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims in New Jersey did he snap out of
his doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't even want to speak his language at first,'' said Joe
Guerriero, a photographer friend of Jelisic. ``Only when he started
to feel more like who he was did he feel comfortable and make
connections. He stopped trying to be American so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Jelisic moved to New York City and earned a two-year college
degree in communications. Frustrated with his prosthesis, he taught
himself to play drums and guitar again. Soon he was playing in
three bands and recording solo, working in a corporate mailroom to
make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising twist has been his renewed popularity in
Sarajevo. This past winter, he sent his self-recorded album,
``Dare,'' to journalists, DJs and friends in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   He was amazed by the buzz. ``All the papers wanted to talk to
me,'' he says. ``I called my Mom, and she said, `Oh, I was just
listening to you on the radio.'''
</P>
<P>
   The album spent six weeks atop the charts of a top Sarajevo
radio station. During a February visit to Sarajevo, his first in
seven years, Jelisic did interviews with magazines and radio shows,
signed a record deal and taped three music videos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Darko was a big surprise for Sarajevo,'' said Jasna Hasovic, a
journalist with a top Bosnian newsmagazine called Dani. ``People
want to re-establish the rock scene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we see Darko,'' she said, ``we remember our life before
the war. It is as if he stayed frozen for these seven years. To see
Darko here in Sarajevo is to see something we have forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Jelisic reaps no financial security from his popularity in
Bosnia, where the pirate industry is the major circulation method
for music. Pirates copy his album and sell it for as little as
$2.50, said Lejla Omeragic. ``Here, everyone makes music only for
fun and art.''
</P>
<P>
   Jelisic said he was overwhelmed by the reaction. He found it
strangely surreal to be the object of adoration in a ravaged land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good time,'' he says. ``I had money, chicks, fame. But
it was plastic, not real. I felt depressed and squeezed into a
little space.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, even while accepting the United States as his home, he
still hungers for acclaim in Bosnia. His next album will be
released there soon, and he is working on a third. ``Before the
war, I tried to be number one,'' he says. ``But I never reached my
full potential. I guess I am trying to do what I couldn't do
before.''  &QL;

MTA PLAN TO BUY FEWER DIESEL BUSES HAS SOME GROUPS STILL FUMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as
desired)  
(Natalie Leston is a master's degree candidate at the Graduate
School of Journalism at Columbia University.) 
 By NATALIE LESTON   
 c.2000 Columbia News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every weekday morning, Samantha Chang rushes to her
bus stop in Staten Island so that she will be near the front of the
line. But she isn't just concerned with getting a seat for her
half-hour ride to the World Trade Center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate standing at the end of the line or sitting on the back
of the bus because I can smell the fumes right away and I breathe
in all that black smoke,'' said Chang, 30. ``I would never let my
2-year-old son ride with me on a New York City bus because of all
the fumes.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City's fleet of 4,300 buses is the largest in the
country, transporting 2.2 million people _ more than a third of the
city's population _ each day. In a city that has one of the worst
air quality records in the nation and an asthma rate three times
the national average, all but 100 of its buses are powered by
diesel fuel. After years of debating with environmentalists and
months of negotiating with state lawmakers, the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, which oversees the city's public
transportation, decided in April that 44 percent of all buses
bought under its next capital budget plan will not be powered by
diesel. But the MTA seems to have some reservations about changing
from diesel technology, and some environmentalists say the plan
does not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is indeed a step in the right direction,'' said Chyi
Sun, a researcher at Inform, a New York-based environmental
research group. ``But it's not like the MTA is saying `I realize
the error of my ways' and that diesel is very bad.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 cities, including Los Angeles, Houston, Cleveland
and Phoenix, are converting their bus fleets to natural gas, which
environmentalists say is the best commercially available
alternative to diesel. New York City Transit, one of five MTA
agencies and the operator of the subway and bus systems, now plans
to have 650 natural gas-powered buses by 2005. It also plans to
have 390 hybrid-electric buses using electric motors that draw
current from a small diesel engine. The agency also agreed to
install special pollution traps by 2003 on the exhaust pipes of
every diesel bus in its fleet and to use low-sulfur fuel in the
tanks of all diesel buses.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the MTA proposed keeping 70 percent of its new fleet
diesel-powered. But the state Assembly vetoed that plan. After
negotiations in Albany involving transit officials,
environmentalists, lawmakers and the governor's office, the MTA
agreed to increase the number of natural-gas buses in its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a negotiated plan,'' conceded Albert O'Leary, vice
president of public affairs for New York City Transit.
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials say they have been attempting to find
alternatives to diesel for several years. New York City Transit
says it has put 90 natural-gas buses on the city's streets so far,
with another 134 expected by year's end. But O'Leary said
natural-gas buses are not necessarily the best alternative to
diesel.
</P>
<P>
   Officials point to a study by the Northeast Alternative Vehicle
Consortium, a Boston-based nonprofit agency that conducted a
yearlong test of New York City buses. The study found that buses
powered by natural gas may not be better for the environment than
buses powered by a combination of diesel and electricity. They also
cite a study by the Harvard School of Public Health, which found
that natural-gas buses may spew as much or more pollution as the
most advanced diesel buses. The report concluded that natural-gas
buses produce less soot, but that diesel emits less greenhouse
gases, which contribute to global warming.
</P>
<P>
   But environmental groups say the studies are faulty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTA uses emissions data not from street level monitors,
where the dirty buses are, but from rooftops, where the air is
cleaner,'' said Tom Congdon, program director at the New York
League of Conservation Voters, a nonprofit, political arm of New
York's environmental community.
</P>
<P>
   Transit officials also have argued that natural-gas buses break
down 50 percent more frequently than the diesel models. And the
only natural-gas fueling facility, at the Jackie Gleason Depot in
Brooklyn, has had a host of problems, including a gas leak and two
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd only be able to carry one-half of the number of people
with compressed natural gas buses,'' O'Leary said. ``That would
mean that we would need 8,600 buses in our fleet to accommodate the
same number of riders we do now, and that would create traffic,
which is the biggest source of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wants to point fingers at the MTA, but it is
primarily environmentally friendly. For every person that takes a
bus, you get one less car on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups say it makes no sense for New York City to
pursue the still-developing diesel-hybrid technology when the
cleanliness of natural-gas buses has already been proven.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to using tax money, it seems to us that they
should make the wise solution in investment,'' Congdon said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet O'Leary also pointed out that the city's bus garages would
need to be retrofitted to handle natural gas. It can cost anywhere
from $25 million to $40 million to convert a city bus depot so that
it can refuel and service natural gas safely, he said.
Hybrid-powered buses would not require retrofitting garages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at all the available technology for the one that
gives the greatest benefit at the lowest cost,'' O'Leary said.
</P>
<P>
   New York City Transit said its goal within 10 years is to
develop electric buses that use fuel cells, a technology that would
power buses entirely with devices that make electricity through
chemical reactions rather than combustion. Those buses would
produce no emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental advocates applaud that plan, but many say that
until that technology is developed, they remain committed to
fighting diesel.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you have to do is stand behind a diesel bus in New York
City to see what's going on,'' Congdon said. ``And to see that a
lot more needs to be done right away.''  &QL;

HYPNOTISTS' SUGGESTIONS TAKEN MORE SERIOUSLY

<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's no Svengali and he won't dangle a pocket watch
before your eyes, but Nolan Baer does know how to lull people into
a trance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you like the ocean?'' asks Baer, seated Indian-style in
stocking feet at his Midtown Manhattan office. Then the 44-year-old
hypnotist trips a switch and fills his patient's headphones with
the ebb-and-flow crashing of waves. ``Close your eyes and relax.
Breathe deeply _ inhaaaaale, now exhaaaaale.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes later, the new patient in the reclining chair
emerges from a semiconscious state and wonders what time it is.
Leaving Baer's office, with its triangular Zen clock, framed Hindu
paintings and Native American hand drum on display the visitor
steps into the elevator feeling like he just had a power nap.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have long dismissed hypnotherapy as quackery, but these
alternative specialists have gained new respect in treating bad
habits, phobias and anxiety. They have made inroads as teachers and
doctors at major medical schools and hospitals. In recent years,
they have organized several associations, a guild and a labor
union. They've even established an International Hypnosis Hall of
Fame in Blue Bell, Penn., which features memorabilia and busts of
famous practitioners, says spokeswoman Barbara Muested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hypnosis is misunderstood because of what people see on stage,
television and in old Svengali movies,'' says Stephanie Benoric, a
Manhattan hypnotherapist at The Hypnosis Institute, which offers
training workshops throughout the country. ``Everybody wants to
know, `Will I be controlled? Will I quack like a duck?' People
don't realize its value as a therapeutic tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Ryder, a Manhattan psychologist who uses hypnosis with
patients on a daily basis, says the practice cannot place anyone in
danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one loses control of their conscious being,'' Ryder says.
``You are never unconscious, like a zombie. To the contrary, you
are more conscious and aware of who you are.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a practice with a long history. Some date hypnotism back
several millennia to trance rituals practiced by tribal shamans and
medicine men. Others say it evolved from Austrian physician Franz
Anton Mesmer's use of magnets and relaxation to cure patients in
the late 1700's _ hence the term ``mesmerize'' _ and later from
Sigmund Freud's use of relaxation techniques. But its modern-day
popularity has steadily increased since the 1970's, when society
warmed to alternative therapies, Baer says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a trend of people seeking more holistic,
non-drug, safe treatments,'' Baer says. ``These treatments work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hypnosis sessions usually last between 20 minutes and an hour,
depending on the individual's needs and hypnotic receptiveness. A
single session with a New York City therapist may cost anywhere
from $150 to $1,500, says Benoric of The Hypnosis Institute. Baer
charges $180 for a one-and-a-half to two-hour evaluation and $90
for each one-hour session.
</P>
<P>
   A hypnotherapist will use imagery and deep-breathing techniques
to deeply relax patients to the verge of sleep, then offer helpful
suggestions. In their hypnotic state, patients may consciously
daydream while their unconscious mind receives and employs the
suggestions, Baer says.
</P>
<P>
   Some hypnotherapy patients can break bad habits through the
power of hypnotic suggestion alone, he says, while others work with
the therapists to consciously change negative behavior, such as
avoiding coffee while treating anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   Hypnotherapists who aren't doctors or psychologists _ called
``lay therapists'' _ generally avoid treating patients for serious
physical conditions unless the therapy complements a licensed
doctor's care. They stick to smoking-cessation, weight-loss and
anxiety treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to want to be hypnotized in order for it to work,''
Baer says. ``That's the only requirement.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he admits, ``I'm not sure anybody knows how it really
works.''
</P>
<P>
   A National Institutes of Health panel of 12 neutral medical
specialists presented research in 1995 that found ``strong evidence
for the use of hypnosis in alleviating pain associated with
cancer.'' The panel also suggested that hypnosis can effectively
treat other conditions, such as tension headaches and irritable
bowel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   Now the American Medical Association is calling for new research
to evaluate the effectiveness of hypnosis and other alternative
therapies. It advises doctors routinely to ask patients about their
use of these alternatives and encourages education about
nontraditional medical practices. A January article in the Medical
Students Journal of the American Medical Association suggests
hypnosis is more effective than placebo, but it works best for
those with the greatest ability to relax.
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on the new recognition, hypnotherapists have
organized their own labor union to preserve hypnotherapy as a
distinct, separate practice from other alternative therapies. About
7,000 practitioners belong to the National Hypnotists Guild, which
started a labor union in 1994 that now has 400 members. The
National Federation of Hypnotists, or NFH 104, is part of the
AFL-CIO's Office and Professional Employees International Union. It
supports licensing or regulation _ but on the union's terms, says
union secretary Ed Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Hypnotherapists' training varies from a few hours and
certification to years of medical school, licenses and academic
degrees. Licensed doctors and psychologists use hypnosis to treat a
variety of medical conditions, from easing pain and nausea
associated with cancer patients' chemotherapy to slowing the
debilitating effects of multiple sclerosis, says Ed Hightower, the
NFH 104 chapter chairman in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Forms of hypnosis are even being taught in major medical
schools. Dr. Herbert Benson, for example, teaches ``relaxation
response procedures'' at Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Benson says he does not teach hypnotherapy per se, but he likens
it to other practices, including yoga, Tai Chi and meditation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a marked overlap with hypnotherapy,'' Benson says,
``but hypnotherapy is just one of scores of procedures that take
you to the same place - a physiological state of quietude.''  &QL;

SUMMIT MEETING SPURS HOPE FOR KOREAN-AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times Syndicate/News Service clients as

<P>
   The last time Harry Bang saw his sister Yong-hi, she was 20 and
living with her husband and two young boys near Bang's birthplace
in what is now North Korea. That was 55 years ago. Today, Bang, 71,
acknowledges from his home in Oakland, Calif., that he doesn't know
much else about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know whether she's sick, or even alive,'' he said.
``I'm very eager to find out, and very sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Bang's lack of knowledge about his sister can be traced to a
decision more than a half century ago to attend a middle school in
the southern part of the country. At the time, the Korean War was
raging. By the time it was over, the Korean peninsula was divided
along ideological lines and the 38th parallel. Travel and
communication between the communist north and democratic south were
severed, as were ties not only between Bang and his sister, but
also between relatives in 10 million other families.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a recently announced summit meeting between the leaders of
the North and South Korean governments is giving Bang and other
Korean-Americans around the country new cause for hope. The
meeting, the first between heads of state of the two countries, is
to include discussions on issues that divide the two Koreas,
including reunification of separated families, economic cooperation
and political reconciliation. It is scheduled to take place in the
Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, from June 12 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   That pleases Marn J. Cha, a Korean-American professor of
political science at California State University, Fresno, who is
the founder of International Separated Families Coalition, a group
that helps Americans of Korean descent locate relatives in North
Korea. Cha estimates there to be at least 100,000 Korean-Americans
with relatives in North Korea. While he says that some may have
been able to visit them during brief, highly orchestrated meetings
granted by the North Korean government, none have been able to
visit the country freely, and many, like Bang, haven't had any
contact at all in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   The summit meeting, Cha said, is a ``breakthrough'' that ``will
likely allow unfettered visits to North Korean relatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Family reunification is not the only positive outcome of the
summit meeting for Korean-Americans that Cha predicts. He said it
is likely that Korean-Americans will no longer be stigmatized by
South Korea for making trips to visit relatives in the north. The
Korean-Americans who have been fortunate enough to travel to North
Korea, Cha said, have long been viewed in South Korea as
``ideologically suspect.'' On occasion, visas to enter South Korea
are denied because of prior visits to North Korea, he said. With
the summit, Cha said he hopes ``that kind of suspicion will be
lifted away.''
</P>
<P>
   Yongmok Kim, a retired Korean-American professor of modern
far-east history at California State University, Los Angeles and
the University of Southern California, said the meeting will also
allow Korean-Americans to draw more freely on a historical
strength: the ability to act as mediator between the two countries.
``North and South Korea have many things they don't want to lose
face on because they've been in confrontation for five decades,''
Kim said. ``Korean Americans can play the role of a good-faith
mediator. The summit meeting might give them more leverage to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But to Eung Pyo Choi, the 68-year-old Korean-American owner of a
bookstore on West 32nd Street, the heart of New York's Koreatown,
the meeting has a more sentimental resonance. ``We need this summit
meeting to unify Korea,'' Choi said. ``Everyone wants reunification
because North and South Koreans, we all have the same language and
the same culture. We are the same people.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim, however, plays down the likelihood of the summit bringing
about change as significant as reunification, citing what he views
as the narrow political motivations behind it. Kim said that the
North Korean leader, Kim Jung II, is agreeing to the meeting
primarily to secure aid for his country's ailing economy. According
to a South Korean government estimate, North Korea's per capita
income in 1998 amounted to only $573 against $6,823 in South Korea;
and South Korea does about as much trade in two or three days as
the North does in the whole year.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Kim said, the South Korean leader, Kim Dae Jung,
could have his eye on the Korean legislative elections as much as
any lasting peace. ``I think this meeting could be more or less a
getting acquainted session more than anything else,'' Kim said.
</P>
<P>
   For Bang, the thought that the summit won't reunite him with his
sister is hard to fathom. ``I very much try to eliminate that sad
idea from my mind,'' he said. ``I hope, I pray to see her before I
die. For the first time since the Korean War, I think I will.''  &QL;

E-COMPANIES HELP ONLINE RETAILERS DEAL WITH MANY UNHAPPY RETURNS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's no secret that e-tailers have problems
delivering goods. But they don't do much better with returns,
either.
</P>
<P>
   With skimpy staffs and few brick-and-mortar outlets, many online
shops don't have the internal resources to receive and inspect
customer returns _ or the savvy to figure out how to make some
money by reselling the returned products, as real-world retailers
do.
</P>
<P>
   So who are the retailers turning to for solutions? Other
dot-coms, of course.
</P>
<P>
   A new wave of online startups has sprung up to provide ``reverse
logistics'' services to e-commerce sites. Some companies offer
``outsourcing,'' taking control of the whole return process for
online retailers. They offer warehouse space to receive returns and
systems to track them. Other firms are designing high-powered
logistical software for bigger e-tailers that want control over
their own returns process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of pain associated with e-commerce for
e-tailers,'' said Brian Farley, Corporate Comptroller at
ReturnView.com, an Irvine, Calif., startup. ``We're hoping to help
e-tailers better manage the void of returns, or their consumers
lose interest in purchasing online.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for online retail. Global e-commerce
spending is estimated to grow to $1.3 trillion by 2003, from $111
billion last year, according to International Data Corp. of San
Jose, Calif. Meanwhile, e-tailers processed nearly $2 billion in
returns in 1999 _ and that figure is expected to jump more than 500
percent by 2004, according to Forrester Research, a market-research
firm based in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Managing returns well is a key part of keeping customers happy.
Numerous studies show that customers strongly consider the
complications of returning the product before purchasing it online.
And so far, catalog companies that also do business online _ not
e-tailers _ have the highest rates of online customer satisfaction
when it comes to order deliveries and returns, according to a
recent survey by Shop.org and Boston Consulting Group. This is
because catalog companies were well-equipped to handle merchandise
returns before they started selling on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ReturnView, and other firms, are trying to level the playing
field for e-tailers. ReturnView's clients set up their Web sites
with special software so that all return requests go straight to
the outsourcing firm's system, which directs the returns to storage
firms ReturnView has contracts with. When the products arrive at
the warehouses, workers inspect the products and decide what to do
with them: return them into inventory, return them to the original
vendor, or refurbish them for resale in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   All of this automation provides insight into customers' return
habits for ReturnView's clients, said Farley, which e-tailers can
use to streamline their own sales and operations. The site launched
in March and is still in talks with potential clients, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Return Exchange offers the same services as ReturnView, but
takes them a step further. The Santa Ana, Calif., company can sell
returned and refurbished products through its own online auction
directly to consumers. And, like ReturnView, the Return Exchange
can offer its clients a mine of data on customer return habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to be a one-stop shop for the e-tailers,'' said
Claudine Mabini, a spokesperson for Return Exchange, which was
launched in February.
</P>
<P>
   One company, Ireturnit.com of Austin, Texas, plans to offer a
different model for outsourcing. Instead of handling returns for
e-clients at the clients' own sites, Ireturnit wants to offer one
catchall site where users can go to return products for a variety
of companies. Users will be guaranteed a full refund for using
Ireturnit's site, says Roland Galang, Ireturnit's business
development manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very attractive for the consumer,'' Galang said. ``As a
venture capital-backed deal, we're willing to take the underwriting
risk for the company. We justify it as a marketing expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Other firms are trying to let e-tailers handle returns on their
own. Several months ago, Yantra, of Acton, Mass., introduced
PureEcommerce 2.0 _ software that tracks goods from companies to
customers and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1995, Yantra started out designing software for
warehouses and inventory management. But nine months ago, Yantra
re-tooled its software to support Internet-based inventory
management, targeting burgeoning online retailers, said a Yantra
spokesperson. It currently has about 20 clients and over 200
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The market for reverse logistics for dot-coms is so appealing
that some bricks-and-mortar companies are jumping into the game.
Take Marketing Out-of-the-Box. Founded in 1991, the Niles, Ill.,
company focused on traditional clients until 1997, when it broke
into e-commerce. Now e-clients outnumber real-world businesses 3 to
1, says David Newberger, the company's founder.
</P>
<P>
   Being a bricks-and-mortar business means MOTB doesn't have to
outsource its warehouse operations, unlike most online
reverse-logistics firms. MOTB employees receive and inspect the
returned product, and determine why it was returned. If it's
saleable, MOTB puts it back into the client's inventory of
products. If it can't be sold again or is damaged but can be
refurbished, MOTB will either return the product to the vendor, or
dispose of it through secondary market channels, like auctions or
liquidators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Handling returns well is important because the name of the
game is customer acquisition,'' Newberger said. ``You want to
satisfy and keep a customer a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   While e-commerce experts lately have sounded the death knell for
most dot-com e-tailers, business is booming for Newberger's
company. The firm is quadrupling its warehouse and operations space
to 400,000 square feet from 100,000 square feet by mid-May.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's for real,'' said Newberger. ``We have a new client each
week, some business-to-business, some business-to-consumer.''  &QL;

<P>
   A jury in East Texas has sentenced a man to 16 years in prison
for stealing a candy bar worth less than a dollar, an example of
how the state with the highest incarceration rate in the country is
cracking down on habitual criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Payne III, 29, was on parole for felony theft when he
was caught shoplifting a ``Super Size'' Snickers bar from a
convenience store in the town of Tyler in December.
</P>
<P>
   A misdemeanor shoplifting conviction normally carries a maximum
$500 fine and no jail time. But since Payne had a criminal record,
including seven convictions for theft, and was on parole, the
district attorney was able under Texas law to charge him with a
felony. Assistant District Attorney Jodi Brown, who tried the case,
could have asked for a sentence of 20 years in prison. Instead she
asked the jury for 16, more than most violent offenders receive in
the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message from this case is that regardless of the value of
the item stolen, a habitual criminal reaches the point where a jury
and a prosecutor say enough is enough,'' said Jack Skeen, district
attorney for Smith County.
</P>
<P>
   Some legal experts said that is just the law of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if East Texas has tougher laws, just tougher
lawyers,'' said George Dix, a law professor at the University of
Texas in Austin, referring to state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is second only to California in the number of state
prisoners it houses. But for every 100,000 people in Texas, some
700 are incarcerated, compared with nearly 500 for every 100,000 in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 90's Gov. Ann Richards began building new state
prisons, tripling the number of beds by 1994. Prosecutors began
pushing for plea bargains, which decreased the average amount of
time prisoners spent behind bars but increased the number of
prisoners. State legislators passed tougher juvenile crime laws,
sending younger offenders to prison and nonviolent offenders to
state jails for shorter sentences. On average, it costs the state
$21,000 a year to house someone in a prison, but a year in a state
jail is around $6,000 less.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, according to Dix, was to send nonviolent offenders
like Payne to state jails and reserve the prisons for inmates
convicted of violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of Payne, the district attorney said the issue
was his record. Since age 16, Payne had been convicted 10 times,
for theft, assault and possession of a controlled substance. He was
in and out of prison for half of his life. In 1993, according to
the district attorney's office, he was sentenced to 10 years for
felony theft and served about four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Enough was enough,'' Skeen said. ``The jury refused to put him
back out on the street after some short period of time to continue
committing criminal offenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Dix said Payne's chances before a jury were not very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the West,'' Dix said. ``We feel very strongly about
citizen justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas is one of only a handful of states that have jury
sentencing, where a panel of peers sentences the defendant, rather
than a judge. Dix said that prosecutors generally expect jurors to
hand down harsher sentences in straightforward cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``East Texas has a reputation of being more stringent, more
strict with criminals,'' Dix said. ``The idea is that jurors will
be more sensitive to these issues than a judge so they'll give them
a stricter sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone agrees that long prison terms will cut down on
crime. State Rep. Toby Goodman, who is both a former prosecutor and
defense lawyer, said Payne's sentence was way over the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would it benefit the state of Texas by throwing this guy
in prison?'' asked Goodman, who is a Republican. ``Yeah, the guy's
a dummy, but what's next _ execution?'' But one of Goodman's peers
in the House thinks Payne deserved the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people just focus on the Snickers Bar then it does seem
silly,'' said State Rep. Will Hartlett, also a Republican. ``But he
was clearly a chronic career criminal. What if they let him out on
parole and he killed someone? He has to be put away before his
crimes get worse and worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Dix said Payne will be required to serve at least four years of
his sentence before being eligible for parole. But Hartlett said he
feels no sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, he got 10 years several years ago for felony theft and
he served about four years,'' Harlett said. ``Now he'll serve out
the rest of that sentence. That's what should have happened in the
first place. Maybe now he'll straighten up in prison.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goodman said Payne received a tough sentence at least in
part because he was in a tough part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Texas is one place in the U.S. that you don't want to
commit a crime, even stealing candy,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ Temperatures in the 70s and creeping humidity were
forecast for early Sunday morning for the men's Olympic marathon
trials. This was not unexpected by Todd Williams, one of the
favorites, who spent much of the last 18 weeks training on a
treadmill in his basement in Knoxville, Tenn., the thermostat
cranked up to 75 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``No window, no fan,'' Williams said. ``Psychotic.''
</P>
<P>
   One of America's top distance runners, a two-time Olympian at
10,000 meters, or 6.2 miles, Williams has been trying to make his
body calloused to the marathon distance of 26.2 miles. For his two
previous marathons, he concentrated on speed work but ran out of
gas in the final two miles, crossing the finish line on fumes in 2
hours 11 minutes 17 seconds at the 1997 Chicago Marathon and in
2:14:56 at the 1999 Chicago Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   He has since realized that he needed more endurance training.
So, preparing for the trials, he did six two-hour runs on his
treadmill, using the soft running surface to cushion against injury
and the basement thermometer to acclimate himself to the expected
heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also think it made me a little bit crazy,'' Williams said.
``When I hit the 20-mile mark, I'll think back to all the sacrifice
I made running for two hours on the treadmill, and I think I'll be
able to push through the pain a little bit more.''
</P>
<P>
   His basement was the toasty equivalent of the reptile house at
the zoo. The Dungeon, his friends call it. It comes complete with
bathroom, shower, bedroom, weight room and treadmill. Williams
trained and slept downstairs while his wife, Stephanie, and their
two daughters, Brooke, who is 3, and Bailee, who is 10 weeks, lived
upstairs. Some runners go to the mountains for isolation, some go
overseas. Williams went to his carpeted dungeon, where the
entertainment ranged from ESPN to the cartoon adventures of Scooby
Doo. He watched entire college and professional basketball games
while running in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I live as hard as I can possibly live and sacrifice
and do things I think are going to help,'' said Williams, who is 31
and has a psychology degree from the University of Tennessee. ``I
put everything in this basket. I told my wife I needed to get a PO
box at the back door, so I can get my mail delivered down there.''
</P>
<P>
   There was particular urgency for speed this weekend. The Olympic
A qualifying standard was 2:14. Among Americans, only David Morris
and Joe LeMay met the standard during the qualifying period for the
2000 Games in Sydney, Australia. For Williams to make the Olympic
team, he had to win Sunday's trials, or finish in the top 3 under
2:14. Here, things got complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he would renounce an Olympic bid if he won
Sunday's trials but did not meet the A standard. Essentially, he
was protesting against the American selection process, which said
that only the winner of the trials would go to Sydney if the
first-place runner finished slower than 2:14 and was someone other
than Morris and LeMay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think someone needs to make a stand,'' said Williams, who
stood to relinquish $75,000 in prize and bonus money if he
renounced a victory on Sunday. ``I don't think it's fair for guys
who killed themselves in November and December to run the
qualifying time and not to get to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He could make all this moot, of course, by running faster than
2:14, which he planned to do regardless of smothering heat and
humidity. Needing more stamina in his legs after finishing the
final two miles of the 1999 Chicago Marathon at a depleted
six-minute pace, Williams began an endurance program this year that
called for runs up to 2 hours 26 minutes indoors and 2:45 outdoors.
One outdoor workout consisted of a four-mile warm-up, the running
of stadium steps, three track repeats of 2,000 meters at 5:55 pace,
more stadium steps, a 10-mile run at six-minute pace, three more
repeats of 2,000 meters, stadium steps and a warmdown run of four
miles.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, Williams has suffered from a stitch in his right
side during races. The problem, he said, occurred in membranes
supporting his liver. He has attempted to resolve the situation by
exhaling when his left foot strikes the ground, which, he said, was
less jarring on his liver. On Sunday, he also planned to have an
injection of Xylocaine to numb his right side.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, he walked into a discount store and bought 17 baby
bottles with pop-up straws to use as containers for his sports
drink on the race course. ``They looked at me like I was crazy,''
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   If his grueling, eccentric methods did not result in a berth in
the Olympics, Williams said, it would be a long time before he
tried another marathon. But he would not allow himself any negative
thoughts. Regardless of the temperature, he planned to run a
succession of 5:05 miles, hoping to run the last mile as fast as he
ran the first. That way, Williams would run under 2:14 and most
likely qualify for an all-expenses-paid trip to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either trained for it or you didn't,'' he said. ``They
won't be handing out any tissues to wipe your tears at 10K (10,000
kilometers). We've got to go for it.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cardinal John O'Connor reached out to countless people, as a
priest, a counselor, and above all, a human being. Those whose
lives were touched by the cardinal remembered a compassionate man
who listened, intently and carefully, a man whose active presence
was as memorable as his eminence.
</P>
<P>
   COMFORT FOR A FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when John Winters, an usher, was killed in St.
Patrick's Cathedral by a deranged homeless man, O'Connor rushed to
comfort the survivors in a way that has stayed with the victim's
son, the Rev. Sean Winters, 45, a priest in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal called the family, counseled them, arranged for a
police escort to the cemetery, brought them a papal blessing from
Rome, and sent flowers to Winters' widow, Rita, each Christmas,
Easter and anniversary of the murder until her death seven years
later.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal presided at Winters' funeral. ``He said my father
was a real hero, a martyr,'' for trying to save a police officer
who was also attacked that night, Winters said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew him at that time as a very sensitive, good priest.
That's what a good priest does,'' said Winters, who works as a
hospital chaplain in the Diocese of Metuchen. ``That had a very
profound impact on my life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I learned from the cardinal was that ministry of
presence, to be with people who are in tremendous emotional or
physical pain,'' Winters said.
</P>
<P>
   INSPIRATION TO HELP OTHERS
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Bell, 42, head of a New Jersey nonprofit group,
remembers the exact date the cardinal was installed in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that moment I was actually contemplating starting a home
for homeless mothers and children, and hearing him, I was further
encouraged and felt inspired to do that,'' he recalled. The
following year, almost to the day, Bell helped open the Good
Counsel Home for Mothers and Children in Hoboken, N.J. The agency
now has seven homes, serving 100 mothers and babies nightly. The
cardinal helped Bell by writing to donors on behalf of Good
Counsel, giving grants from the Cardinal's Fund for Children,
offering Bell the occasional fatherly pat on the back, and being
the host of a breakfast for 40 supporters last year when the
cardinal was so ill he had canceled all outside appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt his encouragement particularly when he said _ and he
repeated this _ that any pregnant woman from anywhere, regardless
of her situation, and where she was from, and how she got pregnant,
can get help in the diocese of New York,'' Bell said. ``I knew he
was talking specifically to me, because that's what we do, and he
encouraged me to do more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time he opened his mouth, he had something that struck
me to my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   GUIDING HAND FOR A PRIEST
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Frank Pavone, 41, head of Priests for Life, an
anti-abortion group on Staten Island, remembers entering St.
Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers the first year O'Connor spent in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took his own responsibility for ordaining us very
seriously,'' Pavone said, recalling how the cardinal invited all 50
seminarians to his residence once a month for mass and social time.
</P>
<P>
   ``By listening to him, I learned so much of what I have learned
about how to preach, how to communicate the church's teaching with
compassion and with clarity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we would hear him speak in St. Patrick's Cathedral, and
there were racial tensions erupting in the city, he would say,
`Folks, what this means for us is that we cannot be good Catholics
and at the same time be racist. One excludes the other.' And I came
away, at the end of it not just knowing what a particular verse of
the Bible said, but here's how I have to respond to what's going on
in today's headlines _ here's how I can gauge how I'm living a
Christian life.''
</P>
<P>
   A BRIDGE BETWEEN FAITHS
</P>
<P>
   Sandi Merle, 59, who describes herself as ``just a Jewish kid
from Paterson, N.J.,'' counted the cardinal as her best friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago he absolutely changed my life around,'' said
Merle, who now lives on the West Side of Manhattan. She had
experienced clinical death after heart surgery, and she needed to
understand why she had been spared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of going to my rabbi, I went to my cardinal, because
he is the wisest man I have ever known,'' she said. ``He did help
me find what it was I was spared for _ to have a more active role
in Jewish-Catholic dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   When doctors diagnosed a brain aneurysm in Merle's goddaughter
two years ago, the cardinal began writing and calling the child,
and kept her picture on his desk. Even when he was sick last
summer, he drove 185 miles to spend an hour and a half with her,
and gave her a Kiddush cup, or wine goblet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `This way you and I can think of each other every
Friday night when we make the prayer over the wine,''' Merle
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Merle met the cardinal at a reception given by the New York
Board of Rabbis, when he first came to New York. She was moved to
tears by an anti-abortion comment he made in the receiving line,
and he comforted her.
</P>
<P>
   ``From that day on, I would go out of my way to go to functions
where I knew he was being honored, and even to attend Mass, which
was very peculiar for me. But it was his homily I was interested
in. I learned more about both our faith groups from listening to
him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She valued his sense of humor, even when ill. When he was
recovering from pneumonia recently, she took him a package. ``I
said, `I brought the chicken soup you love, for your pneumonia,'
and he said `Oh really? What did you bring for me?'''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before he died, the cardinal called Merle to him, and
asked her to promise to continue working to bring Catholics and
Jews together. Later, she found out from Mother Agnes Mary Donovan,
who works near the cathedral, that the cardinal had asked for the
promise for her sake, not his.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was worried about you, because you don't have the same
theology of death as we do,'' Merle remembers Mother Agnes telling
her. ``He was worried, and said keep an eye on Sandi, don't let her
fall apart.'' The cardinal knew that if Merle made a promise to
him, she would keep it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This eminence, this towering figure of God's best creation _
this was God's best work.''

SPORTS COLUMN: COREY JOHNSON HAS PROVIDED SUPPORT TO ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Conn., N.Y., Pa.)   By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the time Corey Johnson came out to the world last week, he
had already come out to most everyone who mattered to him _ his
parents, sister, best friend, teachers, football coach and
teammates _ in a gradual, sometimes orchestrated process that
lasted more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   So, the hundreds of thousands who cheered the linebacker at the
Millennium March for Equality in Washington last Sunday were just
another big-game crowd. Of course, they all seemed to want to shake
his hand and tell him their life stories, if not option his life
story, date him or sign him up as spokesman for their gay
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was chasing me,'' Johnson said in the middle of last
week, sounding tired but still floating on a celebrity high. It was
late at night in his Middleton, Mass., home and he was just back
from one of his part-time jobs, as a secretary in a real-estate
agency. ``I'm weighing offers. After I graduate next month, I'd
like to travel, check out some colleges for the year after and
think about the book and movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten days ago, Johnson turned 18, and he is the activist
equivalent of the teen-age National Basketball Association draftee,
a Kobe with a mission. As the first high school football captain to
declare his homosexuality so publicly, he immediately proved, as he
put it, that ``you don't have to do drama or be a drum major to be
gay.''
</P>
<P>
   The early response to his formal coming-out announcement, on the
front page of The New York Times last Sunday, was an avalanche of
e-mail messages to the Times Web site or to me at, as you must
remember, Thelipsite(at)aol.com (all of them were forwarded to
Coreyjohnson2000(at)aol.com). Most expressed appreciation to
Johnson for giving them hope; some had been closeted high school
athletes and remembered the pain and shame of secrecy. Johnson's
high school, Masconomet, was singled out for the quality of its
teachers, coaches and students, not to mention its long-term
commitment to diversity training.
</P>
<P>
   There is a feel-good aspect to this story for straights, who can
feel big-hearted and progressive, and for gay men and lesbians, who
can feel that their world is becoming safer. Without diminishing
those feelings, it's also useful to remember that Corey's Coming
Out didn't just happen. A high school community (not quite
unanimously) rallied around a handsome, popular star jock, not a
scrawny, vulnerable band member. The school had a Gay Straight
Alliance in place with two advisers, one of them a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   The Masconomet administration brought in the Gay Lesbian and
Straight Education Network, which has a contract with the Safe
Schools program of the state of Massachusetts (which has two openly
gay members of Congress). The stars were in their courses on this
one; think about a star football player even trying to come out
under Friday night lights in Texas. Or in a New York City public
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Dan Woog, a 47-year-old openly gay assistant
soccer coach at Staples High School in Westport, Conn., where he
once played, thinks that Corey Johnson will ``give courage to the
kid out there'' who may someday really shatter the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the one who will make the difference is going to be a
superstar who comes out in high school, and the country follows him
to Division I, then to the pros, and the all-star game and the
league championship,'' Woog said.
</P>
<P>
   Woog, author of ``Jocks: True Stories of America's Gay Male
Athletes,'' published two years ago by Alyson Books, was on the Gay
Lesbian Straight Education Network panel led by Jeff Perrotti where
Johnson first asked for help in coming out. He thinks Johnson's
story brings up an important coaching issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got an athlete in the closet, you've got an athlete
who can't fully concentrate,'' Woog said. ``Coaches have to make a
safe, accepting environment for all kids, gay kids, poor kids, kids
with the wrong sneakers, fat kids. In my workshop, I try to
convince coaches it's not just the right thing to do, it'll show up
in their wins and losses.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gallagher, 43, who was a star at Valhalla (N.Y.) High and a
varsity tackle at the University of Pittsburgh, thinks he would
have been a far better football player if he had been able to come
to terms with his sexuality. He might even have done better in his
Jets tryout, although he was up against Mark Gastineau. He
certainly would not have, at the age of 28, after his first
homosexual experience, climbed to the top of the Kensico Dam,
overlooking his high school field, and thrown himself off.
Gallagher's neck was broken. He is a quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, founder of Alive To Thrive (aliv2thriv(at)aol.com)
and author of the semiautobiographical ``Johnny In The Spot''
(1stBooks, 1998), often speaks at high schools. He says he sees too
many kids struggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``That coach you idolize tries to motivate you with anti-gay
slurs,'' Gallagher said, ``and you wonder what he's telling you, if
he's seeing through you. This Corey is a pioneer, a leader, but
he's up against the hypocritical right-wing hatemongers who want to
punish people for being human. I say there are no straights or
gays, just `strays.'''

GIULIANI'S ESTRANGED WIFE CALLS THEIR MARRIAGE `VERY PRECIOUS' 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donna Hanover said Saturday that her marriage to
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was ``very precious'' to her, as she spoke
publicly for the first time since the mayor disclosed he had
prostate cancer and acknowledged a friendship with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   In an unlikely setting, at the back entrance of St. Patrick's
Cathedral, Hanover held a news conference before she joined
thousands of mourners to pay her respects to Cardinal John O'Connor
early Saturday afternoon. She arrived with a phalanx of staff
members, who had notified news organizations in advance that she
would make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate all the love and kind thoughts that so many
people have sent me and my children during these difficult days,''
said Hanover, wearing a black suit and appearing pale.
</P>
<P>
   Trembling perceptibly, Hanover said, ``I will be supportive of
Rudy in his fight against his illness, as this marriage and this
man have been very precious to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover and the mayor have led separate lives for the last few
years, and she has not appeared at his side publicly during his
second mayoral term. Their lengthy estrangement, though, drew
considerable attention on Wednesday after The New York Post
published photographs of Judith Nathan, the Upper East Side
resident who has accompanied the mayor to town hall meetings and
other public events in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the photographs were published, Giuliani devoted
the first portion of his news briefing to them. He called her a
``very good friend'' and told reporters in the Blue Room at City
Hall that he hoped they would respect her privacy. Later in the
week, asked specifically whether the friendship was romantic, the
mayor would only say that this was a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the news broke of the mayor's cancer and of his friendship
with Nathan, Hanover's spokeswoman had issued statements but
Hanover had not appeared in public in response to queries.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she would not take any questions from reporters,
and spoke obliquely about the future. ``The well-being and safety
of Andrew and Caroline,'' the couple's 14-year-old son and
10-year-old daughter, ``will be my primary concern in any decisions
that have to be made, as has always been the case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover withdrew days ago from ``The Vagina Monologues,'' an
Off-Broadway play about subjects like orgasm and birth that she and
two other actresses were to begin appearing in on May 30. In a
statement, she cited ``personal family circumstances'' as the
reason for her postponement of the acting role, and the statement
did not mention her husband's name.
</P>
<P>
   As she prepared to enter St. Patrick's on Saturday, she
explained her special bond with the cardinal, who died Wednesday.
Appearing to have difficulty maintaining her composure, her eyes
watering, she said: ``Cardinal O'Connor often told me that my
family was in his prayers. He was a Navy chaplain, and I was raised
in the Navy, and we have that as a special bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to pay my respects, and I will have no further
remarks today,'' she said, then walked up the back stairs, followed
by her staff.

   Expos' Express Stalls
</P>
<P>
   The Montreal Expos seemed to be off to a promising season. Then
they arrived in Colorado. The Expos, with a 14-9 record, should
have been suspicious; the Rockies had just scored 29 runs in a
three-game series with the Mets, even though they lost two of the
games. But Colorado did not lose any of the three games with the
Expos, amassing 43 runs and 55 hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you can't explain it,'' said Jim Beattie, the
Expos' general manager, who was an eyewitness to the series in
Colorado. ``You can explain it. We just didn't pitch well. I don't
know if we go in there and say we can't pitch here. We pitched up.
We hung a lot of sliders, breaking balls, changeups. We didn't
pitch inside well. Jeffrey Hammonds hit a grand slam on an 0-2
fastball. We just didn't locate fastballs. That has nothing to do
with pitching in Denver or anywhere else. We made a lot of bad
pitches. So it's explainable.''
</P>
<P>
   Indians Look to Rebound
</P>
<P>
   The joke could be on the Indians. Frustrated by their failure to
win a World Series, any World Series, the Indians fired Manager
Mike Hargrove and named Charlie Manuel, their hitting coach, to
replace him. General manager John Hart said the team needed a new
voice in the dugout. The problem is that new voice may be lulling
the Indians to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's five-time division champions are struggling through
the kind of start they thought they left behind when they became a
force in the American League six years ago. This season, however,
matches the start they had in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In April of that season, they were not in first place for 17
successive days. Sunday marks the 17th successive day they have not
been in first this season. Their record before Saturday was 13-13,
the same as it was three years ago. The Indians went on that season
to fall two outs short of winning the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   `That's Business'
</P>
<P>
   At 22, Jermaine Dye played in the World Series for the Atlanta
Braves. At 26, Dye is a star for the Kansas City Royals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter what team I'm on, as long as I'm in the big
leagues fulfilling a dream,'' Dye said. ``It would have been nice
to play my whole career in Atlanta, but it didn't work out. Maybe
someday I'll get a chance to go back there, but right now I'm happy
where I am.''
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .281 for the Braves as a rookie in 1996, Dye
figured to be with them for a while. The next year, he recalled, he
had a good spring training and prepared to settle in, especially
after David Justice and Marquis Grissom were traded to Cleveland
late in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to be slotted in to play every day,''
Dye said. ``All of a sudden I got traded.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only two days after the Justice-Grissom trade. ``That's
part of baseball,'' the outfielder said. ``That's business.''
</P>
<P>
   Dye said he did not know how to react to being traded for the
first time, especially at such a young age. But, he added: ``I knew
Kansas City wanted me and liked me a lot. I just needed to go over
there, put on a new uniform and realize I'm on a new team.''
</P>
<P>
   Dye struggled his first two seasons with the Royals; in fact, he
spent part of each season in the minor leagues. But last season he
blossomed into a legitimate major league hitter with a .294 batting
average, 27 home runs and 119 runs batted in. That performance set
him up for what he has done early this season.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the weekend, he led the American League in home runs
(12), doubles (12), slugging percentage (.795), total bases (89)
and extra-base hits (24). He was tied for second in hits (41), tied
for third in runs scored (24), third in runs batted in (29) and
fifth in hitting (.366).
</P>
<P>
   But he was not among the leaders in outfield assists, as he was
last season when his 17 assists were tied for first.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year I don't have any,'' he said. ``This year guys aren't
running on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Deals, Small Numbers
</P>
<P>
   The biggest moves the Cincinnati Reds made during the winter
were the acquisition of Ken Griffey Jr. and Dante Bichette. A year
earlier, they traded for Michael Tucker. Those three players formed
the Reds' starting outfield on opening day. Entering Saturday's
schedule, Griffey was hitting .210, Bichette .219 and Tucker .167.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit did not figure on a .225 average for Juan Gonzalez when
it traded for him and offered him a $140 million contract. But then
Gabe Kapler, who went to Texas in the Gonzalez trade, is hitting
.200. Reggie Sanders was traded to Atlanta and is hitting .139.
Mark McLemore signed with Seattle as a free agent and has a .204
average. Pittsburgh signed Wil Cordero, who is hitting .208.
</P>
<P>
   While Derek Bell floats in the high .300's for the Mets, Roger
Cedeno is hitting .202 for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Some other bad early averages of players who aren't new to their
teams: Tony Clark, .155; Rey Ordonez, .179; Homer Bush, .182; Ray
Lankford, .193; Rickey Henderson, .203; Cliff Floyd, .203; Eric
Karros, .204; and Jose Offerman, .207.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Power Company
</P>
<P>
   Before batters hit 931 home runs this April, the most prolific
April for home runs had come in the 1996 season. If this season
proceeds like that one, the home run frequency is very likely to
slow. That April produced 2.30 home runs a game, but the average
for the entire season wound up at 2.18 a game. This April's average
was 2.56.

 &HT;    TV season made us feel like a million bucks
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``Switzerland!'' she cried.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland? My wife is in another room, watching ``Who Wants to
be a Millionaire,'' shouting out the name of that historically
neutral country.
</P>
<P>
   Weird. She's not generally a shouter, and when she is, she's
generally not shouting out European states. But that's her answer
to a question on ``Millionaire,'' and like so many of us this TV
season, which ends May 24, she's talking directly to the TV, as if
a two-way wire somehow ran from our set directly to Regis Philbin's
ear.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not with her. I'm with my son in the living room, where the
TV is off. We're trying, this once, not to let ``Millionaire'' suck
us in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleeping sickness!'' she cries.
</P>
<P>
   Sleeping sickness? All right, that's it. I'm in. I toss a
catalog on the coffee table, jump off the couch and rush to the
bedroom, where ``Millionaire'' glows on the tube like a votive
candle.
</P>
<P>
   Some guy from somewhere (aren't they all some guy from
somewhere?) has already won $32,000, and Reege's eyes are twinkling
_ partially from that twinkly Irish DNA of his, and partially, I
think, from the reflected sheen of his latest Mafia don wear: dark
suit, darker shirt, shiny dark tie.
</P>
<P>
   My wife's poised for the next question. I am, too. My son
continues to hold out in the living room. When we win our million
tonight, we're cutting him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millionaire'' doesn't usually polarize the family like this.
Just the opposite. When some guy from somewhere won a million
dollars one night (``Cockroach!'' my son shouted incorrectly to the
million-dollar question about which insect shorted an early
computer that led to the term ``computer bug''; it was a moth), the
three of us exploded into a whoop not heard inside the house since
... actually, we had never, ever whooped like that before.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, ``Millionaire'' became so much a part of our nights
together that when we moved in front of the set following dinner
one Wednesday and found some sitcom on instead of ``Millionaire,''
my son looked at me like that paperboy famously looked at Shoeless
Joe Jackson after learning he threw the 1919 World Series (``Say it
ain't so, Joe'') and asked, ``How come it's not on more often?''
</P>
<P>
   I explained that ``Millionaire'' was already on at least three
nights a week, more than any network show not called ``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' he said. ``But how come it's not on every night?''
</P>
<P>
   Good question. There have been better TV seasons than the one
about to conclude, but rarely has there been a funner one, and most
of the credit goes to ``Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   It was as if once a gameshow was unloosed in primetime to became
the most successful program on TV _ ``Millionaire'' will be this
season's three highest rated regular shows, averaging about 29
million viewers _ everything was up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   Katie Couric could show us her colonoscopy on NBC's ``Today''
(during which her doctor declared her ``clean as a whistle!''). CBS
could air ``Fail Safe,'' its first live drama in 39 years (with
more coming next season, can another ``Golden Age'' of live drama
be far behind?). ABC's Peter Jennings could win raves and viewers
(and a Peabody) by anchoring 24 straight hours of globetrotting
millennium coverage, a rare, joyfully optimistic news event that
``Millionaire'' executive producer Michael Davies called a revival
of the variety show _ the next dead genre he expects the networks
to resuscitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter Jennings sat there and said, `Let me show you another
thing,' just as Ed Sullivan used to say, `Now watch this,''' said
Davies. ``I know these news guys don't like to hear that. But Peter
did the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave's heart got a lube job and he returned bigger than Jay.
CBS's Bryant Gumble got a new job on a morning show that virtually
no one watched, and managed to lure even fewer viewers (you do that
math). John McCain made Americans of every stripe care about
televised presidential politics in ``February,'' the Arizona
senator's Straight Talk Express tour bus captivating nightly news
viewers like the enigmatic noodling of Albert Brooks' trailer home
in ``Lost in America.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a TV season that made us talk about TV again _ good, bad,
the worst. We talked about it even as we were supposedly e-chatting
and e-shopping and e-trading all night long. After ratings declines
of three to 10 percent each year since the 1994-95 season, the
major broadcast networks' combined ratings this season are
virtually flat _ chiefly because of ``Millionaire,'' without which
it's estimated the networks would be off about seven percent. In a
media universe that feels splintered beyond recognition, TV felt
warm and bright enough again to reclaim its place as the national
fireplace _ a spot where we could all gather separately to share,
you know, somebody else's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom says TV makes you stupid,'' said Stevie (Craig Lamar
Traylor), the four-eyed, asthmatic, wheelchair-bound best friend on
Fox's ``Malcolm in the Middle,'' the season's only breakout sitcom
(yes, the sitcom is dead).
</P>
<P>
   ``Stupid?'' said a disbelieving Malcolm (Frankie Muniz),the
freshest voice from the American family since Bart Simpson. ``TV
makes you normal!''
</P>
<P>
   Well, normal is stretching it. ``Millionaire'' did have its
collateral damage. Fox's ``Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire?'' was
watched by more people who claimed to hate themselves afterward
than any show in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Rockwell and Darva Conger _ those crazy kids with the
porn-star names who seemed scissored straight from the pages of
Post-Modern Bride. We saw this one coming a mile away and still we
couldn't not watch. They were like wedding cake figurines placed on
America's altar _ a Las Vegas hotel stage _ then brought suddenly
to life by Fox and sicced, Frankenstein-like, on the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marry'' captured perfectly the conflicted nature of our
televised times: We want to see it all, and we want it on record
how bad we think it is to look. Who wants to marry a millionaire?
Hell, we all do. But like ol' what-was-I-thinking Darva, we woke
the next morning to a world-class hangover, with the lyin' lug
snoring right there beside us.
</P>
<P>
   We promised never to drink like that again: The weeks following
that Fox special, when Rick and Darva made their separate,
pre-annulled rounds with Diane and Larry and whoever else asked,
were this season's ritual atonement, a kind of Stations of the
Cross that reminded us just how bad we'd been, and how sorry we
were, and how we would avoid all temptation in the future _ or at
least until the end of this month, when CBS airs ``Survivor,''
which strands 16 strangers on an island and films their attrition.
</P>
<P>
   OTHER NIGHTS, OTHER CHANNELS. ..
</P>
<P>
   The season's most restorative surprise was NBC's ``The West
Wing,'' a political drama created by Aaron Sorkin. He'd also
created ABC's ``Sports Night,'' the laugh-trackless dramedy that
last year promised to redefine the sitcom _ until both it, and the
sitcom, tanked. (Yes, the sitcom is dead. Remember ``Action''?)
</P>
<P>
   ``West Wing'' toted the season's heaviest baggage _ ask Al Gore
about Clinton fatigue _ then strapped politics to a gurney and
turned it into an executive branch of ``E.R.''
</P>
<P>
   As up-to-the-moment and with-it as the show is (Rob Lowe as a
prostitute-dating aide? hel-lo), there's something reassuringly
retro about ``West Wing.'' Its the closest thing we have now to
FDR's old fireside chats. Each week we're let into the White House
to view all the pettiness and meanness and self-interest we can
handle, yet we walk away feeling safely in the committed hands of
engaged, likeable folks who deal with those givens and move on.
</P>
<P>
   ``West Wing'' is a smart, savvy, sometimes even savage antidote
to our blaring talk-show cynicism; McCain's primary-season flare
only confirmed our private longing for this stuff. Martin Sheen, as
President Josiah Bartlet, should get more than a few write-in votes
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Less comfy, but no less effective, was ABC's ``Once and Again,''
the latest chronicle from those baby boom Boswells, Ed Zwick and
Marshall Herskowitz (``thirtysomething,'' ``My So-Called Life'').
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again'' was a hot boomer soap opera dressed up as
middle-class insight. It's genius was in admitting that they're the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   Sela Ward (as separated-with-kids Lily Manning) and Billy
Campbell (as divorced-with-kids Rick Sammler) were the
dimple-chinned faces all divorced-with-kids 40-somethings wish they
had _ or were with. Slinking last season over to the WB's
``Felicity,'' for some teasing sex after TV's youthquake briefly
wiped them from the screen, boomers found that Lily and Rick's
window-steaming, teen-like gropings let them throw off Noel and
Julie and Ben and feel young again, on their own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say young? I meant dirty.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Zwick and Herskowitz were annoyingly dead-on;
the guilt, the panic, the exhaustion of divorced parents was
displayed in such keen-eyed, almost poetic detail, that it spoke to
the whole universe of adults whose lives haven't turned out quite
like they'd figured.
</P>
<P>
   Rick: ``I always had a map for my life. And now, it's like I
walked off it entirely. It's weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Weird _ and self-absorbed. The kids _ teens and tweens _ were
TV's most authentic children since ``My So-Called Life.'' They
nailed that noble, self-aware narcissism of their parents'
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Lily's 14-year-old daughter Grace: ``Why can't they keep their
private lives private, without dragging innocent bystanders into
it?''
</P>
<P>
   Maddening as she could be, Ward's character was the season's
most evolved female _ older, divorced, kids, and still attractive
to attractive men. The fact that she really is beautiful was beside
the point _ Lily's glow came less from her gorgeous,
Sprint-spokeswoman hair than a kind of midlife incandescence. Lily
craved both intimacy and sex while lashed to a world of car pools
and visitation exchanges and dying parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's next week?'' was a comment at my house one night, as we
all stared ahead to hide our watery eyes following another
excruciating episode. ``The pets die?''
</P>
<P>
   Ward was one slim rung farther along the network evolutionary
ladder than Amy Brenneman, who created a winningly heartfelt role
as a harried juvenile court judge and single mom in CBS's ``Judging
Amy.'' And she was two rungs ahead of Kathleen Quinlan, who gave a
harder, more L.A. (and less successful) edge to her lawyering
single mom in CBS's ``Family Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet all three were welcome leaps ahead of Sydney Hansen (Melina
Kanakaredes), the prodigal plastic surgeon returned home in
``Providence,'' last year's surprise chick hit on NBC. Dr. Syd was
a start _ she gave the networks permission to build dramas around
adult female leads. Still, the fear before this season was that all
women would be like her: TV smart, but not one teaspoon more.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise: the smarts of this season's women weren't dumbed down.
And guess what? We fell for them. Hard.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of ``Millionaire'' is its us-ness; it might have
looked like all white males in that hot seat (because, well, mainly
it was; the first black contestant didn't appear until April 23),
but once Reege asked a contestant what the Beaufort scale measured,
for $250,000, that squirmin', outta-lifelines-sweatin' dude
transcended race and gender and became every goofy one of us. (It
measures wind.)
</P>
<P>
   The appeal of HBO's ``The Sopranos'' is its other-ness; it took
us deep into the strange and scary world of suburban New Jersey
mobsters and made us feel right at home. Now we all have an Uncle
Junior; now we all pay off our debts in ``boxes of ziti.''
</P>
<P>
   In its second season, David Chase's ``The Sopranos'' went from
cult favorite to TV's most talked-about show; the season finale's
nine million viewers were the most to watch an original, non-sports
program in HBO's 28-year history. Much of the talk centered on
whether the second season lived up to the first; office workers
engaged in the kind of cross-cubicle debates not heard since the
last years of ``Seinfeld'' (yes, the sitcom is dead).
</P>
<P>
   This season's ``Sopranos'' was at least a worthy sequel, a
frequent stunner bookended by the arrival and departure (two
gunshots to the chest) of dead-eyed Richie Aprile (David Proval),
who replaced Tony's mother Livia (Nancy Marchand) as TV's most
fearsome character.
</P>
<P>
   In between, ``The Sopranos'' sputtered (the first two episodes
spent too much time running in place) and soared: the near-death
experience of Tony's nephew Christopher (Michael Imperioli), during
which he arrived at the gates of hell _ an Irish bar where every
day is St. Patrick's Day _ might have been the series' most
profoundly hilarious scene ever.
</P>
<P>
   But ``The Sopranos,'' with the unmatchable James Gandolfini as
Tony, the mob boss we all would be, was never less than very good.
The honest artistry of it proved _ despite wailing over the demise
of ``Freaks and Geeks'' and ``Sports Night'' and ABC's two-episode
wonder ``Wonderland,'' each brilliant but fatally flawed _ that
there is no such thing as a show too good for TV. There's only too
much TV.
</P>
<P>
   And that's this season's big lesson. There might have been a lot
of awful game shows this year, but that only meant fewer awful
sitcoms and dramas. ``Millionaire'' and its brethren didn't push
out quality; they just shrunk the networks' sitcom-drama-newsmag
Bermuda Triangle.
</P>
<P>
   The effect, this season, was subtle. For instance, Mike Billok,
of Silverdale, Wash., was asked one Sunday night in March, for
$250,000: What did Newton Minow call ``a vast wasteland'' in a
controversial 1961 speech?
</P>
<P>
   The answers: A) public schools B) congress C) suburbia D)
television.
</P>
<P>
   Billok didn't know. Didn't know! And so he walked away with
$125,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's how much fun this season was. Mike Billok couldn't even
remember that the vast wasteland is... D.
</P>
<P>
   Television.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1943, Walter Marx, a Jewish teen-ager, was fleeing the Nazis
in a small town in northwest Italy. A young Italian woman saved his
life by hiding him from German soldiers and helping him escape.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 years passed, and though Marx made several trips
back to the town, Borgo San Dalmazzo, the two did not meet again
until a surprising and touching reunion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Marx, now 74 and retired in Roslyn, N.Y., was invited to a
ceremony in the town for a monument he had helped pay for,
dedicated to the many townspeople who aided Jews driven there
during the war.
</P>
<P>
   In his dedication speech, Marx spoke of the young woman in the
town who once risked her life to save his, adding that he had not
seen her again despite many searches.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a 78-year-old woman came from the crowd crying. She
hardly resembled the brave 22-year-old woman with a pretty smile
and thick chestnut locks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remembered a beautiful girl, not a woman with white hair in
her 70s,'' Marx said, ``but somehow I knew it was her.'' Weeping,
the woman introduced herself as Magdalena Gibaudo. The two hugged
as the crowd responded with applause and tears. He offered to treat
Gibaudo to a visit to New York to stay with him. She arrived on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a leather couch in his large house on Long Island on
Thursday evening, Marx and Gibaudo, over tea and strawberries,
discussed how to avoid traffic during their weekend of sightseeing
in Manhattan. It was a far cry from sitting, 57 years ago, in her
father's hotel, planning how to avoid Nazis and the train to
Auschwitz while sneaking Marx to the underground.
</P>
<P>
   With a group of some 1,300 Jews fleeing France, Marx and his
mother walked over the Alps and stopped at the small Italian town.
The two stayed several nights at a small hotel called the Caballo
Rosso, owned by Gibaudo's father.
</P>
<P>
   But the Nazis soon rounded them up with other Jews and put them
into a temporary camp in town. Gibaudo would see Marx toiling in
work crews in town. He injured his back pushing a truck and spent
three months in a local hospital. She visited him there and visited
his mother in the camp, bringing them food. But then the Jewish
prisoners, including his mother, Johanna Marx, were put on the
train to Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Marx, whose father, Ludwig Marx, was arrested earlier in France
and sent to a death camp in Poland, sneaked from the hospital on
crutches and asked Gibaudo to hide him in the hotel. Though she
risked being shot by the Nazis, she took the teen-ager in and later
guided him to the foothills of the Alps, where she introduced him
to members of the Italian Underground.
</P>
<P>
   He agreed to work for the underground, and posed as an
interpreter for the Nazi secret service. He discovered and helped
foil a Nazi attack, he said, and was later wounded in a battle
against German soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he learned that his parents had died in the
camps, and at age 19 he came to New York. He started an air freight
business and married. He and his wife, Ellen, a German Jew who
survived the Holocaust by living in a convent in Belgium, had three
sons. Through the years he often took them back to Borgo San
Dalmazzo, but the inn had been demolished, and he had no luck
finding Gibaudo.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling the war, Gibaudo said risking her life for Marx and
other Jews in danger was something that came ``del cuore,'' or from
the heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do it,'' Gibaudo said, adding that she never forgot
the terror in the face of that handsome 17-year-old who showed up
on crutches one night at her father's hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helping him has remained one of the most important events in
my life,'' she said. ``I always hoped he would come back, but I
never really believed he would.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibaudo said she also helped Jewish prisoners, including Marx's
mother, hobble onto trains with no idea that they were headed to
death camps, a cruel twist that has long tormented her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is such a painful thing to remember walking those people to
the train and watching them get on,'' she said. ``I cannot forget
that. I cannot even read about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Marx said he would always feel indebted to Gibaudo and would
always feel a special tie to Borgo San Dalmazzo.
</P>
<P>
   The horrible memories of persecution are indelible, he said,
``but the experience has helped me face life with a lot of courage,
and surviving has given me a sense of pride.''

U.S. LONG-DISTANCE RUNNERS ARE PSYCHING THEMSELVES OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 (With OLY-MENS-MARATHON) 
 By MARC BLOOM   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even though the new U.S. citizen Khalid Khannouchi is sitting
out Sunday's men's Olympic marathon trial in Pittsburgh, his status
as a ``ready-made'' star who is far superior to other Americans
emphasizes an irony that contradicts most explanations on the
demise of American distance runners.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Kenyans and other Africans is often cited as the
main reason why an American man has not won the New York City
Marathon since 1982 and the Boston Marathon since 1983 or been
close to an Olympic medal since Frank Shorter's gold in 1972 and
silver in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is said, Africans typically run many miles to
school and have the advantage of a running-rich, high-altitude
environment. In Kenya, there are no other big-time sports to
attract athletic talent; if you're a good athlete, you run.
</P>
<P>
   But the root of the American problem is not based on training
environment or physical strength. The problem stems from the mind.
We're psyched out.
</P>
<P>
   When Khannouchi, 28, came to the United States from Morocco in
1993, he was not a running sensation. In high school, he had run
3,000 meters in 8 minutes 35 seconds, which would not have won the
high school event at last week's Penn Relays. The record for U.S.
high school boys is 8:05.8. But Khannouchi believed he could be a
great runner and focused solely on that mission. He got a job as a
dishwasher and trained at night.
</P>
<P>
   Even without a coach or formal training doctrine behind him,
Khannouchi knew that distance-running success took years to
achieve. Winning a marathon would not be a slam dunk. You had to be
patient. You had to sacrifice. Eventually, your time would come.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi waited. As recently as March 1996, he was still the
kind of also-ran who would place ninth in the 3,000 meters at the
U.S. national indoor meet. He had no sponsor and made a few bucks
here and there off the racing circuit. He thought about quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, after four years of running while dodging Brooklyn
traffic, Khannouchi made a breakthrough in 1997. After Khannouchi
won the Chicago Marathon that fall in 2 hours 7 minutes 10 seconds
(his world record, set last year at Chicago, is 2:05:42), I visited
him at his home in Wyckoff Heights on the Brooklyn-Queens border.
Then, he lived in a third-floor walkup and did speed work at
Victory Field, on a scrubby track barely adequate for the joggers
who circled it wearing headphones.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Khannouchi never conceded anything to the Kenyans or
anyone else. He ran nose-to-nose with the Kenyans and eventually
defeated them. If anything, some of the Kenyans feared Khannouchi.
They would whisper about him in awe when he turned up at races.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Kenyans respected American runners like Steve Prefontaine,
Alberto Salazar and Craig Virgin. Recently, I spoke with Virgin,
the only American man to win the world cross-country title, an
event now dominated by Kenyans. Virgin, who grew up on a farm in
Illinois, said he never doubted he could beat anybody in the world.
</P>
<P>
   For years, however, American runners have sulked with a sense of
inferiority, thinking the Kenyans have the edge and there's nothing
to be done about it. Americans have despaired so deeply that they
race almost exclusively among themselves and avoid Kenyans and
other foreign opposition at all cost.
</P>
<P>
   The telling statistic is not only that in the last 10 years only
three American men have made the top-10 at the New York City
Marathon. It's also that leading Americans no longer run races like
New York or Boston at all.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Americans' poor self-image has had a disturbing
trickle-down effect that could have drastic repercussions. Last
week, at a high school track meet in New Jersey, I saw an example
of that. I overheard a white youngster entered in the mile telling
a teammate his prospects for victory were not good. He said to his
friend: ``See that black guy over there? He's in the mile. I'm
going to get blown away.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the African-American youngster, an
inexperienced freshman, rushed out too fast in the lead and faded.
The white kid won. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani returned Saturday to what has
been a solid source of support throughout his political career _
the Liberal Party, and its leader, Raymond B. Harding _ and asked
for the party's backing as he sets his sights on the U.S. Senate.
But Hillary Rodham Clinton also appeared before the same group,
arguing that her views were more in touch with the Liberal ideology
than were those of the Republican mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Clinton each spent an hour in private at a
Manhattan hotel with the policy committee of the Liberal Party, the
first step in the party's move toward choosing its nominee by June
6. This usually barely noticed rite for candidates in New York drew
a bustle of attention Saturday, evidenced by a lineup of cameras
and security officers, reflecting the state and national political
implications that have become attached to the decision by Harding's
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not my first time being interviewed by the Liberal
Party,'' Giuliani said as soon as he left the meeting, grinning as
he noted his longstanding ties with one of the smaller parties that
his advisers believe could provide the winning margin in this
election. When a reporter asked if he considered Harding a close
adviser, Giuliani responded: ``I consider Ray Harding to be more
than a close adviser. I consider him a close personal friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointed to the same friendship in remarks that seemed to
lower expectations on her chances of winning the support of a party
that almost invariably backs the Democratic candidate in statewide
elections. ``I'm well aware of the mayor's relationship with Mr.
Harding and the party,'' she said. ``But I came today to ask for
their consideration, based on the issues that I'm talking about in
this campaign and what I would do in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton is aware, the only time a Democrat running for
statewide office won without the cross-endorsement of the Liberal
Party occurred in a Court of Appeals race in the 1970s, when judges
to the state's highest court were still elected. Giuliani's aides
noted this fact in a handout they distributed to reporters just
before Clinton left the committee meeting to talk with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party has been pivotal to Giuliani's electoral
success as mayor, not so much because of the relatively few votes
he drew on the Liberal line, but because the party's support has
allowed him to blur his ideological designation, making it more
comfortable for some Democrats to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Harding was able to steer the endorsement to Giuliani with
relatively little difficulty during his three races for mayor. But
this high-visibility Senate race has presented the party with a
particularly complicated choice, and it has put Harding in the
position of choosing between the potential future of the
55-year-old party, on the one hand, and his loyalty to a man who is
a close friend and a source of jobs for his family and party, on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual display of public dissension, some Liberal Party
members said in recent days that they would oppose backing
Giuliani, arguing that it would be a betrayal of the party's
philosophy to send another Republican to the Senate. And if he
backs Giuliani, Harding risks losing a presidential candidate:
Clinton's aides have been pushing Vice President Al Gore to decline
the Liberal Party line if the party backs Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides said Saturday that he might well accede to
Clinton's request. They said he would put off the decision as late
as possible, giving him time to assess whether he needs the Liberal
Party to win in New York (right now, his aides believe that he does
not), as well as to see whether Giuliani stays in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Gore's campaign, said that the
vice president was now beginning a closer look at the thicket of
independent parties in New York, and that he would ``consider the
endorsement'' of any party that shared his views. However, Ragone
added, ``the vice president is a strong supporter of Hillary
Clinton, and our campaign will do everything we can to elect her
the next senator from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Harding's friends have tried to convince him that the
Liberal Party's standing might be permanently damaged if it
supports Giuliani and he defeats Clinton this fall. And the
advantage that Harding now enjoys by having Giuliani in City Hall
ends in a year even if the mayor loses, because he will not be
allowed to run for a third consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
   Harding has told friends that he will delay a decision as long
as possible, in no small part to see whether Giuliani indeed stays
in the race. The mayor learned recently that he had prostate
cancer, and he has said he will decide whether he can stay in the
race based on his medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party endorsement has proven important to Giuliani's
political success to date, but Giuliani may be taking some risks in
aggressively seeking its support in this race. For one thing,
taking the Liberal Party line means giving up the Conservative
Party line, said the Conservative Party chairman, Michael Long, who
argued that it was ideologically dishonest for one candidate to run
on both lines. The Conservative Party historically has been as
critical to statewide Republican candidates as the Liberal has been
to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did today _ with Hillary no less _ they both went and
knelt at the altar of Ray Harding, who in fact gave us Bella Abzug,
John Lindsay and Mario Cuomo,'' Long said. ``Doing that, that sends
a clear signal to the world that he wants to run with Al Gore, he
wants to keep the Liberal tradition, and I don't know who the real
Giuliani is.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, running as the Liberal candidate is likely to
complicate Giuliani's efforts to portray Clinton as a liberal. That
has been the central thrust of his fund-raising appeals, and
statewide Republican candidates have, for a decade, routinely
attacked their Democratic opponents as liberal, a tactic that has
proven particularly effective upstate.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani was asked Saturday whether he considered Clinton a
liberal, he demurred. ``I think it would be overly simplistic to
put labels on people,'' he said. ``I think you can say somebody is
a liberal on something and moderate on something else and
conservative on something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning the question to himself, Giuliani said: ``I think about
me, they would say, he's conservative on economic matters, he's
conservative on law and order. But he's moderate, and possibly even
liberal, on social issues. It would depend on the part of the
country you're in. In New York City, I'm often seen as very
conservative. I travel south and west, I'm seen as very liberal. I
like that, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding greeted Clinton politely when she arrived at the meeting
at the Intercontinental Hotel, but, one participant said, asked no
questions, sitting quietly in the back of a room that was thick
with cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Clinton share positions in their support of
abortion rights, gay rights and gun control, as Harding noted after
the meeting. But Clinton pointed out some differences between them
on issues of concern to Liberals, including her opposition to
Giuliani's school voucher program, and her criticism of the large
tax cuts being advocated by Republicans in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her view of what the Liberal Party stood for, she
responded: ``Based on what I know of it and what I've read about
it, it stands for a sort of positive, progressive tradition in New
York politics, and the kind of issues we've talked about. Very
strong support for public education. Strong support for child care
and working families. Strong support for a minimum wage increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Giuliani and Clinton news conferences were somewhat
raucous. At Giuliani's, a state Democratic Committee employee had a
hand-held video camera to record the mayor's remarks, a routine
tactic used by Republicans and Democrats to gather material for
future advertisements. But Giuliani's City Hall press secretary,
Sunny Mindel, stepped in front of the Democratic aide, held up a
sheet of paper in front of the camera, and stood on tiptoes as the
aide raised the camera. Mindel, who does not work for the campaign,
stopped when she noticed that a reporter was taking notes on what
she was doing.

IN CZECH JAIL WITHOUT BARS, WOMEN TEND TO THE ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By LADKA BAUEROVA c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Martina Holmanova, a cheerful blonde in
her early 20s, is a convicted criminal serving two years for
assisting armed robbery. She is also, as part of an experiment that
contrasts starkly with the overcrowded, underfinanced prisons
common in the Czech Republic, a nurse who has learned to delight 90
elderly patients with her animated puppet shows.
</P>
<P>
   Holmanova is one of 57 inmates of Repy female prison on the
outskirts of Prague. In Repy, the windows do not have bars, the
single guard does not carry a gun and the convicts mingle with
nuns, doctors and nurses to tend the elderly patients with whom
they share the building.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoners, neatly made up and dressed in civilian clothes,
can walk alone in the surrounding gardens or join the sisters in
prayer. Some travel unescorted across the city to work.
</P>
<P>
   With 238 prisoners for every 100,000 citizens, the Czech
Republic has one of the highest prison populations per capita in
Central and Eastern Europe. The Czech Prison Authority has become
so desperate that it is sending less serious offenders home.
</P>
<P>
   But the Repy prison's 65 beds, housed in a 19th-century mansion
with a large garden and a beautifully renovated chapel, are almost
never full. The prison's manager and chief psychologist, Alena
Krizova, says she has trouble finding enough offenders who meet the
criteria of her unique institution, established in 1997 and now
boasting an impressive record: 90 percent of its past inmates have
stayed clear of crime since their release.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women here are first-time offenders convicted of
nonviolent crimes like theft and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The candidate must not be aggressive or highly neurotic,''
Krizova said. ``Intellect does not matter _ we have slightly
mentally disabled individuals as well as college graduates.''
</P>
<P>
   Those chosen to serve time in Repy live seven to a room at most,
and can choose whether roommates are smokers or not. Once a week,
they may buy extra food and sweets in a canteen and cook meals in
the kitchen. Inmates with skills are encouraged to share them; one
prisoner with her own computer is showing others how to use it, and
a former inmate who knew English gave language lessons. The
prisoners can sew and knit, study or raise tomatoes and cucumbers
in the greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   But Repy's inmates cannot leave without permission. They get up
at 6 a.m. and go to bed at 10 p.m. Lovers, husbands, children and
relatives may visit only once every two weeks for 90 minutes.
Depending on the gravity of their crime and on their behavior, the
prison occasionally allows them a weekend at home.
</P>
<P>
   Jitka Matulova, 31, never gets a free weekend. Given the
seriousness of her crime, she should not even be in Repy. Six years
ago, she tried to kill her husband by detonating a Semtex bomb in
his car.
</P>
<P>
   She was sentenced to 12 years and spent five of them in two
high-security prisons. But her good behavior, repentance and
growing religious belief so impressed the prison chaplain that he
persuaded the authorities to allow her to transfer to Repy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hesitated a long time before we accepted Jitka,'' Krizova
said. ``But she's proven herself. She is the kind of a person who
needs to experience success, who needs to hear praise when she does
something well.''
</P>
<P>
   Matulova, who now works as the hospital's cleaning lady, still
remembers her astonishment when she arrived at Repy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They brought me here on the Children's Day,'' she recalled.
``The garden was full of kids, they were having a party, and the
guard told me, `Go on, join them.' I couldn't do it. For weeks, I
couldn't get over seeing a window without bars.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friend Jana Sustrova, 43, one of the few recidivists here
(``an incorrigible thief, but otherwise a super girl,'' Krizova
says), served time even under the communists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when they brought me here, I thought they were kidding
me,'' Sustrova said. ``I just didn't believe this was a prison.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It took months, Matulova recalled, to get used to the freedom of
movement, civilian clothes, openness and the civil behavior of the
guards. Now, she takes great solace in her faith, Repy's frescoed
chapel and the compassionate nuns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more time and space to think about my sins here,'' she
said. ``Faith helps.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sister Simeona Kovalska, a St. Boromeus nun who works as the
hospital's head nurse, said she tells new inmates that she does not
care about their background, that here the important thing is
tending the patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see,'' she said, ``how honored they feel when the old
ladies call them `nurses.'''

$4 MILLION CAN'T BUY VICTORY IF LUCK IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE
</HEADLINE>
   (With RAC-KENTUCKY-DERBY) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Favorites don't always win; that much is given
and even longed for in sports. The upsets are the lifeblood of
competition, a vital part of the foundation that all things _ even
the hopeless _ are possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Derby has taken the upset to an unrivaled extreme.
The last favorite to win this coveted race was Spectacular Bid, who
won by 2} lengths in 1979. The Derby is a graveyard of failures for
horses who rumble into Louisville cast as favorites.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this race so hard on favorites? Like everything else
in horse racing everyone has an opinion, no one really knows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that you have so many horses, that's why favorites
don't win,'' said the trainer Billy Ashenbrenner. ``A 20-horse
field is a joke. You can't pick a winner out of a 20-horse field
any way, shape nor form. The horse that wins it is lucky. And with
a 20-horse field, it's mostly bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Luck. You hear that word a lot in horse racing. Spend $4 million
on a horse, and you rely on lots of luck?
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you put the large number of horses in a gate and they
have to go as far as they're going, so many things can transpire
that it's hard to predict who the winner is going to be,'' said the
trainer Robbie O'Connor. ``You need a lot of luck.''
</P>
<P>
   But anything can happen. Last week, Fusaichi Pegasus threw his
exercise rider and fell down. The horse was not injured. Luckily.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these horses get fantastic care _ how you can give this
much money for an animal,'' O'Connor said. ``All of them are taken
care of very well. Yet you can come in here one morning all they
have to do is take one bad step and that $2 million, $4 million
investment is not worth an egg sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   The Derby Jinx doesn't always hit at the Derby with a loss in
what should have been a victory. For many favorites the jinx hits
before they even get to Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   _ In March, Greenwood Lake was the early favorite but got a
hairline fracture of his left front ankle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year, Wondertross had an intestinal blockage the day
after he finished sixth in the Blue Grass.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1998, Lil's Lad was eliminated with a chipped left front
ankle detected three weeks before the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also in 1998, Coronado's Quest was withdrawn from the Derby
because of behavioral problems.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1992, A.P. Indy was withdrawn on the morning of the
Kentucky Derby because of a fractured bone.
</P>
<P>
   There is no jinx, in reality, just a pumped up atmosphere and a
competitive track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around here a long time and everyone I've ever
talked to says this is the hardest race in the world to win,'' said
Doc Danner, an agent who represents Pat Day and other jockeys. He
pointed to last year's race, when Charismatic held off Menifee, one
of the favorites, who had to come out of the 19th hole and weave
his way through a mass of horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, our sport is like going to the casino, too,'' Danner
said. ``If you don't have a little Lady Luck on your side, believe
me, it makes it harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Churchill Downs itself. The scene alone can
intimidate the inexperienced rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about the Derby _ it's the way the race
develops _ it takes a lot of luck,'' jockey Tracy Hebert said.
``Having a good trip, breaking good, staying out of trouble,
cutting corners, not having to go around the whole field. Some
horses just don't run here as good as they run at Belmont. It's got
nothing to do with the favorite not winning, just the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be the crowd, it could be the noise. Who knows?
Nobody knows. This track is a hard track, a horse weights 1,500
pounds, that's pretty big to be hitting on the hard ground. If they
get to stinging, not comfortable, they won't put out. At Belmont,
along the stretch, the track is deeper and the speed will back up a
little bit. Here the speed won't back. You got to be in contention
unless you got a real, real good horse that will come from way out
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like this is a big track, but you get 20 horses in a
race and you got to maneuver and come around, before you know it,
the wire's there. At Belmont, the track is huge. You've got plenty,
plenty room, a long stretch; the race track's a little deeper, the
horse will come back a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Derby Day will come and go, the crucial answers unanswered: Can
you buy a Derby victory? Can you breed a champion?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you spend that kind of money for a horse, your
percentages go way up,'' O'Connor said, ``because you are buying
the pedigree and a horse that's already proven he can run some. But
there's a lot to be said for luck in this game, too.
</P>

 &HT;    Sydney learns Atlanta lesson
 &HT;    By Jim Auchmutey
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia _ Staging the Olympics isn't a competitive
sport, but it sometimes seems that way to the cities that host the
world's biggest event.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Atlanta, the site of the Centennial Games, was
in a wind sprint for the finish line, struggling to complete venues
little more than a month before the Opening Ceremonies. In
contrast, Sydney seems to be jogging toward the tape, having
finished all but one of its 28 venues.
</P>
<P>
   Stadium Australia, the vast arena where the 2000 games will
begin Sept. 15, has been open for more than a year and already has
handled huge crowds for rugby and a concert by the Bee-Gees.
</P>
<P>
   Last Sunday, in a full dress rehearsal for prime time, 5,500
runners competed in the Host City Marathon, testing a brutally
hilly Olympic course that took them across the Sydney Harbour
bridge, past the famous Opera House and, many sweaty miles later,
into the big oval of the Stadium. It was almost like the real
thing, complete with a cheering crowd and medal ceremonies set to
stirring music.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a chance to work out details we never had in
Atlanta,'' said stadium manager Jim Brown, who oversaw the baseball
venue in 1996. ``Four years ago at this time, people were still
worried about electricity and plumbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The International Olympic Committee has praised Sydney for being
further along than any other host city. Atlanta inadvertently
inspired much of the early preparedness.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney wanted to present the best Olympics, and the only way to
do it was to avoid the much-publicized problems _ the commercialism
and the technology and transportation glitches _ that, in the eyes
of the world media, tarnished the Atlanta games. Despite its
successful bidding program, SOCOG already has taken plenty of
criticism. Rowers have complained that weeds in the regatta lake
impede their oars, runners have whined about winds sweeping through
Stadium Australia and, in a first for the Olympics, triathletes
have worried about man-eating sharks invading Sydney Harbour during
the swimming leg of their competition.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious problem by far has been ticket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Australians might love sports even more than Americans do, and
they flooded SOCOG with order forms when tickets went on sale last
year. But few got tickets to the events they wanted, in part
because so many had been set aside for sponsors, national Olympic
committees and other VIPs.
</P>
<P>
   When news leaked out that less than 10 percent of the seats in
some events were available to the average Aussie, it provoked a
lasting backlash in this egalitarian society where ``mateship'' is
a fundamental principle. The Sydney organizers are still recovering
from the public-relations disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We mucked it up,'' admitted the Billy Payne of this operation,
Michael Knight, a career politician who is the third person to
serve as Olympics minister and SOCOG president. ``Australians feel
a proprietary ownership of the Games. They therefore feel an
entitlement to tickets in a way Americans didn't.... We followed
the Atlanta model of ticketing, and we shouldn't have.''
</P>
<P>
   In most other ways, Sydney has managed the Olympic buildup in a
different way from Atlanta. After the Australians edged Beijing for
the 2000 bid in September 1993, plans proceeded slowly. Then more
than 200 SOCOG staffers attended the Centennial Games to observe.
</P>
<P>
   The chief lesson Sydney took from Atlanta was to get the
government much more involved, not only financially, but with the
ultimate authority to decide anything related to the Olympics.
Unlike Atlanta's privately funded and privately coordinated effort,
Sydney's is underwritten by the state of New South Wales. Atlanta
spent $1.7 billion on the games, but Sydney is spending at least
twice that much, a third of it coming from taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the money has gone to develop the Sydney Olympic Park, a
sprawling Disney World of athletics located nine miles west of the
central city on Marabush Bay, a far tendril of the harbor. Fifteen
of the venues with almost a quarter-million seats are concentrated
at the site, which is 40 times larger than Atlanta's Centennial
Park.
</P>
<P>
   The area once was a notorious wasteland that had been used as an
arms depot, slaughterhouse and garbage dump. In places were
asbestos and small amounts of such toxic chemicals as dioxin. It
was so bleak that part of the site _ an old brick pit _ was used as
a set for the post-apocalypse world in the movie ``Mad Max: Beyond
the Thunderdome.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the waste has been destroyed or contained and has been
covered with parkland. In the middle of the green space sit arenas
for baseball, tennis, swimming, field hockey, track and field. The
most conspicuous of them, Stadium Australia, looms over the site
with twin grandstands whose white roof superstructures seem to open
to the sky like a giant bivalve. With a capacity of 110,000, it is
billed as the largest stadium in Olympic history. As with almost
all the facilities, it will remain after the games, when it will be
reduced by 25,000 seats and used for rugby and soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Spectators will not be allowed to drive into the Marabush Bay
area during the Olympics. They either will take a new train line
built for the occasion or hop buses at park-ride lots scattered
throughout the city. Hundreds of bus drivers will be brought in
from out of town. Getting lost is easy in Sydney. The metro area,
at 4 million people, is slightly more populous than Atlanta, but it
has half the highway system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transportation continues to scare me,'' Knight said.
</P>
<P>
   As for that other bugaboo that haunted the Atlanta Games,
``commercialism,'' don't expect to hear about hordes of tacky
souvenir tents in Sydney. ``It won't happen,'' said Ed Hula,
veteran Olympic reporter who moved from Atlanta to Sydney to cover
the 2000 Games. ``Things are much more regulated here. Street
vendors get shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney has other things to worry about, though. They include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Strikes. Trade unions have clout in Australia, and
transportation workers have threatened to walk unless the
government guarantees them bonuses during the games.
</P>
<P>
   _ The last venue. Olympic planners always wanted beach
volleyball to be held at nearby Bondi Beach, the spiritual home of
Australia's surfing. Construction of a temporary 10,000-seat
facility that will close much of the beach for months is set to
begin any day. Neighbors vow to throw themselves in front of the
bulldozers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned to surf on that beach,'' said Lee Rhiannon, a member
of the state Parliament and leader of the local opposition. ``My
grandmother and grandfather's ashes are scattered off that beach. I
resent giving it up so the Olympics can televise some scantily clad
women jumping around in the sand.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Protests. Aborigine runner Cathy Freeman is one of Australia's
best shots for a rare medal in track and field, and her people are
pulling for her. But it won't stop them from using the Olympics as
a platform for drawing international attention to their plight. The
federal government can't decide whether to make a formal apology to
indigenous peoples for a history of shabby treatment, but
Aboriginal leaders plan to force the issue with marches and
demonstrations during the Games.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the preparations are coming to an end, and the drum roll is
beginning. On Wednesday, the Olympic flame will be rekindled in
Greece and begin its long journey toward Stadium Australia _
through the islands of the South Pacific, underwater by a scuba
diver at the great Barrier Reef, by train and plane across the
Outback, held high by golfer Greg Norman as he crosses the Sydney
Harbour Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Four months from the Games, restaurants are booking celebrities;
St. Mary's Cathedral is finishing the twin spires it had wanted to
erect for a century but didn't until the Olympics; and the city's
400 legal brothels are advertising their come-ons. One is the Tokyo
House offer of an ``Olympic's Special'' _ sushi served on naked
female bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Glitches will happen. Traffic probably will be horrendous. But
with its scallop-edged harbor and its sail-roofed opera house,
Sydney really would have to mess it up not to be remembered as one
of the most telegenic Olympic sites. Whatever happens, the city
does not seem quite as eager for vindication as Atlanta sometimes
appeared to be in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sydney is very confident of itself,'' author and journalist
David Marr said. ``If the world applauds us, we'll lap it up. If it
doesn't, we'll be indifferent to the world's opinion. The Olympics
has only exaggerated our arrogant delight in our city.''

OUR TOWNS COLUMN: THE GUYS WHO PINE FOR A COMB 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW PURDY c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENWICH, Conn. _ ``You guys can dig in with your fingers,''
said a man at the front of the room, offering his dark hair for
examination. No one touched, but a couple of men circled around
him, peering at his head as if it were a moon rock.
</P>
<P>
   It might as well have been. In a room of the folically
challenged, the hair stood out as a beacon of darkness in a sea of
shining pates.
</P>
<P>
   The man was a star of a hair transplantation seminar here the
other night, a kind of Tupperware Party for men without lids, where
guys could let their hairlessness down knowing someone would
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always hid it pretty well until my fiancee noticed it,''
said a man named Mike. ``That just kind of threw me over the
edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Said another: ``I saw pictures of myself and said, `That's not
me. I'm a long-haired hippy.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that men are pouring the kind of energy into
re-seeding their heads they once reserved for manicuring the front
lawn. Laser surgery can zap away myopia, cellulite can be vacuumed
up, various body parts can be enhanced, reduced, tucked and nipped.
Farm animals can be cloned, for God's sake! So what about baldness,
the final frontier? There's no cure, but new drugs and procedures
are giving men options beyond wigs that make them look like
clown-college grads or transplants that look like corn fields.
</P>
<P>
   It was fitting that Dr. Ivan S. Cohen, whose Fairfield
dermatology practice is increasingly hair-centric, brought his road
show to a hotel in Greenwich, a capital of the age of endless
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a miracle,'' gushed one of his successes to
prospective patients. ``You can take one part of your body and it
can grow on another part of your body.''
</P>
<P>
   The gathering seemed at times like an all-male production of
``The Vagina Monologues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you go through a moral dilemma?'' one patient, Mark
Kaplowe, 41, who does ad voiceovers, asked another. ```Why am I so
vain? I'm not losing a limb.'''
</P>
<P>
   They talked about personal stuff in terms of money and cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you should be able to invest in yourself,'' the other
patient said, ``especially if it's going to have long-term
return.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaplowe said he thought about his transplant this way: ``If I do
this, it's going to grow forever. If I buy a car, in three years
I'm going to be trading it in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's guilt-free vanity zone fit the emerging theory that men
are people, too. The author Susan Faludi wrote that society has
stiffed men. The Promise Keepers fill stadiums with men who vow not
just to hunt and gather, but to feel and commit. In parenting
manuals, the agony of boys is catching up with the anxiety of
girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to me, why are you doing this?'' said a 62-year-old
banker. ``They say, `You're vain.' Everybody's vain about
something.'' The back of the head ranks high for men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no aversion to balding men,'' said Tom Nevermann, 39, a
relocation consultant. ``I like that look. But I have a really ugly
head. It's pointed. I don't know if I was dropped as a baby on my
head. I was saying to my friend, too bad they can't transplant the
hair from my back. His response was: `Curly's good.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hair regeneration has become big business, as is clear from
half-time commercials and ads in the sports section. Doctors like
Cohen and his staff at the Center for Hair Transplantation are
busier than ever grafting healthy hair onto barren scalps for an
average of about $10,000 a patient.
</P>
<P>
   His session drew about 20 men. He showed before-and-after slides
and recounted memorable patients, like a security guard who held a
toga party honoring his new hair and burned his three toupees.
Mostly he examined heads as if they were melons, taking questions
like, ``If you have a receding hairline in the front and balding in
the back, do you first try to recreate the swirl or do you start
with the front?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good question,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Another question, asked privately, was what about you, Dr.
Cohen?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a high hairline and reasonable density,'' Cohen said,
running his hand over his thinning hair. ``I'm like 57, and I think
I'm pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   You're the expert, Doc.

IRA TO ALLOW ARMS MONITORING, PAVING WAY ULSTER ASSEMBLY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a stunning departure from its previous hard-line
stance, the Irish Republican Army said Saturday it would allow
international inspectors to check its arms dumps as part of ``a
process that will completely and verifiably put IRA arms beyond
use,'' a gesture that could revive the suspended power-sharing
government and the flagging peace process in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Ulster Unionist Party leader David Trimble greeted the IRA
statement with cautious optimism. His party's refusal to sit in a
government with the IRA's political representatives in Sinn Fein
led to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly just 72 days
after it was created. The IRA's reluctance to begin disarming led
to the assembly's suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does appear to break new ground,'' said Trimble, offering
hope that the IRA's gesture is enough to convince doubters in
Trimble's party that the IRA is sincere about wanting to let Sinn
Fein pursue a united Ireland through democratic methods.
</P>
<P>
   But Trimble stressed that he needed clarification on the IRA's
intentions before he would consider asking his party council to
rescind its refusal to rejoin the local government.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart,
Bertie Ahern, welcomed the IRA statement, saying they want to
restore the power-sharing government on May 22: ironically, or
appropriately, the date by which the IRA and other paramilitary
groups were supposed to disarm completely under the terms of the
Good Friday Agreement of 1998. It was an offer by Blair and Ahern
to revive the power-sharing government, which includes two members
of Sinn Fein in the 12-member Cabinet, that led the IRA to make its
dramatic counteroffer Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The two governments said they had already settled on the two
international inspectors: Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish
president who brokered the end to NATO's war with Yugoslavia last
year, and Cyril Ramaphosa, former chief negotiator for the African
National Congress and now a leading businessman in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has not been previously involved in Northern
Ireland, Ahtisaari's stock as an international statesman rose
dramatically when he persuaded Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to withdraw his troops and end the 78-day war over
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ramaphosa, a confidant of Nelson Mandela, is an old hand in the
Byzantine world of Anglo-Irish politics. He hosted Northern
Ireland's political parties at workshops in South Africa aimed at
getting them to make peace as the ANC did with the white National
Party to end apartheid. Ramaphosa has also visited Belfast
regularly, a relationship that began in Boston in 1992 when
Ramaphosa and his white counterpart, Rolf Meyer, were brought to a
conference with Northern Ireland leaders at the University of
Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sources said that Ramaphosa has helped convince the
IRA's seven-member ruling Army Council that it had to find a
compromise that would allow the IRA to retain its pride but also
allow the stalled peace process to move forward. Ramaphosa is
friendly with Brian Keenan, whom many observers consider the most
dominant member of the IRA's Army Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cyril has street `cred' with the Army Council, especially
Keenan,'' said one IRA member, who stressed he was speaking as an
``ordinary volunteer,'' not as a spokesman for the IRA leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Padraig O'Malley, the senior fellow at the John W. McCormack
Institute of Public Affairs at UMass-Boston who organized the
conference that first brought Ramaphosa into contact with the
Northern Ireland parties, confirmed that Ramaphosa and Keenan are
``on good terms.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know each other, and they trust each other,'' said
O'Malley. ``Cyril and David Trimble also get along. Trimble knows
Cyril's qualities.''
</P>
<P>
   According to spokesmen for Blair and Ahern, the British and
Irish governments approached Ahtisaari and Ramaphosa on Thursday
and Friday, asking if they would take on the roles of arms
inspectors. An IRA source suggested Ramaphosa's acceptance of the
job on Friday helped persuade the IRA to make its statement
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   While the IRA stopped short of agreeing to turn in weapons, an
act demanded by the Protestant unionists before they will sit again
in government with Sinn Fein, it was widely seen as a huge
concession by the IRA, which equates its weapons with its
existence. Many in the IRA consider handing in guns tantamount to a
surrender _ which it had carefully avoided when it called a
cease-fire to allow the political process to take over.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the IRA said it would re-enter discussions
with the international commission charged with disarming
paramilitary groups as part of the Good Friday Agreement that was
supposed to transform the conflict in Northern Ireland from a
violent one to one based strictly on democratic politics. The IRA
had cut off contact with the commission after the British
government suspended the local government in February.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's IRA statement was more specific than a statement it
issued just hours before the British government suspended the
power-sharing government. In a last-ditch effort to halt the
suspension, the IRA pledged it eventually would put its weapons
``beyond use,'' a phrase that the British government deemed too
vague to prevent Trimble and his party walking out of the assembly
and collapsing the power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
   But after nearly three months of patient coaxing by Blair and
Ahern, the IRA's statement Saturday went much further.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRA leadership has agreed to put in place within weeks a
confidence-building measure to confirm that our weapons remain
secure,'' Saturday's statement said. ``The contents of a number of
arms dumps will be inspected by agreed third parties who will
report that they have done so to the Independent International
Commission on Decommissioning.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying it would ``initiate a process that will completely and
verifiably put IRA arms beyond use,'' the IRA said, ``The dumps
will be re-inspected regularly to ensure that the weapons have
remained secure.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRA said the arms inspections will be carried out ``in such
a way as to avoid risk to the public and misappropriation by others
and ensure maximum public confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached by telephone in Belfast, an IRA member said he believed
the statement by the IRA leadership ``will be a tough sell to the
grass roots,'' and will be seized upon by republican dissidents as
evidence of ``going soft and selling out.'' But the IRA's Army
Council historically has never done anything it believes would
cause a serious split in the organization.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough was a diplomatic triumph for Blair and Ahern,
who had held meetings with the Northern Ireland parties in London,
Belfast, and Dublin over the last two weeks, seeking a compromise
from the IRA, which had refused to even discuss turning in weapons,
and unionists, who had demanded guns up front before returning to
the suspended assembly.
</P>
<P>
   So jaded were most observers here about the prospects of a
breakthrough that the talks organized by the two prime ministers
received only a fraction of the attention similar meetings had
generated last year when the peace process had stalled over the
fate of paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But spokesmen for both Blair and Ahern insisted that was a
deliberate strategy. They said the high-pressure, high-profile
negotiations of last spring, last summer and last February
collapsed, in part, because there was too much attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better to do it quietly,'' said a spokesman for Blair,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``When you have
high-profile discussions, you have parallel negotiations going on
in the newspapers and it creates difficulties for everyone
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from Boston, where he has returned after a lengthy stay
in South Africa, O'Malley described Saturday's IRA statement as ``a
major breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who knew the history of the IRA, their traditions and
culture, knew they would never turn in weapons. This is about as
far as you can expect them to go,'' said O'Malley, who has written
extensively about Northern Ireland and has spent the last decade
facilitating meetings between politicians there and in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   O'Malley said Ahtisaari's integrity is unquestioned, and that
Ramaphosa is ``one of the best negotiators in the world.'' He said
that if the IRA was threatened with a split because of its
leadership's willingness to have its weapons checked, Ramaphosa
could help mollify dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it comes to a split, they have one of the most skilled
negotiators in the world at their disposal,'' said O'Malley.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans took home some 2.8 billion prescriptions last year,
obtaining some of the newest, most heavily advertised and most
expensive drugs. They bought many of those medications as members
of managed care drug plans run by pharmacy benefit managers,
companies that arrange discounts from retail drugstores and often
operate mail-order pharmacies on behalf of employer health plans.
</P>
<P>
   Now the pharmacy benefit management companies, or PBM's, which
handle drug benefits for 200 million Americans, are being assigned
an important role in widely discussed proposals to add a drug
benefit to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a Medicare drug benefit, including President
Clinton, believe that the pharmacy benefit managers could obtain
discounts from pharmacists and rebates from drug makers for all
Medicare beneficiaries, just as they are expected to do for
employer health plans and Medicare health maintenance
organizations. The managers, sponsors suggest, would help rein in
the costs of the new Medicare program.
</P>
<P>
   But pharmacy benefit managers are coming under increasing
scrutiny. Justice Department officials are investigating possible
illegal kickbacks. Pending lawsuits contend that some pharmacy
benefit managers have violated their duty to act in the best
interest of patients. State regulators are weighing concerns about
the absence of oversight of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   At Senate Finance Committee hearings in March on the Medicare
proposals, the General Accounting Office questioned whether
pharmacy benefit managers would be able to control costs under
government disclosure requirements. And health care experts say
that even for private companies, drug benefit managers have not
been able to put a lid on surging costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``PBMs or no PBMs, it does not have much effect on the growth
trend in pharmaceutical expenses,'' said Henry Aaron, a health care
economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The drug benefit managers do perform valuable services. They
handle billions of automated transactions, checking plan members'
eligibility online and eliminating mountains of paperwork. They
also monitor the drug-buying behavior of individuals, helping
people avoid dangerous drug combinations. And for an extra fee from
the health plan, they will remind people with serious health
problems to follow their doctors' orders.
</P>
<P>
   But though nearly three in four Americans are in drug plans, by
the industry's count, national spending on drugs is growing three
times as fast as overall health care spending, which itself rose
about 6 percent in 1999. Employers' health care expenses were a big
factor in the 4.3 percent rise in labor costs in the year ended in
March, the biggest increase since the early 1990s. Drug
expenditures will double in five years to $200 billion and rise to
$300 billion by 2010 if the current pace continues, said C. Daniel
Mullins, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacy benefit managers say they can slow the pace for health
plans that are willing to place tight limits on members' drug
choices. Drug costs, they add, would rise even faster without their
industry's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third of the increases is from increased utilization,'' or
more people using more drugs, said Judith Cahill, executive
director of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, an
industry-supported professional group of pharmacists. ``A third is
from new, improved products, and a third is from plain old vanilla
inflation in the cost of products.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers are feeling the cost pressures. ``The largest
component in employers' health costs is not in-patient care, not
out-patient care or doctors' office visits or X-rays; it is
prescription drugs,'' said Raymond Brusca, vice president for
benefits at the Black &AMP; Decker Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Many health plans have raised premiums and shifted a larger
portion of the price of a prescription to employees and their
families. Others, mindful of union concerns and competition for
employees in a tight labor market, have swallowed hard and absorbed
the increases.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors was one of the first big employers to hire a
pharmacy benefit management company, in the 1980s. GM spent $762
million on drugs in its self-insured plans last year, up nearly 13
percent from 1998. The company recently hired a doctor of pharmacy
to work with the PBM to try to tame these costs.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Moroni, the company's assistant director of health plans,
said GM expected a cost increase of about 20 percent this year,
fueled by large numbers of older retirees covered by the company's
plan. Elderly people typically take three times as many drugs as
people under 65.
</P>
<P>
   After several mergers last year, the pharmacy benefit management
market is largely controlled by the three largest concerns.
Merck-Medco, PCS Health Systems and Express Scripts say they have
three-quarters of the country's PBM business.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by those companies and by the other pharmacy benefit
managers to control costs have largely been stymied. The savings
from discounts that pharmacy benefit managers get from drugstores
are reduced by manufacturers' price increases and swept away by
intense customer demand for advertised drugs, which are typically
more expensive than alternative products. Drug makers spent $1.9
billion on consumer advertising last year, according to
Scott-Levin, a research firm in Newtown, Pa. And sales of
prescription drugs rose 18 percent, compared with 1998 sales,
according to IMS Health Inc., a market research firm in Westport,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts say the pharmacy benefit managers, which
typically charge employers up to 50 cents for each transaction as
well as other fees, have strong incentives to increase the use of
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an increase in utilization, the PBMs get more money,''
said Debbie Stern, vice president of Rxperts Managed Care
Consulting, a drug consulting firm in Irvine, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, drug makers promote new and highly competitive _
often more expensive _ products by giving the pharmacy benefit
managers rebates based on sales. (The rebates may or may not be
shared with employers.) That system, critics say, encourages PBMs
to choose higher priced drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen anybody giving rebates on generics,'' the
lowest-priced drugs, said Patricia Wilson, a pharmaceuticals
consultant based in Rosemont, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction fees that employers pay for the billions of
prescriptions filled each year mount up. But Barrett Toan, chief
executive of Express Scripts, said these fees merely ``cover
expenses to process those claims.'' He said his customers were
reluctant to authorize harsh limits on drug benefits that might
antagonize their employees at a time of low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the pharmacy benefit management business is a
list, or formulary, of preferred drugs. The employee or health plan
member has a lower co-payment on these products, an incentive to
choose them. In theory, the preferred drugs _ which include many
generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection _ are as
good as or better than any in their class as well as the most
cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   But lawsuits filed on behalf of drug plan members over the last
three years in federal courts in several states argue that sponsors
of managed care drug plans are violating their fiduciary duty to
act in the best interest of patients rather than for company
profits, as required by the federal Employee Retirement Income
Security Act, or ERISA. Several of the suits have been filed
against Merck-Medco, a unit of Merck &AMP; Co., and at least one is
against PCS, which is owned by the Rite-Aid Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for PCS and Merck-Medco said the lawsuits were without
merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have a long history of developing plans and
programs that are designed to benefit plan sponsors and plan
members, with the ultimate goal of saving money for those plan
sponsors and plan members,'' said John Bloomfield, a spokesman for
Merck-Medco.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have raised questions about how much pharmacy
benefit managers really save employer health plans. These companies
typically offer large employers discounts of 12 percent to 15
percent, which come out of the retail pharmacy's pocket. The
discounts are subtracted from manufacturers' posted average
wholesale prices. But those prices may be inflated. ``They are not
an average, not wholesale and not a price, other than what
employers pay,'' Wilson, the pharmaceuticals consultant, said.
</P>
<P>
   While a customer waits at the drug counter, a computer screen
displays the terms of her insurance: the discount from list price,
a dispensing fee of $2.50 or so for the pharmacist, the customer's
other prescriptions and recent purchases, and the co-payment. The
health plan typically gets an electronic bill for most of the
charge.
</P>
<P>
   The drug makers' prices are flexible, depending on the buyer.
``They set a price that they think they can get away with,'' said
Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   New drugs are frequently introduced, and some are priced 20 or
30 times as much as older treatments for the same illnesses. Drug
prices increased 5.2 percent in the 12 months ended in March, while
the cost of medical care including drugs rose only 3.9 percent and
overall consumer prices were up 3.7 percent, according to the Labor
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Richard T. Clark, president of Merck-Medco, said health plans _
employers and their workers _ pay prices that are ``15 percent
lower on average'' than people without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because the pharmacy benefit managers and the drug makers
can keep their price decisions well out of public view, questions
continue to arise. The National Association of State Insurance
Commissioners is considering whether to recommend legislation to
regulate the industry. Kathleen Sibelius, the Kansas insurance
commissioner, said there was ``a growing concern about the monopoly
of control by pharmacy benefit managers who currently are not under
a regulatory umbrella, are not licensed or reviewed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They aren't screened in any way, but they may have a
significant impact on access to prescription drugs and costs
associated with that access,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   William J. Scanlon, director of health financing issues at the
General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
advised the Senate Finance Committee in March that if the drug
benefit managers' role in Medicare was expanded, the pharmacy
managers would have to give up the secrecy that now cloaks their
pricing deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has subpoenaed records of PCS and
Merck-Medco, the two biggest pharmacy benefit management companies,
in an inquiry over the fiduciary duty to drug plan members and
whether certain types of payments to the industry involve
kickbacks. No charges have been filed. Both companies said they
complied with the laws and were cooperating with the investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jim Sheehan, chief of the civil division in the U.S. Attorney's
office in Philadelphia, who is heading the Justice Department
inquiry, said there was ``a tension'' between the benefits that
pharmacy benefit managers provide and ``where they make their
money.'' He added, ``The efficiencies in the business are in the
claims processing and the mail order services; the money is in the
rebates.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, a White House adviser on health policy, said the
administration's Medicare proposal would include requirements to
enhance the quality of service to Medicare enrollees. The plan, he
said, was built on ``taking the best private practices and avoiding
the worst.''

GRIER'S CAREER ENDS AS A REIGN STARTS  
 LINKS WITH PAST DOLPHINS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There will be debates about his drafts _ did they produce stars
or busts? There will be debates about his eye for talent _ did he
go after the right free agents or not? When someone like Bobby
Grier leaves the game, a longtime football man who has survived
four owners and eight head coaches, his career goes under the
microscope, and everyone takes a turn with the scalpel, picking and
dissecting.
</P>
<P>
   Grier is someone many people outside of the Boston area may not
know. And when he was fired in his capacity as director of player
personnel by New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick last week,
it made little news around the country, in direct contrast to the
retirement of San Diego general manager Bobby Beathard, another
person who has dedicated his life to football.
</P>
<P>
   Grier's quiet disposition will not allow him to state what
should be said: that he was one of the league's most dedicated
workers and in a rarity in the sport, a man who was a scout, coach
and executive in a career that spanned almost three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Grier declined to comment on his dismissal. Others in the
Patriots organization were saddened by his firing and said Grier
was somewhat surprised because two years remained on his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Grier's fate, however, was very likely sealed when Belichick
hired a close friend of his, Scott Pioli, a former director of pro
personnel for the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   A further indication that Belichick has anointed himself the
Patriots' football guru came on the same day Grier was fired, when
Dave Uyrus, the team's director of pro scouting since 1997, was
also dismissed. Grier's son, Chris, a scout with the team, will
most likely be asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an unpleasant thing for me to do,'' Belichick said in
a statement. ``I recognized that Bobby Grier has made significant
contributions to the New England Patriots over many years, in
various capacities, as has Dave Uyrus. I enjoyed a good working
relationship with Bobby in preparation for the recent draft, as I
did in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision is unrelated to any specific event, performance
or personal relationship,'' Belichick continued. ``It is more a
reflection of my general feeling to proceed in a new direction with
regard to the structure and operation of our personnel
department.''
</P>
<P>
   There were some black coaches who were outraged that Grier, one
of the few black general managers in the National Football League,
was not allowed to exit with grace, the way Beathard did in San
Diego. That anger may be legitimate, or it may not, but overall
this has nothing to do with race. It is about control. Does a team
give final say on all personnel matters to the head coach or the
general manager?
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Grier reflects a continuing bitter argument on
the issue. Bob Kraft, the owner, decided to give Belichick final
say on all personnel matters. He is among the owners who believe a
head coach can simultaneously handle the duties of coaching and
evaluating college and pro personnel. Other owners and general
managers say it is impossible for a head coach to do both.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft's decision to give Belichick total control may stem from
an incident that involved Bill Parcells, his longtime nemesis and
former coach. In the 1996 draft, Parcells wanted to pick defensive
end Tony Brackens while Grier wanted wide receiver Terry Glenn.
Kraft sided with Grier, and Parcells, frustrated with his lack of
total control, bolted for the Jets. The rift led to Parcells'
infamous statement: if he wanted to cook the meal, he should be
allowed to shop for the groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft may have wanted to avoid any potential future divisions by
consolidating the power behind Belichick, who joins the likes of
Atlanta's Dan Reeves, Seattle's Mike Holmgren, Denver's Mike
Shanahan and Minnesota's Dennis Green as coaches who have the last
word.
</P>
<P>
   Grier is deciding if he wants to stay in football or simply
retire. There have been rumors that the league office may be
interested in him. No matter what Grier does next, his reputation
as a hard and loyal worker is forever secure.
</P>
<P>
   LINKS WITH PAST DOLPHINS
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, coach Dave Wannstedt is doing something quite smart _
surrounding himself with familiar and friendly faces from the
Dolphins' past.
</P>
<P>
   At the April draft, Jimmy Johnson, the former head coach, gave
Wannstedt advice about choosing players. Last weekend Don Shula
made an appearance at a practice for the first time since he
retired in 1996. And Wannstedt turned the locker of retired
quarterback Dan Marino into a shrine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all a part of the Dolphins organization,'' Wannstedt
said. ``When you say `Miami Dolphins' you think of Don Shula, Dan
Marino, Jimmy Johnson. I'm not intimidated by what this
organization has done in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins have been a somewhat fractured franchise recently.
Shula and Johnson did not truly get along. Marino and Johnson were
also not great pals. And the team has endured its share of bad
off-field news, including the accusations against the former
running back Cecil Collins, who was accused of breaking into a
woman's apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt is simply trying to create a more unified, even homey,
atmosphere, and having keen football minds around like Shula and
Johnson certainly cannot hurt.
</P>
<P>
   COWBOYS' $1 MILLION LINEBACKER
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Cowboys linebacker Dexter Coakley signed a one-year
deal worth $1.27 million, becoming the first Dallas linebacker in
the 11 years Jerry Jones has owned the team to earn more than $1
million a year. ... Tampa Bay Coach Tony Dungy spoke to prisoners
in a Florida correctional facility, telling them to never give up
on life. They applauded Dungy, then questioned him. ``Why do you
keep running Warrick Dunn up the middle?'' one asked. ... In
minicamp last week, the Washington Redskins worked cornerback Champ
Bailey at wide receiver but do not plan on using him for punt and
kick returns next season.

IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA, THE DULLES TOLL ROAD IS THE PLACE TO BE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Md.)   By JAMES R. HARDCASTLE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RESTON, Va. _ Rents for office space along the highway leading
from the nation's capital to Washington-Dulles International
Airport are soaring as companies involved in telecommunications and
the Internet compete for the limited space available.
</P>
<P>
   Among the companies that have already emblazoned their logos on
new buildings along the road _ or soon will be doing so _ are
Andersen Consulting, British Telecom, Cable and Wireless, Nextlink,
Nextel, Oracle, Sprint, Teleglobe Communications, Time Warner's
Roadrunner unit and Winstar.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in demand are buildings along a 6-mile stretch of the
Dulles Toll Road from Reston to the airport, where signs can be
attached to buildings that are visible from the highway. About
129,000 vehicles, mostly driven by commuters, travel down the toll
road each day, and last year nearly 20 million passengers used the
airport. That figure represents a 25.8 percent increase from the
previous year, making Dulles the fastest-growing airport in the
world, the Airports Council International said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government owns the airport and the 16-mile-long
toll-free access highway leading to it. In 1984, the Commonwealth
of Virginia opened a 12-mile four-lane toll road sandwiching the
airport access highway, mostly for commuter use. It has twice been
widened, so there are now four lanes in each direction on the outer
edges of the access highway.
</P>
<P>
   The tolls range from 25 to 85 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many firms in the technology area are absolutely set on
getting toll road visibility,'' said Raymond Ritchey, an executive
vice president of Boston Properties, the developer that is erecting
a number of office buildings in the Reston and Herndon, Va., area.
Typically, the companies are three to 10 years old and are seeking
name recognition so that they can attract new employees and
investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But visibility along the toll road doesn't come cheap: That
location demands a 10 to 15 percent rent premium, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Annual rents in new buildings along the toll-road corridor range
from $28 to $35 a square foot, including utilities, and are rising
rapidly, said David Ross, the president of Atlantic Realty of
Tysons Corner, Va., who together with Intertech of New York, is
developing a 27-acre mixed-use site adjacent to Reston Town Center.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Properties is asking for annual rents as high as $44 a
square foot for the top floor at 2 Freedom Square, a 16-story tower
proposed for Reston Town Center and expected to be completed in
early 2002. This compares with the $13 to $14 per square foot
charged for prime space in Reston in 1993, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Reston is a 7,400-acre planned development, founded in 1961, 18
miles northwest of Washington in Fairfax County. With a population
of about 55,000, it straddles the highways leading to Dulles
airport five miles away. The town of Herndon is on the north side
of the road between Reston and the airport. Reston has about 11.5
million square feet of office space, and Herndon about 6.1 million
square feet, according to market data from Grubb &AMP; Ellis, the real
estate services company.
</P>
<P>
   With the opening of the toll road in 1984, office development
exploded in the 1,000-acre strip zoned for commercial use on both
sides of the highway in Reston. Demand for new space collapsed in
the early 1990s and was not rekindled until 1996. Contributing to
Reston's growth as an Internet center is the fact that it is
crisscrossed by fiber-optic cable installed to serve national
intelligence agencies and America Online, whose headquarters is
just north of the airport. The CIA leases two 130,000-square-foot
buildings adjacent to Reston Town Center, and the National Imagery
and Mapping Agency leases a 400,000-square-foot building nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the telecommunications companies in the Reston area are
growing so fast that their management is hard-put to estimate what
their space needs will be. To guard against running out of space,
several have leased entire buildings and then have subleased the
surplus space.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle Service Industries, the Oracle Corp. unit that
specializes in data-management software for governments and
health-care and other companies, took another tack in dealing with
future expansion. It moved into its headquarters in a
210,000-square-foot, eight-story building on the toll road in
October, but it bought the 24-acre site for $14 million back in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Oracle Service Industries, which was then headquartered
just northwest of Washington in Bethesda, Md., had started to look
at possible sites in the Washington area that could accommodate
projected growth. It decided that Reston offered the best
combination of access, quality of life and proximity to its present
and future work force. Oracle is now building the second parking
garage on the site, which will serve a second office building that
is expected to open in November 2001. The site is zoned for a
maximum of 725,000 square feet of office space.
</P>
<P>
   As technology companies cluster along the toll road, legal and
investment services companies are following. Instead of leasing
whole buildings, they are taking floors of premium space in Reston
Town Center, the 80-acre mixed-use development that serves as the
toll-road corridor's downtown.
</P>
<P>
   The center, which opened in 1990 and has a Hyatt hotel and
upscale restaurants, is being developed by the Terrabrook unit of
Westbrook Partners of New York. Boston Properties is Terrabrook's
partner in building and leasing offices in the center, which will
be completed in 2004 if the current pace of construction continues.
</P>
<P>
   In the largest transaction last year in the corridor, Winstar
Communications of New York signed a lease for three buildings with
a total of 700,000 square feet being developed by Tishman Speyer in
its 170-acre Woodland Office Park along the toll road south of
Herndon.
</P>
<P>
   America Online opened its offices in leased space along the toll
road at Tysons Corner, about four miles east of Reston, in the
early 1990s. In 1995, AOL purchased a 235,000-square-foot
industrial building along the toll road and converted it to a
computer center. After outgrowing the space, AOL moved to new
headquarters it built along the extension of the toll road north of
the airport in Loudoun County.

<P>
   LONDON _ The Irish Republican Army offered Saturday to open its
secret arsenal of weapons to international inspection as a way of
meeting peace negotiators' demands that it ``completely and
verifiably'' put its arms beyond use.
</P>
<P>
   The statement from the underground organization was issued just
12 hours after Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish
counterpart, Bertie Ahern, made a public call to the group for such
reassurance, and it lifted hopes of ending the deadlock over
disarmament that has frozen progress on the Northern Ireland peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It represented the first time the IRA had ever explicitly
addressed the crucial and emotive subject of disarmament, and the
proposals went further than even its main political representative,
Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams, had said anyone could expect.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA also said it would reappoint representatives to the
independent disarmament commission that it broke contact with in
February, after Britain put the power-sharing government in Belfast
on hold after only eight weeks. Britain said it had based that
action on the failure of the IRA to make expected moves on weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Blair and Ahern said early Saturday that they hoped to restore
the home rule government by May 22, and they set out a new
timetable pushing back until June 2001 the deadline for a number of
measures intended to secure peace for Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   Those steps include the disposal of paramilitary weapons, a
greater reduction in British troops in the province, a new police
force with more balanced membership among Roman Catholic and
Protestant officers and new human rights provisions.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, leader of the province's largest Protestant
party, the Ulster Unionists, greeted Saturday's statement with
customary wariness, but he said that it was welcome and promised
that his party would devote serious attention to it. If he decides
to go forward, Trimble will have to overcome the deep reluctance of
a significant minority in his party to re-entering government with
their Sinn Fein rivals without an actual handover of guns.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble said: ``It does appear to break new ground. There are
some quite positive elements in it.'' He added, however, that
``there are points that we want to tease out the meaning of.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hume, the head of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic
and Labor Party, was asked by the BBC Saturday what he would say to
Trimble, with whom he shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize. He
replied, ``I would say to David that I think this is what they have
been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume added, ``I think it is making very clear that the gun has
been taken out of Irish politics forever.'' He said the most
significant part of the statement was ``that they are going to put
their guns beyond use, and they are going to have that verified.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The quick sequence of events followed a familiar pattern in the
last years of the Northern Ireland peace talks where months of
stalemates, exchanges of accusations and gloomy predictions are
broken by spurts of activity that raise hopes of an end to three
decades of sectarian conflict that has cost more than 3,600 lives.
</P>
<P>
   David McClartey, an Ulster Unionist legislator from the
suspended assembly, said he and colleagues had emerged from a quick
meeting feeling encouraged by the IRA statement. ``I think there
was a degree of positivity about this statement which hasn't been
there before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Donaldson, the most prominent hardline dissident, made
it clear Saturday night that he would challenge any attempt by
Trimble to take the party back into government based on Saturday's
statement. ``It would appear that the proposals on arms fall well
short of what unionists have been looking for throughout this
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, the Sinn Fein president, presented Saturday's statement
as a triumph. ``I know there have been some who have been skeptical
about whether republicans, the Irish Republican Army in particular,
were really interested in this process,'' he said. ``I think
today's statement shows that they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Friday, Adams had been warning against expectations that
the IRA could respond to the demands for a statement on arms.
Saturday he said: ``This is not an abstract, historical kind of
thing, a dry turning over of the page. This is a life and death,
blood and sinew, emotional and painful step for the IRA to make
because it wants this to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahern called on unionists to view Saturday's development
positively, saying that the statement ``had all the clarity that
people have looked for in the last 12 months or so. We've put a lot
of effort in to try to get this issue addressed,'' he said.
``People were skeptical that there would be an IRA statement; now
they can see it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that unionists who might be uncertain about whether to
accept the deal should remember how far Northern Ireland has come
since the peace talks began. ``There is now very little violence,
tourism is beginning to flourish and economic activity is moving
up,'' he argued. ``People want to move away from the past.''
</P>
<P>
   The British and Irish, who are sponsors of the talks that
resulted in the April 1998 peace accord, announced that the
promised inspections of the arms dumps would be led by two
outsiders. They are Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president
who served as a special U.N. peacemaker during NATO's war with
Yugoslavia over Kosovo last year, and Cyril Ramaphosa, former
secretary-general of the African National Congress in South Africa,
who played a major role in ending apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The two men will report their findings to the independent
international commission that has been charged with supervising the
disarming of the paramilitary groups. ``The dumps will be
re-inspected regularly to insure that the weapons have remained
secure,'' the IRA statement said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The naming of the two foreigners as third parties continued a
tradition in the ongoing effort to end the conflict in Northern
Ireland where outsiders are called in to mediate the major disputes
between the province's two deeply distrustful communities. The head
of the disarmament panel is a Canadian, Gen. John de Chastelain,
and the broker of the original agreement was former Sen. George J.
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for de Chastelain said after Saturday's statement,
``The commission welcomes the recent development and looks forward
to re-engaging actively with the paramilitary groups to further the
peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Ireland peace settlement is an attempt to balance
the desires of republicans, most of whom are Catholics, to draw
closer to and one day merge with the Irish Republic, with those of
the largely Protestant unionists, who want Ulster to remain part of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The original agreement and the various referendums and votes
that have followed have brought a large measure of political
stability to Northern Ireland and have drastically reduced levels
of violence. The IRA and the Protestant paramilitary groups have
maintained cease-fires for nearly three years.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, the IRA said it would make sure that there was
no ``misappropriation by others'' of its weapons, a reference to
public concern over renegade guerrilla groups that object to the
cease-fires and seek to bring the whole peace settlement down with
acts of violence. One of them, the Real IRA, set off a car bomb
four months after the signing of the accord, in the town of Omagh,
killing 29 people and wounding more than 200.
</P>
<P>
   Progress has continually come to a halt over the issue of
disarmament, with unionists arguing that they cannot serve in
government with Sinn Fein as long as it has its ``private army,''
and republicans countering with the claim that the cease-fire
itself, which they call the ``silence of the guns,'' is sufficient
proof of their commitment to peace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Sinn Fein leadership has tried to persuade the IRA to begin
disarming, and, according to British security sources, almost
succeeded in January but failed to get unanimous backing from
members of the ruling army council. Adams is known to fear
provoking any divisions in the ranks because of the republican
movement's history of violent fallouts.
</P>
<P>
   The republican reluctance to disarm stems from a feeling that
the IRA is an undefeated army and from a resistance to taking part
in any action that could be construed as surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure in recent months to get the settlement process up
and running again has been on Sinn Fein, but Saturday's statement
shifts the focus to the Ulster Unionists.
</P>
<P>
   At the last meeting of the party's ruling council, Trimble kept
his leadership with only 57 percent of the delegates' votes after
being challenged by an uninspiring former grand master of the
militant Orange Order, who played on widespread resentment in the
party over what critics view as Trimble's excessive willingness to
make concessions to republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA statement made a rare positive reference to unionists,
saying, ``The full implementation, on a progressive and
irreversible basis by the two governments, especially the British
government, of what they have agreed will provide a political
context, in an enduring political process, with the potential to
remove the causes of conflict, and in which Irish republicans, and
unionists can, as equals, pursue our respective political
objectives peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement Saturday, President Clinton called the
IRA's disarmament announcement a ``significant step'' and a cause
for optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``These developments offer renewed hope to the people of Norther
Ireland that politics will once and for all be pursued through
exclusively political means,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official said Saturday's
announcement is the first time the IRA has put out a ``clear and
unequivocal'' statement about moving forward with the peace effort
and renewing ``confidence'' in the accord by permitting inspections
of its secret weapons stockpiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a sense that it's going to begin, and they are
committed to go all the way through,'' said the official, who is
familiar with the peace effort. ``Both of these things have been
the keys to getting a real clarity about what the IRA's intentions
are.''

A 1,000-MILE TEST FOR OFFSHORE BEACH CATS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.C.)   Herb McCormick is editor of Cruising World magazine.  
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Awash in the nautical lexicon are a sea of oxymorons _ small
gale, light anchor, jumbo shrimp _ that at first take seem like
contradictions, but which upon further review are marvels of
concise description. But Monday, off Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a race
begins that is centered around a waterborne concept _ offshore
beach catamarans _ that many find impossible to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right, you hear people talking about offshore beach
cats and you wonder what doesn't belong in there,'' said the
45-year-old multihull whiz Randy Smyth, laughing. ``Probably the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking by phone from Florida, Smyth, the five-time winner and
defending champion of the Worrell 1000, should know. For when the
20-odd two-person crews launch through the morning surf in Fort
Lauderdale to start the first of 11 legs en route to Virginia
Beach, Smyth will be the odds-on favorite. When asked how many
times he has competed in the Worrell, his answer is short: ``Enough
to know better.''
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, the 1,000-mile race is the frenzied dream
child of the Virginia restaurateur Michael Worrell, who has seen
the event evolve from a four-team, nonstop torture test among
like-minded maniacs, in 1974, to a highly organized affair that
includes dedicated shoreside crews that follow the sailors up the
coast; an international fleet of top-flight competitors; and
copious safety rules and precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are still a lot of great sailors who look at this
event and say it's not their cup of tea,'' Worrell said. ``But for
a certain cadre of hard-core sailors, this is their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   One must be hard-core to even contemplate a Worrell, because as
the fleet hopscotches its way up the Atlantic seaboard _ each leg
averages about 100 miles, and two of them are overnight runs _ the
air and water temperatures plummet while the odds of being ambushed
by a weather front thundering off the coast shorten.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, that confluence occurred at the worst possible time
and place: Cape Hatteras, N.C. Even though there were no injuries,
one boat was dismasted and three more sustained significant damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thousand-fathom line is very, very close to Hatteras,''
Worrell said, referring to the undersea shelf delineating deep and
shallow water in the Western Atlantic. ``These huge ocean swells
come roaring in from the sea and literally trip over Hatteras.
That's why the surf is so huge there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cape Hatteras aside, landing and taking off in rolling surf is a
threat to hulls, rigs and rudders at every checkpoint. But for
Smyth _ a two-time Olympic silver medalist in Tornado catamarans _
the nighttime legs bring the most fearful conditions. ``You're
zipping along, it's pitch black, and there are all sorts of shoals
out there, many of which move around and are uncharted,'' Smyth
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So you're flying at 20 knots and, bingo, you hit a six-inch
spot of thin water. The boat stops but you just keep on flying.''
</P>
<P>
   This year the Worrell is being contested in identical Inter 20
catamarans, which should boost the hopes of another Florida
skipper, Brian Lambert, a class veteran. But Smyth's deck seems
stacked; his crewman, Matt Struble, a former Michigan State
pole-vaulter, is also the reigning Inter 20 North American
champion. Ultimately, Smyth believes his greatest threat will come
from the Australian duo of Brett Dryland and Rod Waterhouse, who
finished second last year and have raced in a combined 17 Worrells
between them.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum are the half-dozen or so teams
entering their first Worrell 1000. Among the rookies are the
event's first woman skipper, Susan Korzeniewski of Liverpool, N.Y.,
and her crew, Davis Murray of St. Thomas, Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   Korzeniewski, a champion Hobie 16 sailor, has realistic
expectations. ``We haven't practiced a lot in this type of boat,''
she admitted. ``It's going to take a little time to get up to speed
with some of the other teams. But we hope to sail respectively and
stay with the fleet.''
</P>
<P>
   In Murray, a boatbuilder and seasoned offshore sailor, she has a
game partner with similar aspirations. ``Our goal is to race hard
every day and sail smart without breaking anything,'' he said. ``If
we come in last and that's the best we can do against these guys,
we'll be very happy with that. What we really want to do is finish
the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who avoid breakdowns and misfortune are due to arrive in
Virginia Beach on May 20. ``Electrical storms, whales, sharks,
military exercises, fishing piers _ there're all kinds of things
waiting out there,'' Smyth said. ``It's kind of a fun race because
it's a new story every day. And none of us know what it's going to
be.''

PHILS ARE BURROWING BUT NOT SURRENDERING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Theirs was a belated arrival, but the Philadelphia Phillies
finally made an appearance in the 2000 season last week.
</P>
<P>
   Until they peeked out from their realm of repose, sort of like
the groundhog on Feb. 2 in another Pennsylvania town, the Phillies
seemed as if they might just take a pass on this season. Until they
erupted for 14 runs and a second successive victory against
Cincinnati, the Phillies had shown no evidence of life. Their vital
signs were as comatose as their third-base coach's signs were
unproductive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just haven't hit,'' general manager Ed Wade was saying as
the Phillies began their game against the Reds last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wade was explaining his team's putrid first month. ``It's
nothing more complicated than that,'' he said. ``Collectively,
we've gotten off to a horrible start offensively. It's tough to win
games when you're not scoring. Looking back at our club coming out
of spring training, you wouldn't figure it was a team that couldn't
score runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The night before, the Phillies had defeated the Reds for only
their third victory in the last 15 games, and they had raised the
National League's lowest batting average by .003 to .230. But even
after they erupted with a 21-hit barrage before Wade's eyes and
sent the team average soaring to .242, they remained the league's
lowest-scoring team.
</P>
<P>
   They also had ended their series with the struggling Reds and
began a three-game weekend series with the Atlanta Braves, whose
lead over them (12 games, entering Saturday night's game) is the
largest margin in the major leagues. A groundhog couldn't have dug
a deeper hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go back and change a 7-and-17 April,'' Wade said.
``We realize what that means. We can't do anything about it. I
think some people would like us to throw up our hands and
surrender. But we don't do that. Our guys aren't made that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Players, however, have a tendency to try to do too much when
confronted with rampant adversity. A player in an 0-for-18 slump
tries to get three hits in one at-bat. Players on a team with a
seven-game losing streak try to hit a six-run home run. Teams
distant from first place try to make up six games in one night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been impressed upon them that we can't approach
it that we're going to make up for 7-17 in four days,'' Wade said.
``We have to continue to play the game the right way and hopefully
mount up more wins than losses. We need a couple teams in our
division to slow down a little bit. I know they ran off a 15-game
streak, but the Braves hopefully can't do that another time or
two.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Phillies had harbored thoughts of upending the Braves
this season, they can put their efforts to better use, like trying
to catch the Mets, who have had their own nightmarish experience
since winning nine in a row, a streak that now seems a little less
remote than ancient history.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies played their first 23 games without Curt Schilling,
their No. 1 pitcher and the soul of the team. Last season the
Phillies resembled a wild-card contender until Schilling went on
the disabled list with an ailing right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   They were four games back in the wild-card race when Schilling
pitched for the last time before going on the disabled list in
August. When he returned in September after a nearly four-week
absence, they were 13{ games behind the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Returning last week following off-season shoulder surgery,
Schilling is viewed as a catalyst who can stir the team. Wade sees
that possibility, but he expressed a cautionary note.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are trying to link our problems in the latter stages of
last season with the problems at the beginning of this season,''
the general manager said. ``I think they're unrelated.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Schilling could repeatedly have won games in which the
Phillies scored no more than three or four runs, an offensive
development that occurred in 19 of the first 25 games. With
basically the same hitters, the Phillies last season finished in
the top half-dozen teams offensively.
</P>
<P>
   But they went to Atlanta last in total bases and only one home
run ahead of the lowest home run total. They had been last in home
runs before Mike Lieberthal and Rob Ducey connected against the
Reds on Thursday for the team's first home runs in six games.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Lieberthal, Doug Glanville, Bobby Abreu and Alex
Arias were the team's .300 hitters. Right now only Abreu is on that
level. A five-hit game Thursday raised Glanville's average by 34
points to .284. Liberthal's three hits pushed him to .258. Arias
was hitting .088. Others not contributing offensively included Ron
Gant (.222), Desi Relaford (.211) and Kevin Jordan (.159).
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good and continue to feel good about our lineup,''
Wade said. ``The best alternative we have right now is to be
patient. The wolves at this point have a lot of suggestions about
knee jerk reactions we should be having. But you can't make
decisions based on knee jerk reactions. The dumbest thing we could
do is be impatient and make moves based on what has happened.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Home buyers know that they are often required to pay
several thousand dollars in closing costs to complete the deal. But
while the types and amounts of those costs are usually predictable,
real estate experts say that buyers of apartments in New York City
_ particularly when the apartment is in a recent conversion or a
newly constructed building _ may be in for some unpleasant
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite easy to see your costs for purchasing in a
conversion jump $15,000 to $30,000 over what you expected to pay,''
said Stephen Kliegerman, director of downtown sales for Halstead
Property Co. in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Kliegerman said that in most cases, the increased costs come
from the fact that developers and sponsors often include provisions
in the contract or the offering plan making the buyer pay
real-property transfer taxes to the city and the state.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical transaction, he said, the buyer is expected to pay
costs that may include the buyer's lawyer's fees,
mortgage-application fees, mortgage points, property-appraisal
fees, document-filing fees, hazard-insurance premiums,
title-insurance premiums, pest-inspection charges, surveyor's fees,
overnight-delivery fees and other charges and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   And while brokers and real estate lawyers are generally able to
provide clients with a fairly accurate estimate of what the charges
will be, Kliegerman said, there are times when even the experts
fail to advise their clients about the costs that can be associated
with buying an apartment in a recently converted or newly
constructed building.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state transfer tax, Kliegerman said, is $2 for
every $500 of the gross purchase price. The New York City transfer
tax, he said, is 1 percent of the purchase price for properties
sold for $500,000 or less, and 1.425 percent of the entire purchase
price for properties that sell for more.
</P>
<P>
   In a standard residential real-estate transaction, he said, the
seller pays both taxes. In transactions involving new conversions
or new construction, he said, the sponsor or developer almost
always passes the costs along to the buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no avoiding these cost pass-throughs,''
Kliegerman said, adding that while virtually all elements of a real
estate transaction are negotiable, developers and sponsors
typically insist that buyers agree to pay the state and local
transfer taxes. ``Its one of the realities of the tight supply and
huge demand in today's real estate market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kliegerman said that with many new condominium apartments in
Manhattan selling for upward of $1 million, the transfer taxes
could be substantial. The state and city transfer taxes on an
apartment that sells for $1 million, he said, would amount to
$4,000 and $14,250 respectively, a total of $18,250.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better brokers and lawyers counsel their clients about
this so they can figure the extra costs into their budgets,''
Kliegerman said. ``But stories of buyers getting really upset when
they hear about these costs for the first time right before the
closing are fairly common.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Simon, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that another
traditional seller's cost that is passed along to the buyer _
again, primarily in new construction and new conversions _ is the
seller's legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buyers can always say to the seller: `You can pay your own
legal fees,''' Simon said. ``But then the seller can then turn
around and say: `Well, then, I'll just have to find another
buyer.'''
</P>
<P>
   An even more frustrating experience for some buyers, he said, is
not finding out until just before the closing that the buyer is
paying the seller's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen cases where lawyers who represent buyers in a new
conversion apparently never read the fine print that requires the
buyer to pay the legal fees of the sponsor,'' Simon said, adding
that such fees can be as much as $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Less expensive, but just as frustrating, he said, are various
``nuisance'' fees that buyers are sometimes required to pay
according to the terms of many sponsors' and developers' contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you see a lot are extra fees for holding the closing
anywhere other than the sponsor's lawyer's office,'' he said,
explaining that such a charge can range from $250 to $600, and
sometimes even more. ``And the charge is imposed even if the
closing is just two or three blocks away.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fairly common provision in contracts for condominium
units in a new building or a new conversion, Simon said, requires
the buyer to use the sponsor's title company or pay the sponsor an
additional $200 or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason for that provision is that the title company that
handled the conversion is familiar with all the legal issues
relating to the property,'' he said, explaining that if a different
title company is used by the buyer, the sponsor or his lawyer will
have the extra work of providing documents and explanations that
have already been given to the sponsor's title company.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that even sellers
of existing apartments are starting to try to pass along to buyers
at least some of the costs of the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that comes to mind are flip taxes,'' Cholst
said, explaining that some co-op proprietary leases require a
shareholder who is selling an apartment to pay a specified amount
to the co-op corporation upon the sale. ``The standard flip tax is
calculated as a percentage of the sale price,'' Cholst said. ``And
I've seen flip taxes that amount to tens of thousands of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the buyer has no legal obligation to pay the flip tax
imposed on the seller by the co-op, he said, more and more sellers
are trying to pass the cost along to the buyer as a condition of
the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether the buyer agrees to the seller's terms usually depends
on the existing market conditions and the general anxiety level of
the buyer,'' Cholst said. ``And in today's market, buyers are
pretty anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding such anxiety, it may still pay for a buyer to
leave the bargaining in the hands of his lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most sellers want you to think that these kinds of clauses are
non-negotiable,'' Simon said. ``But if a lawyer is any good at
haggling, he might still be able to save his client enough money to
cover his own legal bill.''

SUSPECT IN KILLING OF DOCTOR ELUDES SEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The search continues for James C. Kopp, the 45-year-old fugitive
indicted last June in the killing of Dr. Barnett A. Slepian, an
obstetrician who performed abortions in the Buffalo, N.Y., area.
</P>
<P>
   Slepian was killed inside his home in Amherst, N.Y., by someone
shooting from woods behind his house.
</P>
<P>
   Kopp appears on the FBI's 10 Most Wanted list, with 29 aliases,
including Clyde Swenson, Enoch A. Guettler, P. Anastation and
Atomic Dog. He has also been sought for questioning in four
nonfatal sniper attacks on doctors who perform abortions in western
New York, and is wanted by Canadian officials in the 1995 attack on
Dr. Hugh Short, of Ancaster, Ontario, who was shot in the right
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news for the public is that the FBI, if it has a
strength, it's in locating fugitives and apprehending them,
especially if they're on the top 10 list,'' said Paul Moskal, a
special agent with the bureau in Buffalo. ``Ultimately, all of
those people are caught, with rare exceptions.''
</P>
<P>
   The bureau is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information
leading directly to Kopp's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's as likely on the corner on 42nd Street as he is in
Tokyo,'' said Moskal, who added that Kopp had been arrested abroad
in the past. ``This is the type of investigation where tens of
thousands of man-hours are invested, and in that sense we're a day
closer, every day that goes by.''

NEW BUYERS BRING TOWN HOUSES BACK FULL CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NADINE BROZAN c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeffery and Faith Larsen of Greenwich, Conn., have
been anticipating life in an empty nest, now that their children
are 14 and 15 years old. So they have decided to move to a new
nest. That nest, it turns out, will be an old one, a four-story
town house on East 62nd Street built in 1870 and expanded to five
stories in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   When the Larsens move in _ the target date is January _ they
will join a small but impassioned band of city dwellers who are
bringing town houses full circle back to their origins as
single-family homes after decades of being subdivided into
apartments. Projects like the Larsens' require stamina,
determination and more than likely a great deal of money.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, the chief executive of ICor Brokerage Inc., a
four-month-old company that offers business-to-business online
brokerage services, said that he paid more than $2 million for the
house and estimated that the renovation costs would probably hit
$1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 10 studio apartments in the building and a duplex
that once housed an art gallery were demolished. In addition, the
facade will be rebuilt to its original state, a step that has the
required approval of the Landmarks Preservation Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really ugly, and now it will be really beautiful,''
Larsen said. ``I want to bring it back to the look and feel of a
block in a historical district.''
</P>
<P>
   Restoring the house to exactly what it was in 1870 is an almost
impossible task, though. ``Because a fifth floor was added, we
can't make it look exactly is it did, so we must be innovative,''
Larsen said. ``We are putting on a mansard roof with two dormers.''
</P>
<P>
   That the Larsens have seized a rare opportunity is clear, but
just how rare is impossible to measure.
</P>
<P>
   No definitive figures exist for the number of town houses in the
city. A computer analysis of city property records by The New York
Times, using descriptions that would suggest town houses, found
4,400 buildings in Manhattan and 15,200 in Brooklyn that fell
within the parameters. Those figures were arrived at by counting
the number of residential buildings of three to five stories on
lots less than 25 feet wide. The buildings had no more than 12
units and were built before 1905, after which few town houses were
constructed in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Other estimates vary widely. For example, figures taken from the
city's Department of Finance by the Real Estate Board of New York
put the total number in Manhattan at 1,386, a mere sliver of the
borough's residential market, which includes 200,000 co-ops and
65,000 condominiums, according to the board's estimate. For
Brooklyn, Steven Knobel, the executive vice president of Mitchell,
Maxwell &AMP; Jackson, an appraisal firm, said, ``Our guess is that
there are somewhere around 45,000 town houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, 145
town houses changed hands in Manhattan. The single-family town
house is experiencing something of a renaissance, a trend that has
been accelerating in recent years, brokers say, bringing back a
style of gracious living in buildings that don't soar to the sky
and dwarf their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a time the single-family house in Manhattan became almost
extinct,'' said Tim Desmond, a town house broker at Stribling &AMP;
Associates. ``In the 1920s, with the advent of big apartment
buildings, apartment living came into vogue, and houses went out of
favor. That left housing stock that was chopped up into four to 12
units.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the apartments in buildings with three or more units
were subject to rent control or rent stabilization, limiting the
profits the landlord could reap. After 1986, they lost even more
luster as investments, when federal tax laws were changed to
significantly restrict their use as tax shelters. But other factors
were emerging to make the single-family house a diamond on the
market, although sometimes a diamond in the rough. Those factors
include a soaring economy, a dwindling supply of large prewar
co-ops and a growing resistance to what some prospective buyers
describe as the tyranny of co-op boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we are again in a gilded age in New York, but unlike the
turn of the century, there is no vacant land, so people are
reconverting these buildings,'' said Frederick W. Peters, president
of Ashforth Warburg Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers say their clients have numerous motives. ``With a
different perception of safety in the city, people who might not
have thought of doing it 10 years ago are today, and people who 10
years ago might not have been in a position to utilize the entire
house are now,'' said George W. van der Ploeg, a vice president at
Alice F. Mason Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing a trend toward larger, more opulent houses,'' he
said. ``A town house is probably 5,000 square feet, bigger than
most apartments, and that makes a statement. In addition, some
people chafe at the concept of the co-op board having so much
power, from approving the buyer to approving the renovation.''
</P>
<P>
   And, many brokers say, compared with the square footage of a
co-op or condominium, a town house offers a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot more bang _ or space _ for the buck,'' said
Barbara Fox, the president of Fox Residential Group. ``Say you live
in a 20-foot-wide house that is 60 feet deep. For five floors, that
gives you 6,000 square feet. You would have to have an immense
apartment to equal that. Plus you probably get a garden in the
back, you may get a terrace and you can improve the roof and have a
sun deck. It is not cheap, but it is a lot cheaper than getting the
same interior and exterior space in a co-op.''

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The trend seems to have no geographical limits. In Manhattan,
houses are being snapped up on the East and West Sides, uptown and
downtown, from Harlem to Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no undesirable neighborhoods for this in
Manhattan,'' Peters said, but he did agree that there are some
blocks that command special attention. ``Notoriously, the most
desirable street is 70th Street between Park and Lex. It is famous
for some incredibly beautiful buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn, where town houses have long been dominant in some
neighborhoods, the market is surging as well. Brooklyn Heights, the
oldest landmarked district in the country, commands the highest
prices, $2 million to $3.5 million, said Christopher Thomas, a
senior vice president and the sales director for William B. May in
Brooklyn. ``And we are doing a lot of business in neighborhoods we
didn't go into three years ago, like Fort Greene and Clinton
Hill,'' he said. In Fort Greene houses are going for $700,000 to $1
million.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda Magnett, the president of the Corcoran Group in
Brooklyn, said: ``Prices are soaring here, though they are nowhere
near those in Manhattan. A vice president of Juno.com and his wife
who are now renting on the Upper East Side are buying the
first-ever million-dollar brownstone in Clinton Hill and converting
it to a single-family.''
</P>
<P>
   The demand has led, not surprisingly, to bidding wars. Richard
Steinberg, managing director of Ashforth Warburg, put a
single-family house at 161 E. 62nd St. on the market last month for
$3,150,000. ``Within four hours I had three full-price offers,'' he
said. ``We went to sealed bids and sold it over the asking price by
$150,000.'' Should the deal fall through, he said he had two backup
offers in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg is also the representative for Premiere Properties of
Manhattan, a company owned by a British investor, Michael Cannon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew there was a shortage in the New York market of
high-end single-family homes, so two years ago he decided to buy
multiunit buildings as long as they could be delivered vacant,
renovate them and resell them,'' Steinberg said. ``So far, he has
done two, including a building on East 66th Street that he bought
for $3,750,000 and sold for $7,250,000.''
</P>
<P>
   From the buyer's perspective, the single most critical
consideration in the decision to convert a town house that contains
four or more units is whether those apartments are occupied and
whether they are rent-controlled or rent-stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Tenants who are not protected by rent control or stabilization
can be legally evicted at the end of their leases. To evict a
rent-controlled tenant, the owner must obtain an order from the New
York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal verifying the
owner's compelling need for the apartment and then must start court
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Stabilized tenants are protected, too, but Housing Court can
authorize evictions at the end of the lease if the apartment is to
be occupied by the owner or an immediate member of the family.
People 62 and over or people with disabilities may not be evicted
from a stabilized apartment on the grounds of the owner's need for
it unless the landlord provides a comparable apartment nearby at
the same or lower rent.
</P>
<P>
   With all these conditions standing as potential barriers to the
full conversion of a town house, many prospective buyers make it a
condition of sale that the building be empty, and many sellers make
payments to tenants to move.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Mark, a general contractor who bought a 10,000-square-foot
mansion at 8 E. 77th St. for himself and his family of six, did
that when his bid on the building was accepted. ``When we bought
it, it had three or four tenants, and our contract was subject to
its being vacant,'' he said. ``We gave the seller six months and
then could have broken the contract. There was one holdout, so we
gave another three months, but they had to pay him $250,000.''
Houses converted to single-family status by previous owners or ones
that can be emptied by the sellers are worth significantly more
than those with tenants in residence. Sara Gelbard, a senior vice
president of the Corcoran Group who specializes in Greenwich
Village, Chelsea and Gramercy Park, recently closed on a house in
Chelsea with a duplex apartment and two floor-throughs for
$1,750,000, a sum she described as unusually low. ``Two doors down
there is a house on the market that has been renovated for
single-family with an asking price of $2.6 million,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My recommendation is never to buy anything with the intention
of kicking people out,'' she added. ``Offer either to buy them
another place or settle with them. You have to be creative.''
</P>
<P>
   She gave this example: ``Several years ago, I had an owner who
bought co-ops for two tenants, relocated them and is allowing them
to stay for life, and then he will own the apartments.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the wispiest of hints that a building may be for sale is
likely to strike fear in the hearts of tenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting more calls all the time over the issue of owner
occupancy,'' said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York
State Tenants &AMP; Neighbors Coalition. ``We are seeing more and more
eviction cases being brought against tenants in rent-regulated
apartments in smaller buildings. Some of those times it's because
landlords want to occupy the entire building and other times
because they simply want to charge market rents.''
</P>
<P>
   McKee would like to see the laws amended so that rent-stabilized
tenants would have the stronger protections rent-controlled tenants
have, and he favors limiting the number of apartments a landlord
can take over. ``That would make people safe in their own homes,''
he said. ``There are cases when the owners act in good faith and
other times when they use occupancy as a ruse. They simply have a
relative live there for a few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Although empty buildings fetch higher prices, there are still
some owners who want _ or need _ the income generated from tenants
to help carry the mortgage or provide a sense of security. And some
brokers, Paul Massey, the president of Massey Knakal Realty
Services, among them, contend that ``buying such a building is
absolutely worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you value a building with a stabilized tenant in it and you
put a value on the same building were it to be empty, there is a
huge leap in value that allows you to pay the tenant,'' he said.
``If there are three or four tenants, you get more of a break.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate: ``The average multiple-unit dwelling in the city
sells for about $200 a square foot,'' he said, ``and the average
single-family residence for $500 to $1,300 a square foot.''
</P>
<P>
   When San Orr, an investment banker, and his wife, Sarah, an
owner of Babybox.com, a Web site that sells baby gifts, began
looking for a town house last year in the Park Slope and Fort
Greene sections of Brooklyn, they considered renting out part of
whatever they bought for the income it would generate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we decided not to, because we found a house where we
didn't need the rental income,'' said Orr. He would not divulge the
price he paid for the house, which is in Fort Greene. ``We have two
dogs, and we are expecting a baby in August,'' he added, ``and we
wanted not to have to worry about people coming and going. We also
felt that we would best be able to restore the initial character of
the building in its entirety rather than just using one
apartment.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once a building is empty, the process of transforming it into a
single-family residence can take a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though in some ways it is more difficult to do a house than an
apartment,'' said Mark, who has been the contractor on several town
houses and is now doing his own, ``logistically it is easier. You
don't have to have the plans approved by the co-op board or the
building's architect, only by the city. You can work 10 hours a
day, not 5.''
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the project helps, too. ``In any renovation, the
more you do, the easier it is,'' he said. ``Trying to make new work
blend into existing conditions is the most difficult. If you
totally gut a place, it may cost more and take more time, but it is
less difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   But one buyer's difficulty may be another buyer's nightmare.
Whenever he hears a building described as having ``good bones,''
Warren Pearl, a contractor who has been renovating town houses in
Manhattan for 30 years, becomes suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clients and architects say that all the time,'' he said, ``and
what they don't realize is that they are all wrecks, simply because
they were converted a long time ago, probably with improperly done
structural modifications to accommodate all those kitchens and
bathrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Pearl estimates a renovation will cost 50 percent of the
purchase price. ``If you pay $6 million, it will cost approximately
$3 million,'' he said. ``In terms of square footage, high-end
residential jobs are about $300 to $400 per square foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Renovating town houses in New York City presents unique
challenges. ``You have problems here you don't see anywhere else in
the country,'' Pearl said. ``You have attached houses and sometimes
one wall is not attached. Manhattan is filled with underground
streams, which is why buildings often lean, and there are flooding
problems people aren't even aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the more serious flaws he encounters are joists damaged by
walls, plumbing and electric lines added when the house was
converted to apartments, and water damage from inadequately caulked
bathtubs and leaky radiators and roofs. ``People don't understand
the scope and extent of work that is necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That certainly proved true for a woman who moved into a house on
the East Side with her husband and three children in February. It
was not until the building had been gutted during a year of
construction work that they were told that the joists _ the beams
that hold up floors and ceilings _ were collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing I learned from the experience was to
remain calm when the surprises come,'' said the woman, who spoke
about her experiences only on condition that her name not be used.
``The biggest thing for me was to tackle the problem of the day,
and every day there were new problems, electrical, plumbing,
joists. If you don't like dealing with problems, this is not for
you.'' Michael Hourihan, a former tax lawyer who is now commercial
real estate developer, has converted two brownstones in Manhattan.
He is still recovering from a structural surprise. ``I usually live
in the houses myself for a while before selling them, but my most
recent one I ended up selling quicker than I had anticipated,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, Hourihan bought a house on East 69th Street that
had been built in the 1870s and converted to a rooming house in the
1930s. Gutted by fire about 30 years ago, it was rebuilt into a
four-family residence. When he bought it, Hourihan intended to
carve out a duplex for himself, retain two rental apartments to
carry the mortgage and then take over the whole building for his
own use in a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the process of doing cosmetic renovations in the rental
space, we discovered structural flaws that were a result of the
renovation after the fire, stuff even an architect and engineer who
came through couldn't see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The necessary repairs would have been so extensive, he said,
that ``once I had to do that level of rip-out, I decided it would
be too costly to put in kitchens and bathrooms for the apartments
only to rip them out in a few years when I wanted to change it to a
single-family,'' he said. Instead, he skipped right to the final
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved in for a short while, but it didn't make sense to be
paying the heavy mortgage, so I put it on the market around
Thanksgiving, and it will close on April 25.'' He bought the
building for $1.4 million, he said, and spent $350,000 in
renovations that would have cost far more had he not been in the
business. He is selling it for $2.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the house the Orrs bought in Brooklyn needed
relatively little repair. Since it only contained one rental
apartment, whose kitchen and bathroom they have already removed,
they did not have to gut it. ``It was renovated with new electrical
and plumbing systems in the late 1970s, so the renovation is mainly
to change it from a two-family to a one-family house rather than
major structural changes,'' Sarah Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   They took down a 25-foot wall that had been put up to keep the
stairway private and are installing 10-inch steel beams to prevent
floors from sagging.

EDITORIAL: THE EXPERIENCE CARD 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, May 7:
</P>
<P>
   In a series of brisk exchanges last week, Vice President Al Gore
and Gov. George W. Bush laid out their disagreements over gun
control, foreign policy, tax cuts, Social Security and Bush's
record in Texas. Perhaps because he is struggling to stay even with
Bush in the polls, Gore was on the attack almost every day, using
highly personal language to derogate his opponent's policies.
</P>
<P>
   The subtext, however, was not about policy. It was about
experience and temperament. Gore, with his customary lack of
subtlety, was suggesting that Bush is an untested leader with
half-baked ideas. Stressing the value of experience is a
time-honored strategy for the more seasoned candidate in
presidential contests. But it comes with no guarantee of success.
Otherwise we would never have had presidents named Carter, Reagan
and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Carter has been on both sides of the experience strategy.
He won as a new face in 1976, but when he tried in 1980 to depict
the Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan, as unready for the White
House, the tactic backfired. Reagan was a deft campaigner and
debater who skillfully parried Carter's attempt to make him appear
a lightweight. That bit of history bears a cautionary message for
Gore. Even though the vice president is the best debater in
presidential politics today, Bush could gain significantly with a
better-than-expected performance. For now, he is arguing that the
vice president's extreme attacks distort his record and insult the
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, however, he will have to engage Gore's points
more directly. The vice president is right to raise questions about
Bush's achievement in education, the environment, health care and
budget issues. He may have exaggerated Bush's lack of budget
experience, but his point that Texas has a weak-governor system is
a valid one.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign policy, Gore is also raising some fair questions
about Bush, though there is a fine line between the license granted
politicians who speak in generalities and outright distortion. The
vice president accuses the governor of having a Cold War
``mindset'' that treats China and Russia as ``enemies.'' Bush says
he has gone out of his way to assert the contrary. But Bush would
withdraw loans and credits to Russia over its crackdown in Chechnya
and abrogate the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. These two steps
would be dangerously confrontational.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Gore goes too far in accusing Bush of being an
isolationist. As his father's son, he would be heir to policies _
and advisers _ that are international in outlook. As for China's
status as a trade partner, Bush's position is the same as that of
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The arena where Gore has used his toughest language,
surprisingly, is the budget. He repeatedly labels as perilous both
the governor's $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan and his proposal to carve
private investment accounts out of the Social Security system. In
fact, Gore's reliance on the word ``risky'' for almost every Bush
proposal probably should inspire someone to send the vice president
a thesaurus. His point, however, is right. The tax cut, which Gore
says would actually cost more than $2 trillion if you included the
extra interest expenses from not paying down the debt, is
ill-advised. And Bush has not addressed warnings from such stellar
Republicans as Alan Greenspan that a big tax cut now could hurt the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It is of course an exaggeration for Gore to say that Bush has a
``secret plan'' for Social Security. There is something to be said
for Bush's not getting lost in details, as former Senator Bill
Bradley did earlier this year on the health issue. But the governor
needs to flesh out his ideas on Social Security privatization. He
must also explain how he would pay for his tax cut and at the same
time increase military and education spending without jeopardizing
other vital programs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a risk that the public could be turned off by bitter
exchanges over policy minutiae and budget numbers. But such debates
take the measure of the candidates. For Gore they reveal a policy
aficionado who also has a gladiatorial instinct for verbal combat.
For Bush they reveal someone who prefers to be aloof from detail,
but who may not be able to pull that off with the ease of a Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over experience continues, the candidates will be
eyeing the polls for a reading on what the voters make of Bush's
desire to float above the fray or Gore's desire to plunge into it.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: FALLING UNDER THE SPELL CAST BY WAGNER'S
`RING' 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN R. WEISMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the curtain dropped on Act II of ``Die Walkuere'' the other
evening, a smattering of applause rippled through the house. But
seasoned Wagner fans realized that an embarrassing mistake had just
occurred. Like angry Nibelungs, they erupted in shushes, silencing
the misguided few. The curtain rose, and the music churned to its
dramatic conclusion. Then came a thundering ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Not much distinguishes the fan from the fanatic when it comes to
Richard Wagner's four-opera ``Ring'' cycle. They cheer, they weep,
they arrive at the Metropolitan Opera in formal attire, wearing
Wagner buttons and Viking helmets with horns sticking out. They
leave emotionally spent. I am one of them.
</P>
<P>
   I fell under the spell of the ``Ring'' years ago but have always
had trouble explaining its power to others. This spring, I went for
the first time to all four operas in one week _ 20 hours at the Met
_ and have some theories.
</P>
<P>
   From ``Star Wars'' to the Harry Potter series, fairy-tale
fantasies pervade our movies, television and books. In these
hardened times, we cannot seem to get enough of monsters, evil
dwarfs, magic potions, invisibility cloaks, mystical weapons,
heroes searching for their true identity and deliverance through
the power of love. All these elements are in Wagner's Ring, but
there is also something to which our culture has developed an
immunity _ tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The word ``tragic'' is overused today. Wars are tragic,
shootings are tragic, a movie star's illness is tragic. But the
``Ring'' is up there with Aeschylus and Shakespeare. Its music, the
most tragic anyone ever composed, makes almost concrete the
Aristotelian abstractions of fatally flawed characters hurtling to
their doom. At the Met, it is interesting to see the most
privileged people of turn-of-the-century New York, an era of
unbridled self-confidence, addicted to a work that glorifies the
crushing of arrogant aspirations. Call it masochism or guilt, but
there is something about the ``Ring'' that we need.
</P>
<P>
   It took more than 25 years for Wagner to conceive and realize
the ``Ring'' cycle, a project he began as Europe recovered from a
wave of political uprisings in 1848. At bottom, it is a work about
a corrupt old order being overthrown, and the power of this idea
embedded in the ``Ring'' has shadowed its history. George Bernard
Shaw famously saw the ``Ring'' as a parable of capitalism's demise.
In Israel, the debate still rages over whether to perform music
that exalts an attempt by Wotan, leader of the gods, to sire a
master race to save his expiring world.
</P>
<P>
   The affinities that Hitler and the Nazis found in Wagner make us
more than a little uncomfortable. But we are drawn back to the
redemptive message that in trying to rescue his world, and to
create someone with the freedom to defy his will, Wotan
sacrificially accelerates his own destruction.
</P>
<P>
   To see all four operas in one week is to be reminded of
something astounding. Virtually every plot development involves a
betrayal or act of vengeance. The primordial betrayal is the theft
of gold from the Rhine at the opening of ``Das Rheingold,'' but in
``Goetterdaemmerung'' we learn that even before that Wotan
fashioned a spear from a bough of the World Ash Tree, sending the
natural world into decline. In each of the three main operas, these
developments are speeded by an act of drinking something _ water, a
sleep potion, a taste of scalding dragon's blood, a memory drug.
</P>
<P>
   You also have to see all four operas together to realize that
the emotional and philosophical fulcrum is in Act II of ``Die
Walkuere,'' the very act that ended prematurely the other evening.
It is in this act that Wotan realizes the existential trap he is
in. ``Obliged to honor every treaty as the protector of laws, by my
bargains I am enslaved!'' he laments to Bruennhilde, his warrior
daughter. ``How can I create a free spirit who, in defying me, does
my will?''
</P>
<P>
   The deeply pessimistic vision of Wagner is not exactly
fashionable nowadays. But which of us does not spend some time
seeing the world gripped by a cycle of vengeance and decline? There
is even an echo of the cataclysmic end of the ``Ring'' in our world
of forests burning, glaciers melting and water engulfing the land.
</P>
<P>
   The well-dressed audience that staggers out at midnight returns
to its triumphalist world. Perhaps it is easier for these
operagoers to be optimistic after seeing the set of
``Goetterdaemmerung'' strewn with rubble, a distant sun and a
handful of men and women _ are they survivors or mortals or symbols
of the audience? _ peering over the ruins. The music weeps for the
fate of the gods. But it makes us weep for ourselves.

   PUTIN-CABINET _ MOSCOW _ On the eve of Vladimir Putin's
inauguration as Russia's president, the former KGB officer whose
hawkish, secretive demeanor has characterized his election has said
that economics, not military affairs, would characterize his term
in office. On Sunday, Putin will take the reins of the world's
largest country for a four-year term at a time of rising economic
fortunes and growth barely seen since the break-up of the Soviet
Union in 1991. Analysts credit the upturn to high world oil prices,
rather than structural changes made by government before or after
Putin became prime minister last August. However, the
president-elect told the nation this week that he has the political
might and will to keep the boom going. (Coker, Cox News Service).

   VIDALIA _ Nowhere in Georgia is an industry's reliance on
illegal immigrants more obvious than in the 20 south Georgia
counties where the Vidalia onion harvest is in full swing. Two
years ago, after the INS raided a farm during harvest time,
complaints from congressmen gave illegals a temporary amnesty. That
underscores a historic trend: we tend not to enforce laws against
illegal immigrants in economic boom times when business needs
immigrant labor, but INS deports workers en masse in recessions and
depressions. In the last 2 years, with unemployment at its lowest
in 30 years, INS has all but stopped arresting illegals except at
the borders. (Bixler, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH PHOTOS.

   VIDALIA-SIDE _ The US is loathe to arrest illegal immigrants

harvest the $90 million Vidalia onion crop in SE Georgia. This
13-inch sidebar accompanies a larger story about the importance of
illegal labor to the onion crop. The sidebar traces the link
between economic conditions and enforcement of immigration law this
century. In today's roaring economy - Surprise! - arrests of
illegals are way down and workplace raids hardly ever happen.

GIULIANI AND CLINTON COURT LIBERAL PARTY IN SENATE BID
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeats to delete art advisory: No photo will be sent with this
story.)  By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani returned Saturday to what has
been a solid source of support throughout his political career _
the Liberal Party, and its leader, Raymond B. Harding _ and asked
for the party's backing as he sets his sights on the U.S. Senate.
But Hillary Rodham Clinton also appeared before the same group,
arguing that her views were more in touch with the Liberal ideology
than were those of the Republican mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Clinton each spent an hour in private at a
Manhattan hotel with the policy committee of the Liberal Party, the
first step in the party's move toward choosing its nominee by June
6. This usually barely noticed rite for candidates in New York drew
a bustle of attention Saturday, evidenced by a lineup of cameras
and security officers, reflecting the state and national political
implications that have become attached to the decision by Harding's
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not my first time being interviewed by the Liberal
Party,'' Giuliani said as soon as he left the meeting, grinning as
he noted his longstanding ties with one of the smaller parties that
his advisers believe could provide the winning margin in this
election. When a reporter asked if he considered Harding a close
adviser, Giuliani responded: ``I consider Ray Harding to be more
than a close adviser. I consider him a close personal friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton pointed to the same friendship in remarks that seemed to
lower expectations on her chances of winning the support of a party
that almost invariably backs the Democratic candidate in statewide
elections. ``I'm well aware of the mayor's relationship with Mr.
Harding and the party,'' she said. ``But I came today to ask for
their consideration, based on the issues that I'm talking about in
this campaign and what I would do in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton is aware, the only time a Democrat running for
statewide office won without the cross-endorsement of the Liberal
Party occurred in a Court of Appeals race in the 1970s, when judges
to the state's highest court were still elected. Giuliani's aides
noted this fact in a handout they distributed to reporters just
before Clinton left the committee meeting to talk with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party has been pivotal to Giuliani's electoral
success as mayor, not so much because of the relatively few votes
he drew on the Liberal line, but because the party's support has
allowed him to blur his ideological designation, making it more
comfortable for some Democrats to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Harding was able to steer the endorsement to Giuliani with
relatively little difficulty during his three races for mayor. But
this high-visibility Senate race has presented the party with a
particularly complicated choice, and it has put Harding in the
position of choosing between the potential future of the
55-year-old party, on the one hand, and his loyalty to a man who is
a close friend and a source of jobs for his family and party, on
the other.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual display of public dissension, some Liberal Party
members said in recent days that they would oppose backing
Giuliani, arguing that it would be a betrayal of the party's
philosophy to send another Republican to the Senate. And if he
backs Giuliani, Harding risks losing a presidential candidate:
Clinton's aides have been pushing Vice President Al Gore to decline
the Liberal Party line if the party backs Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides said Saturday that he might well accede to
Clinton's request. They said he would put off the decision as late
as possible, giving him time to assess whether he needs the Liberal
Party to win in New York (right now, his aides believe that he does
not), as well as to see whether Giuliani stays in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Ragone, a spokesman for Gore's campaign, said that the
vice president was now beginning a closer look at the thicket of
independent parties in New York, and that he would ``consider the
endorsement'' of any party that shared his views. However, Ragone
added, ``the vice president is a strong supporter of Hillary
Clinton, and our campaign will do everything we can to elect her
the next senator from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Harding's friends have tried to convince him that the
Liberal Party's standing might be permanently damaged if it
supports Giuliani and he defeats Clinton this fall. And the
advantage that Harding now enjoys by having Giuliani in City Hall
ends in a year even if the mayor loses, because he will not be
allowed to run for a third consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
   Harding has told friends that he will delay a decision as long
as possible, in no small part to see whether Giuliani indeed stays
in the race. The mayor learned recently that he had prostate
cancer, and he has said he will decide whether he can stay in the
race based on his medical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party endorsement has proven important to Giuliani's
political success to date, but Giuliani may be taking some risks in
aggressively seeking its support in this race. For one thing,
taking the Liberal Party line means giving up the Conservative
Party line, said the Conservative Party chairman, Michael Long, who
argued that it was ideologically dishonest for one candidate to run
on both lines. The Conservative Party historically has been as
critical to statewide Republican candidates as the Liberal has been
to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did today _ with Hillary no less _ they both went and
knelt at the altar of Ray Harding, who in fact gave us Bella Abzug,
John Lindsay and Mario Cuomo,'' Long said. ``Doing that, that sends
a clear signal to the world that he wants to run with Al Gore, he
wants to keep the Liberal tradition, and I don't know who the real
Giuliani is.''

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, running as the Liberal candidate is likely to
complicate Giuliani's efforts to portray Clinton as a liberal. That
has been the central thrust of his fund-raising appeals, and
statewide Republican candidates have, for a decade, routinely
attacked their Democratic opponents as liberal, a tactic that has
proven particularly effective upstate.
</P>
<P>
   When Giuliani was asked Saturday whether he considered Clinton a
liberal, he demurred. ``I think it would be overly simplistic to
put labels on people,'' he said. ``I think you can say somebody is
a liberal on something and moderate on something else and
conservative on something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning the question to himself, Giuliani said: ``I think about
me, they would say, he's conservative on economic matters, he's
conservative on law and order. But he's moderate, and possibly even
liberal, on social issues. It would depend on the part of the
country you're in. In New York City, I'm often seen as very
conservative. I travel south and west, I'm seen as very liberal. I
like that, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding greeted Clinton politely when she arrived at the meeting
at the Intercontinental Hotel, but, one participant said, asked no
questions, sitting quietly in the back of a room that was thick
with cigarette smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Clinton share positions in their support of
abortion rights, gay rights and gun control, as Harding noted after
the meeting. But Clinton pointed out some differences between them
on issues of concern to Liberals, including her opposition to
Giuliani's school voucher program, and her criticism of the large
tax cuts being advocated by Republicans in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Asked her view of what the Liberal Party stood for, she
responded: ``Based on what I know of it and what I've read about
it, it stands for a sort of positive, progressive tradition in New
York politics, and the kind of issues we've talked about. Very
strong support for public education. Strong support for child care
and working families. Strong support for a minimum wage increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Giuliani and Clinton news conferences were somewhat
raucous. At Giuliani's, a state Democratic Committee employee had a
hand-held video camera to record the mayor's remarks, a routine
tactic used by Republicans and Democrats to gather material for
future advertisements. But Giuliani's City Hall press secretary,
Sunny Mindel, stepped in front of the Democratic aide, held up a
sheet of paper in front of the camera, and stood on tiptoes as the
aide raised the camera. Mindel, who does not work for the campaign,
stopped when she noticed that a reporter was taking notes on what
she was doing.

FUSAICHI PEGASUS ENDS THE FAVORITES' DROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Fusaichi Pegasus, the $4 million colt named
for the flying horse of mythology, came flying through the
homestretch at Churchill Downs on Saturday to win the 126th
Kentucky Derby by a length and a half over Aptitude. He became the
first favorite to win the race since 1979, when Spectacular Bid
captured the race.
</P>
<P>
   The bay son of Mr. Prospector confirmed the powerful signs that
he supplied while winning four of his first five races, and he did
it with style, finesse and power while Kent Desormeaux left his
whip at his side and let the horse render one more virtuoso
performance.
</P>
<P>
   And he glowed through this one, moving relentlessly from last
place in the pack of 19 on the first turn until he bolted into the
lead as they turned for home while 153,204 spectators at Churchill
Downs, the second-largest crowd in Derby history, roared in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus ran the mile and a quarter in 2:01 for the
fifth-fastest time in Derby history, and he had to turn on the heat
against a full cast of exceptional rivals. Aptitude, who ran third
behind Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood Memorial in New York three
weeks ago, finished strongly, with Impeachment third and More Than
Ready fourth.
</P>
<P>
   This was the 126th Derby and one of the most richly endowed with
quality horses and story lines. It was run on a summery afternoon
at Churchill Downs before the huge crowd that approached the race
record of 163,628, reached for the 100th Derby in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Political leaders, movie stars and celebrities of all stripes
stood out in the throng for America's ``most exciting two minutes
in sports,'' and for a personal look at the ``flying horse'' that
dominated the clamor leading up to the race.
</P>
<P>
   But besides Fusaichi Pegasus and his Japanese owner, Fusao
Sekiguchi, who paid $4 million for the colt when he was a yearling,
drama unfolded on all sides. Sekiguchi, the 65-year-old
entrepreneur, appeared at his Barn 41 on the day before the Derby
after flying from Tokyo, and said through an interpreter: ``I
believe that to win is what he is destined to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Derby, though, was packed with other theatrical scripts:
Captain Steve, named for Capt. Steve Thompson of the Louisville
police department; The Deputy, winner of the Santa Anita Derby,
conditioned by Jenine Sahadi, who was the 10th female trainer with
a horse in the Derby and was aiming to become the first to win it;
Marlon St. Julien, the first African-American jockey in the Derby
since 1921; China Visit and Curule, the two horses from the Middle
East sent halfway round the world by Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid
al-Maktoum of Dubai in his continuing effort to extend his racing
empire and his unusual training methods; and 88-year-old Harold
Rose, the breeder, owner and trainer of Hal's Hope, hoping to
fulfill his dream of turning a stable of mostly claiming horses
into the home of a Kentucky Derby winner.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The tone was set on the day before the Derby when the Kentucky
Oaks drew a record crowd of 106,156 for a race that dates back to
1875 for the inaugural season of racing at Churchill Downs. And
many in the crowd suspected they had seen an omen of leniency by
the stewards, who kept everybody waiting in the starting gate for
an unusually long time while crew members tried to coax Vivid
Sunset to stay in her stall.
</P>
<P>
   The race was finally won by Secret Status, who overcame a
stumbling trip down the backside and rallied bravely under Pat
Day's handling to score by six and three-quarters lengths. But the
question hung over the track for the Derby: Would the stewards take
a similarly soft attitude in case Fusaichi Pegasus balked or
cavorted when entering the gate?
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus originally was supposed to break from stall No.
16 in the gate, but Globalize was scratched after his stable pony
bit him on the leg and everybody moved one slot toward the rail.
Still, the first 14 filled the main gate, and the next five took
their positions in the auxiliary gate.
</P>
<P>
   They still were four horses short of the record number of 23 who
started the centennial Derby in 1974, but they matched the total of
19 reached last year, when the one-time claiming horse Charismatic
won for D. Wayne Lukas. It was the fourth victory for Lukas in his
career as America's most successful trainer, a man who started 35
horses before the 126th Derby and who won the race four times.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lukas and Bob Baffert between them won the Derby five
times in the last five years as the dominant trainers in the Triple
Crown. But this time, Baffert arrived in Louisville with just one
horse, Captain Steve, although Lukas entered three: High Yield,
Commendable and Exchange Rate.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked about the likelihood that he could win the
Derby for the fourth time in six years and the fifth time overall,
Lukas replied: ``We're not exactly 30-1. We're going over there
with a pretty good arsenal.''

Sandi Merle, 59, who describes herself as ``just a Jewish kid from
Paterson, N.J.,'' counted Cardinal John O'Connor as her best
friend. Merle met the cardinal at a reception given by the New York
Board of Rabbis, when he first came to New York. She was moved to
tears by an anti-abortion comment, and he comforted her. ``Five
years ago he absolutely changed my life around,'' says Merle who
had experienced clinical death after heart surgery and needed to
understand why she had been spared. ``Instead of going to my rabbi,
I went to my cardinal. ``He helped me find what it was I was spared
for and to have a more active role in Jewish-Catholic dialogue.''

   (NYT15) NEW YORK -- May 6, 2000 -- O'CONNOR-REMEMBRANCES --
Sandi Merle, 59, who describes herself as ``just a Jewish kid from
Paterson, N.J.,'' counted Cardinal John O'Connor as her best
friend. Merle met the cardinal at a reception given by the New York
Board of Rabbis, when he first came to New York. She was moved to
tears by an anti-abortion comment, and he comforted her. ``Five
years ago he absolutely changed my life around,'' says Merle who
had experienced clinical death after heart surgery and needed to
understand why she had been spared. ``Instead of going to my rabbi,
I went to my cardinal. ``He helped me find what it was I was spared
for and to have a more active role in Jewish-Catholic dialogue.''

dot-com. But within the last year the gap has grown. In East
Hampton, where the average house price is $573,725, more than
triple the national average, even salaries as high as $110,000 no

with others who arrived more recently, are being forced out.
Housing in East Hampton is increasingly available only to the
highest incomes and trailer park homes will give way to a park as
large homes are built in the area. (Chris Maynard/The New York

 &HT;    `Boxing out' redefined by Heat-Knicks
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This much is clear: The New York Knicks and Miami Heat
share a love/hate relationship. That is, the teams hate each other
and love to beat each other.
</P>
<P>
   And so, we have the one true, lasting and ferocious rivalry in
the NBA. Opening bell in the Eastern Conference second-round series
is Sunday afternoon in Miami. Watch out for the blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what happens in a New York-Miami series?'' Toronto
Raptors coach Butch Carter added. ``First of all, there will be a
fight. And who's going to stay on the bench in a fight?''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting has been a part of the teams' intense recent playoff
history. There was one three years ago when the Knicks' Charlie
Ward was picked up and thrown to the floor by P.J. Brown at Miami
Arena, leading to the Knicks having six key players suspended for
leaving the bench. The Heat won that series.
</P>
<P>
   The next year was the Larry Johnson-Alonzo Mourning ``fight'' at
Madison Square Garden. The combatants, former teammates in
Charlotte, squared off and threw punches, but none landed. They
were suspended; the Knicks won the series.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, while there was not a fight, there were all kinds
of physical confrontations not seen in other series. Finally, in
Game 5 of the first round, the eighth-seeded Knicks upset the No.
1-ranked Heat on Allan Houston's last-second shot in the lane.
</P>
<P>
   All of this animus began when Pat Riley abruptly bolted from the
Knicks in 1995 to become president and coach of the Heat. The
dislike and desperation to defeat the other has not declined since.
In fact, it's only heightened with all the drama, words and
seemingly endless hype. It's some sort of karma that this is the
fourth year in a row they meet in the playoffs (New York's won the
last two).
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we have to beat them to get over a mental hump?'' Riley
asked rhetorically. ``Or is it to make my life better? Or is it to
make my peace of mind, you know, so I can wake up in the morning
the next day? Or when I'm 65 years old I won't have any nightmares?
No. I'm past that now.''
</P>
<P>
   That may or may not be true. The Knicks have ended the Heat's
season the past two years, and since Riley has not gotten his team
to the Eastern Conference finals in four years with the Heat, the
pressure is at a crescendo. That's just one storyline in a series
that has them all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy, for one, wishes it was just about
playing the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gonna be a war,'' Van Gundy said, mockingly. ``Geez,
Louise. Everybody out there should use their mute buttons. You
could play the same things from last year and the year before.
They're the same stories. We don't even need new newspapers. We
just take the newspapers from last year. No one's going to write,
`Mourning's been unbelievable, Mashburn's had a great year. What is
everybody doing not talking about Mashburn for an All-Star? They're
going to repeat Mourning-Ewing, Houston's shot, Van Gundy-Riley,
Van Gundy brothers, Hardaway shot. ... God. Overdone, overhyped,
and I can't wait till the game starts so we can focus on this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Heat beat the Knicks three of four. One of the
wins was with all-star enter Alonzo Mourning out with an injury and
the other was with Olympian Tim Hardaway sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway missed the first-round series against Detroit with a
foot injury, but Anthony Carter filled in nicely in the three-game
sweep. Hardaway practiced with the team late last week and said
he's about 75 percent healthy and will play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tim's experience is so irreplaceable,'' Mourning said.
``He's been there. He knows how to run this team a little better
than A.C. right now and A.C. knows that.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks know Miami is desperate to get to the conference
finals, and to get there through New York would be most gratifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're the monkey they're trying to get off their
backs,'' New York guard Latrell Sprewell said. ``We're the team
they're looking for. After what happened to them last year, I know
the revenge factor and all those things are going to play into it
and we have to be aware of that.''

MENTOR AND THE IDOL: EWING VS. MOURNING 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was summertime in the late '80s, and a hulking 7-foot figure
with strides as long as normal leaps could be spotted moving
through the halls of the Georgetown University gymnasium, outfitted
with an infant son on his hip and a diaper bag over his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   A few moments later _ after greeting everyone along his path and
wiping any spittle off his sleeve _ he would leave his son in the
safe hands of a Hoya staff member and take the court.
</P>
<P>
   It was time for Patrick Ewing to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   It was the National Basketball Association's off-season, but
Ewing never believed his selection as the No. 1 pick in the 1985
draft meant he was a finished product. The young Knick savior did
not need a long vacation. He wanted to improve; and still does. So
each summer for the last 14 years _ as his children have grown and
his injuries have multiplied _ Ewing has gone back to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when he'd come in with his son, little Patrick, and
he'd change his diapers, and everything,'' said the former
Georgetown coach, John Thompson, currently an NBA analyst for TBS.
``He'd leave him with the trainer and then get in his workout.
Patrick was an example to everyone, all the players who watched
him. It was like, this is how you do it; this is how you work; this
is how you achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Each summer Ewing flung open the gym doors, and it was as if he
was a hero parting streamers and confetti to all the young Hoyas
waiting for their first sturdy whisker. They revered Ewing,
especially Alonzo Mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning was the kid who wasn't moved by basketball until he was
12 years old. Then, one night, he has said, he found himself
sitting in front of a television, transfixed by the determination
Ewing showed during the Hoyas' run to the 1982 NCAA final against
North Carolina. The next day, Mourning took the money he made from
mowing lawns in Chesapeake, Va., and bought a Georgetown jersey. A
couple of years later, he requested Ewing's number in high school.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, as the introductions before Game 1 of the Knicks'
four-of-seven-game second-round series against the Miami Heat rise
above the noise at American Airlines Arena in Miami, the longtime
friends will emerge with No. 33 on their chests. As the series
between these rival teams unfolds, a theory will be put to the
test: Is Mourning still in awe of Ewing? Does facing his mentor
unnerve Mourning?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were to say to Alonzo, `Patrick is your big brother,
and Patrick is your mentor, and Patrick is the guy who watches over
you,' the connotation is that this is somewhere Patrick can get to
him,'' Heat coach Pat Riley said last Thursday. ``That is what
Alonzo has to deal with. They will be lifelong friends. Can that
truly be separated in competition? That's why I never ever in my
whole career cultivated any kind of relationship with somebody I
was going to have to compete against.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's just Riley. As the witness to more than a decade of
intense summer one-on-ones between Mourning and Ewing, when he
wondered if blood would drop on the floor before sweat, Thompson
never viewed the younger Hoya of the two as a shrinking violet.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have a mental edge when you have more experience,''
Thompson said. ``And Patrick has had that, and he has that savvy.
But now Alonzo has been there, and he has experience. Now, it's
just about who has the better game that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mourning is a rippling 30-year-old with boulders under his
skin. He is the shot-blocking menace who landed on the league's
all-defensive team and the proud owner of a nifty jumper, flashy
hook and wicked dunk. So what is this nonsense Ewing spouted about
Mourning last week? ``He's definitely the best center in the East _
next to me,'' Ewing proclaimed. On Friday, Ewing said he stood by
his statement.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an aging superstar, who, at 37, is one postgame ice bag
away from becoming a cryonic experiment and skipped the final
practice before Game 1 with back spasms, and he's talking trash? In
some circles, Ewing's comments were taken at face value. Although
Mourning's statistics are far superior this season, Ewing can claim
an edge in greatness after his nerve held up steadier in Game 5 of
the Knicks' series victory last year in Miami. To others, it seemed
as if Ewing was trying to slip a psychological sliver of doubt in
Mourning's mind. A sort of mental warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's not nearly this complicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just how they talk to each other,'' Thompson said.
``I've heard them say much worse over dinner. It's like, `I killed
you.' It's that kind of stuff. I laughed with Patrick about that
when I talked to him Friday morning. It wasn't something in any way
that was demeaning to Alonzo. It's something they say all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I was in my office and heard them out
there yelling and hollering on the floor. I used to go out and lean
over the rail to see if they were fighting. You'd see them cheating
one another, giving each other a hard time, but always going all
out.''
</P>
<P>
   And always together. They have been close for years. During the
owners' lockout last season, when Ewing and Mourning were bound
together by the criticism they endured as union leaders, they were
a constant tandem outside the meeting rooms. One would call home,
and the other would playfully yank the phone away and begin
chatting with family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, when I can't play anymore, I'm going to watch him and
Dikembe play,'' said Ewing, including Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo in
his Georgetown circle of friends. ``After this, when basketball is
over, the friendship is always going to be there. That's what life
is about. Everyone wants to win, everyone wants to make money. But
if you don't have friends and family, what do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has a friend with the same qualities as himself. He and
Mourning are fierce competitors, tireless workers and aching for a
championship. But in this series, Mourning's performance could go a
long way in determining whether Ewing ever grabs the title that has
eluded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows I can't guard him one-on-one,'' Mourning conceded.
``If we give him the paint, and I'm behind him, he's going to back
you down. But they know he can't guard me one-on-one. They'll
double me and run guys at me.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there will be times when it's just the two of them,
face to face. It happened last year in Game 5, when Ewing won a
stare-down with Mourning. Then, a few hours after Allan Houston's
miracle shot eliminated the Heat, Mourning and Ewing were talking
again, as if the game could not intrude on their friendship.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will never happen,'' Mourning said. ``We know how to
separate the two _ the friendship and the business part of it _ and
we've been doing it for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Over his eight years in the league, Mourning has met Ewing in
three playoff series. Twice, Ewing has come out ahead, including
last year when he scored 22 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and was
unshakable in the final minutes of Game 5. Mourning appeared
tentative, as if frozen by the sight of Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Ewing did get to him. That's what Riley seems concerned
about. But maybe Ewing does not inhibit Mourning at all. Maybe
their friendship just brings out the best in both of them, and, on
different nights, one comes out ahead of the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the reason, but Patrick definitely cares about
Alonzo, and that's also why they go at each other so hard,''
Thompson said. ``They wouldn't respect one another if they didn't
play with every bit of competitive desire they had.''  &QL;

PEOPLE IN NEW YORK MAY SEE PLACES TO GO 
</HEADLINE>
   By TINA KELLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the wintry city smells of roasting chestnuts and
pretzels melt away into summery scents of cut grass and open
sewers, New Yorkers are still lacking that luxury that many smaller
cities take for granted: the public toilet. But that may be
changing shortly.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the city rolled out its plan for a 20-year franchise
for 3,300 bus shelters, 430 newsstands and 30 toilets. A handful of
design firms spent millions of dollars in pursuit of the franchise,
part of it trying to create the prototypical New York toilet. But
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani suddenly canceled the project in June 1998,
saying the city would prefer to ``encourage competition and greater
design variation.''
</P>
<P>
   And citizens stood by, crossing their legs and clenching their
eyebrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great study in how a city can fail to solve a
serious problem when given an excellent cost-free solution,'' said
Doug Lasdon, executive director of the Urban Justice Center, which,
under the name of Legal Action Center for the Homeless, issued a
report 10 years ago about the need for public toilets. ``How come
we can't do it?''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Peter Vallone, the City Council speaker, is hoping to help
deliver the bathroom pass to end all bathroom passes _ 100 toilets
for the city, at $50,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rising from the failures of the administration's plan to put
in pay toilets, the speaker has put in $5 million in our budget,''
said Jordan Barowitz, Vallone's spokesman, who added that the
speaker had just come back from Europe with snapshots of himself in
front of various public potties from world capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope the mayor will agree with this plan, and we will be
negotiating this with him in the upcoming budget talks,'' Barowitz
said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to use city money to build the toilets, instead of
creating a public restroom franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can build them ourselves,'' Barowitz said, ``and worry
about selling advertising and franchises later, so the public can
have some relief.''

O'NEAL AND LAKERS LEAVE KINGS IN THEIR REARVIEW MIRROR 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ These last-minute script changes can be murder.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it was supposed to happen: The Los Angeles Lakers,
the team that dominated the regular season, ending it with a 67-15
record and generating talk of a National Basketball Association
dynasty in the making, were supposed to wave sweetly and then run
down the Sacramento Kings like a tractor-trailer passing a speed
bump.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Lakers handily won the first two games of the
three-of-five-game series in the first round of the NBA playoffs,
then fumbled the third in the final quarter and never even held the
lead at any point during the fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Los Angeles was forced to face the possibility that
its team might be eliminated from the playoffs in the fifth and
decisive game by a speed bump that turned into a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Lakers were able to call in some script doctors
_ Los Angeles is full of them _ and do a little tinkering with the
final act. The result was a fairly thorough roto-rootering of the
Kings before a raucous crowd at the Staples Center, 113-86.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers controlled the game from the opening tip and led by
10 points or so throughout most of the first half, extending their
advantage to 15 points just before the half.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, it only got worse for Sacramento, with the lead
inching up to 20, then 25, then 30, finally peaking at 37 before
Lakers coach Phil Jackson sent in the bench, and the lead finally
dwindled to a mere bone-crushing 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led about any way you looked at it, with a field-goal
average of 52 percent to the Kings' 34 percent and 54 rebounds to
the Kings' 35. Even the Lakers' bench performed well against the
Kings' more touted bench, scoring 42 points, just one less than the
Sacramento reserves. Chris Webber led the Kings with 20 points, but
he was the only team member in double digits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were pretty confident about it, but you don't know until
they throw up the tip and there you go,'' Jackson said after the
game.
</P>
<P>
   The man who took much of the heat for the Lakers' losses in
Games 3 and 4 was center Shaquille O'Neal, a leading contender for
the league's most valuable player award. The Kings double- and
triple-teamed him and effectively blunted his shooting game,
leaving him with point totals of 21 and 25, around half of the 46
points he scored in the opening game.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's victory, however, O'Neal was back in full
form, scoring 32 points and grabbing 18 rebounds. He said afterward
that it was a call from his father that got him back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of down after the two bad games I'd had,'' O'Neal
said. ``My dad said to me, `You idiot, you always play bad in
Sacramento. Just play good at home.'''
</P>
<P>
   After that, O'Neal said, he replayed the season in his mind and
realized that he had in fact always played below par in Sacramento.
It gave him confidence going into the final game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was being kind of hard on myself,'' he said. ``Thank
God for home-court advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said that all of the talk of an MVP award had also
played a part in O'Neal's fifth-game renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are pretty good he's going to be named MVP in the
next two weeks, and he wanted to prove to people that he was worthy
of that,'' Jackson said. ``And he did that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory certainly provided a boost for Los Angeles, which
had been on full smug alert following the team's initial two
victories followed by panic after its two subsequent losses.
</P>
<P>
   This was not at all how it was supposed to happen. The Kings had
gone into the playoffs as the eighth-seed _ the Lakers were seeded
No. 1 _ and had ended the regular season 23 games behind Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers knew they had history on their side in the final
game. Only twice since the five-game playoff matchups began in 1984
had a No. 1 seed fallen to a No. 8 seed in the first round. But the
Lakers had also had a history of bingeing on defeat in the
postseason in recent years, losing four games in a row to San
Antonio last year and four in a row to Utah the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew if we didn't bring our A-game, we were going to be
making history,'' O'Neal said after Friday night's victory. ``And
we didn't want to make history that way. So we brought our
A-game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers will next face the Phoenix Suns in the second round
of the playoffs, beginning Sunday with a two-game homestand at
Staples Center. The Suns have lost to the Lakers each time they met
this season, but Jackson was cautious Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the whole story,'' he said. The Suns had improved
as a team throughout the season, he said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal agreed. ``They're scrappy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Lakers' critics have pointed out that the team had
dominated the recent season so handily that it had yet to undergo a
close brush with disaster, the kind of character-building exercise
that a team often needs to reach the championships. Perhaps,
Jackson said, this series with Sacramento was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care when it had to happen, but I've been talking all
year about how we needed a trial by fire,'' Jackson said.
``Certainly, a team has to have that at some point to develop the
mettle and grit and to be able to sustain the poise, direction and
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They gave us a lot of push, and we needed that as a basketball
team if we're going to advance.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal added, ``This was a good test for us. We just have to
remain dominant at home and then win some on the road.''

FROM PENNSYLVANIA TO LOUISVILLE, FANS LOVE IT  
 NBC POISED TO TAKE OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL AMDUR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Beth Branthoover always wanted to see the
Kentucky Derby in person. So Tom and Bettyjean Branthoover of Black
Lick, Pa., gave their daughter a special present for her 41st
birthday Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drove eight hours to get here for the Derby,'' Beth said
outside the Churchill Downs clubhouse as she held a ticket for an
early race. ``I can't believe I'm here. I've always watched it on
TV. I just never thought I'd see it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what she wanted,'' said her father, who had bought VCRs
and other electronic equipment as presents in the past and then
decided on a special occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Beth also brought her own distinctive style to a social setting
that is always No. 1 in fashion. The owner of a designer shop,
Beth's Custom Leather, in the small town near Pittsburgh, she wore
her own creation topped with a straw hat covered with peacock and
rooster feathers and a mink band. A lucky horseshoe from childhood
adorned the hat.
</P>
<P>
   According to surveys by Churchill Downs several years ago, 60
percent to 70 percent of the Derby fans are from out of town. Their
impact on the local economy is substantial: In the most recent
estimate, done in 1990 by a University of Louisville economist, the
figure was around $90 million. Today it is probably closer to $100
million.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a big day for the locals as well. Calvin Watson, 35,
is district manager of a Family Dollar store two blocks from the
track. He has been a Derby regular for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family has horses and I've been around horses all my
life,'' said Watson, who was sipping a mint julep, the official
drink, with a colleague, Robin Brickey, who had hitched a ride to
the track because she did not want to fight the traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Brickey grew up on a farm in Sandy Hook (population 1,500),
where, she said, ``we always had horses,'' and still do.
</P>
<P>
   ``My great-great-grandparents won the Derby a long time ago,''
Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   The horse? ``I can't remember,'' he said. ``That's before me.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC Poised to Take Over
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's telecast of the Derby marked the end of a long run
for ABC, which had been the Triple Crown network for many years.
Next year, the Derby will move to NBC as part of a five-year Triple
Crown package.
</P>
<P>
   Race officials hope the switch will provide more promotion and
exposure for the Derby, which has had declining ratings in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby, however, falls in the middle of the National
Basketball Association playoffs, which are also televised by NBC.
Churchill Downs officials realize their telecast may be sandwiched
around NBA games _ for better or worse.

THE WINNER WITHIN, A LEGACY IN QUESTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When people ask if he needs to beat the Knicks to feel
whole again _ if he needs another title so he can escape the awful
purgatory of this unforgiving game _ Pat Riley answers with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time I felt that way,'' he said. ``But as you get older,
you get out of that.''
</P>
<P>
   But there are laments. Some run almost as deep as his resolve to
win a championship for the Miami Heat. As he prepares for the
fourth consecutive Heat-Knicks playoff crucible, he has let go of
countless tough losses, moved on.
</P>
<P>
   But one still haunts him. Game 7 of the 1994 finals, in which he
came so close to bringing the Knicks their first title in more than
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really made a coaching mistake,'' Riley said after practice
on Friday afternoon. ``I stayed with John for too long. I did. I
say that now because he was so cold. At the time, he was also
pressing.''
</P>
<P>
   John Starks shot for two for 18 against the Houston Rockets that
June night, chucking up long jumpers, trying in vain to shoot
himself out of a slump, shot after missed shot after missed shot.
Believing in Starks to a fault, Riley failed to pull the shooting
guard he had plucked from obscurity and molded into a starter. The
Knicks went down, 90-84.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to do it over again, the guy that I would have given
some quality minutes to and I didn't was Rolando,'' he said of the
more experienced Rolando Blackman. ``I always to this day regret
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look back and think about it because we were so
close. It was right there, for the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   He shakes his head. A rueful smile passes across his tanned,
lined face.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were up three to two. Just got to win one game. Couldn't
get it done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years later, I wouldn't let a man miss six in a row
without giving him a rest. I'll probably live to regret saying
that, but I think you just learn as you go along.''
</P>
<P>
   Resting his right arm against a pushed-in wood-stained bleacher
_ the tiny diamonds from his 1987 Lakers world championship ring
gleaming _ the 55-year-old coach had just finished practice. He
began to reflect on his career, retirement, a championship lost and
paradise almost found.
</P>
<P>
   The Starks story has a parallel. The Heat is flawed _ two
consecutive first-round playoff eliminations before this year _ yet
Riley believes in his team's ability to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the franchise is in good shape,'' he said. ``We have a
great arena and more season tickets. But it really comes down to
winning. Can we win a championship? And that's where, to this
point, I've failed in New York and I've failed here.''
</P>
<P>
   Failed? He will become only the second coach in history to
record 1,000 victories. In 18 years, his teams have won their
division 16 times. No coach has won more playoff games (149). He
won four championships in Los Angeles. He resuscitated franchises
in New York and Miami. He said that was not enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think both those franchises benefited, but they didn't get
what they thought they were going to get from me,'' Riley said.
``And that bothers me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me, it just really bothers me. I'd like to leave my
career with one more title and leave some other players with one,
so when they look at me, they say: `You know what? You're the real
deal. You know what? They were right about you.' They can't say
that.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been chastised for not upgrading the Heat's roster with
younger players. Riley the coach does not buy the argument that his
loyalty to players has undermined Riley the team president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the coach should say: `Look it, it's time. Now,''' he
said. ``I know this team and when it's time to move in another
direction with some guys, and I also know when it's not. And I
don't think last year's bounce by Allan Houston was the time to
say, `This is a bad deal here.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a great, great group of guys. Hard-working, good
men. Are they good enough to win? That's going to be the ultimate
tragedy if they're not. Because they'll know they're not good
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heat players say Riley has mellowed; he is not as critical
and listens more often to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still Riles, the coach who gets more out of you than
anyone,'' Dan Majerle said. ``But there is a personal side you get
to see now and then.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley has been characterized as a tortured soul, someone who
can't leave his home or fathom life without another championship
ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to fear the consequences a lot more, but I don't
anymore,'' he said. ``I have had nothing but good things happen to
me in my career. I've had some downs. Leaving New York was a very
difficult time. A lot of people thought it was very easy for me to
leave. The departure was one that was very ugly and consistent for
a couple of years. I never wanted that to happen anywhere in my
career. But it did.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The conversation shifted toward retirement. Last summer, he
signed a contract extension through 2004-5, but admitted on Friday
that he thinks about leaving the game sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might not even make it through that,'' he said. ``I'm at the
beginning of the end. I don't feel the same pressure I felt when I
went to New York. I don't feel the same pressure I felt when I
first came here. I know the ship is good.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he has managed to spend more time with his wife, Chris,
and their two children, James, 15, and Elisabeth, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``James is a don't-do-sports kid,'' he related about his
children, who were adopted as infants. ``He's a computer kid and a
musician. And Elizabeth is very well-rounded. They're good kids.
Like any other kids, we have our problems. It's hard to parent
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``James had a difficult time with being James Riley, because he
would get kidded. But he's over it. Elizabeth sort of likes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they don't want to share me with anybody. They get annoyed
when people come up and ask for autographs.''
</P>
<P>
   He also admitted to being somewhat superstitious. One of the
rumors around New York was that he and Chris had their Greenwich,
Conn., home exorcised when he coached the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exorcised?'' he said. ``My wife is a devout Christian. She
used to go in with holy water to Boston Garden. When she went to
Madison Square Garden, she did the same thing, made sure this place
was blessed for `my husband.'
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we didn't have an exorcist come in. My wife is strong
enough to do that herself. Her and her mother would walk around
with the Bible and go in the closet. They'll take care of the
exorcism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not kidding.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley plans to write a definitive book on coaching and something
on pro basketball. Beyond his best-selling motivational books, he
has sold six screenplays with the help of professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't been made yet, but I produced the work,'' he
said. ``I've sold them to all of the studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm a half-decent thinker. I'm going to get a ghost
writer, help me organize it. And I'm going to continue to speak. I
like that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   One of his scripts is titled ``The Seventh Game.''
</P>
<P>
   A renowned storyteller in the locker room, he still uses drama
and metaphor to spur the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked a little bit today about `U-571,''' he said,
referring to the World War II submarine film that he took his
players to see last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my players the other day didn't know the meaning of
it. You cannot make an analogy with `U-571' and the Heat and what
that whole movie is about?''
</P>
<P>
   He answered his own question, talking about what he believed was
the first message of the film: leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first officer was expecting a command,'' he said. ``He
didn't get it and he asked his captain why. And the captain said,
`You're a good leader but you can't command this fleet.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `Why? I'd give my life for these men.'
</P>
<P>
   `` `I know you would, but you don't know what it takes in
warfare to be able to go up to another man and make him give his
life, order him to give his life for the sub.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't do that. He was faced with that dilemma at the end
of the movie. He was faced with the dilemma of ordering one of the
sailors down to release the dormant torpedo in the tube.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, the Miami Heat has been depth-charged two years in a
row,'' he said, his voice rising. ``We have a dormant torpedo tube.
And we have to have a sense of urgency of opening this damn thing,
OK? Do you guys understand that? In other words, do your job. Be a
sailor. Do your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley collects himself. He takes his arm off the bleachers and
steps back. ``That was my symbolic message,'' he said.

AT RALLY FOR LOW-PAID WORKERS, PROTESTERS REJECT HARVARD PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Three days after Harvard University released
a long-awaited report on how it would improve compensation for its
lowest-paid employees, several hundred students and their
supporters, including the actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck,
denounced the report Saturday at a rally on campus.
</P>
<P>
   It was a noisy sign that despite what the administration called
a ``very progressive'' program of education and benefits that would
cost the university over $2.3 million per year, the protesters were
not backing down from their demand for a $10.25 per hour minimum
wage for all university employees.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has centered on the university's part-time, temporary
and contract workers, some of whom make about $6.50 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the granite steps of Harvard's columned Littauer
Hall, in front of a banner that read ``Workers can't eat
prestige,'' Affleck and Damon told the crowd about growing up in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   They said the disparity between the wealth of Harvard's
endowment and the pay of its blue-collar workers inspired them to
write the 1997 film ``Good Will Hunting.'' In the film, Damon
played a janitor at another distinguished Cambridge school, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The two saw both sides of university life. Damon, who attended
Harvard, said he was embarrassed by his alma mater's pay rates.
Affleck said his stepmother, who scrubbed toilets for $5.75 an
hour, and his father, who handed out vacuums and brooms, were part
of the ``low-skilled'' work force at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was often treated brusquely and with little respect,
although not by the students,'' Affleck said of his father.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This is honest work, and there is honor in doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Students began organized demonstrations here in 1998, calling
for a ``living wage'' for the university's workers. Other
universities, including Stanford, Brown and Johns Hopkins, have
started similar campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a faculty committee spent 15 months studying
Harvard's labor policies, finally deciding against raising
take-home pay.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in a proposal released on Wednesday, the committee
recommended that the university give health benefits to employees
who work at least 16 hours a week (the previous threshold was 20
hours) and that Harvard contract only with companies that subsidize
health care for their workers. It also called for more continuing
education and worker training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The committee argued that pay scales are negotiated through
employee unions.

KANSAS CITY'S SPORTS FUTURE IS IN THE HANDS OF YOUNGER GLASS AND
HUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY COVITZ  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Perhaps no issue concerns Kansas City sports
fans more than the future of their highest-profile professional
teams. The truth is, the future may look a lot like the present.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Hunt and Dan Glass, understudies within the Chiefs and
Royals empires, embody the probable next generation of ownership in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Like Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt and new Royals owner David Glass,
their second-oldest sons are passionate about sports. Like their
fathers, they are humble and introverted, buttoned-down and
businesslike. And they share their belief in Kansas City as a
sports town.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Glass, 40, was appointed president of the Royals last week
and finds himself taking a crash course in the business of
baseball. David Glass, 64, also named other family members to the
board of directors, including his wife, Ruth, sons Dan and Don and
daughter Dayna Martz.
</P>
<P>
   ``When David had an interest in purchasing the club,'' Royals
general manager Herk Robinson said, ``one of the things he made
very clear was if he would purchase the club, it would be as a
family project, so the commitment could be extended well beyond his
lifetime. That commitment has never wavered.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Hunt, 35, joined the board of the Chiefs last year, and is
showing a greater interest in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the elder Hunt began transferring his ownership
of the Chiefs to his four children, Lamar Jr., Clark, Sharron
Munson and Daniel. The children now have 98 percent ownership,
divided equally among them, and Hunt and his wife retain 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clark is most actively involved in Hunt Sports Group, whose
interests include the Chiefs, the Wizards and the Columbus Crew of
Major League Soccer, and a small share in the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark has an excellent business mind and excellent affinity
toward business,'' said Lamar Hunt, 67. ``I wouldn't say he's
working for me _ he's working with me and trying to keep me out of
trouble, which isn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are perils when sons take over for successful
fathers, no matter how well and how long they are groomed for the
roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've watched second generations of lots and lots of families,
and it's difficult,'' said David Glass, who helped build Wal-Mart
into the world's leading retail chain. ``Some master it, though,
and do it very well, and they get respect and recognition in their
own right after a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's inevitable that anyone who is following someone else is
judged a little more harshly.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball and business defined Dan Glass' formative years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a sports junkie, and Dan and his brother were
both raised that way,'' David Glass said. ``I got them interested
in baseball at a very young age, and they developed a love for the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Springfield, where his father was general manager
of Consumer Markets, a grocery chain, Dan and his brother
accompanied their father on pilgrimages to St. Louis in the late
1960s and '70s and watched their beloved Cardinals play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lou Brock and Bob Gibson were my favorites,'' Dan Glass
recalled. ``I'd listen to the Cardinals broadcasts, and when my dad
got home I'd give him a play-by-play of what happened. `Brock got
on, stole second; Ted Sizemore bunted him over to third....' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Glasses moved to Bentonville, Ark., in 1976 when David Glass
joined Wal-Mart as executive vice president of finance. Instead of
attending college, Dan Glass entered Wal-Mart's management training
program. He spent five years with the chain, first in Fayetteville,
Ark., and then as an assistant manager in Tahlequah, Okla., Tulsa,
Okla., and Carbondale, Ill., before deciding he could do more with
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Glass enrolled at Southwest Missouri State and after two years
transferred to Drury College in Springfield, where he earned a
degree in business administration.
</P>
<P>
   He also received an education from two of America's most
successful businessmen, Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton and his father,
who in a 24-year career with the company rose to president and
chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Sam Walton, I saw how people-oriented he was,'' Dan Glass
said, ``how motivational he could be around people, just by being
himself, but at the same time, getting his work done. Nobody could
quiz a store manager more without them knowing it than Sam could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up with my dad, I was never intimidated by the boss
guys coming in or the guy in the three-piece suit. I always felt I
had the knack for being able to relate to the guy in the
three-piece suit as well as the blue-collar guy. Sam taught me a
lot about discipline and how to relate to people, and how you treat
them fairly and make them a part of everything and a part of the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Those lessons learned make David Glass confident in Dan's
ability to run the Royals one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a lot of potential,'' Glass said. ``You really benefit
if you like what you're doing and care a lot about it. He really
likes the baseball side of it. The business side of it...he won't
enjoy it as much as the baseball side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan has a lot to learn, he knows he's got a lot to learn and
that's the best part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Chiefs game Clark Hunt can remember was on Christmas
Day 1971. He was 6 years old when the Chiefs lost a playoff game
27-24 in double overtime to Miami in the longest NFL game ever
played and the last game at old Municipal Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Christmas had a lot to do with it,'' Hunt said of the memory.
``The length of the game had a lot to do with it, and I
specifically remember the missed field goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs went 15 long years without appearing in another
playoff game, while Clark's schoolmates in Dallas reveled in the
success of the Cowboys in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting from the time I was old enough to be picked on at
school, the Chiefs certainly struggled,'' Hunt recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The razzing turned Hunt into a fierce competitor, and he won the
respect of his classmates as a star athlete at St. Mark's School of
Texas, a private high school. As quarterback-punter-kicker, Hunt
led St. Mark's to a 10-0 record as a senior. He was also a standout
soccer player and pole vaulter.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt went on to play soccer at Southern Methodist University, a
Division I powerhouse. Hunt, a defender, was captain of the
Mustangs as a senior and was a two-time Academic All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hunt grew up in one of America's wealthiest and one of
Texas' most prominent families, he remained well-grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always amazed me when I was around Clark, how he wanted to
be just another one of the guys,'' said Schellas Hyndman, the
longtime soccer coach at SMU. ``Think about this: Why do you need
to go to college when you have a future in place, an inheritance,
and why do you need to go to be a 4.0 student? Clark sometimes was
his own worst enemy, because everything to him had to be done 100
percent right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clark always wanted to be known for what he has accomplished
and not because of his name.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some SMU opponents, notably arch-rival St. Louis
University, tried exploiting Hunt's side of the field, figuring he
was on the team only because of his name and whatever donations his
family would make to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Hyndman recalled a conversation a few years later with St. Louis
coach Joey Clarke, who told Hyndman: ``We always thought you might
have had Clark Hunt out there because he was Clark Hunt. All the
time we were trying to go at him, because of his name, and then we
found out later, he was your best defender.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Glass worked for the Royals before his dad became the owner.
He spent 1994-95 as a baseball operations assistant and 1996-98 as
assistant director of player personnel, a position that gave him
the responsibility for developing the club's Latin American
program.
</P>
<P>
   Under Glass' direction, the Royals built a dormitory and
upgraded practice facilities and initiated classes for
Spanish-speaking players, teaching them English and how to adapt to
American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We loved to see him come to the Dominican, because he took
everyone out to dinner,'' Royals second baseman Carlos Febles said.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing fancy, mind you. Just trips to Burger King with about 40
or so players in tow.
</P>
<P>
   When Dan Glass joined the organization, it could have been easy
for some Royals front-office officials to question his
qualifications and wonder whether he had a job only because David
Glass was the chairman of the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time, Dan wanted to be here because Dan wanted to
learn this business,'' said Jay Hinrichs, senior director of
operations and administration. ``We didn't think he used his
influence to talk to his father as chairman of the board or to
influence any players' careers, our careers or any of our
decisions. I think he left business at business and family at
family. That's a trait his family instilled in him, and he can
separate the two.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass, who has a son, Dayne, 18, and daughter, Danielle, 16, and
lives in Olathe, Kan., left the organization in 1999 when his
father was negotiating to buy the Royals. He did some real estate
development and dabbled in the stock market, but most of all he
discovered how much he missed baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's defining his role in replacing Mike Herman, longtime
club president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be very hands-on,'' Dan Glass said. ``I want to know
each one of our players and know about their families. I care about
all these guys. A lot of these kids, like (Mike) Sweeney, Febles,
(Carlos) Beltran, I grew up with in the minor leagues. They're
almost like part of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Glass learned from Sam Walton, he views management as a
team effort, one that includes his father, Herk Robinson and the
rest of the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask me who's running the organization, my dad and Herk
are running it, and we all have input,'' Dan Glass said. ``It's not
really by consensus, but being smart and using all your people.
Some of your best ideas come from the bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe that's a lot of my role right now, to think about what
we need to improve and be able to implement some of those good
ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark Hunt works alongside Lamar Hunt at Unity Hunt in a
skyscraper in downtown Dallas. Clark runs the business side of the
family's companies, including Hunt Financial Group and Hunt Capital
Group, and for the past 10 years has been responsible for creating
several investment funds that manage more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Hunt spent two years as a financial analyst for Goldman,
Sachs and Co., before joining his father's office in 1989 _ the
first season that Carl Peterson was the club's president and
general manager and Marty Schottenheimer was head coach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Clark Hunt saw the Chiefs reach the playoffs again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been very fortunate in Kansas City to have Carl Peterson
over the past 11 years,'' he said, ``and Carl and Marty get the
credit for turning the franchise around from the difficulties we
had in the '80s, and that has been a very good lesson for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamar Hunt's ownership style is to let the football people make
the football decisions and the front-office executives make the
administrative decisions, an approach Clark advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Clark Hunt has some contact with Peterson but deals mostly with
Dennis Watley, a senior vice president who oversees sales,
marketing and stadium operations for both the Chiefs and the
Wizards. Watley compares the son's attention to detail to his
father's.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City is also a second home for Hunt because his wife,
Tavia, a former Miss Kansas, is a graduate of Lee's Summit High
School. Tavia was working for the Chiefs' public relations
department in 1991 when a club employee suggested that she meet
Clark Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into the stadium carrying all my bags, pushed the
elevator button, the doors opened, and when I saw this young lady,
I thought, `This must be her,' &UR; '' Hunt recalled. ``We didn't meet
at that time, because people don't talk on elevators. We met at the
kickoff luncheon, August 26, 1991.''
</P>
<P>
   They were married in 1993 and now have a 1-year-old daughter,
Gracelyn, whom they call Gracie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Clark was a little boy, he played all kinds of ball,''
Tavia Hunt said, ``and I think it's genetic, because `ball' was our
1-year-old's first word.''
</P>
<P>
   The Royals' and the Chiefs' leases at the Truman Sports Complex
expire in 2015, and there's an undercurrent of concern and
insecurity in Kansas City about whether the Arkansas-based Glass
family would move the Royals or whether the Hunts would ever return
their franchise to its Texas roots.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be little ground for concern.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs have led the NFL in attendance for six straight
years, and Hunt said plans were in the works to continue upgrading
Arrowhead with wider concourses and more suites so it would keep
pace with the newer stadiums in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chiefs have the greatest fan support in the NFL,'' Clark
Hunt said, ``and I couldn't imagine any kind of scenario where they
wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Glass also envisions continued improvements at Kauffman Stadium,
which would mean more revenue for the club as well as amenities for
fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is going to be here forever,'' Dan Glass said.
``This is a great baseball town. They're great fans. They deserve a
team here.''

FOR NEW GENERATION OF DONORS, SPENDING TIME AS WELL AS MONEY IS THE
KEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFFREY SPIVAK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ ``What could it be this time?'' Kevin Mallot
thought when Peter Mallouk sent him e-mail about going out to
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The two Generation X-ers had been buddies for four years, long
enough for Mallot to expect the unexpected, like being a model for
a book about kissing. So there they sat at a Westport bagel shop,
munching matching turkey sandwiches, when the then-29-year-old
Mallouk broached his next scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start a charity,'' he told Mallot.
</P>
<P>
   Mallot swallowed his food, leaned back and laughed. After all,
they were well-paid businessmen, certainly not millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Then a few minutes later, Mallot agreed to join the charity's
board _ and last summer they joined a burgeoning philanthropic
movement.
</P>
<P>
   Charity isn't just for retired folks anymore. Young
professionals are pursuing philanthropy now, and they're taking a
different approach to giving than old-line tycoons such as a
Rockefeller or even a Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   The new donors give their expertise, not just their money. They
are getting directly involved with a cause, applying the same
hands-on management style they brought to their professions. So
instead of putting their names on a building, they want something
else:
</P>
<P>
   Results.
</P>
<P>
   Dalene Bradford of the Greater Kansas City Community Foundation
and Affiliated Trusts calls this phenomenon a ``new style of
donor.'' Peter Karoff with a Boston-based philanthropic consulting
firm calls it ``a new kind of philanthropy.'' And Paul Schervish,
one of the nation's foremost sociologists of the rich, calls it ``a
sea change in the dynamics of charitable giving.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mallouk and Mallot, their cause involved rounding up 11 more
pals, creating a charitable fund at the community foundation and
then acting like venture capitalists in picking an investment. They
decided to create a child-safety program.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're raising $1 million, creating a curriculum and
coordinating construction themselves. Recently the group _ calling
itself KC CAN, for Kansas City Children's Assistance Network _
gained its first sizable pledge, $100,000 from a local foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Here and across the country, this new kind of philanthropy is
being driven by new wealth. This is an era of initial public
offerings, surging stock portfolios, business buyouts and
baby-boomer inheritances. Each day, it seems, produces more instant
millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City has become a hotbed for the new philanthropy. The
city's community foundation has led the nation in the amount of new
gifts. That is because the foundation is tailored toward the new
style of donor.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a chance
</P>
<P>
   It was Christmastime when Peter and Veronica Mallouk had one of
those unplanned husband-wife chats that turned their lives in a
different direction.
</P>
<P>
   They were driving along Linwood Boulevard, headed back to south
Overland Park, Kan., from a party. The gathering had been for New
Horizons Assistance Corp., which cares for mentally disabled
adults. Veronica had recruited volunteers from her job at Andersen
Consulting in Overland Park to serve the food. Peter had been the
deejay. It had gone well. So well that New Horizons officials had
asked both to join their board.
</P>
<P>
   Should they? That's what they discussed that December night in
1998. Veronica had been a volunteer as long as she could remember:
March of Dimes walk-a-thons as a kid. Teaching Sunday school in
college. Organizing charity events at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already do a lot,'' Peter told his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to do more,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   The Mallouks asked 15 friends, such as Mallot, 27. They included
an investment adviser, an architect, a teacher and some technology
consultants at Andersen Consulting. Almost all agreed.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mallouk then started researching how to put together a
charitable board. By chance, he was steered to the local community
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The organization had spent the past few years reinventing
itself. It had found a niche as a sort of middleman for donors,
setting up meetings with financial advisers and with possible
beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Donor funds rolled in. During the 1990s the number of new funds
jumped sixfold, to 550. New contributions jumped tenfold. Two years
ago the foundation reached $120 million _ the most money received
by any community foundation in the country that year. It topped
that last year with $142.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation doesn't track whether funds come from estates or
Gen X-ers, but officials estimate that one-fifth of contributions
reflect the new style of giving.
</P>
<P>
   There's Kent Humphrey. He spent 18 months taking care of his
wife, who had a brain tumor. After she died in 1998, he started a
fund to pay for things caregivers like him didn't have time for,
such as cleaning the house. Now he's promoting the concept to
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   There's Tom Brown. His mother, Virginia, grew up with crooked
teeth, but her parents could not afford braces for her. Eventually
Virginia got them, and late in life she set up a fund to pay for
children's orthodontic work. Now Brown, a local attorney, screens
applications and makes doctor appointments.
</P>
<P>
   And there's Cynthia Gunn. The local television anchor and
reporter set up a fund to pay for daylong self-help seminars.
They're geared toward high school freshman girls in Kansas City to
coach them about careers, health and relationships. She organizes
the seminars every year.
</P>
<P>
   These new donors have old reasons for giving: passion; prestige;
politics; even tax breaks. But they have new causes, tipping the
balance of the community foundation's grants. The percentage going
to the arts has climbed, thanks to funds set aside for Science City
at Union Station, while those going toward health have dipped.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the average fund the community foundation manages is
$500,000. Most are under $100,000. That's not much compared with
what some lesser-known instant millionaires are doing elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lovejoy of Seattle was the fifth employee in the door
at Amazon.com and now, at age 30, he's overseeing a $2.5 million
foundation with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Trish Millines Dziko, who also lives on the West Coast, quit
Microsoft after eight years and founded an organization devoted to
teaching African-Americans about computers.
</P>
<P>
   And on and on. Philanthropic networks are popping up all over to
deal with this phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of people with modest sums are doing this,'' said Karoff,
president of the Philanthropic Initiative in Boston. ``There's a
yearning on the part of donors for values and a greater sense of
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of a search for meaning in our lives that is going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   The right cause
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mallouk and his board were searching, too. For a cause.
</P>
<P>
   They had money going from paychecks toward their fund. They had
a name picked out, focusing on children. But still no cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a panic at one point,'' Mallouk said.
</P>
<P>
   The community foundation invited him to a meeting at Children's
Mercy Hospital. Mallouk arrived and immediately received a tour. He
was shown different equipment that had been donated.
</P>
<P>
   After the tour Denise Dowd, medical director for the hospital's
childhood safety center, made a presentation. She recited the
hospital's commitment to redesigning playground equipment, speaking
at schools, creating a mock street where kids learn how to be safe.
They didn't have the time or money for that mock street yet, but...
</P>
<P>
   Hold it right there, Mallouk thought. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   He took it back to his board. Members were all for it. They
pledged to build what's called Safety Street, a full-size indoor
reproduction of an actual city street, with working traffic lights,
cars, buses and bikes. It's based on an existing program in New
York City and teaches children what to do and not do on a street.
</P>
<P>
   Mallouk's board is doing all the planning: John Taylor is
hatching the building plan; Mike Keegan is making fund-raising
pitches; Kurt Hogan is creating a Web site; Elise Barton is
developing the teaching lessons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, something like the United Way is a little bit
frustrating,'' Barton said. ``You have a one-day involvement (in
filling out a form), but you don't see where your money is going.
The greater reward is getting to participate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Health Department has donated land at 24th and
Campbell streets. Safety Street is scheduled to open there in the
fall of 2001.

   BROOKFIELD, Mo. _ Odd what can animate a Missouri town. Here,
it's a tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, it's the obelisk-shaped marker of the Rev. Bernard
J. Bettelheim, dead 130 years and now being resurrected, at least
metaphysically, thanks to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to the worn marble gravestone in Rose Hill
cemetery, John A. Swearingen, a lawyer, noted that while nearby
Laclede could claim General of the Armies John J. Pershing, and
that Marceline, just to the east, produced a fellow named Walt
Disney who drew cartoons, Brookfield now has Bernard J. Bettelheim.
</P>
<P>
   Bettelheim?
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely. In fact, the man's resume makes Pershing's and
Disney's accomplishments, at least in terms of variety, look
downright spare.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard J. Bettelheim was a Hungarian Jew; a rabbinical student;
a physician; a scientist whose specialty was the eradication of the
cholera scourge; a linguist conversant in 20-plus languages; a
convert to the Anglican faith; a friend of famed African explorer
David Livingston; a world traveler; a Christian missionary to
Okinawa; a translator of the Bible's King James version into
Japanese, its Okinawan dialect and Chinese; Commodore Matthew
Perry's interpreter in the 1853 opening of Japan; an emigrant to
the United States in the late 1850s; a Civil War Union Army
surgeon; and a Brookfield businessman.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's an eclectic resume.
</P>
<P>
   When Bettelheim died in 1870, age 59, hundreds here turned out
for his funeral. He owned property all over the surrounding area
and in Brookfield, then a boom town with hopes of greatness. People
spoke of the man as the ``Trailblazer of Western Civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bettelheim became a forgotten man. His marble monument here
weathered and was rarely noticed, because it was in the older part
of the burying ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look in that section and you see what look to be big empty
spaces,'' Swearingen said. ``But it's full. In those first years
here there were lots of epidemics and lots of mass graves. And many
of the graves weren't marked then, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Halfway around the world, in a cemetery at Naha, Okinawa, is
another, far more imposing, monument, erected in 1926 to
commemorate the 80th anniversary of Bettelheim's arrival on the
island as a Christian missionary. One of the stones in the
monument, 2 feet by 2 feet by 6 inches, was donated by the
Bettelheim family and cut by the Bain Monument Co. here in
Brookfield.
</P>
<P>
   On the huge shaft of the memorial are Japanese characters
telling of Bettelheim's life and work. Atop the monument, in the
English alphabet, is ``B.J. Bettelheim, 1811-1870.''
</P>
<P>
   In Okinawa and Japan, groups hold symposiums on Bettelheim. Four
years ago there was a sesquicentennial celebration of his arrival
there in 1846. He is mentioned in church services among the
Christian communities in the islands. What papers and records he
left behind are jealously guarded, open only to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   In Brookfield, for all those years, nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Swearingen blames the Depression: ``His children went on after
he died. They were part of the community. Business people. There's
even a Bettelheim Building here.
</P>
<P>
   ``But from what I can learn, the hard times of the 1930s pretty
well ruined them. They moved on. And without them, without their
influence, there was nobody to remind people.''
</P>
<P>
   Bettelheim's revival, said Swearingen, occurred because of a man
in St. Louis in the late 1980s and the emergence of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Leslie Konnyu, after years of research, privately
published The Bettelheim Memorial Album, written in English,
Hungarian and Japanese. Konnyu, who died in the early 1990s, was a
poet, a geographer, a historian and an academic. He was also the
founding editor of The American Hungarian Review, a journal devoted
to the accomplishments of that nation's emigres.
</P>
<P>
   Finding Bettelheim, for Konnyu, must have been like winning the
lottery, Swearingen said.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, shortly after the monograph was published, Wanda
Harwood, a historian here, learned of it and adapted part of it for
an article. Swearingen said nothing really happened when Harwood's
piece appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``People sort of said, `Well, that's interesting,' and went on
about their business.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be Swearingen, exploring the Internet a couple of years
ago, who would come upon a small and vague reference to Konnyu's
book. There were plenty of references to ``Bettelheim'' on the Web.
But all but a few dealt with Bruno Bettelheim, a famous American
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I got Konnyu's book on interlibrary loan out of St.
Louis,'' Swearingen said. ``I couldn't believe it. So I started
taking it around to people here. You'd show it to them, and their
eyes sort of would glaze, but when they'd read it their jaws fell
open.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Swearingen was sending e-mail to Japan and
Okinawa filling out the picture of the man who has to be
Brookfield's most famous resident. He has a stack of replies from
people in those two places who are delighted Brookfield has
rediscovered Bettelheim.
</P>
<P>
   Swearingen thinks in time there could ultimately be another
monument to Bettelheim in one of the city parks.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dorsey, Brookfield's mayor, said that the Bettelheim story
was fascinating, but that any memorial would be a couple of years
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is John's baby,'' he said. ``He's doing the research. But
people are getting interested. I have to tell you that for years
I've gone by that Bettelheim building and never given it a second
thought. Not one. And then we find all this out.''
</P>
<P>
   Swearingen acknowledged having an occasional ``what if''
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was a man who was obviously talented,'' he said. ``So you
wonder that if he had lived, if he had become a real force, what
might have happened to this town? Back then, in the late 1860s,
this was a small city when Kansas City was just a collection of
shacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if Bernard Bettelheim had used his powers of persuasion _
and you know he had some _ to go to the movers and shakers, the
railroad barons, and they had decided Brookfield was the place to
build and develop?
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, those are just daydreams. But they're fun to think
about, especially when you go out to Rose Hill and see his old
monument.''

 UNDATED: human genome.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This charge has not resonated well. ``I strongly disagree with
that,'' said Dr. David Lipman, director of the National Center for
Biotechnology Information, which runs GenBank. ``These groups
understood when they deposited their data that the whole goal was
to make it available without restrictions immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lipman supports another position being taken by the
consortium, that journal editors should refuse to accept Celera's
article on its human genome sequence until the company has first
deposited its data in GenBank. Genome sequences are mind-numbing
rows of A's, T's, C's and G's that would take hundreds of pages if
printed in full. Many journal editors require authors of genome
articles to deposit the sequence in GenBank's computers as a
condition of publication.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Lipman said GenBank did not have the resources to accommodate
Celera's request that its data, if deposited in GenBank, should
receive legal protection from copying by its commercial rivals.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The two teams are negotiating with rival journals to publish
their descriptions of the genome _ the consortium with Nature of
London, Celera with Science of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the customary scientific practice of waiting for
publication until announcing a new discovery, the two sides are
likely to issue claims of success well before their articles appear
in print. To pre-empt Celera's article in Science, the consortium
may hope to enlist Clinton and Blair again in an announcement,
perhaps early next month, that it has achieved its rough draft of
the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   To pre-empt the consortium's declaration of victory, Venter may
make it known, perhaps this week, that he has successfully
assembled the human genome, the final stage in decoding and in
principle a large step ahead of the rough draft stage reached by
the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have already found fault with the other's victory
plans.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium's data is in a mixture of states. Though some
regions of the 3 billion-unit human genome, like the short
chromosome 22, are essentially complete, much of the rest is in the
form of millions of short pieces of DNA, most of them about 10,000
units of DNA in length. Although the consortium knows roughly where
each piece should go on its parent chromosome, it does not know
exactly enough to place all the pieces in correct order.
</P>
<P>
   Venter has said that anything worthy of being called a human
genome sequence needs to be arranged in correct order, which the
consortium's rough draft is not.
</P>
<P>
   If Venter's whole genome shotgun approach works as well with the
human genome as it did with the fruit fly, Celera's version of the
genome will all be in correct order.
</P>
<P>
   Celera's genome is likely, however, to have lots of gaps. The
gaps in its fruit fly genome sequence were mostly small holes of
known length and position that could be filled in later and were of
minor significance. But Dr. Robert Waterston, head of the
sequencing center at Washington University, St. Louis, a leading
component of the consortium, has calculated that there could be
100,000 gaps in Celera's human genome sequence, with an especially
large number in regions where Celera has no consortium data to rely
on.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even though the consortium's rough draft will not be completely
ordered and will contain many gaps, it will nonetheless be of great
value to researchers. Most of the genes are contained within the
decoded regions and can be fished out by computer search programs,
Lipman said.
</P>
<P>
   With Celera's fully assembled genome, it will be possible both
to search for genes and to compare the human genome with other
genomes, an important step in understanding how the human genome
works.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the battle of rival claims, one certain winner will be the
public. Because of the competition, the human genome sequence and
all the benefits expected to flow from it will be available to
researchers and pharmaceutical companies more than four years ahead
of the original target date of 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they both represent remarkable achievements,'' said
Dr. William Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences.

PRESIDENT OF SOUTH AFRICA DETAILS QUEST TO GRASP AIDS DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to rewrite top quotations, picking up original text at `In
this strikingly...')  
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa _ For months, President Thabo Mbeki says,
he pored through medical journals, consulted with scientists and
struggled to understand the epidemiology of the AIDS epidemic that
is ravaging his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was so big that I personally felt that I wanted to
understand this matter better,'' Mbeki said Saturday as he
addressed an advisory panel of international AIDS researchers here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm reading all these complicated things, language I don't
understand,'' he said. ``So I pile through lots and lots of
research documentation. I've got dictionaries all around me in case
there are words that are difficult to understand. I phone the
minister of health and ask her what does this word mean and she
explains.''
</P>
<P>
   In this strikingly personal speech, Mbeki offered his first
detailed explanation of how he came to consult with two Americans
who argue that HIV does not cause AIDS. The decision, which became
public two months ago, quickly touched off a firestorm of
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Leading scientists have criticized him for wasting time on
discredited theories while South Africa is suffering one of the
highest HIV infection rates in the world. Some researchers have
called for a boycott of an international AIDS conference that is
scheduled to be held here in July.
</P>
<P>
   And as prominent American newspapers published editorials last
month condemning his stance, some government officials here began
to fear that the issue would overshadow Mbeki's first state visit
to the United States, set for May 20, a visit that some had hoped
would focus on South Africa's blossoming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Mbeki said that he and his ministers knew that the
human immunodeficiency virus caused AIDS. He said he reached out to
the Americans when he discovered how differently the disease
appeared in sub-Saharan Africa as compared with the United States
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.N. AIDS program, two types of HIV are
currently recognized, and the most common, HIV-1, has 10
genetically distinct subtypes.
</P>
<P>
   Subtype B, which is most commonly transmitted through homosexual
contact and intravenous drug use, is primarily found in the
Americas, Europe, Australia, Japan and the Caribbean. Subtype C,
most often found in South Africa and India, seems to be more
infectious with a higher potential for heterosexual transmission,
the United Nations says.
</P>
<P>
   When he could not find satisfying explanations for such
differences, Mbeki said, he began exploring the work of researchers
who believe that poverty and malnutrition are more likely causes of
the disease in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for an answer because all of the information
that has been communicated says in reality that we are faced with a
catastrophe,'' Mbeki explained in his speech at the Sheraton Hotel
here. ``And you can't respond to a catastrophe merely by saying, `I
will do what is routine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki refused to dismiss the work of the American researchers
David Rasnick, a biochemist, and Peter Duesberg, a professor of
biochemistry and molecular biology at the University of California
at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are included in the government's 33-member advisory
panel, which met Saturday for the first time and will advise Mbeki
on the cause and best treatments for AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The panel is evenly split between those who believe that HIV
causes AIDS, including Professor Luc Montagnier of the Pasteur
Institute in Paris, whose research team discovered the virus _ and
those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   But the uncharacteristically personal speech did offer some rare
insight into Mbeki. As he described his efforts to understand HIV,
which has infected more than 3 million people in this country of 44
million, he portrayed an intensely driven, hands-on leader who is
reluctant to leave critical decision-making to others.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Lodge, a professor of political science at the University of
the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said: ``In one way, of course,
it's an admirable indication of an extremely conscientious and
intelligent chief executive. But I think he's also a compulsive
interferer. There is a medical establishment. You leave, as it
were, to the experts certain things that require expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar criticisms come from doctors in the medical community
here, on this and other aspects of the government's handling of
AIDS policy.
</P>
<P>
   In March, government officials scrambled to explain how $6.2
million of the country's $17 million AIDS budget went unspent last
year. And last year, Mbeki stunned health experts by questioning
the safety of the standard anti-AIDS drug AZT. The government has
decided not to distributed the drug in public hospitals here, even
though the National Institutes of Health in the United States has
determined that the benefits of the drug far outweigh the potential
side effects.

BIG UNIT HAS IT `SEVERELY LOCKED IN'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Arizona lefty Randy Johnson is a few more wins
from his second straight Cy Young award with the Diamondbacks,
thanks to an unreal April in which Johnson went 6-0 with a 0.91
ERA.
</P>
<P>
   But just how dominant he's been is better illustrated by his
complete- game win Friday in which he allowed one earned run and
had his ERA go up. It ballooned all the way to 0.93 to go with his
7-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he keeps doing this, we'll be looking for the cape in his
locker,'' Arizona pitching coach Mark Connor said. ``What is there
to say? I've seen it so much it doesn't amaze me. He's just
severely locked in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's six victories in April tied Dave Stewart and Vida Blue
for the most wins in the month, but Johnson was even more dominant.
Stewart was 6-0 with a 2.98 ERA for Oakland in 1988. Blue was 6-1
with a 1.19 ERA for the A's in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely focused, and good things have been happening,''
Johnson said. ``I feel very blessed with my ability I've been going
out there with. It's a great reward with the work I put into it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson's superb start should get a test Wednesday when the
Dodgers face him at Bank One Ballpark. Randy Johnson is 1-4 with a
4.27 ERA in his regular-season career against Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson. Randy Johnson also had trouble in two playoff starts
against Davey Johnson's Baltimore Orioles in 1997. The Big Unit
went 0-2 with a 5.54 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Wait 'til next year: Cubs pitcher Kerry Wood allowed one run in
six innings in his return to the majors Tuesday, but don't expect
to see the best of the young right-hander for another year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors tell you, `Next year he's going to be
Secretariat,' '' Cubs manager Don Baylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing pitches with complete ease mentally is the issue with
pitchers coming back from major arm injuries. Typically, that
comfort doesn't come until the second year of pitching after the
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``They get better for almost two years,'' said Dodgers team
physician Dr. Frank Jobe, who didn't perform the surgery on Wood
but is a pioneer of arm surgeries. ``In the second year they have
confidence built up, and then they go all out. I bet you (Wood's
statistics) will be better in the second year than they are this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   Throw inside, will fight: Even with long suspensions handed out
by Frank Robinson stemming from the fight between the Detroit
Tigers and Chicago White Sox, Giants manager Dusty Baker doesn't
think it will prevent such events in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably just make some guys want to meet guys by the
bus (to fight),'' Baker said. ``In the old school, guys would just
meet by the bus. The three-strike rule hasn't stopped crime. The
jails are fuller than ever. The death penalty hasn't stopped people
from killing.''
</P>
<P>
   Harried Hampton: Maybe Mets lefty Mike Hampton should have
thought a little more about signing a contract extension before the
season because he's certainly losing a bundle of money with the way
he's started.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was acquired from Houston for Octavio Dotel and Roger
Cedeno to be the Mets' staff ace. He's anchoring them, all right,
holding them down. Hampton won 22 games and had a 2.90 ERA last
season, but this season, he can't find the plate. He's walked 36 in
38 innings and is 2-4 with a 6.52 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason (Tom) Glavine gets those pitches outside, But
if you're all over, you're not going to get calls like the call
today. You're not going to get the flip of the coin.''
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Barry Bonds became the first player to hit a ball
on a fly into McCovey Cove, the channel of water beyond the
right-field fence at Pac Bell Park. ... The Colorado Rockies
finished a six-game homestand Wednesday in which their pitchers
allowed 8.83 runs a game, but the Rockies went 4-2. Colorado
averaged 10.83 runs a game. ... Philadelphia lost a team-record 17
games in April.

TEAMS HOLD BREATH AS PLAYERS AWAIT BIDDING WAR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The second round of the playoffs begin in earnest
today, but for some first-round casualties, the breakups are
already beginning.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto, San Antonio, Charlotte and Detroit, there's an
uneasy feeling as the hearts of the franchise all consider leaving
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   No team is in a worse position than the Raptors, who are
frantically trying to think of ways to convince 20-year-old phenom
Tracy McGrady to stay in Canada. McGrady says he'll only stay if
Vince Carter agrees to sign a long-term deal with Toronto in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league wants a guy like Vince Carter in the
States,'' McGrady said. ``A team like Chicago, a big media market.
I don't know what Vince wants to do, but when his two years are up
I don't want to be wondering whether he's going to stay or not. I
have to know up front.''
</P>
<P>
   McGrady's comments are widely seen as posturing, however, with
everyone expecting him to sign a huge contract with either No. 1
choice Orlando or Chicago, because they have the most salary cap
room.
</P>
<P>
   In a slightly better but just as stressed-out position is San
Antonio, which is monitoring every move Tim Duncan makes as he
flirts with leaving the Spurs in a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``See that Suburban over there,'' teammate Sean Elliott said the
day after the season, referring to an SUV parked inside the
Alamodome. ``Drive it to (a bad neighborhood) and leave it there
for three days. Then go back and see how much has been stripped.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this team will look like if Tim Duncan leaves.
There might be a window switch left.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Duncan isn't offering any clues about where he will
play next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to take some time off to get my body back into shape,
relax then start talking about it in a couple of weeks,'' Duncan
said. ``A couple of weeks after that, I hope to make my decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando is also a popular destination for Duncan, because it
offers plenty of cap room and warm weather.
</P>
<P>
   We'd say Charlotte is losing sleep over the status of Eddie
Jones, but no one really knows what the Hornets are thinking on any
issue these days. They keep whining about moving the franchise,
because the city is not bowing to demands for a new arena, and now
they're dropping hints that they may not even offer Jones the
maximum amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell (all the teams that want me) I love them,' Jones
joked. ``Orlando, Chicago, the Clippers. Who else has money? But
seriously, it's not about the money. It's about putting
championship rings on my fingers.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Jones won't be back in Charlotte next season.
</P>
<P>
   Things are less nerve-racking in Detroit, where the Pistons
actually believe they will re-sign Grant Hill. In fact if anyone
leaves Detroit, it could be Jerry Stackhouse, whose salary ($5.3
million) would clear some cap room.
</P>
<P>
   Who's No. 1?: The Lakers' surprising five-game series with
Sacramento hasn't gone unnoticed throughout the league, although no
one is quite ready to knock them off their perch as the team to
beat in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thinks any team is invincible,'' Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``I would still say they're the
prohibitive favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is saying it's the Lakers' championship to lose,''
Philadelphia coach Larry Brown said. ``I don't really see a
clear-cut, dominant team in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The race has been wide open since Michael Jordan left, and
he's created a big hole that everybody's trying to fill,'' Miami's
Jamal Mashburn said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no one knows how to analyze the current playoff
situation better than Miami coach Pat Riley, who isn't about to
give his former employers (the Lakers) an edge.

   ``The defending champions (Spurs) went down. And there is
nobody, there is not one team left that has ever experienced one,
that knows how to win one,'' Riley said. ``We are starting from
sort of an equal basis that way, and so it's out there for somebody
to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Wizards update: No one is lobbying harder for the Washington job
than St. John's coach Mike Jarvis, who is desperate to find a pro
job. He's lost his top recruit, Darius Miles, who is turning pro,
and is putting out feelers everywhere that he is available. The
Wizards officially spoke to Lenny Wilkens this week, and GM Michael
Jordan intends to speak with former Bulls teammate John Paxson.
</P>
<P>
   Whither Westphal: Sonics coach Paul Westphal did a great job
this season, forcing Utah into a fifth game, but whether he returns
is dependent on whether temperamental superstar Gary Payton allows
management to bring him back.
</P>
<P>
   That means Westphal's chances are less than 50-50.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the league: If Vancouver dumps GM Stu Jackson, as
expected, he will probably return to working for the NBA's front
office again, where he was previously director of operations.

FOREIGNERS LEAVING SIERRA LEONE; HUNDREDS MORE MISSING

<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ Foreigners and officials with
international relief groups left Sierra Leone Saturday, as the
United Nations reported no progress in obtaining the release of
more than 300 of its peacekeepers and civilians kidnapped during
clashes last week with the rebel Revolutionary United Front.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred more Zambian peacekeepers are missing, U.N.
officials in New York said, though it was not clear whether they
had been taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the capital, as most people waited to see whether the
crisis would prove a bump toward a difficult peace or a descent
back into the chaos that engulfed the West African country in
recent years, rebel officials gave no indication of yielding to
diplomatic pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Foday Sankoh, the leader of the Revolutionary United Front, has
steadfastly denied his organization's involvement in the
kidnappings and the deaths of at least four Kenyan peacekeepers,
accusing the United Nations of causing clashes after trying to
force some of his men to lay down their weapons. The rebel
organization, which is nominally part of a power-sharing national
government, repeated its denials Saturday after Sankoh met with
officials from Nigeria and Mali.
</P>
<P>
   ``You now have a lot of fabrications, tall tales about the
RUF,'' Eldred Collins, the spokesman for the rebel group, said in
an interview at Sankoh's compound Saturday. Denying that the group
was holding any peacekeepers hostage, he added, ``They are
scattered in the bush because they do not know the terrain.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Freetown, the Kamajors, a militia that supported the
government, was reportedly rearming in its stronghold in the south.
Many Kamajors, like many rebels, had refused to lay down their
weapons as required by a nine-month-old peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Of the estimated 45,000 combatants in the country's nine-year
war, half are said to have given up their weapons. The actual
figure is probably a lot lower, and widespread fighting could
resume quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Given that history, and the fierce fighting in Freetown in which
thousands were killed or had their hands chopped off during a rebel
attack in January 1999, the capital's airport and helipads were
busy Saturday. Scores of officials of international relief groups,
including the World Food Program, and Lebanese and Nigerian
families were seen leaving.
</P>
<P>
   At a helipad just next to the United Nations' main building
here, 11 flights had carried passengers away. Most foreigners were
reportedly headed to neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for business today,'' said Solomon Johnson, an
official at the heliport. ``But it's not good for the country. It's
just one way. No coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the accord signed in July, all combatants should have
voluntarily given up their weapons months ago. But the warring
parties, and the Revolutionary United Front in particular, refused
to do so at several camps across the country.
</P>
<P>
   While the United Nations provided a $300 incentive, there was
little reason for the combatants to stay inside the camps for the
expected three months. Activities that were supposed to teach them
skills and help them reintegrate into society were never put into
place.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, U.N. peacekeepers had finally been deployed
into most areas of the country _ though never in the diamond mining
district of Kono to which the Revolutionary United Front still
clings. The peacekeepers encountered frequent obstacles erected by
the rebels; it was clear that the rebels remained in control of at
least half the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's incidents occurred just as the United Nations was
building up a presence _ with 8,300 soldiers already here _ on a
continent that the international community had avoided in recent
years, after failed missions in Rwanda and Somalia. The trouble in
Sierra Leone was expected to have a negative effect on the West's
willingness to send peacekeepers to Congo, a country involved in a
far more complex war.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, U.N. officials on Saturday continued to seek support
in speeding up troop deployments to Sierra Leone. The force had
been scheduled to reach its full strength of 11,000 by July.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, France and Britain, the former colonial
power, have said they will not send ground troops, though they are
considering technical and logistical help.

 &HT;    Vacationers rescue Haitian refugees

<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They dropped anchor near one of many deserted
tropical isles in the Bahamas, ready to relax. Somebody broke out a
bottle of German white wine, and the three couples settled in to
share stories of their adventures.
</P>
<P>
   What they saw next would become their most shocking tale of all.
</P>
<P>
   First, they noticed the gray hull of a sailboat. Just a flash of
mast that disappeared around a curve of the barren Flamingo Cay.
Then, a dozen people staggered over the crest of the island, waving
yellow flags and empty water containers, their dark faces a sharp
contrast to the white sand. The three couples watched as the beach
filled with ailing families and made a decision that would save
lives _ 288 in all.
</P>
<P>
   The people they would comfort and nourish were refugees fleeing
Haiti who had been marooned late last month without food or water
after a desperate 11-day sea journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were relaxing and talking like old friends do,'' Carol
Ogden, 50, of Port St. Lucie, Fla., said by telephone from
Georgetown, the Bahamas, on Thursday. ``When we saw people coming
over the hill, we knew something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Jack; their friends, Dr. Peter Berry and
his wife, Louise, from Atlanta, and another couple piled into
dinghies and came ashore at about 5 p.m. There they found the first
of two dead bodies awash in the surf and a crowd of desperate men,
women and children. Berry, a retired physician, quickly saw that
the Haitians couldn't live more than 24 hours without water.
</P>
<P>
   He began sorting through the weak and battered group of some 80
to 100 refugees, attempting to care for them amid the chaos. None
of the rescuers spoke French, but a man named Etienne spoke a
little English. The boat's captain and crew spoke Spanish. ``Where
is the village?'' they asked. ``Which way to the States?''
</P>
<P>
   As more Haitians arrived from the other side of the rocky hill,
where Coast Guard officers later found a wrecked sailboat, the
American couples returned to their boats to begin generating fresh
water.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the refugees could barely swallow, Berry said. He had to
hold one pregnant woman's head while he poured water into her
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the Ogdens and Berrys distributed more than 200 gallons
of water while ministering to the Haitians April 26 and the next
day, until Coast Guard helicopters arrived with food and minimal
medical supplies.
</P>
<P>
   The couples left Flamingo Cay just before the last refugees, and
docked in Georgetown, the first port where the Haitians were
treated. There Berry, 60, was attempting to set up a fund for
sailors like himself to contribute to the medical clinic in
Georgetown to aid the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all drank a little too much rum trying to forget, but we
stayed up all night again. The images, they're hard to forget,''
said Berry, calling the fund ``a token effort.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all probably take away more than we give,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Haitians have recovered, and Bahamian authorities
have already returned about 200 to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   ESCAPE FRAUGHT WITH TRAGEDY
</P>
<P>
   Those shivering on Flamingo Cay that Wednesday evening were
among the first of what some officials fear will be a growing wave
of refugees headed for Florida's east coast, smuggled through the
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   That night, two brothers lifted their shirts to display burns
and bullet wounds and told retired real estate agent Jack Ogden,
56, about being shot and tortured in Haiti, their parents killed.
Others spoke of the 12 fellow passengers who died during the trip,
some from dehydration, some during the shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   A young mother handed her lethargic 3-month-old son, clad in a
pink dress, to Louise Berry, 59, and ran off. Berry brought the
infant back to her boat, cleaned him up and returned him, and a jug
of water, to his mother on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the group were so weak they never made it that far. As
darkness fell, the Ogdens and the Berrys had to search with
flashlights for Haitians in the bushes, too ill to move. When
Louise Berry discovered two men armed with a machete and a knife,
she demanded the weapons be handed over. They were.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Berry began evaluating the condition of the dehydrated
refugees as the Ogdens helped convert salt to fresh water using
pumps aboard their boat, the Motu, the Berry's boat, Tango, and the
other couple's boat, the Magic. They also brought what food they
had: loaves of bread, trail mix, tuna fish, beans, and rice packed
in Ziplock bags. Many Haitians could stomach only small portions,
and distribution provoked disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Between trips ferrying food and water to the beach, the Ogdens
tried to contact the Coast Guard on short wave radio. The couple,
described by neighbors in Port St. Lucie as accomplished boaters
familiar with the Bahamian waters, were unaware the Coast Guard no
longer monitored the frequency.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would later learn that passing sailboats heard
their distress signal, but only one chose to respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just said they couldn't handle it. It would have been
very helpful to have more water,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   When the group finally reached the Coast Guard on a satellite
phone aboard the Magic about 7:30 p.m., they were told it would be
hours before the nearest helicopter arrived from its Nassau station
400 miles away. They lit fires and flares on the beach _ and
waited.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL AND HUMANITARIAN EFFORTS NEEDED
</P>
<P>
   During their night on the island, Berry said many refugees
became sick while huddling in the rain, and two Haitians attempted
to board their sailboats. One stricken teenager swam out to sea and
drowned. Carol Ogden was still trying to radio for help when she
saw him vanish into the clear water.
</P>
<P>
   Then she heard moaning from a woman standing on the beach as the
Berrys pulled the body back to shore, a woman she knew instantly
was the teen's mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``That mournful wailing into the night, that is what I'll take
away with me,'' Carol Ogden, a former advertising executive said.
``Maybe it was naive, wishful thinking, but we believed someone
would help us. These people had tried everything, and things were
not going well.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Coast Guard helicopter could carry only 11 refugees,
and Berry had to choose them. Then he had to decide which four
among the sickest remaining on the island would get IVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people were unconscious. We had to pick the sickest. A
lot of it was pretty random,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard does not routinely patrol waters off Flamingo
Cay, according to Petty Officer Sylvia Olvera. Although officers do
get regular calls from sailors reporting possible aliens or
smugglers, she said the doctor's ability to treat refugees and
remain at the scene aided rescue efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He notified us, he was there and he took over,'' she said.
``He helped these people as best he could.''
</P>
<P>
   The two couples returned to Flamingo Cay two days after the
rescue and found the beach deserted, cleared of trash bags that
held the refugees' possessions, their plastic hangers and soaked
clothing. Although they hope the fund in Georgetown will help
future refugees, Peter Berry and Carol Ogden said the problem they
faced on the beach will not disappear as easily as the 288 refugees
without greater U.S. political aid and attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't feel the problems the Haitians are facing should be
solved on the beaches,'' Ogden said. ``People are always blaming
the Coast Guard for not getting there soon enough, but they cannot
solve the humanitarian issues.''

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: Bush reaches $10 million goal
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service Gov. George W. Bush reached his goal of
<TEXT>
raising a fresh $10 million by the end of April, and he plans to
keep going in an effort that could give him a big summer spending
advantage over likely Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore.
The vice president can spend only around $9 million more before the
Democrats' national convention in August under the limits he agreed
to in exchange for millions of dollars in taxpayer money. Bush, who
has not been accepting federal funds, can spend as much as he can
raise. That could give Bush, who already has spent a record $73
million on his presidential campaign, a huge financial edge. The
Republicans' convention begins July 31 in Philadelphia, the
Democrats' Aug. 14 in Los Angeles. After the conventions, Gore and
Bush each will receive $67.6 million in federal funds and cannot
raise any private money for their campaigns.
<P>
   BRADLEY, FEINSTEIN FAVORED DEMS FOR V.P.
</P>
<P>
   Former New Jersey senator and presidential candidate Bill
Bradley and California Sen. Dianne Feinstein were mentioned most
frequently when Democrats were asked who they want as vice
president, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released
Friday. Bradley was named by one-third of the Democrats and
Feinstein was named by one-fifth. The following other possible
candidates all received 6 percent in the poll: Florida Sen. Bob
Graham, Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh and former Maine Sen. George
Mitchell. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson received 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH COURTING CALIFORNIA LATINOS WITH NEW STYLE
</P>
<P>
   Bush on Friday predicted that he would win California, which has
the largest electorate vote, by courting the Latino vote and
marketing a new montage of images. He declared himself a
``different kind of Republican'' who could capture the state's 54
electoral votes. As if to prove his point, Bush's swing through
Southern California this week was heavy on style, if not always
substance. In two days, Bush ate tacos in heavily Hispanic Santa
Ana, chatted with residents in Spanish, met with youths in Mission
Viejo and celebrated Cinco de Mayo on Friday by meeting with
Hispanic leaders in San Diego County. Bush, who is methodist, also
attended a Roman Catholic Mass in Orange County, where most
Hispanics are Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   However, a Field Poll released earlier in the week shows that
although Hispanic voters have increased by 1 million in the past
decade, the overwhelming majority are Democrats. Sixty percent of
Hispanics polled said they are Democrats, 22 percent said they are
Republicans and 18 percent were not affiliated with any parties.
Many Hispanics said they remained alienated from the GOP, which led
fights during the 1990s against illegal immigration, affirmative
action and bilingual education.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN, BUSH SUMMIT PLANNED FOR TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited ``summit'' between Bush and Sen. John McCain on
Tuesday in Pittsburgh, is likely to produce smiles and handshakes,
but it is far less certain that the GOP rivals will manage the sort
of meaningful reconciliation that party regulars are hoping for.
McCain's advisers have said the Arizona senator will not formally
endorse Bush. That apparent coyness on McCain's part is disturbing
to some Republicans. McCain, Bush's former GOP opponent, has said
he is not interested in being Bush's running mate. Late Friday,
Bush told ABC-TV ``I would want to talk to him about it.''
</P>
<P>
   POT SHOT MISSES THE MARK
</P>

   Bush raised questions Friday about Gore's trustworthiness, but
also faced questions about his own credibility after asserting that
the vice president had once been a member of the National Rifle
Association. Gore aides said that, to their knowledge, he had never
belonged to the NRA. Bush said he was waiting for Gore himself to
definitively answer the question, and said that whether or not he
had been a member, Gore's voting record in Congress suggested he'd
once been a fervent backer of gun rights. ``My position is that
when it was convenient politically he voted one way, and when it's
convenient politically, he's changed his tune,'' Bush said. The
issue came up after Bush on Thursday told reporters: ``I've never
been a member of the NRA. Al Gore's been a member of the NRA, if
I'm not mistaken.''
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON FLUB COULD HELP BUSH
</P>
<P>
   In trying to help Gore, President Clinton inadvertently promoted
the wrong man Friday. Clinton was asked about a videotape that
portrayed the National Rifle Association as hankering to operate
out of a potential Bush White House. ``I don't know that they think
that (NRA Executive Vice President Wayne) LaPierre will literally
have an office here if President Bush _ I mean, if Governor Bush _
gets elected,'' Twice later, Clinton referred to Bush as the Texas
governor, to try to clear things up.

LASORDA WILL SELL YOU ON TEAM USA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Thirty minutes after being introduced Friday as
the manager of the 2000 United States Olympic Baseball Team, Tom
Lasorda was autographing a few baseballs. He made sure to put Team
USA under it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should put 2000 on it,'' someone said.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda snatched the ball back, looked at the person and ...
smiled wide.
</P>
<P>
   Perfect. Everything about it was so right.
</P>
<P>
   What's amazing is it took Major League Baseball and USA Baseball
a couple of months to make a decision that should have taken a
couple of minutes. Lasorda is a natural for this.
</P>
<P>
   There is no better man to be Olympic coach. There is no better
personality to sell baseball as an Olympic sport. He tried to sell
the Los Angeles Dodgers to everyone, but let's face it, Giants fans
and Padres fans and Yankees fans were raised to detest Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Now, even they have to adore him.
</P>
<P>
   About the only bad thing that can come from it is people who
grew up and grew fond of hating Lasorda might actually root for him
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the manager of the Dodgers for 20 years, I think a lot of
the Dodger fans really love me,'' Lasorda said. ``But now, the
whole country is supposed to love me because I'm representing the
whole country.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the quintessential Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   Very few cared about Olympic baseball before. Very few might
care about it in the future. But for two weeks in September, folks
will pay attention to what's taking place in Sydney, Australia. And
they'll do so for the sole reason of Lasorda being the manager.
</P>
<P>
   It's doesn't matter who the players are - though 40-man roster
guys from major-league teams will get the chance to participate for
the first time. It doesn't matter who the coaches are. What matters
is that Lasorda, one of the most recognizable men in baseball, will
be there.
</P>
<P>
   They know Lasorda in Asia, in Europe, in South America and
Central America. They love him everywhere, and everyone knows him.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Darren Dreifort is the only member of the Dodgers
to play in the Olympics, competing in Barcelona, Spain, in 1992. He
said the selection of Lasorda is perfect. The Americans are yet to
win the gold medal since baseball was sanctioned for the 1992
Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have probably the greatest ambassador to the game of
baseball there is, representing America's team, and that's not the
Atlanta Braves,'' Dreifort said. ``They picked the best guy to send
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams called Lasorda last week to find out why he hadn't
been named manager of the Olympic team yet. Lasorda knew he was the
leading candidate, but he wasn't sure what was holding it up.
</P>
<P>
   So Williams called the commissioner's office of Major League
Baseball to pitch Lasorda as the perfect guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me back and said, `Hey, I talked to them,' and they
said, `Hey, Ted, relax, don't worry, everything's OK,' '' Lasorda
said. ``I called him, and he was so thrilled to know that it was
official.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Lasorda wants Williams to come to Australia to talk to the
players before the Olympics begin.
</P>
<P>
   There will be some minor-leaguers on Team USA, maybe some
college kids. They grew up learning about Lasorda, about his
ability to motivate. They'd probably never have a chance to meet
Williams. Now, Williams could be giving the pregame speech.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't happening before.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda embodies Dodgers pride. Bleeding Dodger Blue is his
credo, and his enthusiasm never wanes, and his desire to motivate
never ceases.
</P>
<P>
   He cares deeply about winning the gold medal and representing
the United States. He'll probably make you care the same.

FLORIDA REBUTTAL OF PROTESTS OVER CUBAN BOY  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Responding to the numerous protests Cuban-Americans here
have mounted since federal agents seized custody of Elian Gonzalez
last month, thousands of residents turned out for a demonstration
of their own Saturday, lining sidewalks and filling vacant lots in
southern Dade County to support the American government.
</P>
<P>
   The counterdemonstrators, waving American flags and some
Confederate battle flags, and carrying signs reading ``Reno for
president,'' said they had been angered and insulted by the way
Cuban-Americans had protested the seizure of Elian, 6, from his
Miami relatives' home in Little Havana two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's demonstrators, mostly white and black, said they had
cringed while watching Cuban-Americans burn the American flag and
parade it upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the utmost disrespect for this country in the last
couple of weeks,'' said Robert Milton, a construction worker from
Homestead, a suburb south of Miami. ``It's like these people have
forgotten which country took them in and gave them freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I get sick to my stomach,'' he added. ``Someone needs to tell
them to show some respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Saturday's demonstrators, whom the authorities put at
more than 5,000, said they were still more angered by the attitudes
of local leaders who openly supported Elian's relatives in Miami.
The family had defied the federal government by refusing to turn
over the boy after his father asked that he be returned to his
custody in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they were disgusted at the public squabbling
between city officials.
</P>
<P>
   After the federal raid, Mayor Joe Carollo of Miami denounced the
police chief for not telling him in advance about the raid and
fired City Manager Donald Warshaw.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the police chief, William O'Brien, resigned, saying
he wanted no part of Carollo's administration. Warshaw remains in
office, after a judge temporarily halted his dismissal.
Demonstrators asserted Saturday in this conservative part of the
county that city and county officials had turned their backs on the
rest of the community. They carried signs with slogans like ``Crazy
Joe must go'' and ``I want a new county.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of what is happening in this city,'' said Kristen
Markovich, 31, of Perrine, another suburb south of Miami. ``The
politicians are making fools of themselves and the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hartwell, an organizer of the demonstration, said the
protesters' message had been effective, because of the strong
turnout. ``Miami was a one-sided city until now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators also accused Cuban-Americans of intimidating
anyone who did not share their hatred of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you disagree with the majority, you fear for your life, for
your family and for your job,'' said Marlene Kay, of Homestead.

WHAT ARE INDIANS TO DO ABOUT PEDRO?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Indians signed Chuck Finley so they would have
somebody to beat the Yankees, but what are they going to do to beat
the Red Sox?
</P>
<P>
   As long as Pedro Martinez gets multiple starts in a playoff
series, the Indians can't beat the Red Sox. Martinez is 7-0 vs.
Cleveland, but it has become more than just his 95-mph fastball and
deceptive changeup. Now, it's a mental thing.
</P>
<P>
   Indians pitcher Charles Nagy appeared to hit the Red Sox's Jose
Offerman intentionally, simply because Martinez !ital!pitched
inside!off! to Einar Diaz. Martinez didn't hit him, and he wasn't
trying to hit him and put a runner on base in a tight ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz had leaned out across the plate and hit a changeup on the
outside part of the plate for a double in his previous at-bat, and
the only way to get a hitter from sitting on that pitch is to come
inside with a fastball. It gives the hitter cause for hesitation
before jumping out across the plate.
</P>
<P>
   It worked, because Diaz struck out. But the psyched-out Indians
are so worried about Martinez, they started the mess by hitting
Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't beat him within the rules of the game so they have
to look at alternative ways to beat the kid,'' Red Sox general
manager Dan Duquette told Boston writers. ``This isn't anything
new. There's an intense rivalry between these clubs but our guys
stay within the rules of the game. We didn't hit anybody
(initially). These strategies that batters take of stepping out of
the box and taking a long time as a hitter, they're all designed to
upset Pedro because they can't beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   First to worst: The Texas Rangers have won the AL West each of
the past two years, but they made a number of changes going into
this year and so far, it hasn't come together.
</P>
<P>
   First and foremost is the nine-player trade that sent Juan
Gonzalez to Detroit. But pitcher Justin Thompson, a key component
of the deal, has been out all season with a shoulder injury. Rusty
Greer also is hurt, and now vagabond outfielder Chad Curtis is in
the starting lineup almost every day.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro has been bothered by a bad hamstring. The
bullpen, particularly reliever Jeff Zimmerman, isn't pitching like
it did last year. And the Rangers are depending heavily on young
outfielders Ruben Mateo and Gabe Kapler, and young third baseman
Mike Lamb.
</P>
<P>
   So the results - 12-16 and in last place in the AL West - are
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going in the direction we want to go,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ''We preach patience. We want to be
patient, but we're missing something. I thought we would be more
consistent. I honestly thought our offense would be more
consistent, top to bottom. I thought our bullpen would be a whole
lot better, and I thought our defense had a shot at being better
than it's shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Think again.
</P>
<P>
   A month to Dye for: Darin Erstad had an incredible month of
April, but it would be difficult to argue with the American
League's selection of Jermaine Dye as player of the month.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals outfielder became the first player in major league
history to get double figures in homers (11) and doubles (12)
before May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been in this type of mode before, but not in the big
leagues,'' Dye said. ``I can't explain it. You're on every pitch.
You're in a zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Short hops: Second baseman Randy Velarde, hurt for most of his
time with the Angels, hasn't played one inning with the A's this
season because of an injury. ... After Ken Griffey Jr. struck out
three times in a game against the Mets last week, the New York area
papers referred to him as Ken Whiffey Jr. ... Cal Ripken is a
record-breaker in a variety of all-time categories, including one
he'd rather avoid. When he grounds into two more double plays,
he'll tie Hank Aaron for the most in major-league history. ...
Orioles pitcher Scott Erickson was excused from the ballpark last
week so he could attend a People Magazine photo shoot. Erickson was
named to the magazine's 50 Most Beautiful People list. He was one
of three athletes on the list, and the only baseball player.

DESORMEAUX FINDS WAY OUT OF TROUBLE AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHON RAND  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Jockey Kent Desormeaux thrust his helmet
joyfully in the air with both hands Saturday after Fusaichi Pegasus
gave him his second Kentucky Derby victory in three years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Desormeaux didn't reach the winner's circle at Churchill
Downs until he got back in the good graces of a trainer with a top
3-year-old. He's now made the transition from the doghouse to being
top dog twice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux in 1995, at age 25, became the youngest rider ever to
win 3,000 races. But top trainers in southern California became fed
up when they considered too many of his rides uninspired, and they
stopped using him. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux mended his fences, though, and in 1998 Bob Baffert
put him on Real Quiet, which won the Derby and Preakness, then
finished second in the Belmont. Desormeaux publicly admitted he had
started to believe that he, not the horses, was responsible for
winning races and needed to be reminded that wasn't the case. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, however, Desormeaux was back in the doghouse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and Neil Drysdale, who trains Fusaichi Pegasus, were
unhappy with several of his rides and stopped using him during the
Del Mar meeting near San Diego. Drysdale resumed using Desormeaux
over the winter, but Baffert has not. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux has won all five races he's been aboard Fusaichi
Pegasus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a huge year the previous year.... We were just not in
tune with each other,'' Drysdale explained diplomatically. ``We
both felt it would be good to have a breather from each other.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When asked what it took for Desormeaux to get back on his
horses, Drysdale replied, ``Just a bit of time and his attitude.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux's attitude couldn't have been more upbeat when
Fusaichi Pegasus won the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct on April 19. The
colt's dominance that day established him as the inevitable
Kentucky Derby favorite. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Four days later, however, he and his wife, Sonia, learned their
year-old son, Jake, was deaf. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We were devastated,'' Desormeaux told the Daily Racing Form. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out, I had to take a deep breath and sit alone
for a while.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux was particularly distraught because he lost the
hearing in his right ear after a spill at Hollywood Park in 1992. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux's skillful maneuvering of Fusaichi Pegasus after the
horse's poor start Saturday demonstrated the brilliance that
convinces trainers to give him second chances. He didn't panic and
instead patiently moved Fusaichi Pegasus up the rail, then swung
the colt outside on the final turn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Fusaichi Pegasus, an alert start seemed crucial to his
chances to win, because he was breaking from the No. 15 post in a
19-horse field and usually runs just a few lengths off the
leaders. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The racing gods smiled on us, the rail opened up and he moved
up,'' Drysdale said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Desormeaux, Drysdale is smiling on him again,
too. &QL;

 &HT;    Fusaichi Pegasus outruns his reputation
 &HT;    By John Crittenden
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Behind most of the field at the start, favored
Fusaichi Pegasus spent most of the race maneuvering around horses
like a motorcycle dodging through a pack of tanks. But when he
burst into the lead at the top of the stretch, the Kentucky Derby
was over.
</P>
<P>
   In winning by 1/12 lengths over long shot Aptitude, Fusaichi
Pegasus elevated himself from prospect to wonder horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This pretty boy can run,'' said jockey Kent Desormeaux.
</P>
<P>
   While the other jockeys on the Derby challengers were pounding
at their horses at the finish, Desormeaux had put his whip away.
</P>
<P>
   Now racing has to wonder if any challengers will show up to take
on the Derby winner in two weeks at the Preakness Stakes in
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Purchased at auction two years ago for $4 million by Tokyo
software manufacturer Fusao Sekiguchi, the Kentucky-bred colt
destroyed almost all modern guidelines for picking Kentucky Derby
winners.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus became the first favorite to win the race since
Spectacular Bid in 1979. He is the first Wood Memorial winner to
take the Derby since 1981. No son of Mr. Prospector, long the most
successful of Kentucky sires, has ever won the Derby before.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers without Derby experience rarely finish first in the
race. Fusaichi Pegasus made Neil Drysdale a winner in his first
Derby. ``Humbling and rewarding,'' said Drysdale, named to the Hall
of Fame this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know this horse is lightly raced,'' said Drysdale, a
suggestion that the Derby winner, with just six races, is still
improving.
</P>
<P>
   The entries that were supposed to be prime challengers finished
far from the front.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy, trained by Jenine Sahadi, trying to be the first won
ever to win the Derby, came in 14th as the No. 2 betting choice.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Steve, from the barn of Bob Baffert, the Derby's winning
trainer in 1997 and 1998, led by a head after a mile, but came in
eighth, fading fast.
</P>
<P>
   High Yield, thought to be the best of the three Wayne Lukas
entries, was a baffling 15th at the finish, a neck ahead of Florida
Derby winner Hal's Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Todd Pletcher, with four horses in the race, was third
with Impeachment and fourth with More Than Ready, certainly a
successful introduction for a first-time Derby trainer. His other
two horses misfired, with Trippi 10th and Graeme Hall last.
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope held the lead for the first 3/4 mile, then was passed
by Captain Steve and Trippi. At the top of the stretch, Fusaichi
Pegasus was in the lead, with More Than Ready a head back and
Wheelaway in third by another head.
</P>
<P>
   Famous because of his price tag and his promise, Fusaichi
Pegasus, on this one day at least, was better than his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love challenges,'' his owner said through an interpreters.
``I love breaking records and setting new records.''
</P>
<P>
   Sekiguchi, 64, said he would have been willing to spend another
million to buy Fusaichi Pegasus. ``When I laid eyes on him two
years ago I knew he was a Derby winner,'' he said.
</P>

   A crowd of 153,204, the second biggest in Derby history, was at
Churchill Downs on an 82-degree afternoon. They got the smallest
win payoff ($6.60) on a Derby champion since Spectacular Bid. With
19 starters, the purse for the race was $1,188,400, biggest in the
126 years of the race.

   Sekiguchi gets a $150,000 bonus for his ownership of the horse
that won both the Wood and the Derby. Drysdale's share of the
Wood-Derby bonus is $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Derby winner came into the week before the race with the
reputation of being a wild horse, one who bucked and raged on the
practice track. Fusaichi was calm on Derby Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things he does on the track come from his inquisitive
temperament,'' said the owner. ``That was nothing to be concerned
about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Be sure he is comfortable early in the race,'' Drysdale told
Desormeaux in the saddling process. ``He will do the rest.'' That
worked out well.

FRANCE GOES ON THE OFFENSIVE AGAINST MAD COW DISEASE
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS for general rewrite. Deletes `ART' from slug.)  
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUELLAS, France _ At first the veterinarian said that it might
just be milk fever. Then the possibility of a brain tumor was
discussed. But as the laboratory took longer and longer to report
test results, Guy Jambon accepted the inevitable. One of his herd
had been infected with mad cow disease, although none had ever been
detected in this southeast region of France.
</P>
<P>
   The health department trucks came a few days later, on Feb. 18.
In one morning, all 670 of Jambon's cows were taken for slaughter
and incineration _ leaving the barns, the pens, the milking room
and the fields empty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part that got to you was how quiet it was,'' Jambon said.
``I was saying to myself, `We don't really understand anything. How
did the cow get this disease? How did this happen here?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jambon is not alone in raising such questions. The number of
cases of mad cow disease discovered in France, as in many other
countries in Europe, has been climbing steadily. The totals are
still minuscule compared with those in the United Kingdom, which
has reported 178,000 cases of the deadly degenerative brain disease
since 1986, and endured a four-year ban on its beef by other
European nations.
</P>
<P>
   But what many experts find alarming is that the numbers are
going up at all, given that strict preventive measures were ordered
in 1996, when scientists first linked mad cow disease, also known
as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, to a similar brain disease in
humans.
</P>
<P>
   Not only are totals rising, but more and more countries have
reported cases of the disease. It has now been discovered in
native-born cows in 10 European countries, including Portugal,
Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg
and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
   In France, the issue has been all over the front pages lately as
the pace of cases appears to be rising steeply this year. In 1997,
six cases were detected in France. In 1998, 18. Last year, it was
30. This year, 16 new cases have been reported already, roughly one
a week.
</P>
<P>
   Officials are so worried that they intend to begin random
testing of cows that have died after exhibiting suspicious behavior
before the start of summer. As many as 50,000 of France's 21
million cattle are expected to be examined each year under the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Hirsch, the head of France's new food safety agency, is,
like many other officials here, bracing himself for the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could certainly show that there is much more mad cow out
there than we have detected so far,'' Hirsch said. ``We just don't
know. There is so much we don't know about this disease, we can
hardly say with confidence that it is under control. We'll have to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   But French officials are not the only ones concerned. Earlier
this year, a group of scientists advising the European Union on the
issue warned that millions of Europeans may be at risk of catching
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the fatal human version of mad cow
disease, despite their governments' claims that their countries are
free of the disease. The European Union has been urging broader
preventive measures throughout its 15 member countries. But some
countries have refused, saying they do not have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see these measures taken,'' said Beate
Gminder, a spokeswoman for David Byrne, the food safety
commissioner for the European Commission, the executive body of the
European Union. ``The number of cases of mad cow may be much larger
than we know. It could be that cases exist much more extensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are still highly puzzled by the disease, which was
first recognized in cows in 1986. It appears that it is not caused
by a bacteria, a virus or a fungus, but stems from infectious
particles called prions, perhaps acting in concert with a virus or
other agent. The disease kills brain cells, leaving the organ full
of holes and resembling a sponge.
</P>
<P>
   Since the human form of the disease was first recognized in
1995, more than 35 people have died of it in Britain. Estimates of
how many people are likely to be infected range widely. Some
British scientists have speculated that another 75 people will die
of the disease in the next 20 years. Others say 80,000, depending
on the incubation period and how the infection is passed from
animal to human.
</P>
<P>
   No one yet knows how much infected meat someone must eat before
the lethal brain-wasting disease takes hold, or if some other
factor must be present, too. To date, efforts to prevent the
disease in cows have centered on eliminating animal feed that
contains infected animal parts.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts believe that, apart from foodstuffs and
cow-to-calf transmission, there may be a third, and yet unknown,
mode of transmission.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disease is one of the great mysteries of the century,''
Hirsch said. ``We don't know exactly what is the nature of this
disease, so we don't know what steps to take to prevent it. We do
have many questions about modes of transmission. We are looking at
different things.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So far, France has taken perhaps the most conservative position
in Europe, refusing to even accept British beef despite assurances
by European Union officials that it is as safe as any other beef on
the market. (The European Union is currently moving forward with a
lawsuit against France over the matter. )
</P>
<P>
   But while the European Union may feel France has gone too far in
trying to protect itself from British meat, it is urging many
European countries to take more precautions against mad cow disease
than they have been willing to take so far.
</P>
<P>
   Only seven European Union countries, including Britain and
France, have taken the strictest preventive measures. Not only do
they control the animal feed, but they also prevent the parts of
the cattle most likely to carry prions, including the brain, spinal
material and intestines, from even entering the food chain.
</P>
<P>
   The European Commission would like Austria, Denmark, Finland,
Germany, Greece, Sweden, Italy and Spain to do the same. (Italy and
Spain currently only ban the most infective parts of the beef from
countries with known cases of the disease.)
</P>
<P>
   The European Union is also planning a monitoring program
starting in 2001 that would test up to 65,000 cows a year
throughout its member nations to build a realistic picture of a
disease that many fear is underreported.
</P>
<P>
   While Britain has been hit hardest by the disease, Ireland is
next with 466 cases. Portugal has had 371 and Switzerland 351. The
next highest country is France, with 92 cases detected since 1991.
Most of France's cases have been in the north, where there is a
greater likelihood of exchanges of feed and cattle with Britain.
But lately, cases have begun to be detected in other regions of
France.
</P>
<P>
   French officials had predicted that because of their precautions
cases of the disease would be declining by now. Experts note that
it no doubt took a while for the 1996 regulations banning animal
parts from animal feed to take hold. And there may also be
instances in which regulations were ignored and the effects are now
being seen. A recent European Union report still found traces of
meat and bone meal in some samples of French feed despite the ban.
But some experts say they are not sure such incidents account for
the rise in numbers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Britain's Conservative Party has called for a
European ban on French beef. But the appeal has largely been
dismissed as a political tit-for-tat, as the numbers of infected
cattle are still very small. In addition to France, the United
States continues to ban British beef. But it does not have similar
restrictions on beef from elsewhere in Europe, Gminder said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, French farmers unions and the government have stepped in
quickly to help farmers whose herds have been hit by the disease.
Within a week of losing his cows, Jambon had 30 young calves back
on his farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was at least something to keep him busy,'' said Gilbert
Limandas, the president of the local farmers union. ``There is no
question that this is a real trauma for the farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   But as he goes about his work, Jambon says, he is still scared
it will happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no precautions to take because I had already taken
all the precautions I knew about,'' he said. `So, I'm back doing
the same thing and hoping it doesn't happen again. We are all
wondering around here: `Who will it hit next?'''

CHIEFS MINICAMP BEGINS WITHOUT DERRICK THOMAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JASON WHITLOCK  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life without Derrick Thomas began in earnest Saturday afternoon
for our Kansas City Chiefs and for us, their followers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Wizards-type crowd showed up at Arrowhead Stadium for a
non-contact minicamp practice. It was as if the regular season _
Christmas around here _ came early for Chiefs fans. They dusted off
their grills and practiced the fine art of tailgating,
beer-guzzling and setting unrealistic expectations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't surprise me,'' said Chiefs tight end Tony Gonzalez,
referring to the crowd. ``We have the best fans in the NFL.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez and his teammates also got to practice a little, too _
the fine art of honoring Thomas' memory. That's what this 2000
season is all about. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't intend for this to be construed as a knock, just a
statement of fact: So far the Chiefs have done very little this
off-season in terms of improving their personnel from a year ago.
Signing a trio of solid interior offensive linemen _ Brendan Stai,
Jeff Blackshear and Aaron Graham _ made good sense considering the
Chiefs appear likely to lose either Will Shields or Dave Szott, or
both. But it doesn't move the Chiefs anywhere near the playoffs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Landing a big-ticket free agent won't be what helps the Chiefs
make a Super Bowl run this season. Rather, their best chance to
surprise us is if they've truly learned a lesson from Thomas' death
and use his memory to inspire a focused, disciplined,
enjoy-the-moment-because-it-could-be-taken-away effort. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think there's a small chance it could happen. The Chiefs got
off to a good start Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They genuinely appreciated the enthusiasm from the 12,577 fans
who attended Saturday's practice. Cunningham was so excited that
during his post-practice chat with the media, he sounded like a
high school coach preaching the importance of school spirit. The
players fed off the fans' energy, too, and turned their practice
intensity up a notch. Following the practice they acknowledged the
fans by throwing T-shirts and footballs into the stands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I realize the actions were mandated by management _ owner
Lamar Hunt, King Carl Peterson and Cunningham know the Chiefs have
had a dreadful off-season in terms of public relations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But this may be the closest thing to an apology we ever see or
hear from the Chiefs as long as Peterson is in control of the
franchise. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I think the fans should _ and did _ graciously accept the
apology and view it as a sign that the Chiefs are taking a few cues
from Thomas, their future Hall of Fame linebacker. He never had a
problem acknowledging when he was wrong _ just remember the way he
handled the Monday Night Football situation. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' spirit hung over Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything we can do to raise (Derrick's) name up we're going to
do,'' running back Donnell Bennett said. ``He's a big part of what
we're going to do this year.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone I spoke with said the best way to honor Thomas is to
win. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to go out there and win the Super Bowl,'' said
Gonzalez, who like the rest of his teammates has a No. 58 decal on
the back of his helmet. ``I talked to Derrick's mom just a couple
of nights ago, and she said Derrick's up there watching over us
now. She said she feels that we're going to go to the Super Bowl
this year, and I believe her.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center Tim Grunhard, a native of Chicago, added: ``I compare it
to when Harry Caray died and the Cubs made the playoffs. He was up
there turning the wheels or something because (the Cubs) kept
getting all the breaks. I think D.T. will be up there making sure
we get the breaks.'' &QL;

CHIEFS QUARTERBACK TAKES OFFENSIVE LINE ON HUNTING EXPEDITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY COVITZ  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's nothing like spending a few early-morning hours sitting
in a duck blind or wading through snake-infested wilderness in
pursuit of pheasant or wild boars to bring teammates closer
together. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's why Chiefs quarterback Elvis Grbac invited nine teammates
to an off-season hunting expedition to south Texas. All expenses,
including first-class travel, were paid by Grbac. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was Grbac's way of showing appreciation to his offensive line
for keeping him injury-free for the first time in his three seasons
with the Chiefs. It also was a means of developing esprit de corps
among teammates and demonstrating that Grbac wants to be a leader
of this team in 2000. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys got to finally know who I am,'' Grbac said. ``That's
where the relationship will grow between individuals. Anytime you
can get away from the game, or whatever your profession, and spend
time with people, you're going to get to know them. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to get them away from football, and not to talk about
football, just relax, just a bunch of guys having a good time _ it
was awesome.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grbac stole the idea for the hunting trip from Joe Montana. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe used to do things like this,'' Grbac said. ``He would
always say, `You don't realize all the pain an offensive lineman
goes through until you watch it on the film on Mondays, and they do
it week in and week out. I get touched maybe two or three times.'
So it's an opportunity to pay your respects to those guys.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This was no stroll through the woods, either. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The wake-up calls sounded at 4 a.m., and hunting guides took
Grbac's group by bus into the wild about 35 miles outside Houston.
They hunted for duck, snow geese, pheasant and boar. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And they rolled back into the hotel well after dark. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that Elvis is as driven off the field as he is on,''
center Tim Grunhard said. ``We started hunting at 5 in the morning,
and by noon, I was ready to quit. But we kept going until 5 at
night. Twelve hours of hunting. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When Elvis has a goal, whether it's to hit a tight end across
the field or to bag a wild boar, he's driven to do it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides Grunhard, those who joined Grbac on the trip included
guard Will Shields and tackle Glenn Parker, now with the New York
Giants; defensive end Ty Parten and three players no longer with
the team: linebacker Greg Manusky, deep snapper Ralph Tamm and
tight end Ted Popson. Guard Dave Szott, who was ill, and tackle
Victor Riley, whose wife had a baby, were late scratches. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``This was also a chance for guys who may never play again, an
opportunity to go out in style,'' Grbac said. ``We talked about our
families, we talked about our futures, what we're going to do, we
talked about hunting, we talked about a lot of things we don't talk
about during the football season. It was kind of nice. '' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grbac missed 10 starts in his first two seasons because of
injuries and another six starts when he was benched at the end of
the 1998 season, so he never felt comfortable taking a leadership
position with the Chiefs, much less taking teammates on a hunting
expedition. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, in the NFL, when you get injured, you are
shuffled to the back,'' Grunhard said. ``People don't talk to you
as much, people tend to stay away from you. When he was hurt, he
didn't get a chance to become a big-time member of this team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Grbac missed only three snaps and threw for 3,389
yards and 22 touchdowns, the most by a Chiefs quarterback since
Steve DeBerg's 23 in 1990. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, Grbac, 29, wants to put his imprint on this team. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys in the offense have finally gotten comfortable with
my style of play and what I do for the team,'' Grbac said. ``Last
year was a turning point for me, just being healthy for the entire
year. They knew the same quarterback was going to be there every
day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last training camp, there was some question of
whether Grbac would be able to hold off veteran Warren Moon for the
starting position. But Grbac was one of just eight NFL quarterbacks
to start all 16 games in 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The doubt about him has vanished. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When Elvis walks out on the field now, there's no question who
the quarterback is,'' coach Gunther Cunningham said. ``There's no
question he's like a different guy. Last year, I was concerned
about him, getting his confidence level to where it should be, and
now he's just changed completely. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a good attitude, the players look to him, they
listen, and they saw it all a year ago when he was performing on
the practice field, how consistent he was, how effective he was,
and then he went into the games. All the games weren't perfect, but
a lot of them were very good.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grbac planned the hunting trip before Derrick Thomas' untimely
death, but the trip gave the players an opportunity to share their
thoughts on the tragedy.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good for the guys because it was the off-season,'' said
Parten. ``If it was in season, then everyone as a team would be
able to talk to one another about it. It was good for us guys down
there, driving out in the van to go hunting, and the subject would
come up and we'd talk about it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Grbac plans to make the hunting trip an annual event, and he
hopes next time his teammates will have something to celebrate.
While Grbac led the Chiefs to a 9-7 record, reversing the 7-9
debacle of 1998, they missed the playoffs for the second straight
season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quarterbacks are measured by winning, and Grbac, who has a Super
Bowl ring from his four seasons in San Francisco, understands
what's at stake this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say all you want about the franchise winning 100
games,'' Grbac said of the Chiefs' success in the 1990s, ``but you
look at the stretch the last couple years, and we have not made the
playoffs, and that's a problem. We pride ourselves on being in the
playoffs, and when I got here I talked about winning the Super
Bowl. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it's all about. Guys have matured from last year,
and understand their roles. Hopefully what happened last year, we
can build on that and get better.'' &QL;

WIFE CHARGED IN KILLING OF RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The wife of a prosperous Russian businessman killed
her husband in their lavish Staten Island home, had her boyfriend
help her dump the body, then took her children on a vacation to
Disney World before reporting her husband missing, the police said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Elena Kiejliches, 34, was arrested Friday and charged
with second-degree murder in the killing of Borys Kiejliches, 49,
who was found in a cardboard barrel in a marsh near the Belt
Parkway on the Brooklyn-Queens border on April 25, said William H.
Allee, the chief of detectives. Borys Kiejliches had been shot once
in the head with a large-caliber pistol and his hands had been
tied, Allee said. He had been dead for some time when his body was
discovered, the chief added.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kiejliches' $125,000 Mercedes-Benz had been found at the end
of Coney Island Avenue, near the Brighton Beach boardwalk, three
weeks earlier, the chief said. He was last seen on March 28, a week
before that, near his home at 91 East Loop Road, in the Todt Hill
section of Staten Island, a wealthy neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kiejliches, who had been married to the victim for eight
years, had reported her husband missing, Allee said, but detectives
were ``extremely suspicious'' about the circumstances of his
disappearance. Ms. Kiejliches had refused to talk to investigators
about her husband's disappearance and had hired a lawyer, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The case was investigated by detectives from Staten Island and
Queens homicide squads and will be prosecuted on Staten Island,
because investigators believe that the killing took place in the
basement of the couple's home, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn man officials identified as Ms. Kiejliches' boyfriend
was also arrested in connection with the killing. Allee said the
man, Messiah Justice, 26, had helped Ms. Kiejliches dispose of her
husband's body. He described Justice as an aspiring rap artist.
</P>
<P>
   One official said Justice often stayed at the couple's home
while Mr. Kiejliches was away on business.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Justice, who has an arrest record
dating to 1989, was charged with hindering prosecution, tampering
with evidence and obstructing governmental administration, Allee
said.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the location of the bullet wound that killed
Kiejliches, one official also said investigators suspect that he
was shot while sleeping or lying down. The couple, the official
added, had a history of domestic violence.

   Detectives have learned that a section of carpet was missing
from the otherwise immaculately kept home, suggesting to
investigators that someone removed it to conceal evidence, several
officials said. The murder weapon has not been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kiejliches took the couple's two children, an 8-year-old boy
and a 5-year-old girl, to Disney World just before she reported her
husband missing, Allee said.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Kiejliches had an aviation fuel business called Albo Inter
Corp., which listed his Staten Island home as its address, and was
also affiliated with a dental business in Brooklyn, according to
business records and a person who answered the telephone at the
dental office. Allee said Kiejliches spent a great deal of time in
Russia on business but would not elaborate on the trips.

CORRUPT LAPD OFFICERS RUINED CASES WITH THEIR LIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 and BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Illegal searches and false testimony by corrupt
officers _ not planted evidence _ tainted most of the vacated
felony convictions related to the LAPD Rampart scandal, a Daily
News investigation has found.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the 73 felony convictions overturned thus far
actually included significant evidence of crimes that became
tainted because corrupt officers initiated arrests without probable
cause, according to a review of court documents and confidential
investigative reports.
</P>
<P>
   As the worst police corruption scandal in city history continues
to unfold, attention has focused on the most violent acts of police
thuggery, the planting of evidence and the framing of suspects as
described by dirty-cop-turned-snitch Rafael Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Guns and drugs, however, were not planted on suspects in the
majority of the overturned cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand what goes on in Rampart and places
like Watts. They're virtual police states where civil rights
protections don't apply,'' said Connie Rice, a nationally
recognized civil rights lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the scandal broke last September, the public's response to
the corruption has been muted by the perception that many of the
victims were hardly sympathetic figures or law-abiding citizens. A
review of the cases confirms that perception, and the circumstances
around the arrests could help to reduce the city's liability.
</P>
<P>
   When the corrupt cops illegally kicked down a door, rifled
through a room or frisked a suspect without cause or consent, they
often found what they suspected: a pound of cocaine stashed in a
bottom dresser drawer; 50 small balloons filled with crack sitting
in a car; marijuana plants growing on the balcony; cocaine
concealed in a butter container; loaded guns.
</P>
<P>
   Rice argued it is a dangerous but common path for gung-ho
officers in Los Angeles and many other big cities to fabricate
probable cause in order to arrest people they believe are guilty of
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you go down that road, it's just a couple of (steps) away
from, 'I might as well fabricate the evidence, because they're all
bad. They're all guilty of something and sooner or later they'll be
arrested anyway,' '' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what created Rafael Perez.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Daily News' analysis of the vacated cases, at
least 56 percent of the convictions that have been tossed out by
the state Superior Court involved defendants who were actually
carrying drugs or guns or who were in the immediate proximity of
drugs or guns. In those cases, officers routinely fabricated
stories to justify how they obtained the evidence and then lied in
court to ensure the arrest appeared legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, about 25 percent of the vacated convictions were
tainted because Perez and other cops planted guns or drugs on the
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the remaining cases were overturned either because Perez
had unconfirmed doubts about the actions of his former colleagues
or because a conviction was based largely upon his trial testimony.
In fact, in at least two of the vacated cases Perez maintains the
arrests were legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even criminals have rights,'' said LAPD Cmdr. David Kalish, a
spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers must have reverence for the law. Violating an
individual's rights, whoever they are, is counter to our principles
and core values and to the oath of office every police officer
makes to support the constitutions of the United States and of the
state of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were several cases where evidence was planted on a
person. But in many of the cases, had the officers followed the
rules and done their job right, they could have made legal
arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Perez has told investigators that he and his
partner stopped a man ``who just looked out of place'' on Temple
Street in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk to him,'' Perez recalled in an interview with the
corruption task force. ``All of a sudden, he drops ... a black
canister. I mean, real obvious. I mean it was his. He dropped it.
And we arrested him.''
</P>
<P>
   That, however, wasn't enough to guarantee a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   So Perez and his partner then falsified their police report and
lied in court to solidify the arrest, saying they observed the man
buying cocaine from a dealer. With two prior convictions, the man
was sentenced to two years in state prison and then deported. His
conviction was overturned last month after county prosecutors
learned about the falsified police report.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Perez said he and two other officers got
word from a confidential informant named ``Oscar'' that drugs were
being sold out of an apartment. Rather than set up an observation
post, the officers fabricated a story about witnessing the drug
dealing and then kicked down the door.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the apartment, Perez said, the cops found a variety of
narcotics, including more than a pound of cocaine. They even caught
a person dropping ``a big cookie of rock cocaine inside the
toilet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two people were arrested and eventually pleaded guilty to drug
charges in 1997. They were sentenced to three years in state
prison, and were deported after their release. Last month, the
convictions were overturned after Perez told prosecutors the search
and seizure took place without probable cause.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti said the Daily News' findings
didn't surprise him, but in no way alter what transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be no excuse for an intentional crime committed by a
police officer. These are intentional crimes committed by police
officers,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The victim's race, nationality, record, whatever, shouldn't
matter. A police officer cannot get away with committing a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   While Perez is an admitted liar and a convicted felon, his sworn
statements relating to the overturned cases have been confirmed by
LAPD detectives and the District Attorney's Office. The Daily News
has obtained a transcript of the confidential testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Perez offered his confessions of corruption to prosecutors last
September in exchange for a more lenient sentence for stealing
about $1 million worth of cocaine from an LAPD evidence locker in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the corruption probe, more than 20 officers
either have been fired, have been suspended, or have quit. And
three officers were charged last month with crimes. More charges
are expected to be filed within the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   Joel R. Isaacson, who represents two Rampart officers _
including Paul Harper, who was charged with criminal misconduct two
weeks ago _ disputed the credibility and significance of Perez's
statements.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're relying on his testimony. We disagree,'' Isaacson
said.
</P>
<P>
   All of the officers facing prosecution have denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   To date, the City Attorney's Office, which has settled three
cases for about $120,000 each, has attempted to assess the city's
liability for the scandal on a case-by-case basis. No one in the
office has analyzed how many of those wrongfully convicted had
drugs or guns in their possession or had been at gang parties where
guns and drugs were present.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Assistant City Attorney Thomas C. Hokinson, head of the
office's civil litigation branch, said the analysis would be ``very
helpful'' to the city and could reduce its liability. The financial
fallout has been estimated to be at least $125 million and possibly
as much as $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is helpful in going to the issue of determining what
damages actually were sustained,'' Hokinson said. ``It's one thing
if the allegation is that someone planted the drugs and another if
he had the drugs to begin with. That's a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Most notably, it changes how a jury looks at the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presence of weapons or illegal drugs will affect (the
jurors') judgment of what is reasonable compensation for the
plaintiffs,'' Hokinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Public Defender Kimberly Wong, who represented one of the
defendants whose convictions have been overturned, said her client,
Walter Rivas, always maintained drugs were planted on him.
</P>
<P>
   Wong said Rivas' conviction illustrates how unwilling the
criminal justice system is to challenge police claims of probable
cause, especially when the defendants come from poor, inner-city
neighborhoods awash in drugs and guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The majority of people in our community accept that the ends
justify the means,'' Wong said. ``It's a slippery slope, because if
the community accepts the first step that the probable cause was
fabricated, then the next logical step is planting the drugs on
people like Mr. Rivas who never had any drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who was involved in the March 1998 arrest of Rivas, later
told investigators he believed the arrest was dirty. Rivas is
currently in federal custody at an INS detention center. He has
filed a civil lawsuit against the city, naming seven officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always one guy who doesn't run, maybe because he's
innocent. He can pay for that,'' Wong said. ``They can break you
down.''

MARLINS' SMITH ENJOYED PLAYING IN JAPAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Passing up a season in the major leagues could be
the best move of Mark Smith's baseball career.
</P>
<P>
   After spending years bouncing around in the minors and sitting
on the bench in the majors, the former USC All-American opted to
spend last season in Japan. While it's a move often considered the
last resort for extending a pro career, it appears to have provided
a significant boost for Smith, who is back in the United States and
off to the best start of his big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   The outfielder earned a spot with the Florida Marlins as a
non-roster invitee and entered this weekend's series against the
New York Mets batting .333. He has never batted better than .285 in
the majors. He has just four starts, but he's appeared in 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had opportunities before I left for Japan to stay in the
United States,'' Smith said. ``But I just wanted to go over there
for the experience and financially it made more sense to go there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Japan experience helped me. People think that the baseball
in Japan is second rate to over here. The pitchers over there are
every bit as good as the pitchers over here, there's no doubt in my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The 293 at-bats he had playing for Yakult were 100 more than in
any of his previous major league seasons. He batted just .243 but
hit a career- high 20 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It took about a month to get used to the customs of a new
country and league, but after that Smith said he fit in and found
it less of a challenge than being a reserve player.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' Smith said of the role he has filled since he was
initially called up to the majors in 1994 for a short stint with
Baltimore. ``It's probably one of the hardest things to do in
baseball, when you're asked to go in and perform and you haven't
been in there everyday, maintaining your skills. Any bench player
you talk to is probably going to say the same thing. It's very
difficult, but you just got to go in there and be ready to battle
every time you're in there. Nothing comes easy being a bench
player. It's definitely a lot easier when you're playing
everyday.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, 29, established school career records for RBI (168),
stolen bases (57) and triples (13) at USC. He was a first-round
draft pick by the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   This is just the second season he's been on the opening-day
roster of a major-league team. Before he went to Japan, the
highlight of Smith's professional career had been hitting a home
run to clinch a 10-inning combined no hitter for teammates
Francisco Cordova and Ricardo Rincon with the Pirates in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Playing time is the only thing Smith feels kept him from doing
better in the past, but just being in the major leagues keeps him
happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some young outfielders we'd like to give some time
and (Smith)'s accepted his role,'' Marlins manager John Boles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're here in the big leagues,'` Smith said. ``You can't
complain about being in the big leagues. ... I just wish I had
gotten more of an opportunity. I got a chance in Japan.''

GIULIANI'S ESTRANGED WIFE CALLS THEIR MARRIAGE `VERY PRECIOUS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert new 9th through 12th grafs, bgng `For his
part...')  
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Donna Hanover said Saturday that her marriage to
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was ``very precious'' to her, as she spoke
publicly for the first time since the mayor disclosed he had
prostate cancer and acknowledged a friendship with another woman.
</P>
<P>
   In an unlikely setting, at the back entrance of St. Patrick's
Cathedral, Hanover held a news conference before she joined
thousands of mourners to pay her respects to Cardinal John O'Connor
early Saturday afternoon. She arrived with a phalanx of staff
members, who had notified news organizations in advance that she
would make a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate all the love and kind thoughts that so many
people have sent me and my children during these difficult days,''
said Hanover, wearing a black suit and appearing pale.
</P>
<P>
   Trembling perceptibly, Hanover said, ``I will be supportive of
Rudy in his fight against his illness, as this marriage and this
man have been very precious to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hanover and the mayor have led separate lives for the last few
years, and she has not appeared at his side publicly during his
second mayoral term. Their lengthy estrangement, though, drew
considerable attention on Wednesday after The New York Post
published photographs of Judith Nathan, the Upper East Side
resident who has accompanied the mayor to town hall meetings and
other public events in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the photographs were published, Giuliani devoted
the first portion of his news briefing to them. He called her a
``very good friend'' and told reporters in the Blue Room at City
Hall that he hoped they would respect her privacy. Later in the
week, asked specifically whether the friendship was romantic, the
mayor would only say that this was a private matter.
</P>
<P>
   Since the news broke of the mayor's cancer and of his friendship
with Nathan, Hanover's spokeswoman had issued statements but
Hanover had not appeared in public in response to queries.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, she would not take any questions from reporters,
and spoke obliquely about the future. ``The well-being and safety
of Andrew and Caroline,'' the couple's 14-year-old son and
10-year-old daughter, ``will be my primary concern in any decisions
that have to be made, as has always been the case,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the mayor continued to assert Saturday that some
matters should be considered private. In the lobby of the
Inter-Continental Hotel, where Giuliani was seeking the endorsement
of the Liberal Party, he responded to the results of a poll
published in The Daily News that included questions about his
friendship with Nathan.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-thirds of the 431 people questioned said they
believed that the mayor's friendship with Nathan was a private
matter and said that it had no effect on how they viewed him as a
candidate for the U.S. Senate, the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most New Yorkers feel the way I feel,'' the mayor said,
adding, ``Somebody's private life should be left alone.'' He added,
``The mere fact that you're a public official doesn't mean that
you're not a human being and that you don't have the same issues
and things that go on that other human beings do, and everybody is
entitled to privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has said he will not make a final determination about
continuing his campaign for the Senate until he decides on a course
of treatment for his cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hanover withdrew days ago from ``The Vagina Monologues,'' an
Off-Broadway play about subjects like orgasm and birth that she and
two other actresses were to begin appearing in on May 30. In a
statement, she cited ``personal family circumstances'' as the
reason for her postponement of the acting role, and the statement
did not mention her husband's name.
</P>
<P>
   As she prepared to enter St. Patrick's on Saturday, she
explained her special bond with the cardinal, who died Wednesday.
Appearing to have difficulty maintaining her composure, her eyes
watering, she said: ``Cardinal O'Connor often told me that my
family was in his prayers. He was a Navy chaplain, and I was raised
in the Navy, and we have that as a special bond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have come to pay my respects, and I will have no further
remarks today,'' she said, then walked up the back stairs, followed
by her staff.

   SEATTLE _ To bunt or not to bunt.
</P>
<P>
   That was the question when Garret Anderson was at bat with
runners on first and second and nobody out in the ninth inning in a
scoreless game between the Anaheim Angels and Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   But Angels manager Mike Scioscia said it never entered his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson hit into a double play and the Mariners ended the game
on Mark McLemore's RBI single in the bottom of the ninth for a 1-0
victory Saturday before 43,427 at Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Garret is a guy you want up there swinging the bat
with a chance to win the game,'' Scioscia said. ``You have Garret,
(Troy) Glaus and (Scott) Spiezio coming up. All you need is a base
hit by one of those guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``G.A. is hitting fifth and I look for him to drive in runs for
us all year. He's hitting there because he has the potential to
drive in over 100 runs a year. You have to stick with him.''
</P>
<P>
   After Anderson grounded into the short-to-second-to-first double
play, Glaus struck out looking to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners closer Kazuhiro Sasaki (1-0), who got Anderson to hit
into the double play and then retired Glaus, created his own mess
by walking Mo Vaughn and Tim Salmon to start the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Sasaki escaped and got the win only because the Mariners did
what the Angels could not do - get a bunt down.
</P>
<P>
   David Bell opened the ninth with a single off Mike Holtz (0-1)
and pinch runner Charles Gipson took second on Dan Wilson's
sacrifice bunt. Holtz tried to throw a 2-2 fastball low and away to
McLemore, but he got the ball up and McLemore lined it to
right-center field for the game-winning hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the type of game execution is important,'' Scioscia
said. ``They got 'em on, got 'em over and got 'em in.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson has only 11 sacrifice bunts in his career, so he
wouldn't say he was expecting a bunt sign when he stepped to the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think about it,'' Anderson said. ``I asked Ron
(Roenicke, the Angels third base coach), does he have me bunting.
He said no, so I went to hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Scioscia) knows the type of hitter I am. I think he made his
judgment based on that. There are going to be times he might ask me
to bunt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to take the bat out of G.A.'s hands,'' Scioscia
reiterated. ``We already had a runner in scoring position. The
table's already set.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason runs were at a premium was because both starters
pitched well.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners starter Gil Meche didn't get the victory, but he shut
out the Angels on two hits through seven innings. Arthur Rhodes
threw a scoreless eighth, setting up Sasaki.
</P>
<P>
   For the Angels, Kent Mercker was starting in place of the
injured Jason Dickson and threw five scoreless innings. He was on a
limited pitch count because he had been pitching out of the bullpen
all season. He made 76 pitches and allowed only three hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scoreless,'' Mercker said when asked to evaluate his
performance. Mercker has admitted his disappointment at not being
in the starting rotation despite a solid spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doesn't matter how you feel or what you do as long as you
don't give up runs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker's changeup was particularly effective, as he struck out
five.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to throw that pitch when you know how to use
it,'' he said. ``When you're throwing out of the 'pen you don't
have time to get everything going. I'm pleased with how I threw, I
just wish today I wasn't on a pitch count. Mentally I felt I was
where I wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Meche still doesn't have a win this season, but he lowered his
ERA to 3.51 on Saturday. The Angels finished with only two hits -
singles by Salmon and Anderson. They had only three baserunners in
scoring position all day.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Meche) made tremendous pitches when he had to,'' Scioscia
said. ``We just had to go a little deeper into our bullpen than
those guys did and they eventually got to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were without relievers Troy Percival, Mark Petkovsek
and Shigetoshi Hasegawa because their arms needed rest.

BOTTENFIELD, WALBECK WORKING WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Anaheim Angels manager Mike Scioscia doesn't like the
idea of matching catchers with certain pitchers. He says his
catchers should be interchangeable when it comes to working with
the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But Scioscia is going with catcher Matt Walbeck when Kent
Bottenfield is pitching. Walbeck has started only nine games this
season, and six have come with Bottenfield on the mound. The
battery has worked well together lately, as Bottenfield has given
up only four earned runs in his past three starts, covering 21
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been leaving everything up to Matt,'' Bottenfield said.
``I haven't shaken him off in three starts. He's allowing me to
learn the hitters. He's teaching me, basically.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield is making his first tour through the American
League, having spent his entire career in the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Wally has an understanding of the league Kent is
looking for,'' Scioscia said. ``Right now, they're working well
together. Will it always be that way? I can't say that. Somewhere
along the line we'll get Bengie (Molina) to catch him.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the mark: Darin Erstad went 0 for 4 Saturday, his average
dipping below .400 for the first time this season (.398). Erstad is
hitting .143 (3 for 21) on the current road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys have made some good pitches against him,'' Scioscia
said. ``He's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   On the grill: While Erstad has cooled off, Tim Salmon has heated
up. Salmon reached base four times Saturday with a single and three
walks. He's hitting .563 (9 for 16) on the trip, raising his
average to .269.
</P>
<P>
   Getting close: Shortstop Gary DiSarcina worked out Saturday and
took another step toward returning from a sore right shoulder.
DiSarcina is likely to be back in the starting lineup today or
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Dads get no rest: Reliever Al Levine rejoined the team Saturday
after going home to be with his wife, Linda, who gave birth to the
couple's first child late Thursday, a boy, Anthony Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   Levine didn't have much time to rest before getting back out
there. He pitched 2 innings Saturday, allowing no runs and two
hits.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thousands of mourners from across the New York region
and the nation, including many children and disabled people,
converged on a funereal at St. Patrick's Cathedral Saturday to pay
their last respects to Cardinal John O'Connor with prayers, hymns
and the ancient rites of Roman Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   On a sun-washed spring day with temperatures that climbed into
the high 80s, crowds stood for hours in long, slow lines on Fifth
Avenue and 50th Street to enter the great cathedral's double doors,
draped in black and purple bunting, for a last glimpse of the
cardinal, lying in state at the altar.
</P>
<P>
   Streaming under the arched Gothic pillars almost all day and
into the evening, a double line of mourners filed past the bier,
which was flanked by white-gloved police officers at attention.
Many people wept softly and murmured prayers for the cardinal, who
died Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds also filled the 2,300-seat pews to overflowing for a
morning Mass in Spanish, for an afternoon Mass in English that was
organized for children and disabled people, and later for vespers
and rosary services. For many it was a day of reflection as well as
sorrow for the death of the cardinal, who was 80.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a wonderful man, a model for Catholicism,'' Frank
Rusch, an airline pilot from the West Coast, said after viewing the
body cloaked in scarlet and white vestments and lying in a
red-velvet-lined mahogany coffin. ``He is very well thought of. I
speak of him in the present because he is still with us.''
</P>
<P>
   As preparations for the cardinal's funeral on Monday went
forward, there was no word from the Vatican on the selection of his
successor as the archbishop of New York, although speculation
continued to focus on Bishop Edward M. Egan, of the Diocese of
Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   While the selection process is secret, with harsh penalties for
anyone who breaks the silence, some church officials have virtually
confirmed Egan's appointment, saying that an announcement as early
as Tuesday or Wednesday is likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is Egan,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty evident,'' another senior church official
involved in the early stages of the selection process said. He
indicated that the church's highest officials in New York and the
Northeast had already been notified, but said they would keep
silent out of respect until after the cardinal's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was to lead a host of dignitaries at the
funeral _ 3,500 invitations have gone out _ and the Vatican
secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, was to represent Pope
John Paul II and officiate at the 2 p.m. Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's events _ the second of three days of Masses and other
services leading to the funeral and burial in the crypt under the
altar at St. Patrick's _ gave striking testimony once more to the
admiration and respect that millions accorded the cardinal,
America's most influential Catholic leader.
</P>
<P>
   By 10 a.m., when the cathedral opened, the crowds waiting to get
in were already enormous. The lines snaked around into 50th Street,
then back to Madison Avenue, where they doubled back again to Fifth
Avenue and redoubled back toward Madison. And they kept getting
larger.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the day's heat was a torment. About 11:30 a.m., a man
in his 70s fainted on the sidewalk. People went to his aid, giving
him sips of water and orange slices. He revived a bit and said he
had been in line for 90 minutes after walking about a mile to the
cathedral from the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 40th Street and
Eighth Avenue. Firefighters took him away on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
   Some people had flown in from Puerto Rico and other Caribbean
islands. Some had come by airplane and bus from other states. Many
residents of the metropolitan area took buses or subways to pay
tribute to a man they said had been a friend of the poor, the sick
and immigrants struggling to make a new life in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the cardinal so much, I just had to come,'' said
Minnie Stinson, a Bronx homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Rosado, 21, a cashier at the Candado Plaza Casino in Old
San Juan, Puerto Rico, said he had flown to New York with his
family for the Mass in Spanish. ``I am really, really Catholic, was
raised in a Catholic house,'' he said. ``The cardinal gave so much
to the poor and the rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Maximo Mendoza had come with 18 others from his Bronx church
because of the cardinal's support for Hispanic immigrants. ``He
opened the door for Mexicans,'' Mendoza said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Doyle, 76, came by bus from Scranton, Pa., where he said he
had known John O'Connor as a bishop. More than personable, he
recalled, O'Connor had known many of his parishioners by their
first names.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Kaatz, who drove 77 miles into town from upstate Wingdale,
N.Y., with her two children, said: ``It was important to see him.
It was very important for the children.'' Alluding to the
cardinal's eight-month struggle with brain cancer, she added, ``I
feel happy for him because he is at peace, and is where he always
wanted to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Vasquez, who brought his wife and child from the Bronx,
said sadly, ``He meant a lot to us as Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   People from Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Cuba and other
Caribbean and Latin American nations, as well as many non-Hispanic
people, attended the Mass in Spanish, which was celebrated by the
Most Rev. Francisco Garmendia, auxiliary bishop of the archdiocese.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the politicians, to the police, to all the nationalities
represented here today, we are all brothers today in respect for
the cardinal,'' Garmendia said. ``We want to thank you, cardinal,
for all you did for us in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In his homily in Spanish, the Rev. Josu Iriondo, director of the
office of Hispanic affairs for the archdiocese, spoke of the
cardinal's warm relationship with Hispanic people, of his two
visits to Cuba and of his sending food and other aid to hurricane
victims. ``He was a lover of life, a defender of life, of the sick,
of the poor,'' Iriondo said.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the 2.4 million Catholics in the archdiocese
are of Hispanic descent, church officials say, and about 100 of its
413 parishes are predominantly Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mass, Esperanza Morales, an official of the Tepeyac
Association of New York, which represents Mexican immigrants, said:
``He always talked to us in Spanish, and always wanted to help us.
We loved him. We want to tell him `thank you' for all he did for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after noon, dozens of buses drew up around the cathedral
carrying hundreds of elderly and disabled men and women, many of
them in wheelchairs or moving with the aid of walkers, canes or
crutches. Also on board were hundreds of children, many mentally or
physically disabled. They were helped into the cathedral by
counselors and aides from hospitals and nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   For the 1 p.m. Mass, pew after pew was filled. Those in
wheelchairs sat in the aisles and made new rows. Many in the
audience were neither young nor disabled.
</P>
<P>
   It was relatively cool inside, out of the sun and in the subdued
light from the lofty chandeliers and the high, arched stained-glass
windows on either side of the nave. Organ music swelled and a choir
sang. Many in the crowd fingered rosaries, and some cried softly as
the Mass unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a processional hymn, ``Sing With All the Saints in
Glory,'' followed by a psalm, ``We Shall Go Up With Joy to the
House of Our God.'' The Most Rev. Robert A. Brucato, apostolic
administrator of the archdiocese, read from the Gospel of John.
</P>
<P>
   The Mass was sponsored by the archdiocesan Office of Education
and its Office of Persons with Disabilities, and Brucato spoke of
the cardinal's devotion to the disabled and to young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a very concerned man, with a hands-on approach,''
Brucato said. He also spoke of the cardinal's friendship with a
police officer, Steven McDonald, who was shot and paralyzed in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   While those in the pews could not see the cardinal, television
monitors positioned here and there provided close-up views of the
body.
</P>
<P>
   After the homily, the Mass continued with the Liturgy of the
Eucharist and the preparation of the altar for communion. A hymn,
``On Eagle's Wings,'' was sung by Michael Joncas. The Eucharist
prayer, including the acclamation ``Holy, Holy, Holy,'' was
followed by the communion rites.
</P>
<P>
   Another hymn, ``I am the Bread of Life,'' was sung by Suzanne
Toolan. The concluding rites were the Prayer after Communion and
the recessional hymn ``For All the Saints.''
</P>
<P>
   As the last bars of the recessional faded and the aroma of
incense drifted through the cathedral, lines to view the cardinal
formed again and moved solemnly forward. One could hear the
shuffling of many feet, the creak of wheelchairs, the clink of
coins in a poor box. People crossed themselves at the sight of the
cardinal and again on the way out.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the sun's glare on Fifth Avenue, Tanya Melendez, an East
Village resident, asked her sons Devon, 10, and David, 9, both
students at Our Lady of Pompei School, to reflect on the cardinal.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least he's in a better place,'' Devon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's in a better place too,'' David said. ``What he's
been through has been a great life for him. He lived the way he
wanted to live.''

<P>
   An hour after the park cleared, when the clubhouse was
practically empty, Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan sat in front
of his locker, staring at the day's pitching chart.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Pedro chart _ something to behold and save. An original
Pedro chart is like sheet music penned by Mozart himself, or a page
torn from Hemingway's typewriter that would someday turn up in ``A
Farewell to Arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Does Kerrigan rank Pedro games the way some of us might list the
top five Jack Nicholson roles or Larry Bird's best playoff moments?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I just sit back and enjoy it,'' said the coach. ``I take
it all in because I know I'm not going to see something like this
for a long time. I marvel. I really do. I'm jealous, too. I would
like to have that stuff for just one inning. Just give me one
inning or one batter.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach was only one of thousands hurling bouquets at the feet
of Pedro. And this was on a day when Martinez suffered his first
loss since last Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro fanned 17 in a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Steve Trachsel
(best known as the man who surrendered the first No. 62 to Mark
McGwire) and the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at sold-out Fenway Saturday.
One can only guess what we'd be saying and writing today if Pedro
had actually won the game. His 130-pitch (91 for strikes)
masterpiece came on the heels of a tumultuous, suspension-packed
week and thrilled the K Kult of Red Sox Nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, that was some game,'' said Sox manager Jimy Williams.
``You just have to write what you feel rather than me say anything.
He had phenomenal stuff . . . up, down, in, out. We just couldn't
score. Did you guys enjoy watching that kid pitch today?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Jimy, we did. It was impossible not to enjoy a tidy,
old-timey, double complete game (when's the last time we saw one of
those?), which was played in 2 hours 36 minutes (the most exciting
156 minutes in sports) and featured mound artistry normally
associated with bygone days when Walter Johnson faced Smoky Joe
Wood at state-of-the-art Fenway in 1912.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox announced that Pedro dropped his appeal of a five-game
suspension that was doled out by MVP-turned-hardball policeman
Frank Robinson. In a prudent move, Martinez will begin serving his
sentence Sunday, which means he can take the mound in Baltimore
Friday pitching with one extra day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck to the O's. They'll be facing a man who is 13-1
(including playoffs) since Aug. 19, a man with a 2000 record of 5-1
with a 1.22 ERA, 67 strikeouts, and 9 walks in 44 1/3 innings. At
this hour it feels like Pedro and Randy Johnson could start the
All-Star Game and post zeros deep into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays can hit. Tampa's lineup includes Greg Vaughn,
Jose Canseco, Fred McGriff, and Vinny Castilla. Castilla whiffed
four times. After striking out three times, Vaughn drove home the
run when he slapped a curveball to left-center with Dave Martinez
on second and two out in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tip my hat to him,'' said Pedro. ``Greg Vaughn put up a good
battle. I have nothing to regret. I would take that outing again
against anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt he had better stuff on that starry night last
September in New York when he punched out 17 of the world champion
Yankees. But it was difficult to remember another game in which so
many righthanded batters buckled their knees and froze as
curveballs whirred across the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Steve ``Psycho'' Lyons, in from the press box for Fox TV, said,
``I was playing center field the night Roger (Clemens) struck out
20 and I've never seen so many hitters fooled like this today.''
</P>
<P>
   We have come to expect nothing less. There's a buzz in the
streets outside Fenway on days when Pedro pitches. Fans walk to the
park expecting something wonderful to happen. It's a festival of K
cards with a sprinkling of Dominican flags. Rarely are the legions
disappointed. Saturday they stood and cheered Pedro when he walked
in from right field after completing his warmups. It was a
referendum of sorts _ Sox fans voting yes on the question of
whether he should have retaliated in Cleveland. The Nation stood
again after Martinez retired John Flaherty on a comebacker for his
final out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are supposed to have fun with it and I'm glad I'm able to
supply some of the stuff they expect,'' said Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed no regret about the end of his winning streak, or
the waste of a 17-strikeout performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally tip my hat to Vaughn,'' he said. ``There's no
whining. No crying in baseball.''

APPEAL OF SUSPENSION DROPPED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a Red Sox spokesman came into the press box in the ninth
inning Saturday afternoon and said general manager Dan Duquette had
an announcement to make, everyone knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said that pitcher Pedro Martinez was dropping the
appeal of his five-game suspension and would serve it, beginning
Sunday. By doing so, Martinez will retain his spot in the rotation,
delaying his next start by only one day, to Friday in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez was suspended by Frank Robinson, Major League
Baseball's vice president for on-field operations, after he hit
Roberto Alomar of the Indians with a pitch in the eighth inning
last Sunday in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In the same inning, Cleveland pitcher Charles Nagy had hit Jose
Offerman, in apparent retaliation for a knockdown pitch Martinez
threw at Cleveland catcher Einar Diaz in the seventh. Both teams
were warned after Nagy hit Offerman, and Martinez was automatically
ejected, along with manager Jimy Williams, when he hit Alomar in
the backside.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, Robinson announced Martinez was fined and
suspended and Nagy fined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro Martinez did withdraw the appeal of his suspension,
which will allow him to take his regular turn in the rotation,''
Duquette said. ``This was the most common-sense way to resolve the
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette spoke with Martinez Saturday morning in a back room of
the Red Sox clubhouse. The GM said that while Martinez would have
had a ``strong case,'' neither the pitcher nor the team wanted to
risk him losing time while it was being heard. A hearing on the
appeal had been tentatively scheduled for Wednesday in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no guarantee that they would make a decision the
same day,'' Duquette said.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had no comment on the matter. Catcher Jason Varitek
said he was not surprised the matter did not distract Martinez from
pitching brilliantly in a 1-0 loss to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't think that would change his focus,'' Varitek said.
``I wouldn't expect that from him. That was something that was out
of his control. The only thing he could do was give it his best
shot and he did.''

<P>
   John Kibler, who was a highly respected umpire in the National
League for a quarter of a century before reluctantly retiring in
1989, said he was having lunch Friday near his home in Southern
California when he ran into Irv Noren, the former first baseman and
outfielder who played for six teams, including the Senators and
Yankees, in the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to him, `Can you believe these guys nowadays?' ''
Kibler said. ```A pitcher throws a pitch 2 inches inside, and
hitters want to charge the mound.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Irv told me a story about when he was with the Senators, they
were playing with Detroit, and Virgil Trucks was on the mound. `I
was in the box, and I just scraped the dirt with my spikes,' Irv
said. `Trucks said to me, you better dig a little deeper, because
in a couple of minutes, you're going to be lying in it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of pitches later, and Trucks knocked him on his back.
Irv wasn't sure who the umpire was, he thinks it was Bill McGowan,
but the umpire said to him, `What are you going to do, young man?'
Irv said to him, `I think I'll stay right here.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The story, of course, underscores the place the knockdown pitch,
the brushback pitch, the beanball pitch have had forever in the
culture of baseball, a culture Frank Robinson has been commissioned
to change by the lords of the realm.
</P>
<P>
   It may be an impossible task, as the uneven hand of Robinson's
justice demonstrated last week. Does Pedro Martinez have the right
to move a hitter off the plate? Of course. Did his pitch come
dangerously close to Einar Diaz's head, when he could have
accomplished the same purpose by throwing at a lower latitude?
Absolutely. Were the Indians justified in their anger? Imagine the
Sox' reaction if Bartolo Colon ever comes that close to Nomar
Garciaparra's head, and you have your answer.
</P>
<P>
   Was Charles Nagy justified in throwing at the next Red Sox
batter to come to the plate after the Diaz knockdown? By the
unwritten code by which the game is played, yes. Was Dan Duquette
correct in his assertion that plate umpire Tim Tschida could have
ejected Nagy then and there? Indeed, there is plenty of precedent.
Was Martinez reckless when he hit Robbie Alomar, knowing he would
be tossed for doing so? Yes. Did everyone in a Sox uniform think
Pedro was merely standing up for one of his own? You know the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gets suspended, pending his appeal; Nagy gets a token
fine. And no one is satisfied that such an incident will be avoided
in the future. Indeed, both Sox manager Jimy Williams and Tigers
manager Phil Garner suggested that teams may adopt the strategy of
baiting Martinez as a way to get him out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly been an area of trouble for a lot of years,''
Kibler said. ``When I first came to the big leagues _ I stayed for
good in '65 _ players handled it themselves. If a batter wanted to
go (charge the mound), he could. (Willie) Mays was knocked down by
everyone in the world, and he never charged the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the problem today is you only have one pitcher on a
staff with good control, who if he wants to move a guy off the
plate will throw at his arm or his leg, not at his chin. The other
guys may aim low, and the pitch is high.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildness, of course, was not the issue for Martinez, who has the
best control in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Bob) Gibson, he wouldn't throw at you unless something had
happened in the game,'' Kibler said. ``I remember one game in
Dodger Stadium, Dick Stello was umpiring behind the plate, and
Gibson threw one 6 feet over the batter's head. Stello went to the
mound and told Gibson that was a fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gibson later met with Chub Feeney (the National League
president) and said, `Let me ask you a question. If you think I was
throwing at that guy, do you think I would have thrown it 6 feet
over his head?' Chub said, `No.' `Then why am I getting fined? If
I'm going to get fined, I'm going to drill the guy the next time.'
Chub told him, `Forget it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Kibler is skeptical that the knockdown pitch can be legislated
out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Chub 20 years ago, `Now we're warning the pitchers,
warning the dugouts,' but then the next guy who comes inside a
little bit, we're in the jackpot, because we've got to throw the
pitcher out of the game. That puts all the pressure on us. Let the
players handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Players seldom charged the mound, Kibler said, because the
offending pitcher knew the next time he came to the plate, he would
invite retaliation. That, of course, can't happen in the American
League, where the designated hitter precludes pitchers coming to
bat.
</P>
<P>
   The owners, Kibler said, may have economic reasons for asking
the commissioner to legislate the brushback pitches and brawls that
inevitably accompany them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners may have said, `We've got to protect the players
because they're making too much money,' '' Kibler said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I remember when Gibson was pitching, guys on the
opposing team would say to each other, `Don't mess with Gibson
today, because he's not going to take it out on you, but on the
next guy.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think these things should be taken out of the umpires' hands
and put in the players' hands,'' Kibler said. ``They're all making
millions of dollars. If they want to kill each other, go ahead. The
umpires can't control it, because it's not fair. You're going to
give the first guy (who throws at a hitter) a free shot, and then
throw the next guy out of the game? That's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the umpires can do is what Duquette was advocating
last week. The umpires are empowered by the rules to issue a
warning, or eject a pitcher, if they suspect he was deliberately
throwing at a hitter. If Tschida thought Martinez was aiming at
Diaz's head, he could have warned him immediately. And he certainly
could have tossed Nagy for his obvious nailing of Offerman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because umpires don't like the rule (about warnings),
sometimes they let it go a couple of batters too long, and then you
have a donnybrook,'' said Kibler. ``If the umpire says, `I'm
stopping it right now,' maybe you'd have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   And let's not forget Offerman, who could have defused the
situation by picking himself up and taking his base, accepting that
Nagy plunking him on the hip was payback for Diaz eating dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how it would have been done, back in the good old
days,'' Kibler said with a chuckle. ``Back in the good old days,
when pitchers were pitchers, hitters were hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   And everyone knew his place.
</P>
<P>

   Pen writes the story
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch has a sprained left wrist and was looking at
going on the disabled list for the first time in his career. Ricky
Ledee, the left fielder, is barely above the Mendoza Line. David
Cone has been whacked around, Roger Clemens has been inconsistent,
and even El Duque, Orlando Hernandez, was lit up by the Orioles
Friday night. And still, the Yankees roll on with the best record
in the American League. ``It's their bullpen,'' a major league
scout said. ``They've got the best group of relievers in baseball,
and that's even before they get to the closer. (Mike) Stanton is
throwing better than I've ever seen him.'' Stanton, the Bombers'
lefthanded specialist, qualifies as the Ex-Sox Player of the Week,
as the Yankee bullpen breezed through April with a 7-0 record.
According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it is the first time
anybody's bullpen has made it through April undefeated. Stanton
already has made 15 appearances and began the weekend with a 2.31
ERA. In 11 2/3 innings, he'd allowed just 11 hits and two walks
with a dozen strikeouts. Until the Orioles cuffed them around
Friday night, the pinstriped pen had a 1.20 ERA in its previous
dozen games. (Of course, New York still won Friday, on a Jorge
Posada home run in the ninth.) Stanton, Jeff Nelson, Jason
Grimsley, and Ramiro Mendoza, the swingman, give the Bombers depth
and quality no other team can match. The scout, incidentally, said
do not be fooled by Clemens's record. ``He's throwing the ball real
well, in terms of his velocity and command,'' the scout said. ``He
doesn't have the late action on his ball that he had earlier in his
career, but he's still effective. Cone has shown nothing, but I
wrote him off early last year, too, and look how he bounced back.
He's one of those special guys.'' . . . Padres pitcher Woody
Williams, who was a teammate of Cone in Toronto, was found to have
an aneurysm in his shoulder in virtually the identical spot where
Cone had his, under the left armpit. Williams is expected to be out
almost three months after having surgery last week. Cone called
with support. Williams said he noticed something was wrong the day
after his first start, in New York, when his wrist was red, sore,
and swollen. ``I didn't think anything of it,'' he said. ``The
second start, my fingers were numb and cold. And those last three
starts were hard to get through. If I'd kept pitching, chances are
I might've lost my hand.'' Cone was the same age (33) as Williams
when he had surgery in 1995; in his first start back, he threw
no-hit ball for seven innings. ``It's a scary-sounding word,'' Cone
said, ``but it is fixable.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gwynn's at-bats dry up
</P>
<P>
   Another Padre still hurting is Tony Gwynn, who has had fluid
drained from his knee five times. The eight-time batting champion,
who is on the DL, is hitting just .186, and it's almost certain
that the soon-to-be 40-year-old won't get the 502 at-bats he needs
to kick in next season's $4 million contract extension . . . The
early returns suggest that these Atlanta Braves may be stronger
than ever. The 15-game winning streak, a club record, was the
longest in the National League since Mays was a rookie, in 1951.
The pitching staff had a 1.98 ERA during the streak while the
offense not only outscored the opposition, 77-32, but showed a
knack for scoring late, pushing across 13 runs in the eighth inning
during the six-game trip that ended their streak. And a look at the
schedule suggests the Braves won't be slowing down soon. Starting
this weekend with the Phillies, the Braves do not face a team with
a winning record until they meet the Yankees June 1. And of their
next 19 games, the Braves play a dozen against teams currently in
last place, including six with the Phillies and three each with San
Diego and Milwaukee. Andres Galarraga is the great comeback story
of this or any year, catcher Javy Lopez has returned from a
difficult knee surgery as good as ever, and while John Rocker
continues to alienate anyone with a double-digit IQ, he had been
untouchable on the hill until Friday. Still, the difference between
this club and its predecessors may be the depth of its bench. Bobby
Bonilla, Wally Joyner, Trenidad Hubbard, and sensational kid
shortstop Rafael Furcal have joined Eddie Perez and Keith Lockhart
to give Bobby Cox more weapons than he's ever had . . . The Twins,
picking four spots ahead of the Red Sox in the 1994 draft, made
second baseman Todd Walker their first selection. The Sox took
Garciaparra. Last week, Walker, who hit .316 two seasons ago, was
sent down to the minors. He has asked to be traded, claiming
manager Tom Kelly has no confidence in his defense or his ability
to hit lefties. He's right on both counts. At the time he was sent
to Salt Lake City, Walker was batting .234, just .150 with runners
in scoring position . . . Who said it? ``Someday we'll wake up in
baseball. The brushback pitch is where it's got to stop. This isn't
the grand old game. We can't have guys throwing 95 mile-per-hour
weapons at someone's head. Baseball better get it stopped.''
Answer: Yes, it was a Clevelander, but he doesn't work for the
Tribe. Those were George Steinbrenner's words two years ago, after
Armando Benitez, then of the Orioles, hit Tino Martinez in the back
with a fastball.

TIME TO GET MOVING ON YASHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Senators last week hinted that they finally might trade
franchise center Alexei Yashin. Ottawa general manager Marshall
Johnston didn't make a Yashin deal sound like a fait accompli, but
the fact that he put the suggestion out there is a sure sign of
what's to come in the next few weeks _ the hottest sweepstakes
since the Quebec-Philadelphia deal that landed Eric Lindros on
Broad Street in '92.
</P>
<P>
   Yashin, in St. Petersburg, Russia, for the World Championships,
promptly and predictably responded to Johnston's hints with an ``I
love Ottawa'' campaign with the media. Great place, a great hockey
town, full of great people, he said. What he could have added, but
didn't: ``And I can't wait to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the sincerity. While he spoke, Yashin's girlfriend, Carol
Alt, punctuated his comments with what were chronicled as soft
kisses on his neck. If I weren't still sitting here with my
shinguards in place, another long season drawing to a conclusion as
I type this, it would be enough to make my knees buckle.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come, no matter what an arbitrator rules later this
month about his contract, for Yashin to be kissed goodbye by the
Senators.
</P>
<P>
   True, he is one great talent, and it's that talent that offered
him the comfort level to thumb his nose at a contract worth $3.6
million and demand one of two things from the Senators _ either a
lot more money or a trade to another club that would pay him a lot
more money. But people should live up to their signatures. If your
name means nothing, what does? Yashin showed the world, especially
those Ottawa fans he now praises, that honor is as old-world as the
one-time Russian empire.
</P>
<P>
   In Toronto later this month, arbitrator William Holden will
decide whether Yashin, suspended by the Senators early last
November for failing to report, still owes the team a year's work
at the agreed-upon price of $3.6 million. Holden's decision, said
Johnston, could influence whether the team seeks to move him.
</P>
<P>
   But Holden's ruling truly will be nothing more than part of the
negotiating price when the Senators open the bidding. In fact, even
if Holden doesn't declare Yashin a Group 2 free agent, and says he
has to work a year for the $3.6 million, Yashin no doubt will
insist that any club acquiring him just tear up the arbitrator's
decision. He already has lost a year's pay. He isn't going anywhere
for a deal of less than, say, three years at $8 million or better.
</P>
<P>
   The questions now are: (1) Who will pay him that? (2) What will
that team have to surrender?
</P>
<P>
   The first question isn't so tough. There are always clubs
willing to pay big dough for elite players, no matter how much they
complain about the salary drain. He's a malcontent when it comes to
money, but Yashin is an elite player, unique in that he has the
slick moves of a savvy pivot and the booming slapper of a power
forward. Think: Mike Modano-Cam Neely hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Senators have to think of landing an elite
player. That's always the trickiest part. When it came time for the
Oilers to deal Wayne Gretzky in '88, when he was right around
Yashin's current age, Oilers owner Peter Pocklington was only too
happy to take more in cash ($15 million) than in player stock
(Jimmy Carson, Martin Gelinas) and draft picks. But Ottawa needs a
big name in return, someone who can bring some real grit to the
lineup and make the Senators a bona fide contender.
</P>
<P>
   The pool of prospective swaps, as viewed here: Zigmund Palffy,
Los Angeles; Sergei Fedorov, Detroit; Keith Tkachuk, Phoenix; Teemu
Selanne, Anaheim; Vincent Lecavalier, Tampa Bay; and Lindros,
Philadelphia. Of the bunch, Tkachuk and Lindros by far would bring
the most grit. The real prize to acquire from Anaheim would be Paul
Kariya, and he's only a year younger than Yashin, but the Ducks
wouldn't be that daring, and the Senators don't want his price tag
($10 million a year).
</P>
<P>
   Nearly eight years later, wouldn't the Flyers love to have a
do-over for the Lindros deal? Remember what they gave up for
L'Enfant Terrible: Peter Forsberg, Steve Duchesne, Kerry Huffman,
Mike Ricci, Ron Hextall, Chris Simon, and a pair of first-round
picks (Joceyln Thibault and Nolan Baumgartner). Yeow. At the time,
Lindros was 19 years old, touted as a Cup kingpin for 10-12 years.
Now he's 27, still without a Cup, and his long list of injuries
makes him a very questionable commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Yashin's shelf life is no more than 5-7 years now. He's not
going to bring Ottawa a Lindroslike ransom, but don't worry, the
bidding will be high. It would be even higher if Yashin's play were
as important to him as his pay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wrong number
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Roenick has one year remaining on his deal in Phoenix,
which puts him on target to be an unrestricted free agent July 1,
2001. His Boston-based agent, Neil Abbott, said Friday that Coyote
GM Bobby Smith called in December to get a general feel what it
would take to extend Roenick's deal. ``I gave him an idea,'' said
Abbott, ``and never heard back.'' No doubt Roenick will want
something similar to what the Red Wings recently handed Brendan
Shanahan: $26 million over four years, with a club option at $6.5
million for a fifth year. ``I wouldn't call that a stretch,'' said
Abbott. Don't be surprised if the Desert Dogs deal Roenick this
summer, if only because it may be impossible to find anyone to take
on Tkachuk's $8.3 million pact. They could wheel Roenick for a
young, cheap prospect and use the savings to bring back No. 1
goalie Nikolai Khabibulin . . . Bryan Lewis, the NHL's supervisor
of officials, estimates that referees Dan Marouelli and Rob Shick
each skated 14.2 miles in Philly's 2-1 victory over Pittsburgh
Thursday night, settled in the fifth OT. Asked what kind of
overtime compensation the two whistleblowers would receive, Lewis
said, ``Oh, about the same OT a writer gets in a game like that.''
. . . Count Bruins Hall of Fame goaltender Gerry Cheevers among
those who hold Boston University netminder Rick DePietro in high
regard. ``What I've seen of him, he's terrific,'' said Cheevers.
``He always seems to be in position. He handles the puck well. He's
confident. And he's got charisma up the ying-yang.'' DiPietro last
week signed the papers that make him eligible for next month's
entry draft, forfeiting his final three years at BU. Many scouts
figure he'll get grabbed in the top 10. ``Just about every team out
there would have to be interested,'' said Cheevers. ``Remember, if
you answer your goaltending situation with a 20-year-old, you've
taken away a big headache for a very long time.'' . . . How badly
do the Senators need grit? Their top trio, Radek Bonk-Magnus
Arvedson-Marian Hossa, was held without a point in the first-round
playoff loss to Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Pricing himself out
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for unrestricted free agent Tom Barrasso to be back
tending net in Ottawa. Overall, he did his job, but reports out of
Ottawa have him looking for a two-year deal worth about $3.5
million per year . . . The new GM in Calgary, replacing Al Coates,
most likely will be Mike Murphy, longtime pal of Flames president
Ron Bremner. This past season, Murphy has shared NHL discipline
duties with Colin Campbell . . . The Sabres have to figure out how
to protect both goalies, Dominik Hasek and Martin Biron, in the
expansion draft or risk losing a decent position player _ maybe
Richard Smehlik on defense or Erik Rasmussen up front. Unless, of
course, they wheel Hasek. But they wouldn't do that, would they? .
. . USA Hockey abruptly fired Jeff Jackson and his top aide, Bob
Mancini, a major shakeup for the national development team based in
Ann Arbor, Mich. Jackson, ex- of Lake Superior State, had been with
the program since its inception. One name to keep in mind as a
possible new coach: former NHL forward Mike Eaves, now back in
Minnesota after getting canned as one of Kevin Constantine's
assistants in Pittsburgh . . . Word around Montreal is that
ex-Buffalo goalie Bob Sauve could replace Rejean Houle as the
Canadiens general manager. Houle is still on the job, but has been
widely rumored for weeks to be headed out the door. Sauve and
Pierre Lacroix, the Avalanche GM, once were partners as player
agents, but Sauve took over the job in full when Lacroix was hired
away as the Nordiques boss. How about Habs coach Alain Vigneault
making it to the short list, along with Joel Quenneville (St.
Louis) and Ron Wilson, for the Jack Adams Award as Coach of the
Year? The Habs remained in the hunt for a playoff berth right to
the end, despite 500-plus man-games lost to injury. If he wins it,
it wouldn't be the Jack Adams, said Vigneault, ``It would be the
Patch Adams.'' . . . The Rangers gave Pittsburgh owner Mario
Lemieux a call for permission to speak to Craig Patrick about
returning to Manhattan for another stint as Blueshirts GM. A waste
of a call, said Patrick, because he's too happy doing the job in
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   See you later
</P>
<P>
   In case you missed it, the Flyers said that Ulf Samuelsson's
sprained knee will keep him out of the remainder of the postseason.
That may explain the void you've been feeling this spring . . .
Deal of deals: The Tampa Bay Lightning next season will price 1,500
seats at $10 apiece and hundreds more at $8 a pop. This is a
franchise reported to have given away in excess of 100,000 tickets
last season . . . The Hurricanes believe they could have as many as
seven kids from their farm team, the Cincinnati Cyclones, playing
for them in 2000-01. That's just what the Bruins were thinking
about their crop of Baby B's last summer. Meanwhile defenseman Paul
Coffey is an unrestricted free agent. If he doesn't re-sign in
Raleigh, look for him to surface in Toronto, where the Leafs will
have to cover themselves if Bryan Berard can't make it back from
his eye injury . . . While he's been away fighting the World battle
in St. Petersburg, Bruins defenseman Hal Gill has slipped a notch
on Jaromir Jagr's belt. Jagr now says Philly's Chris Therien, 6-5,
230, is the toughest blue liner he faces . . . Look for Atlanta to
move netminder Norm Maracle and find someone to put the heat on No.
1 Damian Rhodes. The plan is for ex-UMass-Lowell netminder Scott
Fankhouser to spend at least a full year in the minors . . . Former
Bruin Dave Ellett won't be asked back to St. Louis. Look for
Stephane Richer and Bay Stater Jim Campbell also to get their
Bluenote pink slips . . . Now that Bill Ranford has retired, the
Oilers need someone to provide relief for Tommy Salo, who played in
70 games this season. Don't be surprised if Oiler boss Glen Sather
calls Boston and inquires about getting Rob Tallas . . . Edmonton's
chief scout out West, Lorne Davis, believes DiPietro is the best
goalie he's seen in the draft since Grant Fuhr (selected No. 8
overall by Edmonton in '81) . . . In his playing days, Cheevers was
known for his general disdain for practice. Asked recently how his
golf game was progressing, he said, ``Not bad. I've got some new
clubs, and I've got to get out there and practice. If you know me
and practice, I'll be done at 11.'' Time of the quote: 9:53 a.m.

NO CUTTING CORNERS ON NASCAR'S OVALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are the barbarians at the gate. They are the ``outside
influences'' infecting the NASCAR Winston Cup Series with tempting
offers of performance-enhancing products that, they claim, are
invisible to NASCAR inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   They are the cheaters, the scofflaws, the bandits corrupting the
sport with promises of easy circumvention of NASCAR rules.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, NASCAR sent a message when it hit driver Jeremy
Mayfield, car owner Michael Kranefuss, and crew chief Peter
Sospenzo with a series of severe penalties for using an illegal
fuel additive in an April 16 race at Talladega, Ala. Mayfield's No.
12 Mobil 1 Ford Taurus won the pole position but finished 14th.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors impounded the car following the race and detected the
additive _ or oxygenate _ that enriched the fuel mixture with
additional pure oxygen. It had been put in the tank, NASCAR
discovered, by an unidentified crew member during Mayfield's final
pit stop. Mayfield and Kranefuss were absolved of complicity in the
wrongdoing by Mike Helton, NASCAR's senior vice president and chief
operating officer, but they were penalized nonetheless. Mayfield
was stripped of 151 Winston Cup points, dropping him from seventh
to 14th in the standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like when my father used to do it, when he'd take off his
belt,'' said Helton. ``He'd give you two whacks for what you did,
and another so that you wouldn't do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield won last Sunday's NAPA 500 at California Speedway,
becoming NASCAR's 10th different winner this season. That victory
was allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Kranefuss, who operates the team, co-owned by Roger Penske, also
was docked 151 owners' points and fined $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sospenzo was suspended for three races (until June 6) and hit
with an additional $25,000 fine Thursday when the roof of
Mayfield's winning car was found to be under the 51-inch minimum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a whole lot you can say under the circumstances,''
Kranefuss said in a statement. ``Mistakes were made and there were
certainly some grave errors in judgment. We won the pole at
Talladega by following the rules, which NASCAR confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, we accept the penalty, we have taken
disciplinary action within our team, and we apologize to our fans,
our sponsors, NASCAR and the other teams. We will make sure nothing
like this will ever happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   But how can NASCAR prevent some snake oil salesman from offering
a team a ``wonder product''? These are independent schemers who
operate outside NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Said Helton, ``After New Hampshire _ or `Tiregate' as a lot of
people called it a couple of years ago _ we circled back with all
the car owners and crew chiefs and explained to them what was
flying around out there, including a letter, quite frankly, that
began to get our attention on the bigger issue of people out there
making claims they could get around our rules and regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what kind of started the process. The dilemma we face
is that our authority, basically, is limited to NASCAR members. So
we have a process where we work with NASCAR members. What we are
investigating is the possibility of NASCAR, as a company, going
after people who make erroneous allegations beyond being a member.
That's complicated and that's part of the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent rules violations, Helton doesn't think there is a
cheating epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's massive or overwhelming at this point,'' he
said, ``but even the tire situation or the fuel situation that
we've had in the last 18 months is enough for NASCAR to pay serious
enough attention to it to do the right thing by the garage area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what happens, for the most part, the teams are smarter
than the sellers are. I think the teams understand that this really
can't happen, but if you hear it enough, then you start believing
in it, and our concern is people being that cavalier with the topic
and the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say in this particular incident with the 12 car that
there's a chain of reactions that leads us to understand that this
was not a case of someone coming by the shop selling snake oil and
making claims against NASCAR's rule-making process. This is a good
deal different situation that we found out during the
investigation, but it still brings to light a bigger issue that we
have a great deal of interest in following up on.''

   Formula One driver David Coulthard will be back behind the wheel
for Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix in Barcelona after he, his fiancee
Heidi Wichlinski, and personal trainer Andy Matthews survived a
crash landing of their private jet in Lyon, France. The aircraft's
two pilots were killed in the crash. Coulthard, a 29-year-old
Scotsman, spoke Thursday about the harrowing crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish to express our heartfelt sympathies to the families of
the two pilots, David Saunders and Dan Worley, who behaved with the
utmost professionalism throughout the incident,'' said Coulthard,
who was traveling from England to Nice, France, when the Learjet
developed engine problems. ``During the flight the co-pilot
informed us that we had an engine problem and would have to make an
emergency landing at Lyon, which would be in about 10 minutes time.
Prior to the landing, we had time to prepare ourselves in the
`brace' position.
</P>
<P>
   ``On impact, a wing tank ruptured and there was a fire on the
right side of the aircraft. When the plane finally came to rest,
the front of the cockpit had broken free from the main fuselage. At
this point we established that the only way out was through the
front of the aircraft. Andy led the way through the debris, and as
this part of the aircraft was 3 or 4 feet above the ground, I
followed Andy out so that we could help Heidi get down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we were all clear of the plane, I returned to see whether
there was anything we could do for the pilots. But there was
nothing to be done.''

   Al Unser Jr. ended a five-year drought in open-wheel racing when
he won the Vegas.com 500 April 22 at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
Unser, who was let go from his CART ride with Penske's outfit last
year, was reunited with former boss Rick Galles on the Northern
Lights Series Indy Racing League circuit. ``When Roger made the
announcement in Detroit about his two (new) drivers, Rick Galles
called me the next day,'' Unser said. ``There are people in this
world that never give up on you, and Rick Galles is one of those
people.'' Last week, Unser and Galles, who teamed to win the 1992
Indy 500, returned to the fabled Brickyard for an open test
session. It was Unser's first time in an open-wheel car at Indy
since his ill-fated qualifying attempt in 1995. ``When I pulled out
of the pits, it was great,'' Unser said. ``It was great to be back.
All the same feelings _ you know, the tradition, the heritage of
this place _ just came screaming back and it was wonderful.'' . . .
New Hampshire International Speedway will kick off its 2000 season
Saturday with a 200-lap Busch Series and 125-lap Busch North Series
doubleheader. Drivers will square off on the softball diamond in a
benefit game Thursday at 6:30 p.m. at Memorial Field in Concord,
N.H. An autograph session will take place at 5:30 . . . Jerry
Marquis, of East Windsor, Conn., will be juggling a hectic schedule
this season, attempting to campaign cars in the Busch North,
Featherlite Modified, and SK Modified Series at Stafford Motor
Speedway in Stafford Springs, Conn., where he is the reigning New
England Region Winston Weekly Racing Series champion. ``It makes it
more difficult to focus on one or the other, where you have to
actually concentrate on two different styles of open-wheel cars and
then your full-fendered car with the Busch North Series, so it
gives you three different kinds of scenarios in racing,'' said
Marquis, who also pulled triple duty in 1996 and parts of 1998.
``Basically, I'm kind of used to that and I was able to adjust my
driving style and adjust the tempos of both series by doing that on
a two-night-a-week basis. I think that actually physically trained
me to be prepared and be able to handle that kind of a challenge.''

IBF TAKING BIGGEST HITS IN COURTROOM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ While last week's heavyweight title fight between
undisputed champion Lennox Lewis and challenger Michael Grant
hogged the headlines in Manhattan, just down the Jersey Turnpike a
more important fight was going on in a Newark courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government is fighting to lock the doors of the
International Boxing Federation and put its president, Robert Lee
Sr., and several accomplices behind bars for taking bribes and
selling ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Beavers, a former chairman of the IBF rating committee,
spent most of last week ratting out former accomplices, telling
stories of how he stuffed cash in his sock and delivered it to Lee
in a hotel room for ratings considerations. The FBI caught the
transaction on videotape, but the judge refused to allow the tape
as evidence, claiming Lee had a right to assume privacy in his
hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Bob Arum, among those who will testify to having paid
such bribes, told federal investigators he paid $100,000 to get
unrated Axel Schultz approved as an opponent for George Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   During an HBO-sponsored symposium on the future of boxing,
Foreman denied that a bribe was paid. Anyone who knows how cheap
Foreman is wouldn't doubt it, but Arum admitted the money was for
that purpose.
</P>
<P>
   That the IBF was taking money hand over fist to sell its ratings
seems impossible to dispute. That the World Boxing Association and
World Boxing Council have conducted business in a similar fashion
may not be provable. What was significant in boxing last week was
really not the fight between Lewis and Grant but the fight between
the federal government and the IBF.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government loses this case, it's business as usual in
boxing,'' said Time Warner Sports president Seth Abraham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other sport has some kind of apparatus to run it. It has
some kind of organization with a commissioner who has powers to
enforce the rules. Boxing is the closest thing to buccaneering left
in the world. If the government wins this case and begins to change
that, the sport will benefit greatly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a very significant case,'' said Arum. ``The
resolution of this case, plus the enactment of the Muhammad Ali
Reform Act (championed by Arizona Sen. John McCain), bodes well for
the sport if the government wins.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sanctioning organizations have suffocated the growth of
boxing. So the question is not should those organizations disappear
but what to put in their place. With the proliferation of these
organizations there are now dozens of champions and no sense to any
of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are strict rules in the sport but not in the business of
the sport. The rules all involve the ritualistic functions like the
weigh-in and the signing of contracts filed with the commissions
that turn out to be completely different from the real contracts
signed for a big fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, these local commissions don't have enough people
or money to police the sport. The reality is, where McCain is
moving will be a hybrid of state and federal regulation but on a
national basis. Not a federal commission but a national commission
using the association of state boxing commissions for an
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for any of that to happen, the government has to win this
case first.''
</P>
<P>
   Arum is probably right about that. So the big fight last weekend
was not really at Madison Square Garden; it was in a Newark
courthouse barely noticed by boxing fans. It's a fight that's long
from over . . . and long overdue.

   David Tua believes he has an advantage over Lewis, an advantage
most people would overlook. He's 6 inches shorter than the
6-foot-5-inch champion. Most people believe Lewis's size is his
biggest asset, but Tua has his doubts. ``Lewis for many years has
looked good against taller, bigger guys,'' Tua said after Lewis's
demolition of the 6-7 Grant. ``All he has to do is punch straight
at them. For me, he'll have to punch down. I'll slip punches, hit
him in the body, hit him in the chest. I'll see his body all night
in front of me.'' Tua, the IBF's top contender, will get his shot
at Lewis no later than November. Promoters are having preliminary
discussions for a Lewis-Tua fight, which should make for an
interesting negotiation. Kathy Duva's Main Events promotional
company represents Lewis and used to represent Tua before he jumped
to America Presents, the Dan Goossen-led promotional arm that also
represents Mike Tyson on a fight-by-fight basis. ``No disrespect,
but Lennox is tailor-made for me,'' said Tua (35-1, 30 KOs).
``Lennox doesn't have a problem when his punches are going straight
ahead to a man that is standing directly in front of him on the
same level. When he's punching down, the angle of his punches don't
work as well. Lennox can't box a smaller man on the inside. He'll
have to try to distance himself with a jab, which he will not be
able to do with my pressure. I'll be the one working on the inside.
His reach will be useless.'' . . . One person buying into Tua's
theory is a guy who looks a lot like him _ Tyson. He told a British
reporter, ``Tua's angry, mean, and hungry. He's got that look in
his eye like he's ready to kill someone. I hope it's not Lewis,
because I want to end Lewis.'' Tyson is supposed to be fighting in
June or July against Lou Savarese in Italy, but the fight has
already been postponed twice because Tyson wasn't ready . . . TVKO
reported a disappointing estimate of only 375,000 buys for the
Lewis-Grant fight. But TVKO senior vice president Mark Taffet
claimed the fight ``performed in the manner we expected,'' because
they didn't expect much. Lewis may be the undisputed champion, but
fans don't want to pay to watch him fight . . . Of a fight with
Tyson, Tua has a promotional suggestion. ``That fight should be on
Independence Day because it would be fireworks,'' Tua said. ``We're
both strong guys. One from a different era and one from the present
era but with the same style of fighting.'' . . . Junior Jones is
talking about retiring, less than a week after his TKO loss to IBF
featherweight champion Paul Ingle. Jones told friends his legs no
longer allow him to do what he used to do and that it is time to
stop. Jones fought bravely against Ingle but could not keep up with
the young Brit's relentless attack. Trainer Teddy Atlas got Jones
to the 11th round using a style that kept Jones in the fight early
and opened it up later when time was running out. It nearly worked.
Jones dropped Ingle in the ninth round, but when he didn't finish
him, Atlas knew the rest of the night would be difficult. One funny
moment in the fight occurred after Ingle was knocked down. Gary
Gittelson, Jones's manager, screamed at Atlas, ``You did it!'' When
he saw Ingle get up on sturdy legs, Atlas turned to Gittelson and
said calmly, ``This fight is far from over.'' . . . Undefeated
light heavyweight champion Darius Michalczewski was asked if he
might want to see his two sons, ages 8 and 13, become boxers. ``In
my mind, the environment is not appropriate for them to become
boxers,'' Michalczewski said. ``It's because they have such a great
life. I would like to see my son a world champion but I know how
hard it is. If I have the chance to advise him against doing it,
then I will. He can work out a bit, but he doesn't need to become a
boxer. One boxer in the family is enough. They should continue
learning and improve their mind. Not everybody must become an
athlete. Both are very intelligent boys. They are very good at
school. They have the chance to continue learning because they
don't have to worry about financial problems. I would love to have
a son who is a professional world champion, but I couldn't bear if
he would get knocked out. This would break my heart.''

</P>
<P>
   Around and around
</P>
<P>
   Here's Sugar Ray Leonard's view of how people see the sport that
made him rich and famous. ``People have this misconception about
boxing and who does it,'' Leonard said. ``A lot of people think the
kids are bad, in gangs or something, but in reality, the sport
instills discipline, character, and there are a lot of good people
in boxing. I really wish it didn't have the image it has.'' . . .
According to Lewis, Evander Holyfield ``is a person that never
stuck by any rules. I don't need to call him a hypocrite once
again. We've already passed that stage. He knows what he's doing.''
. . . A book written by Ali's close friend Howard Bingham claims
Ali did not win the original Supreme Court vote on his draft
registration case. ``Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight: Cassius Clay
vs. The United States of America'' claims the original vote was 5-3
to uphold his conviction but Justice John Harlan changed his mind
and then his vote, deadlocking it at 4-4. Harlan convinced others
to change their votes, and Ali ended up with a 8-0 victory and the
freedom to return to boxing . . . New York attorney Howard Sirota
is forming a new ranking organization, with boxing writers voting
online for the top 20 fighters in the various weight classes. The
theory is this will be a far less corruptive system than the IBF,
WBC, and WBA rankings. Backed by New York Post columnist Jack
Newfield, novelist and editor Pete Hamill, and Budd Schulberg, who
wrote ``On the Waterfront,'' the idea is based on the college
football and basketball rakings. They couldn't do any worse than
the present system . . . Cuban defector and former Olympic gold
medalist Joel Casamayor has dedicated his May 21 fight for the WBA
super featherweight title to Elian Gonzalez. ``I don't like to talk
about politics but I would like to see him stay here,'' Casamayor
said. ``This boy has touched my heart. I'm dedicating my fight to
the freedom of Elian Gonzalez.'' Casamayor, who defected along with
then-Cuban national teammate Ramon Garbey, left Miami to train and
live in Las Vegas because of ``too many distractions'' in a city in
which the local Cuban community remains rabidly anti-Castro . . .
Bernard Hopkins is back on the Roy Jones-Richard Hall undercard
after promoter Murad Muhammad dumped him. HBO would not allow
Muhammad's fighter, Brian Barbosa, to fight Hopkins because he had
suffered severe cuts in his last fight and had only six weeks to
heal. After weeks of negotiations, a settlement was reached and
Hopkins will fight Syd Vanderpool . . . Give Wladimir Klitschko
credit. Although it was his brother, Vitali, who quit in the ring
against Chris Byrd because of a torn rotator cuff, Wladimir
understands the problem it created for both of them. ``I understand
what happened,'' the younger Klitschko said. ``Vitali's career has
to start over again, and so does mine. I understand people's
perception.''

   Micky Ward's representatives met with HBO senior vice president
Lou DiBella about getting the Lowell junior welterweight on an HBO
card. Nothing has been lined up but DiBella would like to use Ward
this summer . . . John Ruiz will be outfitted by Trained 2 Survive,
the one-year-old Salem-based sports apparel company, for his June
10 fight against Holyfield. ``John Ruiz embodies the spirit of our
company,'' said Dave Dunton, founder of Trained 2 Survive. ``He
more than exemplifies our philosophy that there are no excuses in
life and to believe in yourself. John liked our line, and we're
excited to be working with him on this marketing venture.

BEATHARD MAKES A GRACIOUS EXIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just over a week ago, the NFL lost the kind of person it can ill
afford to lose. The kind of guy you find less and less in front
offices in these days of computer printouts, tight-fitting salary
caps, and bean counters making decisions based on salaries rather
than production.
</P>
<P>
   It lost a football guy. A real football guy.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand why 63-year-old Bobby Beathard finally
decided to retire to his surfboard and his 12 grandchildren after
37 years in the NFL, but he still will be sorely missed. Not only
in San Diego, where he had been general manager since 1990 and
built a Super Bowl team in 1995, but throughout the insular world
of professional football.
</P>
<P>
   Once considered a drafting guru, Beathard never got full of
himself when he was an integral part of building seven Super Bowl
teams _ in Kansas City, Miami, Washington, and San Diego. Because
of that, he never got too down the last few years when his drafting
acumen was called into question by people who knew far less than he
did and the Chargers failed to return to the Super Bowl, plagued by
more than a few drafting gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   The last big name he picked may prove to be his biggest bust, in
fact. Ryan Leaf has shown nothing but immaturity and a bad temper
since coming into the NFL. But even though he may be a bust, he was
not a mistake, and Beathard went out knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   Although he may have traded away his team's future to get Leaf
with the second pick of the 1998 draft, it was not a mistake. Leaf
was the wrong guy, but there was no other guy with his talent
except the guy taken ahead of him, Peyton Manning. Although he
never said it publicly, Beathard, had he had his druthers, would
have taken Manning, and had that happened, he'd probably still be
working in San Diego, but so what?
</P>
<P>
   Beathard did the right thing the day he traded up to grab Leaf,
just as he did the right thing most of the days he was running NFL
war rooms. He wasn't right all the time _ nobody is _ but he was
right most of the time, and few personnel men can claim that, so he
goes out with his head high and facing the sun and the waves he
still loves to ride.
</P>
<P>
   He also goes out the way he acted most of the time he was in
power _ with unerring grace.
</P>
<P>
   When asked at the March owners' meetings about Leaf _ as rumors
of Beathard's impending retirement were already circulating _
Beathard said, ``I'm rooting for him to pull it together. Not for
me. For himself and for the Chargers.''
</P>
<P>
   This was said about an infantile, petulant, 21-year-old
multimillionaire who hadn't done a thing for Beathard and the
Chargers but make them look foolish. This was typical of Beathard,
who was no Pollyanna but no Hannibal Lecter, either.
</P>
<P>
   So don't believe the stories that Leaf's failures and lousy
personality drove Beathard to despair. Don't believe the six No. 1s
he traded during his time in San Diego for players who seldom
worked out did it, either.
</P>
<P>
   It simply was his time for leaving, and so he left. Left with a
few tears in his eyes during his final press conference, but with
his head held high.
</P>
<P>
   As it should have been.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Charger in charge
</P>
<P>
   It figures that Beathard was not replaced by Billy Devaney, his
longtime assistant in personnel matters, but rather by Ed McGuire,
the Chargers' capologist. Devaney will head the scouting department
and run the draft but he will report to McGuire . . . How sick is
American society? Consider this. According to All Stretched Out
Limousine Service in Linthicum, Md., the Lincoln Navigator that
Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis was using the night he
allegedly was involved in the murder of two men is now the hottest
car the company has. The stretch SUV that seats 14 is rented almost
every night, even though it costs $1,500 for eight hours. It also
was the featured car in the Ferndale (Md.) 2000 Day parade,
sandwiched between fire trucks and convertibles with Miss Anne
Arundel County inside. All bullet holes and bloodstains have been
cleaned up, so riders have to use their imagination when it comes
to what happened Super Bowl night in Atlanta. The car will reappear
in Atlanta in three weeks when the jury in the murder trial takes a
look at it . . . This story shouldn't surprise you. Denver bad boy
linebacker Bill Romanowski got into hot water with teammate Terrell
Davis last week when he slammed into the recovering running back
during a noncontact drill without pads. It was one of the first
days Davis had worked around other players since tearing his knee
apart a year ago, and he was less than pleased with Romanowski, who
has been fined by everybody else in football for his
extracurricular activities so why not his own team? ``Romo is
Romo,'' head coach Mike Shanahan said. ``He didn't even know what
he did.'' Well, Davis knew . . . The Miami Dolphins have altered
their defensive set and lineup to try to get more of a pass rush
out of quick but undersized linemen Jason Taylor and Lorenzo
Bromell. Head coach Dave Wannstedt has moved Bromell from tackle to
end on the opposite side of Taylor. Both will play farther outside
the offensive tackles to take advantage of their quickness and
minimize the problems that arise from their relative lack of size.
The 6-foot-6-inch Taylor weighs barely 250 and last year had only 2
1/2 sacks. The shift of Bromell also was insurance for the future,
because at the end of next season Taylor, Rich Owens, and Trace
Armstrong all can become free agents . . . Aug. 23 has been
declared Dan Marino Day in Miami, with an official celebration
scheduled for Pro Player Park to honor the retiring quarterback.

   Patriots cornerback Ty Law is a headache for the Dolphins even
in the offseason. Miami All-Pro cornerback Sam Madison has begun
negotiating a contract extension, and agent Gene Burroughs is using
as a standard Law's seven-year contract with its $14.2 million
signing bonus . . . He is filling big shoes, but Marcellus Wiley
believes his feet and his talent are big enough. The Buffalo Bills'
young defensive end has inherited Bruce Smith's position, a
position Smith filled well enough to be a lock for the Hall of
Fame. Wiley comes from an unlikely place for an NFL starter _
Columbia University _ but the former second-round draft choice
showed enough promise that general manager John Butler felt
comfortable letting Smith leave for Washington as a free agent.
Wiley doesn't seem uncomfortable with the idea, either. ``I didn't
want to be a 10-year veteran backup,'' Wiley said. ``I was going to
come into this camp challenging him anyway.'' Oh, really? Two years
ago, Wiley led the team with 27 quarterback pressures. Last year he
had 21, although he made only 8 1/2 sacks in the two seasons
combined. Coach Wade Phillips said that, in some pass rushing
situations, Wiley ``looks like Bruce,'' which is a bit much when
you're talking about one of the leading sackers in NFL history.
Although his goal is to exceed the seven sacks a slowed-down Smith
had last season, Wiley wouldn't make a specific prediction, he
said, because ``that's the Nostradamus effect.'' Sounds like he
went to Columbia; most guys in his position would be talking about
the Notre Damus effect. Wiley refuses to get into comparisons with
Smith because he knows the man he's replacing will only grow in
legend, but he did say confidently, ``It's going to be me this
year. It's going to be Marcellus.'' So the Bills hope . . . Only
the Oakland Raiders could lose money on attendance when the NFL is
not in season. A month ago, lawyers for team owner Al Davis claimed
he was owed $825 million in damages and lost revenue for an alleged
breach of contract by Alameda County and the city of Oakland
involving sellouts he was promised for moving the team from Los
Angeles. When those same attorneys finally appeared in Superior
Court in Sacramento last week, they claimed the figure was now $1.1
billion. According to them, the team is worth $400 million less
than it would have been with a string of sellouts, so they want
that money, too. Good luck making that argument. As it is, the deal
is already costing the citizens of Oakland and Alameda County $15
million a year in loan payments. The government contends the
contract never guaranteed the team any income, but Davis contends
public statements by government officials before the lease was
signed led him to believe he had such guarantees. If you've ever
spent five minutes talking to Davis, you know one thing. He wasn't
duped by anybody . . . Washington cornerback Champ Bailey got his
first exposure to offense during minicamp, but it amounted to only
one screen pass thrown to him by backup quarterback Jeff George.
Coach Norv Turner said he may try to get the former Georgia two-way
player the ball as a receiver, but he's not likely to let him
return kicks or punts. Although Turner claims he has return men who
handle the ball better, the fact is the Redskins learned their
lesson on such matters after watching the New York Giants lose Pro
Bowl cornerback Jason Sehorn two years ago on a punt return. In his
rookie season last year, Bailey started all 16 games and led the
team in passes defended (17) and had five interceptions . . . The
Philadelphia Eagles may have the biggest set of offensive tackles
in football with 6-8, 330-pound free agent acquisition Jon Runyan
and 6-8, 330-plus-pound Tra Thomas.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Realignment plan
</P>
<P>
   Like the Dolphins, the Eagles are also making a strategic change
in the way they line up on defense. Head coach Andy Reid has
decided to use outside linebacker Carlos Emmons on the tight end
regardless of what side he is on, making Barry Gardner the
weak-side linebacker full-time. They also plan to move their
linebackers off the line to allow them to play more in space and
use their speed to flow to the ball . . . Ex-Boston College lineman
Doug Brzezinski worked at center for the Eagles during a recent
minicamp. There is no plan to convert him, but with Steve Everitt's
release, they are looking for security at the position . . . The
Detroit Lions may find themselves in a bind in July. After signing
running back James Stewart to a huge free agent contract, they are
now being told in whispers that Barry Sanders intends to report to
training camp rather than repay the team millions. Sanders made the
initial payment of more than $88,000 last year, but this season's
installment would be well over $1 million, and word is he won't pay
it. Instead, he'll report and the Lions almost certainly will face
a huge salary cap hit, because they won't be able to get rid of
either Sanders or Stewart. For the time being, though, the Lions
are operating as if Sanders will not be back and Sanders is doing
what he always does _ saying nothing . . . Nothing will be official
until June 1, but it appears Randall Cunningham will be released by
the Minnesota Vikings, the team that helped him revive his career
two seasons ago, and likely sign an incentive-laden contract with
the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to back up second-year starter Shaun King.
Cunningham was not invited to a recent Vikings minicamp, so he
stayed in Las Vegas to work out on his own. Bubby Brister took
snaps behind No. 1 quarterback Daunte Culpepper in Minnesota, and
took them a lot cheaper than Cunningham would have because he
stands to earn $3.3 million this year . . . According to Keyshawn
Johnson, he's going to be on the leading edge of more than just
pass receiving this year. With the launch of Keyshawn.com, Johnson
says he will create a state-of-the-art Web site honoring himself
with ``a highlight show like ESPN, with live highlights.'' That
idea should last until Johnson is informed that he'll have to pay
to get the rights. Johnson spoke to that issue recently at an
Internet seminar in Santa Monica, Calif., when he claimed that
athletes should have some rights to the use of their own images.
Johnson acknowledged that the NFL would likely fight him over the
use of logos, but he had a quick retort to that: ``The NFL may own
them, but ultimately we wear 'em and in fact if we didn't wear 'em,
they wouldn't be much use to them anyway.'' Good point.

   No word from Young
</P>
<P>
   Steve Young caused a stir in San Francisco last week when he
made a brief appearance on the last day of minicamp. Young told
reporters he would not make a decision about playing again until
late this month. General manager Bill Walsh is opposed to the
return of Young or Jerry Rice, believing it's time to move on. But
it's difficult with such high-profile players. The 49ers seem to
have moved on, however. They drafted two quarterbacks in April,
Walsh told other coaches at the annual owners meetings that Young
would not be back, and head coach Steve Mariucci has said the team
would release Young if he asked out. Young had not talked directly
with Walsh about the issue until last week, and now calls that a
mistake. With Young's concussion history, the bigger mistake would
be coming back. But don't be surprised if he's in an NFL uniform in
September. Just not a 49er uniform . . . Rice's position is equally
uncomfortable. Rice, perhaps the greatest receiver in NFL history,
stands to earn $3.95 million this season, and the Niners don't want
to pay it. They want to slash his contract to bring down his cap
number. Rice says he's willing to do that but also calls it an
issue not about money but about ``respect.'' Whenever you hear that
word connected with a contract negotiation, you know it's going to
be a problem. A case in point was Johnson's problems with the Jets,
which were not about money of course but about respect _ about $7
million a year worth of ``respect,'' as I recall. Rice has said
he's ``at peace'' with the situation, in part because he watched
old friends Joe Montana and Ronnie Lott go through the same purging
in San Francisco . . . The future of Rice and Young was not the
main thing on the 49ers' minds during that minicamp. They had 21
defensive backs, which should make clear one area they are
addressing . . . Old friend Bill Kuharich landed on his feet as the
new pro personnel director of the Kansas City Chiefs. Kuharich, who
was fired as general manager of the New Orleans Saints after a 3-13
season, rejoins Chiefs president and GM Carl Peterson, for whom he
worked in his first pro football job with the USFL's Philadelphia
Stars . . . St. Louis Rams quarterback Kurt Warner may have done
more for the future of the Arena League than any other player in
history. Not only did his meteroic rise to Super Bowl MVP enhance
the indoor league's profile because he is an alumnus of the Iowa
Barnstormers, but he recently signed a deal with a video game
company to create a game called Kurt Warner's Arena Football
Unleashed. Despite hundreds of offseason offers of various types,
Warner is still the first player at the Rams' facility in the
offseason, according to head coach Mike Martz. ``He's 100 percent
in attendance,'' Martz said. Warner is already 11 pounds lighter
(205) than a year ago and has scheduled his off-field commitments
for weekends since the team's conditioning program began April 3 .
. . Cleveland Browns head coach Chris Palmer is about as good a guy
as there is, but that doesn't mean he's not the boss. At last
week's minicamp, he warned free agent linebacker Joey Mayo not to
hit offensive players when the team was working without pads. When
Mayo did it anyway, Palmer warned him not to let it happen again.
The next day it did, and Palmer ran him off the field as promised.
When Mayo at first refused to budge, Palmer sent equipment manager
Bobby Monica over to make it clear he meant business. ``I made it
very explicit if it happened again he was going home, so he went
home,'' Palmer said.

RANGERS' WOES NO REASON FOR SOS TO DEION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Doug Melvin, you know it's not your day, your week, or maybe
even your season, when the lovely and talented Deioness is rumored
to be coming back to the Chicken-Fried Kingdom, yet Jerry Jones is
not remotely involved in the pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was only last week at the Cowboys' minicamp when
there was private talk of a sudden burst of fresh air engulfing the
Valley Ranch locker room, which had everything to do with the
removal of one large me-me-me fraud.
</P>
<P>
   So, just how desperate are the Rangers and Melvin? Have the
despair and the outfield injuries plunged this team to such a
gutter level, that trading for Nine-Toed Deion, as reported, was
actually a consideration last week?
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, it was. ``Consideration'' might be too
strong, and any inquiry about the Reds dealing Sanders came a month
ago, after Rusty Greer went on the disabled list, instead of last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But at some point, Melvin did do the unthinkable. He threw out
Deion's name to the Reds, one of about a dozen outfielders he has
discussed with various clubs. Nothing happened beyond that, and
adding Sanders is no longer even a remote thought by the Rangers.
Maybe owner Tom Hicks balked. Or manager Johnny Oates said no way
to having to deal with that clubhouse headache. Then again, Sanders
is hitting .200 at Triple A, so interest does tend to cool.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of cool, Melvin has obviously lost his. If the normally
unflappable general manager had even a split-second thought about
obtaining that cargo ship full of soiled ego luggage, it's a sure
sign the Rangers' month of April sent Melvin into nuclear panic.
</P>
<P>
   If we don't watch this carefully, he might actually bring in
Ruben Sierra from the Mexican League minors and give Ruben a
Triple-A tryout. Is Darryl Strawberry out of rehab yet? What about
him? And because the Rangers' current record is directly connected
with the on-going failures in the bullpen, has Melvin contacted
Steve Howe?
</P>
<P>
   Why, Doug, why?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that same thing about looking at every option,'' he said.
``The player you wouldn't even consider last week may be the player
you are after this week. Things change in a hurry with injuries.
When Rusty got hurt, Deion's name came up. But it hasn't recently.
It's nothing we're going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Melvin believes Cleveland could end up with Sanders, if the Reds
trade him. There is also desperation in Cleveland, where a slow
start has been combined with Kenny Lofton's injury. But the Indians
don't know Nine-Toed like we know Nine-Toed.
</P>
<P>
   Your job has to be on the line before a baseball team gives this
guy a second thought. Melvin's job isn't, based on what will
eventually happen this season. What tends to be worrisome is Melvin
acting and reacting as if the house note won't be paid beyond
October.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Doug, we understand injuries. Understand that the removal
of Greer, Frank Catalanotto and, lately, Rafael Palmeiro, took much
of the bite out of an already watered-down batting order. And when
Gabe Kapler also went out, even with his offensive struggles, the
outfield depth was reduced to nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, if key members of the bullpen had pitched anywhere close
to expectations, then the current record would be reversed. But Tim
Crabtree hasn't, and John Wetteland had the back-to-back blown
saves in April, which sent the Rangers into a lengthy funk. There
were several areas to second-guess going into the season, but
nobody listed the bullpen as anything except a team strength.
Unpleasant surprises do happen, however.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the April schedule: The Rangers were playing teams,
as it turned out, they weren't yet ready to compete against on even
terms. The Yankees, Red Sox and Indians will again be the best in
the league, despite the current struggles in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   But there is always hope when the rotation is solid, and the
rotation has been just that, if not beyond. In addition, the
schedule in May suggests this is the month when the Rangers can
make up for what happened in April. If they don't, then Melvin
might have every right to panic. But why start so early?
</P>
<P>
   Hindsight says plenty at the moment: Todd Zeile's bat is missed
at third, but Melvin certainly made a valid attempt to re-sign him
last winter. It was Zeile's surprising decision to jump to the
Mets. The injury to Catalanotto put on hold Melvin's plan at second
base, which didn't include bringing back Mark McLemore. At the
moment, McLemore is missed, but a healthy Catalanotto could
eventually make that a forgotten issue.
</P>
<P>
   No question, the Lee Stevens trade for David Segui in late March
removed more firepower from the lineup than Melvin could afford to
give up. But even that opinion was fortified after all those
left-handed bats went down with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez? He was going to be missed, and he is. But that
trade is not even worth a debate. For financial and other reasons,
Juan had to go, and as stated at the time, it will be two years
before the total Detroit package received in the deal can be
properly judged. But clip-and-save this: I'd take that same deal
yesterday or tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, however, of the usually calm and deliberate Melvin,
here's a guy who in the past three or four weeks wasted a moment of
breath by uttering Deion's name to another general manager. The
laughing could be heard all the way over at Valley Ranch. But in
Arlington, there's nothing funny about panic.

WINGED VICTORY FOR DERBY FAVORITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It was a lesson we were all taught as
children: Good behavior will be rewarded. It turns out that those
words of wisdom are also true for racehorses, as Fusaichi Pegasus
behaved himself beautifully Saturday, and went on to dominate the
126th running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``With luck and health, he is capable of winning the Triple
Crown,'' said his rider, Kent Desormeaux, who hit his mount with
the whip only once (at the quarter-pole).
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus, who was off at 2-1 ($6.60 to win), became the
first favorite to take the Kentucky Derby since Spectacular Bid in
1979, and the first son of legendary sire Mr. Prospector, who died
last year, to win the Derby. He scored with such ease that it
appears he has an excellent chance to become the first Triple Crown
winner since Affirmed in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Noted for odd behavior, such as tossing exercise riders, falling
over, bucking, and standing stock still, Fusaichi Pegasus had
discouraged some potential backers. Saturday he stood briefly, then
bucked, on the way from the barn to the paddock, but he was docile
in the post parade, and loaded into the gate like a gentleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flies were on him,'' explained his trainer, Neil Drysdale.
``I attempted to put a fly net on him, and it upset him. We had
come with ice water, and we sponged him down in the paddock. He
cooled right off.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he first started, he would buck in the post parade. He
thought it was fun. As time went on, he has realized that this is
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus was 15th in the 19-horse field through the
opening quarter, but then he flew up the rail. To say he has a
fluid stride would be an understatement, and he began to pick off
the rivals in front of him. He swung out for the drive, split
horses, and forged ahead at the eighth-pole.
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude and Alex Solis chased him home at 11-1, but as well as
the long shot ran, he was no match for the winner, as Fusaichi
Pegasus cruised home a length and a half in front. The time for the
1 1/4 miles, run over an extremely fast track, was 2:01, the
fourth-fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, part of a four-horse entry, closed for third with
Craig Perret aboard, 4 lengths farther back. Second choice The
Deputy, off at 9-2, finished 14th with Chris McCarron aboard,
spoiling Jenine Sahadi's bid to become the first woman to train a
Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance at Churchill Downs was 153,204, the second-largest
crowd in Derby history.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brilliant horse,'' said Desormeaux, who won the
Derby in 1998 aboard Real Quiet. ``This pretty horse can run. I
don't need wings, I feel like I can fly. I just gave him nudges,
and he began to accelerate. When he straightened away, I kissed at
him, and he took off. He has an awesome turn of foot. At this stage
of his career he is the best horse I've ever been associated
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale was named to the Hall of Fame last Tuesday, and, by
winning the Derby, he repeated the accomplishment of trainer D.
Wayne Lukas, who was named to the Hall on Derby week last year,
then won the race with Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a very rewarding and humbling week,'' said Drysdale.
``The horses put you here . . . without the horses, there isn't a
sport. That's what makes you humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a very talented horse. I'm so delighted for him. He
deserved it. I'm very, very proud of him. If he's all right, we'll
go to the Preakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't concerned about the distance, I think the distance
helped him.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Fusao Sekiguchi, the venture capitalist who purchased
Fusaichi Pegasus for $4 million as a yearling, watched his horse
earn $1,038,400 Saturday, which included a $150,000 bonus for
winning both the Wood Memorial at Aqueduct (April 15) and the Derby
(Drysdale received a $100,000 bonus as well).
</P>
<P>
   ``I love challenges,'' said Sekiguchi through an interpreter.
``We were told many times that the favorite has not won in 21
years. I loved breaking the jinx. I have full faith in Mr.
Drysdale. I know he's a remarkable horseman. I know whatever he
wants to do, he can do. I can see in his eyes that he's happy with
the horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things that the horse does is something that comes through
his inquisitive temperament. It is nothing to get concerned
about.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Derby taught everyone a lesson. It's better to be
nice than naughty.

ENOUGH IS ENOUGH: STARS NEED TO DISPATCH SHARK PRETENDERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's time that they end this, and the Stars know that.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Stars fans don't enjoy a good chortle, like the
one from watching Bryan Marchment stagger off the ice with a groin
injury. And it's not as if, any minute now, Eddie Belfour is likely
to kick out the windows on a police cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   No, they need to end this playoff series tonight because the
Stars know, deep down in their playoff-hardened hearts, that there
are bigger fish to fry than Steve Shields and the San Jose Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   The puck will drop tonight at 6:30, which means if all goes
according to the defending champs' plan, the Sharks can be home and
on the golf course tomorrow before lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   It's time the Stars end this. Maybe it's something in the San
Jose water. Maybe the Stars are distracted, wondering if Sharks
coach Darryl Sutter really does look like Chuck E. Cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, the Stars need to dispose of these pretenders and get
on to the contenders. The Colorado Avalanche and Patrick Roy await.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trade deadline, the Avalanche and the Stars have
loomed as the NHL's best matchup. Their Western Conference finals
series last year was laced with drama _ and even better hockey than
the six games with Buffalo for the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado has Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg and their 11th-hour trump
card, Ray Bourque. And there is also, it seems, this mildly
simmering Roy-versus-Belfour thing, wherein Eddie supposedly said
something somewhere that the proud Monsieur Roy took exception to.
</P>
<P>
   Or that's what the Denver papers are saying, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Roy-versus-Belfour is worthy of a Michael Buffer introduction.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour-versus-Shields? Enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Shields is the same goaltender who had trouble beating out Mike
Vernon who, I think, broke in in Detroit with Gordie Howe. Vernon
was traded in December, and Shields immediately asserted himself by
winning exactly five of his first 16 starts.
</P>
<P>
   With the first-round series there for the taking in Game 6
against St. Louis, Shields gave up six stunningly soft and quick
goals to the Blues and was yanked. Shhhhh _ I think the guy falls
asleep. If the winning goal tonight goes in on a deflection off
Shields' head, remember where you read it first.
</P>
<P>
   As his own coach, Coach Cheese, said, ``I've said all along that
if you expect to beat Dallas, you've got to have great
goaltending.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks haven't. Which is why, for the Stars, it's time to
end this.
</P>
<P>
   Shields' counterpart, of course, Belfour, had his usual Crazy
Eddie reunion with the choir in San Jose. Belfour _ by all but The
Mansion standards, perhaps _ had an outstanding season.
</P>
<P>
   But on the Sharks' home ice, Belfour turned into the Eddie that
we've seen in those memorable TV promos, the
how-so-and-so-spent-his-day-with-the-Stanley-Cup spots. In the ad
Eddie is on a carnival Tilt-A-Whirl, the trophy beside him,
giggling crazily while the two Cup chaperones in suits appear on
the verge of throwing up.
</P>
<P>
   In Crazy Eddie, the Stars trust. At Reunion Arena, Sharks fans
might note, Belfour has yet to surrender a goal this series to the
San Joses.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom says that if the home team can stay out of
the penalty box tonight, the Stars can put an end to this
best-of-seven series. Coach Ken Hitchcock's team has won seven
playoff contests in a row at noisy, Slurpee-iced Reunion. It would
be most uncharacteristic for a Hitchcock team to perform again as
it did in Game 4, which the coach termed ``a little comedic
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Tonight it can't be comedy central, and the Stars know that.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Nolan and that handsome Mike Ricci have had their fun.
Stars fans are finished hyperventilating, watching Marchment wobble
off. And the Bay Area sports sections have used their last
``Yee-Haw'' joke.
</P>
<P>
   Enough is enough. Bigger fish await.
</P>

RED SOX GET PUNCHED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The strikeouts flowed once again like vintage wine Saturday
afternoon from Pedro Martinez, who swallowed whatever bitter
aftertaste was left from being assessed a five-game suspension and
whiffed 17 Tampa Bay Devil Rays, matching his personal best.
</P>
<P>
   But the champagne at Fenway Park was delivered to the opposing
clubhouse after Devil Rays pitcher Steve Trachsel, an 18-game loser
last season, outdueled the Sox ace, 1-0, with a three-hitter in
which the former Cub fanned a career-high 11 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay reserve shortstop Ozzie Guillen decided the moment
warranted a bottle of bubbly, and who could blame him? A Martinez
loss is a rare occasion. Greg Vaughn's two-out single on a
full-count breaking ball in the eighth inning scored Dave Martinez,
who had singled and stolen second, and sent Pedro the Younger to
his first loss in 13 starts since last Aug. 19. Two of his last
three defeats have come against the Devil Rays, even though their
first seven outs were whiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straight survival,'' Vaughn said of his winning hit, which
came after three at-bats in which he struck out thrice on the
minimum nine pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give him credit,'' said Martinez, who had 15
strikeouts through seven innings, three more than at the same point
in his epic 17-K performance in Yankee Stadium last Sept. 10, but
had just one strikeout in each of the last two innings. ``I got him
three times. It's about time he did something. He's just a good
hitter, man.''
</P>
<P>
   Trachsel was anything but good last season in Chicago, losing
more games than anybody in the big leagues. He had 14 losses
entering August, and was spared a 20-loss season only by going 4-1
in September. But Saturday, he toyed with a lineup that was missing
Nomar Garciaparra, out with a pulled left hamstring. Trachsel gave
up a single to Troy O'Leary in the second, a single to Brian
Daubach in the third, and another single to Daubach in the sixth
before setting down the last 11 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez and Trachsel combined to strike out the most hitters in
any game, according to Sox researchers, since Kerry Wood of the
Cubs whiffed a record-tying 20 and Shane Reynolds of the Astros 10
two years ago to the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, when (Trachsel) took the mound, he knew he wasn't going
to give an inch out there,'' said Tampa Bay manager Larry
Rothschild, who also acknowledged that Martinez had stuff equal to
Kevin Brown and Al Leiter when they threw their no-hitters while he
was the Marlins' pitching coach.
</P>
<P>
   Like Martinez, Trachsel struck out the side in the first and had
an answer in the only two innings in which the Sox put two runners
on base. Carl Everett, who went 0 for 4, whiffed twice, and didn't
get the ball out of the infield while batting cleanup, tapped out
to second with runners on first and third in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had runners on the corners again in the sixth, when
Daubach led off with a single and took third when first baseman
Fred McGriff booted O'Leary's ground ball. But Mike Stanley struck
out, one of his three whiffs, and Jason Varitek, who had come into
the game with a career-best nine-game hitting streak, grounded out
to short.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing on our part,'' Varitek said. ``That's the
game we need to win, when we pitch well. But you've got to give
(Trachsel) credit. He threw everything. He had a real good split,
and he threw a changeup, slider, curveball, sinker, four-seamer.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the Sox hit in the ninth, general manager Dan Duquette
made an appearance in the back of the press box and announced that
Martinez was dropping the appeal of the suspension he was given for
hitting Roberto Alomar of the Indians with a pitch last Sunday
following a warning from plate umpire Tim Tschida. Martinez will
begin to serve his penalty immediately, which has the effect of
pushing his next start back one day, to Friday night in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who has yet to utter a word about the suspension _ a
posture recommended by club officials _ maintained his stance after
Saturday's game. Asked if he felt it important to show that his
performance would not be affected by the suspension, Martinez was
defiant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about it,'' he said. ``I never will. I go
after my goals the same way, the same way I approach the game. I
won't think about it. It's not worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was a hollowness, too, about losing a game in which he
struck out 15 or more batters for the seventh time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just couldn't score,'' said Red Sox manager Jimy Williams.
``The other guy pitched a great game. How many did Pedro strike
out? He had phenomenal stuff. Breaking ball, location, up and down,
in and out. We just couldn't score.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston right fielder Trot Nixon, whose drive to the warning
track in center was the hardest-hit ball of the day for the Sox,
could barely bring himself to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't going to say anything about (Trachsel),'' Nixon said.
``I had my pitches to hit. We all did.''

SAHADI HAS THE KENTUCKY BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home . . . ''
</P>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Long, long ago Stephen Foster wrote those
words about a home that wasn't even his but that of his cousin over
in Bardstown, Ky. Little matter. Kentucky had its state anthem.
</P>
<P>
   And on the first Saturday of every May, the sun always ``shines
bright on my old Kentucky home.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for an hour before Saturday's Kentucky Derby. The first
rumble of thunder was heard, rain pelted the horses running in the
race before the Derby, and Jenine Sahadi looked up to the sky, did
a little rain dance, and implored, ``Rain, rain go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi was just outside Barn 41 on the Churchill Downs
backstretch. Only a few raindrops were falling here, but no matter.
Down at the far end of the same barn, trainer Neil Drysdale was
tucked inside, under cover, his Fusaichi Pegasus only a few feet
away in his stall. Motionless. As Drysdale had been saying all
week, ``I'm not as concerned as you people in the media'' about his
temperamental colt.
</P>
<P>
   A group of women walked by the barn, some nine or 10 of them,
and each made a point of walking up to Sahadi and patting her
shoulder, wishing her luck or shaking her hand. The sisterhood all
had one wish, that Sahadi would be the first woman to train a
Kentucky Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   A fan walked by Barn 41 and shouted out, ``The Derby winner's
coming out of this barn; mark my words.''
</P>
<P>
   But which one? Sahadi's The Deputy or Drysdale's Fusaichi
Pegasus?
</P>
<P>
   ``T'is summer,'' Foster had written about the old Kentucky home
that wasn't his, ``and all the people are gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was spring and not all the people of Kentucky were
gay, certainly not Sahadi and Drysdale. Their springs were wound
very tight.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi had given her colt a bath in the morning and went back to
her hotel room ``where I tried to take a nap in between all the
phone calls; the phone rang all day. I just lay there, I didn't
sleep since the phone was ringing all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, too ill to make the trip, had called from California
``but he'll be watching on TV and I'm sure he'll be in floods of
tears when he sees me walking over.''
</P>
<P>
   The walk over? That short half-mile from the barns behind the
Churchill Downs backside, along the fence along the clubhouse turn,
thousands of fans screaming at human and horse, the wrong way past
the finish line until the left turn under the Twin Spires and into
the paddock.
</P>
<P>
   No other experience in American sports compares. Why, just
moments earlier, owner Bob Lewis had tried to minimize the anxiety
of the walk by doing what an Anheuser-Busch distributor in Los
Angeles does to pass the time _ trying to spot fans with cans of
Budweiser in their hands. ``It gets more thrilling each time,''
said Lewis, whose first walk was in 1997 when his Silver Charm won
the Derby. ``It doesn't get easier.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sahadi, though, it was her first walk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already barfed,'' she said. ``I almost feel better when I
do that. I didn't do it before the Santa Anita Derby (won by The
Deputy), but I did it before both Breeders' Cups. I mean, I saddled
fast, I saddled as fast as I could and then I barely got to the
bathroom in time. Once you do it, you're much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi laughed. Then lit another cigarette. And paced and paced.
</P>
<P>
   It was so hard to ease the tension. Gary Barber, one of the
owners of The Deputy and the producer of the movie, ``The Sixth
Sense,'' had a cell phone to his ear just outside The Deputy's
stall in Barn 41 and Sahadi mocked him to lighten the heaviness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should have seen these guys (Friday night at a dinner put
on by Team Valor, the other owners of the horse). ``Gary sees these
numbers . . . `00000063421' on his phone and you hear him make his
call, `I want a dime on the Lakers,' and `I want a dime on the
over' (a wager on the total points in the Lakers-Sacramento game)
and `I want a dime on this' and `I want a dime on that.' These guys
are sickos.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sahadi paced some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,'' Foster had
written of his sweet Kentucky home. ``All merry, all happy and
bright.''
</P>
<P>
   Drysdale had two horses in the Derby, Fusaichi Pegasus and War
Chant. As if to show his lack of concern about the antics of
Fusaichi Pegasus, Drysdale chose to send War Chant first on the
track and follow that colt with his better (and more active) horse.
Every once in a while, though, Drysdale would peek behind him to
see if Pegasus was pulling another stunt of his.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after Fusaichi Pegasus made his turn from the mile
chute and onto the main track itself that the colt pulled his first
stunt. For no apparent reason, he pulled to a complete halt and
would not move. Drysdale scratched his head and waited. Nothing
else to do. Thirty-five seconds later, again for no apparent
reason, the colt began to walk again.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, one of those thousands of Kentucky ``young folks . .
. all merry, all happy and bright'' of Foster's could be heard
shouting through a chain link fence over to Fusaichi Pegasus,
``You're going down, Peggy.''
</P>
<P>
   And another one of those young Kentucky folks, all bright and
merry, shouted non-stop at Fusaichi Pegasus, but the colt never
even cocked an ear in his direction. ``You don't even turn around,
Peggy,'' the fan shouted in exasperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 'n by, hard times comes a knocking at the door,'' Foster
had written more than a century-and-a-half ago. Who could he know?
</P>
<P>
   Just past the finish line, with Enrique Lircios calmly keeping
his 6-year-old pony, Whistle, at the side of Fusaichi Pegasus to
keep the colt calm, Drysdale thought he saw some flies on the back
of his star. He reached over to an assistant and grabbed some
netting and draped it over Fusaichi Pegasus's back. Whoa, Nellie.
</P>
<P>
   The colt quickly came to a dead stop and begin frantically
kicking his back heels in frustration, kicking them high and
kicking them strong. All those behind the colt, media and handlers,
scattered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting sticky,'' said the trainer. ``There were flies
on his back, so I attempted to put the net on him.'' But Fusaichi
Pegasus didn't appreciate it, ``and so I took the net off him
quickly.'' And the colt again began his walk to destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``The corn-top's ripe and the meadow's in the bloom,'' Foster
had sung of his sweet Kentucky, ``while the birds make music all
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   How could Foster have known? The birds? Pegasus? Flying so
gracefully?
</P>
<P>
   When all was done, when Fusaichi Pegasus had won the Kentucky
Derby as effortlessly as any horse since Seattle Slew in 1977, when
Fusaichi Pegasus had ran to the perfection of animal beauty that he
is, jockey Kent Desormeaux aptly summed up this awesome mix of
beauty and strength: ``This pretty boy can fly.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Sahadi's The Deputy had run a miserable 14th, another
one of those mysterious finishes that so many good horses have
suffered here in the Kentucky Derby, she was forlorn. Her husband,
trainer Ben Cecil, hugged her and gave her a kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so happy, I feel so anxious, I feel so many things,''
she had said only an hour earlier. ``But most of all, I feel I want
this over.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weep no more, my lady, Oh! Weep no more today,'' Foster had
written. ``We will sing one song for my old Kentucky home, for the
old Kentucky home far away.''
</P>
<P>
   The tears were still flowing down Sahadi's cheeks nearly an hour
after the race when she and The Deputy had made it back to Barn 41.
Her horse ``was exhausted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And then the tears stopped. A lesson had been learned, for,
``The sun shines bright on my old Kentucky home,'' but on the first
Saturday in May, that warm Kentucky sun is most selective.
</P>
<P>
   It smiles on only one horse, one trainer and one jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weep no more, my lady. Oh! Weep no more today.''

STARS GO FOR KO AGAINST SHARKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, so the last thing the Stars want or need to be thinking
about is the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they may be wise to keep in the back of their minds the
image of Peter Forsberg and Joe Sakic lounging around the house in
their boxer shorts. Because while the Stars and San Jose Sharks are
busy beating each other up tonight, that's what the Avs players
will be doing. Resting.
</P>
<P>
   They advanced to the Western Conference Finals by defeating
Detroit on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars could join the Avs if they defeat the Sharks in Game 5
at 6:30 tonight at Reunion Arena in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that lies in the back of your mind that right now they
are sitting there, waiting,'' Stars captain Derian Hatcher said,
before leaving San Jose. ``We have a chance to get a good rest
right now. Obviously, we don't want to come back here.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars don't win tonight, it's back to San Jose for Game
6, where a frenzied crowd and another punishing game awaits. Not to
mention Game 7 looms.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Stars want to get this series in the rearview mirror as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks, who had chances to win Game 4 but couldn't, look
ready to float to the surface. The Stars just need to push them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is blood and we smell it, then we go for it and try to
go for the throat and end it as soon as possible,'' Stars center
Mike Modano said. ``You don't want to give them any room, any air
to breathe. You want to eliminate them as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars, to a man, say that if they're going to end this
sooner rather than later they're going to have to play better
defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much better,'' Stars defenseman Darryl Sydor added. ``That's
for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   No, that's not a misprint. The stifling, smothering,
just-try-to-get-a-goal-on-us defense of the playoffs was a no-show
for Game 4 on Friday night. The Stars allowed four goals _ in 40
minutes _ which would be as if Pedro Martinez gave up 10 runs in
two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time we gave up four or five goals?'' Stars
winger Mike Keane asked rhetorically. ``That's just not us. It's
the little things we have to tighten up on.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest of the little things is penalties. The Stars have
had 16 penalties in the past two games. Dumbs ones. Questionable
ones. Silly ones. Whatever the reason, there were too many of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars need to stay out of the penalty box or risk putting
the Sharks back into the series. The Sharks capitalized by scoring
a combined three power-play goals in Games 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, it was a little bit undisciplined on our part,'' Modano
said. ``If we are going to be better down the road, we have to
eliminate that retaliation and stuff like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest offender for the Stars never served a minute in the
penalty box.
</P>
<P>
   When referees whistled Stars goalie Ed Belfour for roughing not
once but twice within a 40-second span in the third period, he had
to stay on the ice and help kill his own penalties. He did it, too:
The Sharks were scoreless on both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it fires him up,'' Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk said.
``But I think he has to be careful that you don't put our team in a
hole too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Because what's riding on tonight's game isn't merely closing out
the San Jose Sharks. The numbers say that will happen eventually.
When the Stars lead 3-1 in a series, they have gone on to win the
series all but once.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are down 3-1, it's tough. It's tough mentally,''
Hatcher said. ``The odds have it. When you are up 3-1, you have a
huge advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars are playing to eliminate the couch factor in the
Western Conference Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's extremely critical,'' Nieuwendyk said of closing
out the Sharks. ``We don't want to make that long trip back. ... We
have them in a very vulnerable position. We have to make sure we
capitalize.''
</P>
<P>
   If they don't, the Avs will be capitalizing on the couch.

SECOND-GUESSING APTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE SULLIVAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ In every Kentucky Derby there is a moment _ a
split second, really _ that can make all the difference in the
world. In that snap of the fingers, the correct decision can mean
victory. The wrong one, defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Fusaichi Pegasus won the 126th Derby by a length and a half
Saturday but Bobby Frankel, trainer of runner-up Aptitude, felt the
result could easily have been closer or even different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desormeaux took the rail and got lucky,'' said Frankel.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux, riding the winner, was well back in the early
going, settled behind Aptitude and Alex Solis.
</P>
<P>
   On the far turn, Solis made a decision. He took Aptitude off the
rail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I moved out into the middle a little so I would have the
choice to go inside or out,'' said Solis.
</P>
<P>
   With the rail clear, Desormeaux was free to move inside horses
and up into contention. In the last quarter-mile he pulled away and
Aptitude chased futilely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was in great shape,'' said Solis about that moment
when he moved off the rail. ``I thought I had a big chance to win
the race. But then (Fusaichi Pegasus) came galloping up and he was
doing it real easy. I knew he was going to be hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be the case, but Frankel, without being too
critical of his jockey, wondered what would have happened if Solis
had made a different decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If my jock does what Desormeaux does, it was going to be real
close,'' he said. ``Desormeaux got real lucky and we only got beat
a length and a quarter (actually a length and a half). Maybe we
don't beat him, but it was going to be real close. They would have
been together at the 16th pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Aptitude will get another chance at Fusaichi Pegasus, but it
won't happen in the Preakness. Aptitude will stay at Churchill
Downs, where the West Coast-based Frankel has a small string of
horses, and prepare for the Belmont Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too many hard races,'' said Frankel about running in the
Preakness and the Belmont. ``Why do it? We can't win the Triple
Crown now anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question the 1 1/2-mile Belmont, the longest of the
Triple Crown races, will suit Aptitude. ``He's bred for it, top and
bottom,'' said Frankel, referring to Aptitude's sire, A.P. Indy,
the winner of the 1992 Belmont, and his dam, Dokki, a daughter of
Northern Dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to it,'' said Solis.

VAN GUNDYS CAUGHT IN PARENT TRAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They know the drill by heart. Bill Van Gundy goes upstairs and
turns on the television, but mutes the sound. Downstairs, Cindy Van
Gundy watches with the sound on. The two do not communicate with
anyone, including each other, until the game is over.
</P>
<P>
   It has been that way for three years, and it will be that way
again this week. While many salivate over another Knicks-Heat
playoff series, it is, at best, a tough time for the Van Gundys of
Brockport, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   One son, Jeff, coaches the Knicks. Another son, Stan, is an
assistant with the Heat. This will be the fourth consecutive year
the parents go through this ritual at home while their sons go at
each other in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried going to the games once, but I guess we don't like
having our emotions on public display,'' said Cindy. ``It's just
easier this way. It's always so much easier when they play other
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill, a longtime high school and college coach, added, ``It
wasn't really fun when we went to the games in person. NBA fans
everywhere are less than pleasant to the visiting team. And no
matter where we go, we have someone on the visiting team.''
</P>
<P>
   So they don't go out in public. Or have friends over. On one
occasion, they allowed a local sportswriter to watch the games with
them, but only if he agreed to keep it civil in the newspaper. He
complied.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be a little nerve-wracking,'' said Cindy. ``I try to
look at the positive side, that one of them will win, that they are
both at the top of their profession, that they are both competitive
and doing what they want to do. I try to keep it in perspective.
There's so many things going on more important than the Heat and
the Knicks. I try. I really try.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then they throw up the ball and I become a wild woman.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill says he appreciates being alone so he can say what he wants
and not worry about anyone hearing him. He watches not only as a
father but also as a coach. He will wonder why such a play was run
and critique strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can do anything I want,'' he said. ``That's the biggest
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to him, it all comes down to the same thing when the game
is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got one son happy and one son dejected,'' he said.
``Jeff tries to tell me that I should look at the positive, that
one son is going on. But that's always hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy said, ``Absolutely, we always feel more for the loser than
the winner. That's why it's so hard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Van Gundys did catch the Knicks clincher in person last
Sunday in Toronto. When they returned home, they discovered their
house, which was for sale, had been sold. In July, they will move
into an apartment in Miami, where they can be closer to Stan and
his four children. Jeff has one daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But they already have a problem of sorts. The new digs have no
second floor. What to do next year if the teams meet again?
</P>
<P>
   ``I hadn't thought of that,'' said Bill. ``I guess we'll have to
get two TVs and close the door to one of the rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Cindy, ``He may just have to leave and drive around Miami
for a few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five and fold?
</P>
<P>
   With both the Pacers and Lakers going to the five-game maximum
in the first round, it marked the second time both No. 1 seeds were
so extended since 1984, the year the 16-team format was instituted.
The other time was in 1994, when Western No. 1 Seattle was upset by
No. 8 Denver (which trailed, 0-2), and Eastern No. 1 Atlanta,
arguably the most fraudulent top seed in the last 16 years, ousted
Miami in five games (after trailing, 2-1). Since 1984, no No. 1
seed has been extended to five games in the first round and gone on
to win the NBA title. However, No. 6 Houston went five games with
Utah in the first round in 1995 and went on to win the title . . .
The Warriors have offered contract extensions to assistant coaches
Rod Higgins and Brian Winters, but they will not be the least bit
surprised if Higgins decides to leave for the Wizards . . .
Meanwhile, isn't it interesting that all these teams are interested
in Isiah Thomas as a head coach and the Pistons won't go near him?
. . . Winston Bennett lasted less than a year in Boston as Rick
Pitino's No. 2 assistant. Now, he's back in the biz, having just
been named head coach at Kentucky State. The Division 2 Thorobreds
were 13-14 last season. Since leaving the Celtics, Bennett had been
working in real estate in the Lexington, Ky., area and also doing
occasional scouting for Pitino . . . Now that the Spurs have been
put out of their misery, the team has some big offseason questions,
starting with the status of You Know Who. Tim Duncan is still
playing it cozy, although he does have a very solid relationship
with coach/general manager Gregg Popovich, who wisely did not rush
his franchise player back into the series with Phoenix. In addition
to Duncan, veteran Avery Johnson (who turned 35 in March) is a free
agent and wants to stick around. Given his age, the Spurs may
decide to give him a one-year balloon contract so as not to tie up
their cap down the road. The improving play of Antonio Daniels and
Samaki Walker has given the Spurs some hope, although all will be
lost if Duncan decides to go to Orlando. The Spurs are expected to
make a serious run at free agent Derek Anderson . . . From
Minnesota's postmortem _ four consecutive first-round exits _ comes
this gem from Kevin McHale on signing free agents: ``If you could
put a gun to a guy's head and make him sign a contract, we'd be
more successful. I've got more guns than most general managers.'' .
. . Celtics GM Chris Wallace tried to slip into Athens incognito,
but instead was treated like General Patton on the march to Messina
when he showed up at the big AEK-Panathinaikos game last Wednesday.
He was there to see, among others, big center Iakovos Tsakalidis of
AEK. How wild was it for Wallace? Well, in one Greek paper he had
to say that he hoped his presence had not taken away from the game
(which Panathinaikos won as Tsakalidis was limited to 8 points and
5 rebounds in 18 foul-plagued minutes). Another Greek paper claimed
to have seen his notes from the game and published them. ``I've
never seen anything like it,'' Wallace said. ``I kept telling them
that I was over here just to see the guy play.'' Tsakalidis said
before the game that, as far as he was concerned, he was a free
agent and planned to attend the NBA predraft camp next month in
Chicago. AEK may have other ideas. Wallace also stopped in Israel
on his junket, er, scouting mission to see Nate Huffman. He's the
7-footer from Central Michigan who plays for Maccabi Tel-Aviv and
is considered this year's John Amaechi, although smaller. Given the
Celtics' interior problems, anything is possible. There's their
likely draft pick (11th), free agency, and trades. One option might
be a deal with Toronto for the rights to Zeljko Rebraca, who is
considered the best player in Europe. He's 27 and probably will
play one more year overseas. But the Raptors apparently are open to
moving him, having elected not to sign him last year. Wallace saw
Rebraca play twice last week and had some discussions with
Rebraca's representatives. The Greek papers, however, seemed to
think the Celtics were homing in on Tsakalidis with their pick.
Wallace has tried to downplay any interest in European players, but
he can't do that anymore given the team's clandestine but fruitless
attempt to snag Dirk Nowitzki two years ago . . . A clarification
from last week on the subject of European players. Ethminios
Rentzias was drafted by Denver in 1996 and the Nuggets may well be
waiting for him. But not as badly as Atlanta. The Hawks acquired
his rights via trade. Rebraca was drafted in 1994 by Seattle and
his rights were acquired by the Raptors in a three-way trade last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The McGrady factor
</P>
<P>
   With all due respect to Vince Carter, the most important
individual in the Raptors organization is Tracy McGrady. As he
goes, so goes the franchise, which only a couple of years ago was
at ground zero and could be there again if McGrady bolts. ``Vince
Carter is an outstanding player,'' said Knicks assistant Brendan
Malone. ``Unfortunately for Tracy McGrady, he has to play in
Vince's shadow. McGrady is an outstanding player. He has the long
arms. He's an outstanding offensive rebounder. He's good around the
basket. He's a good passer. He can score in the post, off the
dribble, or facing up. He's only 20 and he's going to be a star in
this league.'' But if that stardom materializes somewhere else,
like Orlando or Chicago, then Carter would be holding the bag and
you could start the Vince-to-America countdown. Antonio Davis has
an opt-out clause at the end of next season while fellow graybeards
Charles Oakley and Kevin Willis have a couple of years left, at
least contractually. Doug Christie, meanwhile, all but assured his
exodus with his comments about coach Butch Carter. He, too, has an
opt-out clause at the end of next season. McGrady tried last week
to put the onus on Vince Carter by saying he'd sign with Toronto
only if Vince did. But Vince can't do anything for two more years.
The Raptors need to re-sign McGrady. If they don't, the slide
begins again. Old friend Dee Brown has probably played his last
game as a Raptor and will enter free agency at 31 . . . The Celtics
should take a long, hard look at Adonal Foyle, who is a free agent.
He hasn't exactly dazzled in his three years at Golden State, but
he is a shot blocker and has an upside. The Warriors would like to
keep him and know that Foyle is unlikely to command anything more
than the $2.5 million exception. But Foyle seems like an ideal
Pitino candidate: an underachiever who could fill a need in Boston
. . . Here's another byproduct of the ridiculous first-round
playoff schedule (which the NBA defends). The Knicks will be the
hosts for Game 3 against the Heat Friday. That will mark a span of
16 days between home playoff games for New York. Miami, host Sunday
afternoon, has gone seven days without a game and 11 days between
home games _ and the Heat are division champions.

PEGASUS TAKES FLIGHT AS FAVORITE WINS KENTUCKY DERBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ It's hard to fathom a wad of cash $4 million
thick. It's just as hard to fathom a horse with wings.
</P>
<P>
   But Fusaichi Pegasus, who cost $4 million as a yearling, moved
somewhat like the mythical Greek version when _ as jockey Kent
Desormeaux put it _ the colt ``floated around there today'' to win
the 126th Kentucky Derby in front of 153,204 people at Churchill
Downs.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux rode his second Derby winner when he got Fusaichi
Pegasus to rally from 15th place early in the race. He reached a
prominent position nearing the stretch before powering through the
lane to win the Derby by 1 1/2 lengths over a game, but hapless,
Aptitude, the same horse who ran third behind him in the Wood
Memorial Stakes three weeks ago in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fusao Sekiguchi, a Japanese venture capitalist, bid $4 million
to buy Fusaichi Pegasus at the Keeneland Summer Yearling Sale in
Lexington, Ky., in July 1998. Then he named him almost like a
vanity plate on a hot rod automobile. The first name is a
combination of Fusao and ``ichi,'' which means No. 1 in Japanese.
Pegasus is the name of the horse in Greek mythology that has wings.
</P>
<P>
   The name has fit through the four races leading up to the Derby,
all victories with an average winning margin of more than two
lengths. But it looked as if Desormeaux might be driving with an
expired plate when the horses were midway through the final turn.
</P>
<P>
   Desormeaux had to ease his horse around More Than Ready, who was
making a move from fourth to second. Desormeaux angled out even
more to the point that he was seven wide entering the stretch less
than a quarter-mile away from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had faith that the traffic would break and he would have a
gap in front of him and he would make way,'' Sekiguchi said through
his interpreter, Mikki Tsuge. ``I knew he was going to bust out.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a door in the way he might have broken it down. But
Fusaichi Pegasus got a break there, if he needed it. Straightening
for home, Captain Steve was vying for the lead under jockey Robby
Albarado. But Wheelaway veered in sharply toward the rail under
rider Richard Migliore and put the squeeze on Captain Steve.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he left a wide-open path for Desormeaux. Still
about seven wide, he shook up Fusaichi Pegasus with the reins and
moved to pop him with the whip. But he ended up giving the colt
three light taps. That's all he would need of the whip.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took off,'' Desormeaux said, ``like the best horse I've
been involved with at this point of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty good animal. At this time two years ago,
Desormeaux was crossing the Churchill wire first with Real Quiet.
After winning the Derby, Real Quiet took the Preakness and missed
winning the Triple Crown at the Belmont by the smallest losing
margin in the history of the series.
</P>
<P>
   There are more positives to consider. The winning margin matches
the 1 1/2 lengths Real Quiet claimed. But there was another horse
gaining on Real Quiet that day. Yesterday, Fusaichi Pegasus was
home free in the final eighth of a mile and could have put on more
distance if Desormeaux wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The winner was in front of me all the way,'' said Aptitude
jockey Alex Solis, the runner-up. ``And he was running so easy.
He's obviously a very special horse.''
</P>
<P>
   The time of 2 minutes, 1 second is the sixth-fastest in Derby
history. It's the best since Grindstone covered the 1 1/4 miles in
the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Secretariat still has the track and Derby record at 1:592/5.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if Desormeaux saved some horse for the Preakness,
the next step in the Triple Crown that is a little less than two
weeks away on May 20 in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't do more than he had to from the start. Fusaichi
Pegasus was 15th after moving under the finish line for the first
time, leaving a little more than a mile to make up 13 1/2 lengths
to the lead. It's the farthest Fusaichi Pegasus has ever been
behind in his previous five starts (he was fifth, 2 1/2 lengths
back in his career debut, the only time he's lost).
</P>
<P>
   ``He broke keen,'' Desormeaux said. ``But his second step was
laggard. But Neil's words were bouncing in my head.''
</P>
<P>
   That's Neil Drysdale, trainer of Fusaichi Pegasus and whose
election to horse racing's Hall of Fame was announced Tuesday. In
pre-race instructions, Drysdale told Desormeaux to move easily over
to the rail and save ground for the rest of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the colt settled onto the backstretch, until
Desormeaux wanted some action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to get contentious,'' Desormeaux said. ``I wasn't
just a pilot. There were some nudges.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't need a nudge coming down the stretch. Fusaichi
Pegasus pulled away, as if he were a horse with wings. nn

QUIGLEY STILL ON STANDBY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His tee time was in Florence, S.C., last week, but his heart was
in Houston. This week he's in Knoxville, but he'd prefer New
Orleans. He keeps his travel plans open at all times and knows a
thing or two about airline routes, but he will drive the backroads
if that's what it takes.
</P>
<P>
   He is Brett Quigley, quite often located underneath the heading
of ``alternates.'' His uncle Dana, easily mistaken for an ATM
capable of drilling a 4-iron under the wind, is a weekly contender
on the Senior PGA Tour and riding an incredible wave of success. In
a heartbeat, though, the proud uncle would trade in one of his top
10s if he knew it would provide a break for his brother's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in Never-Never Land,'' said Dana, referring to Brett's
status on the exempt list. ``He has been for three years, but some
day it will come together for him. The kid can play. Believe me,
he's a player.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, he's biased, but the uncle happens to be telling the truth.
Brett Quigley, the 1987 US Junior Amateur champion, has been on the
edge of a breakthrough on the PGA Tour for a few years now. He was
128th on the money list in 1997, 127th the next year, 152d last
season. Nothing to be ashamed of, but in his line of work, falling
just outside the top 125 earns you a spot in the 29th category of
priority when it comes to exempt status. There's a traffic jam
ahead, but to get into it you have to negotiate a few rotaries.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you show up at an event, sit around for three days,
then go home because not enough players got sick. Sometimes you
choose to play somewhere else, though your exit is rehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   Take last week, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a flight booked out of Florence Wednesday night,'' said
the 30-year-old graduate of the University of South Carolina, ``but
I had to cancel it.'' He had been seventh alternate in the Shell
Houston Open and got all the way to No. 1 when the withdrawals
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Deprived once again of a spot in a PGA Tour event _ he's gotten
into just three thus far _ Quigley stayed in Florence for the
BUY.com and made the most of it by finishing in a tie for second.
There was an opportunity to win, and even though it was not the big
leagues, ``It felt good to play with the pressure on,'' he said.
The $29,866 paycheck doesn't count toward his PGA Tour money
status, but it will help with some bills, and Quigley took great
comfort in the fact that he overcame a 1-over-par 73 to start.
</P>
<P>
   But, no, there is no thought of sticking full-time with the
BUY.com Tour and putting an end to this sort of dual citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much money out there,'' said Quigley. ``Just look
what happened to Mike Sposa.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Quigley, Sposa is an unheralded PGA Tour player who happens
to be waiting for a break. It came, in a small way, last week. As
the sixth alternate, he got into the field at Houston. Though he
had missed four cuts in six starts, Sposa proved grateful for
another chance and finished in a tie for seventh, good for an
$84,350 check.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see: $29,866 for finishing in a tie for second or $84,350
for finishing in a tie for seventh? Is it any wonder why Quigley
books those exit flights?
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when you're going to get it going,'' he said.
``All it takes is one good week, with the way the purses are.''
</P>
<P>
   There was another exit plan in the works this week, but Quigley
_ the fifth alternate for the Compaq Classic in New Orleans _ did
not get a chance to use it. So he stayed in Knoxville for his fifth
BUY.com start of the year and through two rounds (69-72) had
himself in position to threaten once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for my confidence,'' said Quigley, who is in
constant touch with his uncle. Last Sunday, Brett's chase for the
win in Florence was on the Golf Channel, while a short time later
Dana was on ESPN, in the hunt at the Bruno's Memorial Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Both Quigleys came up a bit short, but Dana vows that someday
things will change for Brett:
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll catch a break, and when he does, people will see how
good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Going astray
</P>
<P>
   Things got a little sloppy in the final round of last Sunday's
Chick-Fil-A LPGA event in Stockbridge, Ga. Sophie Gustafson, who
would go on to win, slammed her tee shot out of bounds at the third
hole, and playing partner Laura Davies did the same at the fourth.
Michelle McGann, who was in position to win for the first time
since 1997, drove into the woods at the eighth, then punched out to
a steep bank, from where she swung and missed twice before settling
for a quadruple-bogey 8. Next to fall from contention was Kelly
Robbins, who won the first event of 1999 but has gone 31 since
without one. She drove into the water at the easy par-5 10th. All
of which left Gustafson to collect the top prize, though a serious
speech impediment led her to ask tournament host Nancy Lopez to
make the acceptance speech . . . Gary Nicklaus has requested a
sponsor's exemption into the upcoming Memorial. Officials usually
extend exemptions to the two Q-School graduates who have earned the
most money on the PGA Tour, which would be Matt Gogel (27th,
$535,482) and Nicklaus (48th, $355,260), but that could change. In
which case we are predicting that somehow, someway a sponsor's
exemption will fall into Nicklaus's lap . . . Congratulations to
Bob Lendzion, the longtime pro at Quechee, Vt., who used a 7-iron
to ace the 165-yard 14th hole during the final round of the Bruno's
Memorial Classic. It led to his best score (68) in 10 events on the
Senior PGA Tour this year, and he finished tied for 22d, his
highest finish since T-17 in the opening event of the year . . .
Earlier in the week, Tiger Woods said he would honor a strike by
the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television
and Radio Artists, so a Nike commercial had to be put on hold. But
unless the SAG and AFTRA put up a picket line at TPC at Las Colinas
in Irving, Texas, it's back to work in Woods's other pastime _ golf
_ as he ends a four-week vacation by playing in this week's GTE
Byron Nelson Classic. David Duval is also expected to return to
competition for the first time since his Masters heartache . . .
Busy week for World Golf Hall of Fame announcements. Judy Rankin
became the first LPGA Tour player voted in via the veterans
category, a move that was popular though it could be questioned;
Rankin won 26 times, but never a major. Donna Caponi, who probably
will be next to be voted in, counts four majors among her 24 wins.
On the men's side, no one was elected for induction _ not even Greg
Norman _ but Jack Burke Jr. was named in the veterans category, and
four others (Deane Beman, Sir Michael Bonallack, Neil Coles, and
John Jacobs) got the nod based on lifetime achievement. They will
join Beth Daniel and Juli Inkster at the induction ceremonies Nov.
20 in St. Augustine, Fla. . . . ``Byron Nelson: A Texas
Gentleman,'' a documentary on the life of the great champion, will
be on the Golf Channel at 9 Monday night.

   The Graduate
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 33 years after his death, Francis Ouimet will be awarded
an honorary diploma from Brookline High School. It will be accepted
by his daughters, Jane Salvi and Barbara McLean, next Saturday at
Brookline Golf Course (Putterham Meadows). During the ceremonies, a
life-size statue of Ouimet and his caddie from the stunning 1913 US
Open, Eddie Lowery _ arguably the most famous likeness in golf
history _ will be dedicated. Lowery's daughter, Cynthia Wilcox,
also will be on hand, as will the sculptor, Bob Pack. The statue
originally was on display at The Country Club during last
September's Ryder Cup, but it has been donated to the town of
Brookline, which has chosen to relocate it to the course. Following
the ceremony, a scramble tournament will be held ($240 per
foursome), and interested players can call Brookline GC at
617-730-2078. In a few weeks, Ouimet will be inducted into BHS's
Hall of Fame . . . Olde Scotland Links in Bridgewater will provide
the challenge for some of the area's best professionals when the
New England PGA Pro-Pro Match Play Championship tees off Monday
morning. Kirk Hanefeld of the Ridge Club and Bob Green of Tedesco
CC will try to defend their title against 15 other teams. An
18-hole stroke-play qualifier will be held Monday, with the low
eight teams advancing to Tuesday's match-play format . . . With the
Cronin Memorial having wrapped up Saturday, the local amateur
spotlight swings to the MGA Four-ball Championship (May 15-16 at
Walpole CC), but right behind that comes the Norfolk County Classic
(May 20-21 at Presidents GC). It will be the 22d edition of the
NCC, and head professional Arthur Cicconi, as he has from the
outset, will oversee this popular attraction. Bill McInerney of
Charles River is the defending champion, and for players who did
not receive invitations, there will be a qualifying round May 17.
For information, call the pro shop at 617-328-3444, ext. 305 . . .
The Tucker Anthony Tournament is back for another season, and
MediaOne is televising this year's competition. Monday night at 8,
Cummaquid, led by 19-time club champ Barbara Fitzpatrick, takes on
Crumpin-Fox with Stacey Wolejko, recently crowned the MIAA girls'
champion.

EWING STILL A PIVOTAL FIGURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ He always wonders why, among his many roles,
the coach of the New York Knicks is also seen as the Defender of
Patrick Ewing. He doesn't avoid it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should be,'' said Jeff Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   But he also sees it as an unnecessary role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did (Larry) Bird need to be defended in Boston? Patrick needs
no defending, but that's the thought process here,'' Van Gundy said
as he prepared the Knicks for Sunday's opener against the Miami
Heat in the Eastern Conference semifinals. ``I've never sensed that
a guy who has done so much _ clearly, he's the best Knick player of
all time _ and still plays at such a high level needs to be
defended. So, I always wonder, why is it that people say I'm his
biggest defender? Why does he need defending? It's an amazing
phenomenon in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing will be front and center and, barring injury, front and
center for the rest of the Knicks' run in the playoffs. After three
years of battling wrist, rib, knee, and Achilles' tendon injuries,
the 37-year-old Knick flagship is as healthy as he has been in
years.
</P>
<P>
   He did miss the first 20 games of this season, allowing his
Achilles' tendinitis to heal. He returned and started the final 62
games, leading the Knicks in rebounding and shot-blocking. Over the
past three seasons, Ewing has missed 88 games because of injuries,
and the Knicks are a very revealing 46-42 in those games.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus Camby might think that the Madison Square Garden fans are
tired of seeing the old dump-it-in-to-Patrick Knicks and prefer
instead the freewheeling style of Latrell Sprewell. That might be
what the fans want. That's most definitely not what Van Gundy
wants; nor does he suspect that he is alone in that line of
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 20 games he missed, we were 11-9,'' the coach said.
``We were an average team without Patrick. I think the guys
understand fully, even though they may have gotten more minutes and
more shots in those games, that we still were 11-9. They understand
that this guy is the most important player to our success.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing is not the same player he was 10 years ago or even five
years ago. His shattered right wrist has mended, but has robbed him
of his position as the best jump-shooting big man in the game.
Defensively, he is not as agile laterally or getting back on
transition.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not lost anything where it matters the most: the
ability to compete at an elite level with the inner strength and
confidence that he is not only capable but indispensable. He
believes that. He really does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came into the league 14 years ago with the Knicks and he was
the hardest-working player on our team then,'' said Knicks
assistant Brendan Malone. ``He still is the hardest-working player
on our team now. And he has not stopped believing that he is an
outstanding player. I think that's what carries him: his work ethic
and his tremendous belief in himself as a player. Everyone wants to
dismiss him and send him out to pasture. He refuses to listen to
that.''
</P>
<P>
   It's good that he does. There's been a lot of it, especially
with the arrival of the young pups and the inevitable deterioration
of Ewing's game to age and injuries. But Van Gundy is right.
Without him, they're Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always going to think what they want to think,
believe what they want to believe,'' Ewing said. ``I think I'm
still a great player, but I feel sometimes if I hadn't gotten hurt,
if I hadn't hurt my wrist . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``My Achilles' healed perfectly, my wrist will never be the
same. That was an adjustment. It still is an adjustment. But apart
from being hurt, I've accomplished a lot and I'm still playing
great. I'm surprising all of y'all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, never regarded as a go-to guy for reporters, even had
some fun with the media last week (which, with the league's
outright capitulation to television, came and went without a single
Knicks game). While Van Gundy was saying that Alonzo Mourning was
the best player this season in the Eastern Conference ``hands
down,'' Ewing was wondering how that could be.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he thought Mourning was the best in the East, Ewing
smiled and said, ``Yeah.'' Then there was a long,
nine-months-pregnant pause. ``Next to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The tabloids, predictably, went nuts. ``Ewing: I'm Still The
Man,'' said the Daily News. The Post said, simply, ``I'm The Best:
Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he says he's the greatest, or believes he's a great
player, he really believes it,'' Malone said. ``It's not for
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing conceded that Mourning might disagree, but that was OK
with him. Neither has a championship ring and only Ewing has tasted
the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't even talk about it,'' Ewing said. ``We don't need to
talk about that. He knows he's great, I know I'm great. The
objective is to go out and win.''
</P>
<P>
   He has put last year behind him. He has no choice. It tortured
him to watch the Knicks go up against the Spurs without a decent
big man. He doesn't know if he might have made a difference, but he
does know he can't undo what's already done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a new series, a new year,'' he sniffed. ``Can't worry
about that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Spurs already are gone. The Knicks are getting
ready for what has become their annual tong war with Miami. The
Knicks, no longer the trendy underdog of last year, figure they
have as much of a chance as anyone of coming out of the East.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing also figures there's a lot of basketball left in his
banged-up body. He's under contract for next year and never has
remotely hinted when he might retire. Just this week, his former
coach, Pat Riley, now leading the hated Heat, said Ewing had aged
as well as any big man he has ever seen. Riley, in case you may
have forgotten, had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar until the age of 42.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, and even for years before that, Abdul-Jabbar was
trying to be what Ewing still can be: a factor and a force. He has
had a week to practice, prepare, and rest for the next round. That
might not be good news for Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' he said. ``I feel pretty good. I'm healthy _
healthy as I'm going to be. I plan on going through the series
playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, just maybe, Van Gundy can drop the one role he never
really has come to understand.

THE DEPUTY STUMBLES TO A 14TH-PLACE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM PRICE 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Possibly the most puzzling performance in the
Kentucky Derby yesterday came from The Deputy. The second favorite
in the wagering at 9-2, The Deputy finished 14th.
</P>
<P>
   He was ninth after the opening quarter-mile, but he never got
any closer. In his only other meeting with Fusaichi Pegasus, The
Deputy lost by less than a length in the San Felipe Stakes seven
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did his best,'' said Jenine Sahadi, who trains The Deputy.
``Chris \RMcCarron, the jockey\S, said that he didn't have any real
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just didn't fire. Chris said he seemed to be struggling,
but we don't know why just yet. He looks like he came out of the
race OK.'' \Nsubheds:St. Julien's trip Marlon St. Julien, the first
African-American to ride in the Kentucky Derby in 79 years,
finished seventh aboard Curule. Coupled in the wagering with the
Godolphin-owned China Visit, Curule was a longshot at 23 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien won the first race at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie
and was the track's leading rider the first two years until he
moved to the Kentucky circuit last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great trip,'' St. Julien said. ``He broke well, and
we were able to drop in and save ground. He ran better than
expected, and the Godolphin people seem pleased. That makes me
happy.'' \Nsubheds:Derby crowd The crowd of 153,204 people marked
the second-largest crowd in Churchill history. The record
attendance stands at 163,628 for the centennial running of the race
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   A record total of $65 million was wagered at Churchill and
off-track locations. It's a preliminary number because some
off-track locations had not reported immediately after the race.
\Nsubheds:Captain Steve injury Trainers for Captain Steve, who
finished eighth after getting pinched back behind More Than Ready
when Wheelaway veered in sharply in midstretch, discovered a slight
injury to the horse when he returned to the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got slammed pretty good,'' said April Mayberry, who assists
Captain Steve trainer Bob Baffert at Churchill. ``He came out of
the race with a grabbed quarter behind, but other than that he's
OK. He cooled out fine.''
</P>
<P>
   A grabbed quarter on a horse is when the skin around the hoof is
cut by another hoof. It's unclear when the injury occurred.
\Nsubheds:Dubai try For the second consecutive year, Sheikh
Mohammed al Maktoum has come away from the Derby without a victory
despite spending millions. The Sheikh, the crown prince of Dubai
emirate in the United Arab Emirates, had to settle for a
sixth-place finish from China Visit and seventh from Curule.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the three-sixteenths pole, I really thought we were going
to win,'' China Visit jockey Frankie Dettori said. ``He was in the
bridle. But he ran out of steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep getting closer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sheikh spent a reported $4 million on Worldly Manner prior
to the colt's seventh-place Derby finish last year. He spent
another $5 million on Chief Seattle after that colt finished second
in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile last year, but he wasn't training
properly and did not make the trip from Dubai. \Nsubheds:Hal's Hope
ends Hal's Hope, trained by 88-year-old Harold Rose, battled Trippi
through the opening three-quarters of a mile before tiring and
finishing 16th.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw those fractions, I got nervous,'' said Rose, who
endured quadruple bypass heart surgery last year. ``You just can't
go that fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening three quarters went in 1:09 4-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we go back home with him,'' Rose said. ``I don't know
what's next now.'' \Nsubheds:Briefly Danny Pish, a trainer based at
Lone Star Park, was represented by First Attraction in the $121,000
WHAS-11 Stakes for 2-year-olds on the Derby undercard. She is the
winner of the Jean Lafitte Futurity, but she was the only filly in
the field of the WHAS, and she finished last among 12. There's talk
that Heritage Of Gold might be the best older mare in the country
after she won Friday's Grade III Louisville Breeders' Cup Handicap
over a field that included Keeper Hill and Silverbulletday.
Heritage Of Gold was the Horse of the Meet last year at Lone Star.

DEVILS BEAT MAPLE LEAFS, 4-3 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A brilliant goal by Patrik Elias, another by John
Madden and two marvelous passes by Scott Gomez for goals by Sergei
Nemchinov and Vladimir Malakhov led the New Jersey Devils to a 4-3
triumph over the Toronto Maple Leafs Saturday night at the Air
Canada Center.
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Devils a 3-2 lead in the four-of-seven-game
Eastern Conference semifinal series. The Devils can advance to the
conference finals when play resumes Monday night at Continental
Arena in New Jersey for the sixth game of a series dominated for
the most part by the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto took the lead twice on goals by Garry Valk and Jeff
Farkas, but the Devils rallied with three unanswered goals before
Sergei Berezin narrowed the gap for the Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   A melee erupted at the end of the game, after the Devils had
played the final seconds while killing a penalty to their captain,
Scott Stevens. The players from both teams stood in front of their
benches and barked at each other before the officials escorted them
to the tunnels for the dressing rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Devils coach Larry Robinson came up with the right matchups for
the most part. The Devils took 32 shots at Curtis Joseph, while
Martin Brodeur, playing on his 28th birthday, faced 25 shots to
earn his seventh victory in these playoffs and the 41st of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson surprised no one by bringing Sergei Brylin back into
the lineup in place of Steve Kelly. Brylin had missed six games, or
since the second game of the opening-round series against Florida,
with a bruised right knee. He simply returned to his place at left
wing with Bobby Holik his center and Randy McKay the other wing.
</P>
<P>
   Brylin was the Devils' best forward last year when they were
eliminated by the Pittsburgh Penguins. He has always raised his
level of intensity in the playoffs, and his superb efforts were
noticed in the days when Jacques Lemaire was the head coach and
Robinson was his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old Brylin was a spark plug in the Florida series,
which the Devils swept. He not only scored a goal in that series,
but he also played effectively against Pavel Bure, the league's
leading goal scorer during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Brylin's role Saturday night was to be on the ice as much as
possible against the Maple Leafs' top forwards, but he did not get
that many chances because Toronto coach Pat Quinn had the last
change and avoided that matchup.
</P>
<P>
   For the biggest part of the game, Quinn sent out his top line of
Mats Sundin centering for right wing Steve Thomas and left wing
Jonas Hoglund when the line of Madden centering for Jay Pandolfo on
the left and Claude Lemieux on the right was on the ice for the
Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Quinn also matched the Sundin line against the
Devils' top line of Jason Arnott centering for Elias on the left
and Petr Sykora on the right.
</P>
<P>
   It was the speedy and elusive Elias who made the play of the
night with 3 minutes 19 seconds left in the first period, matching
Valk's goal that opened the scoring nine minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a pass from Scott Niedermayer in the neutral zone down
the right flank, Elias entered Toronto's zone with plenty of speed.
Just when it looked as if Darcy Tucker had him figured in the right
circle, Elias dropped his left shoulder to get behind Tucker, and
put the puck in the upper far corner of the net from a sharp angle
at a time when he appeared to be headed around the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Elias' goal, his third in the playoffs, came on the second power
play of the game for the Devils, who could have fallen behind by
more than a goal after Valk's redirection from the slot of
Aleksandr Karpovtsev's shot from the right circle beat Brodeur over
the glove.
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs pressed for several minutes after Valk's goal,
but they failed to convert their opportunities, with Thomas and
Hoglund missing from good position on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas regained the lead for the Maple Leafs with his first
National Hockey League goal, 2:19 into the middle period, when he
took advantage of Arnott's failure to clear a rebound from a shot
by Berezin and beat Brodeur from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   The next goal, with 4:01 to play in the second, came on a
mistake by Toronto defenseman Greg Andrusak, who allowed Gomez to
pass to Nemchinov in the slot. With plenty of time and space,
Nemchinov beat Joseph with a low shot for his third goal of the
playoffs to send the teams into the third period tied at two goals
apiece.

SHIELDS TAKES THE HEAT AFTER SHARKS' DEFEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sharks coach Darryl Sutter directed his harshest criticism of
the playoffs toward goalie Steve Shields after the Stars' 5-4
victory in Friday's Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Shields served up the Stars' first shot of the game from Mike
Modano 68 seconds in and never allowed his teammates a chance for
momentum. They resiliently erased four Dallas leads, but the
longest Shields could ever keep the game tied was 4 minutes, 1
second.
</P>
<P>
   He will try to redeem himself tonight, much the way he did last
series against St. Louis, in do-or-die Game 5 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said all along,'' Sutter said, ``if we're going to beat
Dallas, we need great goaltending. And for us, that's ...''
</P>
<P>
   Sutter stopped and motioned with his hands as if he were
flipping a coin.
</P>
<P>
   Sutter used ``bad goal'' to describe Sergei Zubov's short-handed
goal that put the Stars ahead, 3-2, just 56 seconds into the second
period.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost set your watch to a Shields meltdown. It has been
the same pattern throughout the playoffs. After a couple of
confident outings, inexplicable collapses follow. He has allowed 26
goals in six playoff losses and seven goals in five playoff
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Game 4 ran at a frenetic pace, with both teams' forwards flying
and launching scoring chances. Shields was not responsible for all
five goals, but, to quote him from after his Game 1 misadventure,
he wasn't ``the difference maker.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Sharks are to get back in this series, Shields _ whose
2-0 record in Game 7s can't be overlooked _ will have to be the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to have big saves,'' Sutter said.
 &LR; subheds:Marchment sidelined Sharks defenseman Bryan Marchment did
not return to the game after pulling a groin muscle during the
first period Friday. He was injured while the Sharks were on the
power play, and the injury indirectly led to Guy Carbonneau's
short-handed goal. It also left the Sharks' defense short-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That had a huge impact on our game,'' Sutter said. ``It gets
us away from our matchups.''
</P>
<P>
   If Marchment is sidelined for Game 5, Andy Sutton and rookie
Scott Hannan are available. Neither has seen playoff action. Sutton
played 40 games in the regular season, and Hannan played 30.
 &LR; subheds:Nolan a leader Owen Nolan's unassisted short-handed goal
at 7:48 of the second period Friday, tying the game at 3-3, tied
him for the lead in NHL playoff goals with eight. He is tied with
Pittsburgh Penguins players Jaromir Jagr and Martin Straka.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan and Mike Ricci, who has five playoff goals, have half of
the team's 26 goals.  &LR; subheds:Briefly The Sharks have three
power-play goals in the series. Two are by virtue of five-on-three
advantages. Otherwise, the lethargic Sharks' power play is
1-for-23.
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks are 5-4 all-time in elimination games.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jeff Norton called Friday's wild 5-4 contest ``the
craziest playoff game I've ever been involved in.'' He has played
in 55 career playoff games.

AS SHAQ CAN TELL YOU, NOTHING'S FREE FROM THE LINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He wears a tattoo of Superman on his arm. But when Shaquille
O'Neal looks at his woeful free-throw percentage, he knows it is
his kryptonite.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball's equivalent of the extra point and the open-netter,
free throws are supposed to be a reward. But for some of the NBA's
best players, shots from the line are anything but free. Especially
for Shaq.
</P>
<P>
   They are the lone weak spot in O'Neal's dynamic game, rendering
him powerless at times. Because of his career free-throw percentage
of .534, some opponents opt to foul him late in close games. His
career playoff percentage, .520, is even worse and his struggles at
the line might hurt the Lakers in their hunt for the NBA title so
many were prepared to hand them at the end of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only `but' I've got in my life,'' he said.
``Perfect movies. Perfect low-post game. Perfect life. `But, you're
not a good free-throw shooter.' I'll always hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA playoffs that is a big ``but''.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers entered their first-round playoff series toting one
of the best regular-season records in NBA history, and were
supposed to make short work of the Sacramento Kings. ``But/ ... the
Kings forced the Lakers to a deciding fifth game. The Lakers held
on to win the series with a 113-86 victory Friday night, but the
Lakers' inconsistent free-throw shooting was a big reason the Kings
pushed the Lakers to the limit.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings shot 75 percent from the line and scored 23 percent of
their points on free throws in the series. O'Neal, who leads the
Lakers in scoring average at 29.7 points per game, made 11 of 23
free throws in the Lakers' three victories, but made only 10 of 26
in the two games the Lakers lost in the series. He shot 52.4
percent during the regular season, down from the 54 percent he shot
last year and the 52.7 percent he made two years ago. However, it's
a stark improvement from the 48.7 and 48.4 percentages he converted
during the 1995-'96 and '96-'97 seasons. Translation: the more you
send Shaq to the line, the better chance you have to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   So what does Superman do about the kryptonite? Practice, you
say?
</P>
<P>
   Lakers coach Phil Jackson, he of the Zen philosophy, said
free-throw shooting is a principle that consists of more than just
practice, practice, practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of it's mechanical, but most of it is psychological and
rhythm,'' Jackson said. ``\RO'Neal's\S doing a whole different
rhythm thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like every shot he takes is different. Now every shot
he's taking has the same semblance of order to it. That's real
important that at least you get consistent, so you can practice the
same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Superman could take a lesson from Utah's Swishman.
</P>
<P>
   Utah guard Jeff Hornacek has been almost automatic at the
free-throw line. This year Hornacek led the NBA in free-throw
shooting as he only missed nine of 180 attempts. His .950
percentage is the NBA's third all-time single-season mark.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek has never shot under .822 from the line since a .777
mark as a rookie for the 1986-87 season. Hornacek's free-throw
shooting routine consists of stepping to the line, wiping the right
side of his face three times _ that's his way of saying hi to his
three kids _ dribbling three times, and bending his knee three
times before releasing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got great concentration, and he's always been very
good,'' Jazz coach Jerry Sloan said. ``Any player with that kind of
concentration, there's always a chance he could go a long way
without missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season], Hornacek made 67 consecutive free throws
before missing one Jan. 6 against the Mavericks at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   About six years ago, Hornacek used a tip from a psychology tape
that helped increase his percent made from the mid-80s to the
upper-80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envision my whole routine first, then I envision the shot
going in the basket and then I actually go through my routine,'' he
said. ``Since then I've been up near that 90 range.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Boren, the free-throw shooting coach for the Mavericks,
said O'Neal's free-throw woes can be corrected with time, patience,
practice and change of habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 problem with Shaq is he shoots a line-drive free
throw,'' Boren said. ``Nobody's going to tip that hoop toward him.
He's got to get some arc on it, so he'll have a target to shoot
at.''
</P>
<P>
   Boren said free-throw shooting is all about mechanics first, and
then it's mental, balance and muscle memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an athletic happening, like hitting a baseball or hitting
a golf ball,'' he said. ``There are certain things that are common
to all athletic happenings like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Coaches Association recently did a
10-year study of 3,500 NCAA Division I men's college games. It
discovered that 25 percent of all points scored during that time
were from the free-throw line, 35 percent of all the points scored
in last five minutes were from the free-throw line, and 67 percent
of all the points scored by the winning team in the last minute
were from the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done my own tracking, and those numbers track pretty much
the same in the pros,'' said Boren, who has been an NBA free-throw
specialist coach for seven years. ``Free throws are extremely
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the season our guys were hitting them left and
right, and it's pretty comforting for the coaching staff to be
sitting on the bench knowing that at the end of the game if you're
ahead, you know you're going to win. And to know that you can put a
whole team out there where they all shoot over 80 percent, that's a
big advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   An advantage the Lakers don't have if Shaq is at the line.

NETS INTERESTED IN LAKERS' KUPCHAK
</HEADLINE>

By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The New Jersey Nets, searching for a new director
of basketball operations, are pursuing Los Angeles Lakers general
manager Mitch Kupchak, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Nets officials recently asked for permission to speak with
Kupchak about the opening, and the team granted their request,
Lakers spokesman John Black confirmed. Kupchak wasn't immediately
available for comment, and Black declined to say if the parties had
spoken yet.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak, a member of the Lakers' front office since 1986, was
pursued by the Denver Nuggets two years ago. Shortly thereafter,
the Lakers gave him a long-term contract extension, putting Kupchak
in position to eventually succeed executive vice president Jerry
West as head of basketball operations.
</P>
<P>
   That deal still has at least three years remaining, but the
Lakers' decision to grant the Nets permission to speak with Kupchak
means they probably would let him out of the contract.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak is a coveted basketball mind around the league, and he
has made no secret of wanting to hold the top personnel position
with an NBA club. It has been assumed he would wait for that
opportunity here, once West retires.
</P>
<P>
   According to The New York Times, the Nets are also interested in
Lenny Wilkens, John Thompson and Isiah Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak, who turns 46 later this month, has East Coast roots. He
was born in Hicksville, N.Y. and was a standout at Brentwood High
on Long Island.

<P>
   &UR; INCUBUS &LR;  By Ann Arensberg. Ballantine, $14. In this postmodern
Gothic novel, wilted crops, bizarre weather, monstrous births among
farm animals and especially the arrival of a bodiless force that
ravishes women become metaphors for the sexual and social problems
of a small Maine town. ``Arensberg is particularly good at
depicting the itch and ache of human relations,'' Janet Burroway
wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MIND OF THE RAVEN: Investigations and Adventures With
Wolf-Birds &LR;  By Bernd Heinrich. Cliff Street/HarperPerennial, $13. A
biologist examines the social relationships and mischievous
behavior of the common raven to determine whether these uncannily
intelligent birds learn tricks by chance or consciously analyze
problems. ``The mind of Bernd Heinrich is a big, antic thing, like
a raven, and meant to live outdoors,'' David Quammen wrote in The
New York Times Book Review in 1999. ``He has a rare ability to
embed dense scientific explications within graceful, light-footed
nature writing.''
</P>
<P>
   According to  &UR; LIVING ON THE WIND: Across the Hemisphere With
Migratory Birds &LR; , by Scott Weidensaul (North Point/Farrar, Straus &AMP;
Giroux, $15), an estimated 5 billion birds migrate throughout the
Western Hemisphere every year, often in journeys of amazing length
and duration. Last year one critic called this account of migratory
habits ``fulfilling for birders and nonbirders alike.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TERRA INFIRMA: A Memoir of My Mother's Life in Mine &LR;  By Rodger
Kamenetz. Schocken, $11. The author's unsparing meditation on his
mother, who died at 54 from cancer, examines the inspiring yet
destructive force of her love, and probes the mystery of one
woman's jagged, willful character and the way it imprints itself on
her son. Last year in The New York Times, Richard Bernstein called
this ``an impressively intelligent, maturely perceptive and
learned'' book that is both ``strange and moving.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; A GOOD ENOUGH DAUGHTER: A
Memoir &LR; , by Alix Kates Shulman ($13), in which an independent New
York writer returns to suburban Cleveland to care for her aging
parents and discovers their vigorous inner lives, including her
mother's impassioned pursuit of a literary career in later life.
``Her portrayal is refreshingly upbeat, infused with insight,
affection and respect,'' Leslie Chess Feller wrote in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRACE &LR; , by Robert Ward (St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95), is a
fictional account of the author's complex relationship with his
grandmother, with whom he spent part of his childhood in postwar
Baltimore, and her life as a social activist. The result is ``a
book-length valentine written for and about a woman he clearly
adored,'' Ruth Coughlin said in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; WHITE OLEANDER &LR; , by Janet Fitch (Back Bay/Little, Brown,
$13.95), a lovely but poisonous plant is a metaphor for motherhood.
This novel follows the harrowing coming of age of a girl who is
forced into the California foster-care system after her mother, a
footloose poet, is imprisoned for the murder of a lover. Fitch's
``startlingly apt language relates a story that is both intelligent
and gripping,'' Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARIS TRANCE: A Romance &LR;  By Geoff Dyer. North Point/Farrar,
Straus &AMP; Giroux, $13. Luke Barnes is a young Englishman who travels
to Paris to write a novel, only to hook up with a beautiful Serbian
student and another couple, and to discover how contentment can
curdle into inertia and failure. ``I can't think of a recent novel
that better describes the scarily charged beginning of a love
affair,'' Daniel Mendelsohn wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LEXUS AND THE OLIVE TREE &LR;  By Thomas L. Friedman. Anchor,
$15. A columnist for The New York Times deploys a torrent of
anecdotes and vignettes to probe the causes and effects of
globalization and the transforming power of technology. ``Friedman
knows how to cut through the arcana of high tech and high finance
with vivid images,'' Josef Joffe wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A VIEW FROM THE MANGROVE &LR;  By Antonio Bentez-Rojo. University of
Massachusetts, $16.95. The final work of a trilogy by the
expatriate Cuban author exploring the history of the Caribbean is a
collection of tales of slave trading, invasions, murders and other
events in which the characters exist only in extremis. ``His
stories are dense with disaster and rich in description,'' Barbara
Fisher wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DON'T LOOK BACK: Satchel Paige in the Shadows of Baseball &LR;  By
Mark Ribowsky. Da Capo, $16. According to this biography, Leroy
Robert ``Satchel'' Paige, the most famous player in the history of
the Negro leagues, was both a brilliant pitcher and a shrewd
self-promoter. The author ``has done enough digging into Paige's
life and career to separate the historical record from the
pitcher's own gauzy, entertaining recollections,'' Warren Goldstein
said in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE POND &LR;  By Ha Jin. Vintage International, $11. In this
first novel by the winner of last year's National Book Award, a
factory worker in a Chinese village unleashes satirical cartoons
and clever letters of complaint in a crusade against his superiors.
The result is a ``naughty, lusty, raucously entertaining''
screwball comedy, Mei Chin wrote in 1999.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-to,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the nonfiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending April 29, at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such
outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of nonfiction can change from week to week, reflecting
changes in book buying.
</P>
<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)
indicates that some bookstores report receiving bulk orders for a

   MIAMI _ Responding to the numerous protests Cuban-Americans here
have mounted since federal agents seized custody of Elian Gonzalez
last month, thousands of residents turned out for a demonstration
of their own Saturday, lining sidewalks and filling vacant lots in
southern Dade County to support the American government.
</P>
<P>
   The counterdemonstrators, waving American flags and some
Confederate battle flags, and carrying signs reading ``Reno for
president,'' said they had been angered and insulted by the way
Cuban-Americans had protested the seizure of Elian, 6, from his
Miami relatives' home in Little Havana two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   While the sometimes heated protests that greeted the
government's action took place largely in Miami proper, Saturday's
demonstrations occurred in a conservative area of Miami-Dade County
that is home to farms, factories and thousands of whites who feel
little affinity for the city. About 20 people displayed Confederate
battle flags, but the demonstration also attracted more than 100
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the protesters said they had cringed while watching
Cuban-Americans burn the American flag and parade it upside down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen the utmost disrespect for this country in the last
couple of weeks,'' said Robert Milton, a construction worker from
Homestead, a suburb south of Miami. ``It's like these people have
forgotten which country took them in and gave them freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Iget sick to my stomach,'' he added. ``Someone needs to tell
them to show some respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Saturday's demonstrators, whom the authorities put at
more than 5,000, said they were still more angered by the attitudes
of local leaders who openly supported Elian's relatives in Miami.
The family had defied the federal government by refusing to turn
over the boy after his father asked that he be returned to his
custody in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   They also said they were disgusted at the public squabbling
between city officials.
</P>
<P>
   After the federal raid, Mayor Joe Carollo of Miami denounced the
police chief for not telling him in advance about the raid and
fired City Manager Donald Warshaw.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the police chief, William O'Brien, resigned, saying
he wanted no part of Carollo's administration. Warshaw remains in
office, after a judge temporarily halted his dismissal.
Demonstrators asserted Saturday in this conservative part of the
county that city and county officials had turned their backs on the
rest of the community. They carried signs with slogans like ``Crazy
Joe must go'' and ``I want a new county.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of what is happening in this city,'' said Kristen
Markovich, 31, of Perrine, another suburb south of Miami. ``The
politicians are making fools of themselves and the rest of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Hartwell, an organizer of the demonstration, said the
protesters' message had been effective, because of the strong
turnout. ``Miami was a one-sided city until now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators also accused Cuban-Americans of intimidating
anyone who did not share their hatred of Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you disagree with the majority, you fear for your life, for
your family and for your job,'' said Marlene Kay, of Homestead.
``Freedom of speech doesn't apply in Miami-Dade County anymore.''

AT RALLY FOR LOW-PAID WORKERS, PROTESTERS REJECT HARVARD PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to insert number of workers in 3rd graf.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Three days after Harvard University released
a long-awaited report on how it would improve compensation for its
lowest-paid employees, several hundred students and their
supporters, including the actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck,
denounced the report Saturday at a rally on campus.
</P>
<P>
   It was a noisy sign that despite what the administration called
a ``very progressive'' program of education and benefits that would
cost the university over $2.3 million per year, the protesters were
not backing down from their demand for a $10.25 per hour minimum
wage for all university employees.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has centered on the university's more than 3,000
part-time, temporary and contract workers, some of whom make about
$6.50 per hour.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from the granite steps of Harvard's columned Littauer
Hall, in front of a banner that read ``Workers can't eat
prestige,'' Affleck and Damon told the crowd about growing up in
Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   They said the disparity between the wealth of Harvard's
endowment and the pay of its blue-collar workers inspired them to
write the 1997 film ``Good Will Hunting.'' In the film, Damon
played a janitor at another distinguished Cambridge school, the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The two saw both sides of university life. Damon, who attended
Harvard, said he was embarrassed by his alma mater's pay rates.
Affleck said his stepmother, who scrubbed toilets for $5.75 an
hour, and his father, who handed out vacuums and brooms, were part
of the ``low-skilled'' work force at Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was often treated brusquely and with little respect,
although not by the students,'' Affleck said of his father.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This is honest work, and there is honor in doing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Students began organized demonstrations here in 1998, calling
for a ``living wage'' for the university's workers. Other
universities, including Stanford, Brown and Johns Hopkins, have
started similar campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In response, a faculty committee spent 15 months studying
Harvard's labor policies, finally deciding against raising
take-home pay.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in a proposal released on Wednesday, the committee
recommended that the university give health benefits to employees
who work at least 16 hours a week (the previous threshold was 20
hours) and that Harvard contract only with companies that subsidize
health care for their workers. It also called for more continuing
education and worker training programs.
</P>
<P>
   The committee argued that pay scales are negotiated through
employee unions.

CONVENTION POST STIRS RE
 SENTMENT
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by N.Y. Times News Service
 clients) 
 BY KRIS MAYES 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If John McCain has his way, the leader of the Arizona delegation
to the Republican National Convention will be his companion on the
cam paign trail, Cindy McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But the senator's efforts to install his wife at the head of the
delegation have rekindled anger among support ers of Gov. Jane
Hull, who last month agreed to give up the gover nor's traditional
prerogative of serv ing as chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total snub to Jane, and it's a distraction from what we
ought to be doing right now, which is talking about the issues that
are going to help us beat Al Gore,'' said state Sen. Scott
Bundgaard, R-Phoenix. ``We shouldn't be engaging in this petty
bickering and infighting.''
</P>
<P>
   So much bad blood has been spilled in the battle for the
chairmanship of the convention delegation that last week,
negotiations between the two sides broke down.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership question will be decided next Saturday in
Scottsdale by delegates to state GOP conven tion.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy, who had previously made a point of avoiding involvement
in state and national politics, is step ping into the spotlight in
her hus band's behalf. She has asked to address the state
convention because the senator will be giving a com mencement
speech out of state, according to state party officials.
</P>
<P>
   John's aides have made it clear behind the scenes that the
decision that his wife lead the state's GOP activists into the
national convention in Philadelphia is not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   But Hull backers see an effort to punish Hull for supporting
Texas Gov. George W. Bush during the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Arizona GOP, Mike Minnaugh, said that
tapping Cindy to head the delegation is a good compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, (John) McCain won the state, and who knows
whether he will run again,'' Minnaugh said. ``I think it's another
opportunity to show some additional respect for Senator McCain and
what he has done for the state and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hull withdrew from the race to lead the delegation
after McCain, on national television, laughingly dismissed the idea
of her filling the post. Nevertheless, friends say, Hull had hoped
to have some say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the struggle over the leadership of the state
delegation has mirrored the national negotiations between Bush and
McCain over a Tuesday ``summit'' between the two men in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In a week and a half of negotiations between McCain and Hull's
staffs, no detail has been too obscure to raise hackles. McCain was
reportedly angered after a handful of Hull loyalists applied to be
delegates. And Hull was thrown off guard by the move to place Cindy
McCain at the helm of the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, as it became clear that John McCain would not budge
on having his wife lead the delegation, the negotiations trailed
off. A sched uled meeting Thursday between the two sides was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   Bundgaard blames McCain for cast ing a shadow over the efforts
to craft a slate of delegates and wonders whether a plot is brewing
to keep Bush supporters out of the conven tion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, they want a lot of McCain insiders, people
that are predictable and unwavering support ers for McCain, and it
gives every appearance that Senator McCain is trying to wage some
sort of floor fight or challenge to Governor Bush for the
nomination,'' Bundgaard said.
</P>
<P>
   According to several sources close to both Hull and McCain, the
Bush campaign has been monitoring the developments from Austin,
hopeful that the bad blood will not poison relations at the
national level.
</P>
<P>
   Mal Barrett, a GOP party official from Prescott who is running
to be a delegate, said the matter of who will make up the
delegation will not be a bitter fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to be a floor fight or some kind of
acrimonious thing,'' Barrett said of making Cindy McCain the
chairman. ``If the dele gates don't want to do it, they won't do
it, but I don't think it's going to be a nasty thing, by any
means.`
</P>
<P>
   Competition for a seat in the delega tion has not turned ugly,
but has become as intense as the last few moments of a furious game
of musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 200 party activists, elected officials and party leaders
have applied for the 30 available slots. Compounding the problem is
the fact that the delegation has shrunk from its 1996 size of 39
delegation, a reduction that occurred under Re publican National
Committee rules after the state voted for President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, party leaders are having to make tough choices as
they put together the recommended slate to present to the state
convention. They want ethnic diversity, but they also need to
reward the party activists, who most of the year toil in relative
obscurity.

REVOLUTION SHAKE UP EARTHQUAKES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH _ There was good reason for the Revolution to
celebrate Saturday night. They scored more than one goal in
regulation for the first time since April 1 and they took over
first place in the Eastern Division with a 2-1 win over San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have 10 points in eight games and are leading the
division for the first time at this point in the season. Even more
significantly, the Revolution seem to have uncovered a midfield
choreographer in Bolivian Mauricio Ramos.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos and Wolde Harris combined for both goals. Ramos scored
first, capitalizing on an unforced San Jose turnover, in the 55th
minute, then played a give-and-go with Harris, who converted in the
59th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution survived an Abdul Thompson Conteh counter in the
72d minute and a disallowed goal by Ian Russell, which appeared to
have beaten the offside trap four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some good combination play and we played a lot faster
than in past games,'' Harris said. ``We kept possession, and we
kept possession going forward, so we kept the attack flowing. We
took a little risk because we were attacking, but it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos took command just behind strikers Harris and Johnny
Torres, with Leonel Alvarez and Carlos Parra in support. Alvarez
(left foot tendon strain) departed in the second half, but Parra,
replacing John Harkes (calf) was a steadying influence in his first
start. The Revolution remained active and sufficiently composed
with a young lineup in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some of the same problems in the first half,'' coach
Fernando Clavijo said. ``We kept possession and we created chances,
but we were not able to finish. In the second half, we were able to
get a couple of goals and we missed a couple more. They have
experienced players and they put pressure on us, we lost Leo
(Alvarez) and Carlos Parra was tired, but we managed to keep them
out of the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   A Ryan Tinsley giveaway led to Ramos converting an inspired
drive into the far upper corner of the net in the 55th minute, four
minutes after Khodadad Azizi hit the crossbar for San Jose.
Tinsley, under no apparent pressure, scuffed a pass to Harris in
the Revolution attacking zone. Harris laid off a perfectly-weighted
ball for Ramos, running into the penalty area, to convert his first
goal for the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, Harris took on three defenders in the
penalty area, played a give-and-go with Ramos, and finished a
wide-open shot.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez appeared on the verge of increasing the lead, carrying
to the end line on the edge of the goal area, but his foot caught
in the turf and he was replaced by Shaker Asad in the 67th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The game opened in the second half, allowing the Revolution's
Asad, Ramos, and William Sunsing to display their skill, but also
left the Revolution in jeopardy. In the 88th minute, Jeff Causey
blocked a point-blank drive by Wojtek Krakowiak. And the match
ended in bizarre fashion as referee Rich Grady blew the final
whistle as Sunsing avoided Cannon and was about to go in alone on
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Earthquakes struggled to find an offensive rhythm in the
first half, but were secure at the back thanks to the strength of
John Doyle and the elegance of Mauricio Wright. But Azizi had
little impact until midway in the second half, when he moved to
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Azizi launched a perfect pass to Conteh, who outmaneuvered Brian
Dunseth and lofted a shot over Causey to cut the deficit to 2-1.
Russell appeared to beat the offside trap, finishing a pass from
Wright, but the goal was disallowed in the 76th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone makes mistakes, including referees and linesmen,''
San Jose coach Lothar Osiander said. ``New England deserved to win
over the 90 minutes. And those things are supposed to balance out
by the end of the year.''
